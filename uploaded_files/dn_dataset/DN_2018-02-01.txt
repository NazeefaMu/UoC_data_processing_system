A poll like no other!
Local government polls are now due in nine days and the cacophony of political rhetoric has reached unparalleled levels for an election that will not change a government or elect a President. The poll will however determine future political alliances and strategies for all major political parties, hence the scramble for the vote of the average citizen.
Since President Maithripala Sirisenas emotive outburst at a Cabinet meeting two weeks ago, the United National Party (UNP) and its parliamentarians have, for the most part, refrained from making direct references to the President. This follows instructions from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena has been campaigning on the theme of crusading against corruption. The President who has been outspoken regarding the findings of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds has now expanded the scope of his campaign speeches to include the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC).
The focus of the Central Bank bond inquiry was former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his alleged links with former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and his son-in-law and Director of Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Arjun Aloysius.
PRECIFAC reports
In contrast, the persons of interest identified in the PRECIFAC reports are parliamentarians and others loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Rajapaksa himself has been investigated. The Rajapaksa camp is contesting the local government election as the newly established Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
Although there has been somewhat of a truce between the UNP and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in their campaigns, it was clear that the President was keen to take his message to the public, especially with regard to the Central Bank bond sale. That is why, addressing a SLFP rally at Panadura he declared that a coalition of VIP robbers had met a residence at Borella and conspired to delay a parliamentary debate on the issue. The President also threw a challenge, daring the debate to be staged before the February 10 election.
As a result, the debate itself has now become a bone of contention. In what appeared to be a response to the Presidents challenge, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe declared that the UNP was prepared to conduct the debate on February 8, two days before the local government election. However, the Premier was to say that the PRECIFAC reports should also be debated on that day.
There is no issue in having a debate on the bond commission report as it is nothing new. We have had several debates on the bond issue, the Prime Minister told a meeting in Deniyaya. The Prime Minister stated that the PRECIFAC report was more important. This was because it had recommended that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa be stripped of his civic rights, he said.
Former President Rajapaksa has also entered the fray, throwing a challenge for the debate to be held on February 7 instead of a day later, so it would not contravene election law. However, Rajapaksa was alluding only to a debate on the Central Bank bond inquiry and not to the PRECIFAC findings.
The other major opposition party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), was demanding that the President summon Parliament immediately using the executive powers at his disposal, without awaiting agreement from political parties.
Political party leaders
The Prime Ministers offer to debate the Central Bank and PRECIFAC Commission reports placed the Elections Commission in a quandary. Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said this week that the day chosen for the debate falls within the period of silence prior to the local government elections where all propaganda activities would have to cease. A Parliamentary debate on a topic with electoral sensitivity could have a bearing on the election, Deshapriya noted.
However the Elections Commission Chairman was quick to note that the Elections Commission had no authority or moral right to overrule the Supremacy of Parliament. The Elections Commission cannot even think of doing it. There is no provision for it, Deshapriya said.
A meeting between leaders of political parties represented in Parliament and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, with Deshapriya also in attendance, was held on Tuesday to resolve the issue where it was agreed that the debate would be held next Tuesday, February 6.
Meanwhile, other comments by President Sirisena have raised eyebrows in the corridors of power. For instance, in a meeting with media heads and newspaper editors last Friday, the President said that he had not decided whether he would run for President again.
The question had been dominating conversation in political circles, especially after the President referred the issue of the duration of his term of office to the Supreme Court, seeking a determination as to whether it was five years or six years. The Supreme Court determined it was the former.
I have not decided whether to contest the next presidential elections or not. Yet, I will continue to do politics as long as I am alive. I am a political animal. It is in my genes. I will do politics with or without positions, the President said.
While this explanation will not end speculation, it certainly indicates that the President is open to the proposition of running for office again. Previously, soon after assuming office and thereafter at the funeral of Maduluwawe Sobitha thera, he had pledged not to run for Presidential office again.
Another remark made by the President that attracted much attention was his remarks, at a campaign rally in Ratnapura, that he was prepared to form a SLFP government even tomorrow if all 96 parliamentarians elected through the SLFP-led coalition at the last general election stood by him. At present these 96 MPs are divided into two camps: 45 have pledged their support to President Sirisena while 51 remain loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Some have interpreted this remark, taken together with President Sirisenas remarks over the Central Bank bond sale, to signal an imminent parting of ways between the two major partners in the government of National Unity, the UNP and the SLFP.
Local government elections
They point out that the Memorandum of Understanding between the two parties has not been formally renewed after it lapsed on December 31, 2017. The initial agreement, formulated in the aftermath of the 2015 August general election was for a period of two year but was extended in September 2017 until the end of the year but no further renewal has been undertaken in December.
Others however believe that the current verbal jousting between the UNP and the SLFP is merely part and parcel of electoral politics and that issues will settle down after the local government elections. There was similar banter in the lead up to the August 2015 general election but they didnt escalate to the current level of acrimony because the SLPP didnt exist then as a separate entity. Therefore, the President didnt have to compete with the SLPP for SLFP votes, these analysts argue.
The other issue that is very likely to come to the fore in the coming days is the purported recommendation by PRECIFAC to strip former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of his civic rights. The SLPP has already protested loudly about this claiming that Rajapaksa has a wide public following and would become even more popular if this is done. That there will be much more discussion on this issue in the coming weeks is certain.
The next nine days will be fraught with much discussion, debate and divided opinion. This local government election will be like no other before it as political parties will be compelled to reflect on its outcome, take stock and reinvent their strategies as they look forward to the next major polls which could either be the provincial council elections or, in their absence, the next presidential election, now due at the end of next year.

Ravi called to step down as UNP assistant leader
United National Party General Secretary Kabir Hashim said that until the Attorney General or Bribery Commission reach a decision on taking legal action against MP Ravi Karunanayake, he should step down as UNPs Assistant Leader.
There are no findings against any member of the United National Party including Mr. Ravi Karunanayake in regard to the issuance of Treasury Bonds, Minister Hashim said.
But, however, the Commission of Inquiry has decided that the Attorney General and the Bribery Commission should determine whether action should be taken against (Karunanayake) under the Bribery Act or other appropriate legislation in respect of their findings that he had derived a substantial benefit from the lease payments made by an associate company of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, he said.
The full statement is as follows: In the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on the issuance of Treasury Bonds, there are no findings against any member of the United National Party including Mr Ravi Karunanayake in regard to the issuance of Treasury Bonds. But, however, the Commission of Inquiry has decided that the Attorney General and the Bribery Commission should determine whether action should be taken against Mr Ravi Karunanayake, MP, under the Bribery Act or other appropriate legislation in respect of their findings that he had derived a substantial benefit from the lease payments made by Walt and Row Associates (Pvt) Ltd., which is an associate company of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., which is owned and controlled by the same persons who owned and controlled Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.
The Commission has also stated that the Hon. Attorney General or other appropriate authorities could also consider whether the evidence given by Mr Ravi Karunanayake is shown to have been incorrect and in that case whether there are grounds for prosecution under Section 179 and or under Section 188 of the Penal Code or other relevant provisions of the law, read with Section 9 the Commission of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948.
In view of this, the Committee appointed by Hon.

Royal rockets to Guinness World Records: Shooting to glory!
On November 10, 2017 Royal College set a new world record for the most number of water rockets released simultaneously in a time span of five seconds. The former record of 1056 rockets which was achieved by the students at Shap Pat Heung Rural Committee Kung Yik She Secondary School in China, in 2013 was surpassed by the students of Royal College who launched 1950 water rockets.
The feat was proposed by the Astronomical Society of Royal College in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the club and involved the participation of 2000 students from Grades 6 to10. Of the 2000, 1950 rockets were launched successfully at the Royal College Rugby Complex, clearing the 10 percent error allowance of 1800 and rocketing Royal into the Guinness World Records.
The Guinness World Record was presented by the Astronomical Society of Royal College to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 19 at the BMICH.
Disce Aut Discede
In an interview with the Daily News, Royal College Principal B A Abeyrathna briefly explained the journey towards securing the Guinness World Record. A task that left many feeling wary owing to the significant probability of failure and the fear of it amounting to a waste of time, it did not deter the young boys from striving to achieve their goal. Keeping with the motto of the school, he emphasized the power of education above all else.
Motivated by the Senior Deputy Principal, these boys proved that education was the key to success as they applied their theoretical knowledge to the practical task of constructing the water rockets. The process required great perseverance and discipline. Assistance was obtained from the army and the air force who aided in the process of constructing the launchers and supervision of the 2000 boys who participated.
A vision becomes a reality
The Senior Games Master of Royal College, M A M Riyaz, was filled with joy about the success of the young Royalists whose vision to beat China had become a reality. With regard to the previous record set by China he said, Our boys wanted to beat that and so embarked on this journey.
Although the journey was long and tedious he was filled with humble gratitude to all those who had contributed to achieving this prestigious record including, the Principal, Senior Deputy Principal, the Ministry of Education, the teachers-in-charge including. B R Chanditha, the sectional heads, the army and air force, the Physical Training Inspectors (PTIs) including Jaaliya, the Arthur C. Clark Institute for Modern Technologies, the sponsors, teachers, parents and the innovative group from the Astronomical Club.
Success in Unity
The teacher-in-charge of the Astronomical Society who was a source of strength to the boys behind this feat was B. R. Chanditha. Commenting to the Daily News, he spoke of the demanding nature of the journey that the boys had ventured on. The training and the discipline that went into the success of the project was not easily achieved. The varying ages of the students who participated resulted in difficulty in ensuring that the students stayed in one place. He recounted how the youngsters would grow tired from having to sit still and would take to running around the Rugby Complex.
He mentioned the many tasks that had to be accomplished before the final launching of the water rockets. These included obtaining sponsors as in spite of attempts to keep costs to a minimum, funds were necessary to facilitate the mechanisms used for the launch. Sponsors included Arpico, Elephant House, Sri Lanka Telecom and the Lottery Board. He also detailed the complications that were faced when selecting the best mechanism for the launch and the trial and error process of selecting the most feasible strategy for the launch. All this had to be done while keeping with the guidelines set by the Guinness World Records committee.
A Herculean task
The team from the Astronomical Society that were behind this record-breaking feat were Yuneth Wijenayake (Secretary, 2018), Maneth Senavirathna (Chairman, 2017), Mahen Abeyrathna (Secretary, 2017) and Dheeshaan Booso (Assistant Secretary, 2017).
The Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies (ACCIMT) popularized water rockets in 2005, by conducting a workshop on making water boosted rockets followed by a national water boost rocket competition which was held since 2005.
Since then, ACCIMT has been providing opportunities to the Sri Lankan school students to participating in the international water rocket competition organized by the Asia Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum.
In 2015, the Sri Lankan water rocket team consisting of six students and two teachers participated in the APRSAF water rocket competition which was jointly organized by the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) in Indonesia and APRSAF in Bali, Indonesia. Yuneth Wijenayake of the Astronomical Society of Royal College Colombo won second place in this event.
Wijenayake explained the three part preparation process that went into securing their spot in the Guinness World Records. After getting permission from the principal, the three part process was involved selecting a feasible mechanism, organizing the students who took part and contacting the Guinness World Record committee.
The initial task was to zero in on a simple, low cost mechanism for the construction of the water rockets. Having commenced their task 2 to 3 months before the launch date, they worked around the clock, testing each method that they thought appropriate. They finally settled on individual launchers, keeping in accord with the guidelines of the Guinness World Records committee, which consisted of a pump attached to a re-used carbonated drinks mega bottle. The creation of 2000 such contraptions was no easy task, as each mechanism had to be tested individually to ensure that there were no pressure leaks as the room for error allocated was a mere 10 percent. Exceeding this would result in their immediate disqualification.
Maneth Senavirathna explained how they managed to get the students organized and prepared for the launch. As the structure and functions of the water rocket were listed in the Science textbooks, a majority of the students who participated from Grades 6 to10 were well versed in the requirements of the task. Nevertheless, the whole process was practiced on five days to ensure that performance was smooth on the day of the launch. After focusing and deciding on a suitable process, keeping in line with the school procedure and the Guinness guidelines, they began to prepare the students. Special permission was obtained from grade heads and teachers-in-charge in advance and with the support of the school, they were able to execute their plan. Permission from parents were readily given as they supported their sons, especially the Astronomical Society, to the extent that even late/overnight work was not restricted.
While all this appears to have been quite the challenge, the team agreed that their greatest obstacle was communicating with and keeping to all the guidelines given by the Guinness World Records committee. Dheeshaan Booso, who mainly handled all the communications with the Guinness World Records committee, explained the intense three part application process. The seemingly simple act of establishing video conferences via Skype was wearisome owing to the difference in time zones. The provision of evidence of their accomplishment, including photographs, videos, evidence of supervision of students by the Sri Lankan Air Force and so on had to be submitted online and uploaded on to a website.
Mahen Abeyrathna described how in spite of the initial pessimism surrounding the attempt, they worked together tirelessly, day and night in the hope of achieving something great. From November 9, each rocket was tested individually for flaws. With all this hard work, when the day of the attempt dawned, they expected nothing but positive results.
Nothing is impossible!
Once they had completed the task with a total of 1950 rockets being launched successfully, they submitted the required evidence to the Guinness World Records committee and uploaded the proof to the website. Then the wait began two to three weeks following the submission in the first week of December. Booso received an email confirming that Royal College were the new record holders for the most number of water rockets released in five seconds. After informing the principal and the rest of the team, they were absolutely elated. It took five days to print and one week for the certificate to be delivered. Now, finally in possession of the certificate, they are filled with excitement and happiness.
They undertook this Herculean task with the objective of brining prestige to the Royal name and with the hope that they could prove that breaking the boundaries of the norm and testing themselves would result in unbelievable accomplishments. Being extraordinary and inventive and being open to trying new things is what helped them secure this accomplishment. Their message to their peers and fellow youth is that with will power, courage and the necessary technical skills, anything is achievable and nothing is impossible!

Saudi Arabia should be dropped from UN Human Rights Council: British lawyers

A campaign to removeSaudi Arabiafrom theUN Human Rights Councilhas been launched by a group of British lawyers, who argue the desert kingdoms membership of the body is contradictory and ironic.
Saudi Arabia, whose seat on the council expires in 2019, has faced international condemnation for its role in theYemenconflict.
It is also accused of crackdowns on political dissidents as well as having deeply conservative laws on issues including homosexuality and womens rights.
In a report, London-based lawyers Rodney Dixon QC and Lord Kenneth Donald John Macdonald said suspending Saudi Arabia from the body would act as a major lever for the government to clean up their act and make a proper new start.
They raised the plight of 60 political activists and peace campaigners who thehuman rights lawyers said were detained in September last year.
Speaking toAl Jazeera, Dixon said it was "completely contradictory and ironic for a government with systemic patterns of abuse - as we have highlighted in the report - to be sitting on the council, and in fact previously to have chaired the council.
The report said: "Those detained have not been charged with any offence, and the information about the reasons for their arrests and circumstances of their imprisonment are very limited."
Yemen has been torn apart by three years of conflict between the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi.
More than 10,000 people have died in the conflict, which has also triggered the world's largest cholera epidemic, starvation and other diseases.
Saudi-led air strikes  which in some cases have targeted hospitals and funeral gatherings  have killed thousands of civilians.
Human Rights Watch haspreviously criticised the decision to keep Saudi Arabia on theUNHCR, saying it raised questions about the integrity of the group.
The UNHCR comprises 47 members distributed by region.
Thirteen places go to Asia-Pacific states including China and Philippines, which themselves have faced global criticism for poor human rights records.

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunge said it would be a betrayal to the peoples mandate if the system of consensual governing currently in effect did not continue after the local government elections.
He added that even though the SLFP and UNP are contesting the LG elections separately, they should unite for the betterment of the country at its conclusion. He said so during the welfare programme of Game Pansala - Gamata Saviyak, held at the Kolonnawa Rajamaha Viharaya yesterday. He further added that the President and the Prime Minister have a good mutual understanding concerning this issue.
People believe that there is a dispute between the President and the PM. Its a matter of change in attitude, just like among husband and wife. They can provide wise solutions, because they are intelligent persons, Ranatunge stated.
Even though the SLFP and the UNP have different principles, they are united for the betterment of the country. Theres freedom of the media now, which people asked for. Democracy is given so that people can live freely. People requested us to punish the wrongdoers. That is the only thing we could not do. But we are happy about what we have done, he added.
In the last presidential election, people voted for the President and the PM without considering political parties. No party received a majority, because expectations of the people were the unification of two main political parties. We dont require party politics now. We can build up political parties anytime, but not the country. Therefore, the two main political parties should be unified after the LG election; if not it will be a betrayal to the peoples mandate, Minister Ranatunga stated.

Smooth solutions
Having dry skin is both a blessing and a curse. You rarely get pimples during your teens, make up stick on better to your face and you never look shiny. However dry skin does tend to show the passage of the years more with fine lines and wrinkles. Easing your dry skin is not just about what you put on it. It also depends on how you clean your skin, the air around you, and even your clothes.
Identifying dry skin
You may show the following symptoms if you possess dry skin:
* Almost invisible pores
* A dull, rough complexion
* Red patches
* Your skin will be less elastic
* More visible lines
Your skin can crack, peel, or become itchy, irritated, or inflamed if you have dry skin. If the skin is very dry, it can become rough and scaly, especially on the backs of your hands, arms, and legs.
Factors which causeskin to dry out
Dry skin may be caused or made worse by:
* Your genes
* Aging or hormonal changes
* Weather such as wind, sun, or cold
* Indoor heating
* Long, hot baths and showers
* Ingredients in soaps, cosmetics, or cleansers
* Medications
For many, dry skin is not a sign of a skin condition or disease, but is simply caused by harsh soaps, itchy clothing, misusing moisturiser, and long, hot showers. But the medications you take - and even medical conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition - can also cause severe dry skin.
Medications that cause dry skin
Medications for medical conditions like high blood pressure (such as diuretics), cholesterol-lowering drugs, and acne (such as retinoids like Retin A and isotretinoin) may also dry out the skin.
Different types of dry skin
 Seborrheic dermatitis: This type involves a red, scaly, itchy rash on various areas of the body, particularly those areas that contain many oil glands. Seborrheic dermatitis can occur as scaling on the scalp, eyebrows and sides of the nose.
 Allergic contact dermatitis: This occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that causes an immune reaction, such as poison ivy. Allergic contact dermatitis of the hands often causes scaling on the fingers.
Atopic dermatitis: This is a long-lasting type of dermatitis that often runs in families. It may cause excessively dry, itchy skin too.
Athlete's foot: In many cases, athlete's foot shows up as dry flaking on the soles of the feet.
Areas of the body thatare most prone to dry skin
The most common dry skin areas are the lower legs, hands and arms. While patches of dry, itchy skin can appear anywhere, it is most common on the arms, hands, lower legs and abdomen. Dry skin is often felt more than it is seen, but on some people it can be noticeable and embarrassing.
Importance of moisturizing
Regular use of lotion and moisturizer should be a part of any good skin care regimen. However some products are better than others. Choose a lotion with plenty of vitamins with an SPF of 15 to protect your skin during the day. Also use lotions that are oil free, non-comedogenic (wont clog pores), allergy and dermatologist tested.
Some people often make the mistake of only applying moisturizer when dry skin occurs. You should apply moisturizer daily after washing, and before your face has time to dry completely. After cleansing, pat your face dry with a soft towel and apply your face lotion to your damp skin. Applying to damp skin is best because it is rehydrated and in the perfect state for sealing in that moisture. The same applies to the body as well.
Avoid or combat dry skin
Those having dry skin must choose a moisturizer that helps to restore moisture to the skin. It is better to use an oil-based moisturizer that contains moisturizing ingredients or petrolatum-based products. Such products will help keep your skin hydrated.

South Korea to further strengthen bilateral ties with SL
The new Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Sri Lanka, Lee Heon presented his credentials to President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidents House in Colombo, recently.
Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana and the Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando were present on the occasion.
Ambassador Lee shares a very special bond with Sri Lanka, having served at the Korean Embassy in Colombo in the 1990s, in his very first posting abroad after joining the South Korean Foreign Service, a statement from the embassy said.
Serving as Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Sri Lanka, his first post as an ambassador, is truly meaningful. During his previous service in this country, when Sri Lanka was still experiencing civil war, the Republic of Korea was the largest distributor of FDI in Sri Lanka.
Ambassador Lee is delighted to have the opportunity to return to Sri Lanka, which is like a second home to him, in particular at a time when the bilateral relations have been strengthened by the celebration of 40 years of diplomatic relations in 2017, the statement said.
The state visit by President Sirisena to South Korea last November was meaningful and Ambassador Lee had the opportunity to meet with the Sri Lankan President on various occasions.
The new Korean Ambassador seeks to further strengthen the excellent relations between Korea and Sri Lanka.

Swansea stun Arsenal, Liverpool cruise
London: Petr Cechs howler rocked Arsenal as they crashed to a shock 3-1 defeat at Swansea, while Liverpool cruised to victory over Huddersfield on Tuesday.
Arsenal goalkeeper Cechs miscued attempt to clear allowed Jordan Ayew to slot home Swanseas second goal at the Liberty Stadium.
It was the killer blow for Arsenal, who had already seen Sam Clucas equalise just one minute after Nacho Monreal put the visitors ahead from Mesut Ozils pass in the 33rd minute.
Clucas claimed his second four minutes from time to finish off Arsenal, who have now won just once in their last five league games. The result leaves Gunners manager Arsene Wenger still searching for his first away win of 2018, despite a second-half debut for substitute Henrikh Mkhitaryan following his move from Manchester United.
The Gunners are in sixth place, trailing eight points behind fourth-placed Liverpool in the race to qualify for the Champions League via a top-four finish. The arrival of Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, set to sign on Wednesdays transfer deadline day, cant come soon enough for Wenger.
We will know more about that tomorrow morning, Wenger said of the Aubameyang move.
I felt defensively we were very poor and made big mistakes. Its better not to talk about the second or third goals.
Swansea were sharp, disciplined and hungry. Unfortunately I believe we were not good enough, we were not disciplined enough.
The result also completes remarkable back-to-back victories for Swansea over Liverpool and now Arsenal.
They are out of the relegation zone and have transformed their season with three wins in five league games under new boss Carlos Carvalhal.
At the John Smiths Stadium, Liverpool got back on track in emphatic fashion thanks to goals from Emre Can, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah in a 3-0 win. The Reds had endured frustrating defeats against Swansea in the league and West Brom in the FA Cup.
But Jurgen Klopps men dominated possession and from the moment Emre Can rocketed home a long-range opener in the 26th minute the result was never in doubt. Firmino extended Liverpools lead on the stroke of half-time when he somehow squeezed the ball home from the byline after being played in by a clever Sadio Mane back-heel.
Klopp had left Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk on the bench, but the absence of the club-record signing was hardly noticed as the Reds continued in cruise control.
Salah completed the scoring from the penalty spot in the 78th minute after Can was tripped up in the box.
We had to keep the ball and score at the right moments. Overall it was absolutely deserved, Klopp said.

Ton-up  Mominul powers Bangladesh to  374-4 on day one
Chittagong: Mominul Haque hit a towering century to help Bangladesh take opening day honours in the first Test against Sri Lanka in Chittagong on Wednesday.
Mominul hit an unbeaten 175 as the hosts reached 374-4 at stumps after electing to bat first at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.
The left-hander shared a 236-run third-wicket stand with former captain Mushfiqur Rahim, who fell just short of his fifth Test hundred after scoring 92 off 192 balls.
Skipper Mahmudullah Riyad, on nine, was batting alongside Mominul when stumps were drawn at the start of the two-match series.
Suranga Lakmal struck with the second new ball to claim two wickets off successive deliveries and give Sri Lanka some respite late into the final session.
Lakmal, who returned figures of 2-43, forced Mushfiqur to edge behind the stumps after the batsman had struck 10 fours in his relatively sedate innings.
The medium-pacer bowled Liton Das for a duck with the next ball, which swung late to uproot the off-stump after the batsman had attempted to leave the delivery.
Mominul was dominant at the other end, hitting 16 fours and a six off veteran spinner Rangana Herath during his stay, which has lasted 203 balls so far.
The 26-year-old posted his fifth Test century and his first in more than three years off just 96 balls, with back-to-back fours off left-arm wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan.
He then edged Herath for four to reach 160 and bring up his 2,000 Test runs in his 47th innings.
Mominul was the fastest Bangladeshi to achieve the feat, overtaking Tamim Iqbals record of 53 innings.
Mominuls authoritative batting came at his favourite ground after Bangladesh had lost both openers, Tamim and Imrul Kayes, in the morning session despite starting strongly.
Tamim made 52 off 53 balls and shared a 72-run opening stand with Kayes (40).
Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera bowled Tamim with a beautiful delivery that pitched outside off-stump and spun sharply to beat the batsman and clip the bails.
Tamim struck six fours, and a sweetly timed six off Perera over long-on, in his 25th Test fifty. Sandakan trapped Kayes leg-before on the stroke of lunch, ending the left-handers 75-ball stay. - AFP

Trincomalee an example of multi-ethnic, multi-religious co-existence
Trincomalee is a unique city, rich in culture and religious places of worship. Most importantly, it is a crossroad where different ethnic groups have come to meet and live in relative peace.
According to the 2012 Census of the Trincomalee District, it comprised 1,592,516 Muslims, 98,772 Buddhists, 98,133 Hindus and 21,893Christians. Thus Trincomalee is the ideal place to look at how reconciliation in this country would work and is practised.
The Sarvodaya Peace Centre, the US-based Karuna Centre and the National Peace Council are the inter-religious entities effectively promoting ethnic harmony, peace and reconciliation in this pluralistic society comprising multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural communities.
Karuna Centres Susendra Wijenadan said close collaboration with the Sarvodaya Peace Centre in Trincomalee helped them conduct programmes on building peace and reconciliation. They also implemented numerous activities with the participation of all ethnic and religious groups.
Tamil and Sinhala language classes are conducted in order to facilitate communication among the different ethnic groups. Inter-faith dialogue sessions have also been conducted within each the Divisional Secretariat.
According to Wijenadan, since 1994, the Karuna Centre has been conducting seminars on skills and practices of conflict resolution and programmes promoting mutual understanding with the joint participation of other civil society organizations. He said the role of religious dignitaries had become a vital factor in promoting peace and reconciliation. These programmes, he said, would be important in creating unity and harmony not only among the different ethnic groups, but also between the different faiths.
Removing ignorance through understanding
Rev. W. Thilakaratne of the Inter Religious Foundation said the war in the North and East was due to non-existence of inter-religious understanding. He said all human beings were not born as members belonging to various religions and ethnic groups but were grouped much later. If Sri Lankans had learnt to respect humanity and lived according to the teachings of their respective religions, the North-East war could have been avoided.
It is only through religion that people could seek truth which of course could remove ignorance. It was unfortunate that Sri Lankans failed to achieve peace and reconciliation even though our society comprises devotees of the major religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, he said.
Rev. Thilakaratne quoting a Biblical verse said the gist of all religions is to love ones neighbour as one loves oneself, and if we can do that, we will have reconciliation.
Inter-Religious Cooperation for Community Development and Empowerment programs in both Trincomalee and Batticaloa have helped in developing mutual understanding and tolerant attitudes between different religious communities. These have also provided opportunities for devotees of diverse religious faiths to be engaged in community activities which promote reconciliation and harmony at the grassroots level.
Presidential directive on reconciliation
The four main religions in the country have had their own groups trying to promote ethnic reconciliation. Since 2007, Muslim Aid has conducted awareness programmes in the Trincomalee District and many other districts in the country. They are part of the North-East Forum for Reconciliation (NEIFR) comprising religious leaders in Sri Lanka. In addition, the Presidential Task Force on Ethnic Affairs looks into ways in which relations could be improved between the ethnic communities.
Research and Media Director of the National Peace Council (NPC) and member of Presidential Task Force for Ethnic Affairs, Dr. Jehan Perera said since the inception of the NPC, they have conducted numerous workshop and seminars among the different ethnic groups and faiths to promote peace and harmony.
During the sessions of the district-level Inter-Religious Committees (DIRC), the participants are provided opportunities to discuss their grievances. In group discussions, participants made suggestions to resolve these issues. Dr. Perera revealed several success stories from DIRC: members during group discussions had even pointed out early warnings of volatile situations existing in their respective areas.
In addition, with the assistance of Divisional Secretariats, identity cards have been issued to those who had failed to obtain IDs for the past several years.
Dr. Perera said inter-religious dialogue operated across 16 districts in the country at present. Nine of the DIRCs are headed by Buddhist clergy while others have Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.
The main focus of DIRC is to bring about a political solution, reconciliation, trust and confidence with the aim of building peace. Quoting Professor Hans Kung, a Swiss Catholic Theologian, he said, There would be no peace in the world without peace among religions and inter-religious dialogue.
Dr. Perera further said famous religious shrines played a vital role as the meeting grounds of devotees belonging to different faiths.
Some of the participants of inter-religious groups however revealed that even though people of diverse religions gather together, they still found it difficult to mingle with each other. If there were activities where the mixed groups could participate together, it could prove to be more effective. According to them, monthly workshops and seminars on inter-religious dialogue were not so effective.
The Jaffna Inter-Religious Group is a voluntary civil society organization comprising religious leaders from the Hindu, Christian, and Islamic faiths. In addition, civil society representatives, womens groups and other social service organizations have joined the Jaffna Inter-Religious Group (JIRG). Swami Shiva Sri Somasundara Kurukkal, Bishop of Jaffna, Jamiyyaathul Ulaima, the Naga Vihara Chief Incumbent and Father Issac David Dixon founded the organization together with a few other members.
The vision of JIRG is to establish a society that is free from ethnic, religious and caste division.
Majority of the local tourists visiting Jaffna on pilgrimages from other provinces are unaware of customs of Hinduism. Sometimes the behaviour patterns of these visitors could create religious conflicts.
In order to avoid such incidents, JIRG has intervened on several occasions to ease the tension between visitors and residents.
Similarly, the JIRG annually organizes religious ceremonies to promote co-existence among major religions of Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Christianity.
The JIRG also carries out exchange programmes for members of all faiths with people of the South.
During the inter-religious programmes, in addition to religious harmony, participants are also made aware of transitional justice, human rights, the findings of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and case studies from other conflict-ridden countries on harassment, intimidation and other abuses, etc. It is hoped that these examples will motivate them to say no to war next time around.

In his maiden State of the Union address:
Trump calls for "one American family"
US President Donald Trump made a pitch for national unity and strong borders in his maiden State of the Union address Tuesday, calling for one American family after a year plagued by acrimony, division and scandal.
Delivering his biggest speech of the year, this most polarizing of presidents sought to put the spotlight on a robust Trump economy, while pointedly calling on a packed joint session of Congress to enact hardline curbs on immigration.
Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve, he said.
Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family. Trumps opening tone was uncharacteristically conciliatory, although it bridged no compromise on his drive to reduce immigration -- which he painted as responsible for a plethora of social ills.
He touched on a range of foreign policy issues -- including, in an emotive moment, offering the spotlight to crippled North Korean amputee defector Ji Seong-ho, who waved a crutch in the air as he received a prolonged standing ovation.
Trump warned that Pyongyangs reckless nuclear drive could very soon threaten the US homeland, while also eyeing the geopolitical challenge posed by adversaries China and Russia. But Trumps State of the Union, the third longest on record at one hour twenty minutes, was overwhelmingly focused on domestic concerns.
Among those looking on were dozens of cross-armed Democratic lawmakers, some decked in black to honor the victims of sexual harassment and still others wearing butterfly stickers in support of immigrants -- two social issues that more than any others have roiled America in the age of Trump.
Over the years the State of the Union address, a set piece of the American political calendar, has lost some of its impact and pizzazz. But the primetime address, watched by as many as 40 million Americans, was still a once-in-a-year opportunity for Trump to speak to the nation and mend his sunken approval ratings, languishing around 40 percent.
Seeking to enliven his own base, Trump spoke at length on the need for immigration reform, drawing hisses from the opposition as he equated immigrants with criminality and economic tension and spoke of chain migration. For decades, he lamented, open borders had allowed drugs and gangs to pour into the United States. He again called for the construction of a border wall that remains unfunded in Congress.
They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Two couples whose daughters were murdered by MS-13, a Salvadoran gang, were among those joining the First Lady to watch the address.
The United States is a compassionate nation he said, but as president of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for Americas children, Americas struggling workers, and Americas forgotten communities.
The 71-year-old real estate mogul and reality TV star touted a long bull run on Wall Street and improving growth rates, something the White House has dubbed a Trump bump.

Volkswagen carmaker under fire again
Volkswagen, the worlds biggest carmaker, is under fire globally from politicians and environmentalists following revelations it helped to fund experiments in which monkeys and humans breathed in car fumes for hours at a time.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said there was an urgent need for the company to reveal the true extent of the experiments, which were commissioned by the European Research Group of Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), a body funded by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW.
These tests on monkeys or even on humans are not ethically justifiable in any shape or form, her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. The indignation of many people is absolutely understandable.VW is already under heavy scrutiny over its role in the dieselgate scandal, in which the carmaker manipulated tests on about 11m cars worldwide to make it appear they met air emissions tests, when in reality they exceeded them many times over when used on the road.The company said on Monday a small internal group had mistakenly pushed for the tests to be carried out and that they did not reflect VWs ethos. But industry observers said VWs excuses held little water, as the experiments had been well-documented and the results presented to managers at BMW, Daimler and VW, all of whom belonged to the EUGT, a car lobby group, which has since been disbanded.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 13
What if you could  consistently create a new business venture
Last week, we briefly enumerated the five paths companies typically follow to reconstruct their market possibilities and open up blue ocean possibilities. Today, we begin with discussing those paths in somewhat detail.
n Look across alternative industries  and determine what products and services have different forms but achieve the same purpose. Customers commonly make trade-offs between alternative industries. The space between these industries may provide some significant opportunities for value innovation.
* Look across the strategic groups within an industry  and understand which factors determine the customers decision as to which group they will belong to. By offering the key determining factors from each group and eliminating everything else, a blue ocean can open up.
* Look across the chain of buyers  and combine their differing definitions of value. Purchasers, users and influencers will all have different definitions of good value. If you challenge conventional wisdom about who is the target buyer, blue oceans can open up.
* Look across complementary product and service offerings  and come up with a total solution. If movie theaters did this, they might create a blue ocean by offering a babysitting service so people could go to the movies.
* Look across functional or emotional appeal  and challenge the orientation of your industry. Inject some emotional elements into a product which has traditionally been marketed along functional lines. Or, you might go the opposite direction. Transform your industry from being emotionally driven to being functional and no-nonsense.
Every strategic plan ever written by a corporate planning department starts with a lengthy description of current industry conditions and the competitive environment. Next up is usually an analysis of how to increase market share. In other words, the usual corporate planning process is very much Red Ocean oriented. There are even screeds of spreadsheets attached to back up every aspect of the plan. Little wonder strategic plans never lead to the creation of blue oceans.
Strategy canvas
A strategy canvas is basically a line graph that plots functions/factors against importance for a company or an organization and then overlays competitors or industry benchmarks. In this way, information can be built to help formulate a competitive strategy.The strategy canvas can allow us to communicate a wholly differentiated strategy.
The strategy canvas serves two purposes: (1) To capture the current state of play in the known market space, which allows users to clearly see the factors that the industry competes on and where the competition currently invests. (2) To propel users to action by reorienting their focus from competitors to alternatives and from customers to noncustomers of the industry.
A good strategy canvas:
* Will help everyone visualize accurately your current strategic position in the marketplace.
* Will allow you to chart what your future strategy can and should be.
* Helps everyone focus on the big picture rather than operational details.
* Specifies precisely what the current and future factors that affect competition within your industry.
* Shows where both you and your competitors differ in the investments youre making for future success.
* Will stimulate dialogue between various business units about where the company should be heading.
* Will foster and enhance the transfer of strategic best practices across units within the firm.
Drawing a strategy canvas is a tiring assignment. Even identifying the key factors of competition is far from straightforward. The final list is usually very different from the first draft. Assessing to what extent your company and its competitors offer the various factors is equally challenging. Most managers have a strong impression of how they and their competitors fare along one or two dimensions within their own scope of responsibility, but very few are able to see the overall dynamics of their industry.
The catering manager of an airline, for instance, will be highly sensitive to how his airline compares in terms of refreshments. But that focus makes consistent measurement difficult; what seems to be a very big difference to the catering manager may not be so important to customers, who look at the complete offering. Some managers will define the competitive factors according to internal benefits. For example, a CIO might prize his companys IT infrastructure for its data-mining capacity, a feature lost on most customers, who are more concerned with speed and ease of use.
Visual awakening
A common mistake manager make is to discuss changes to strategy before resolving differences of opinion about the current state of play. Another problem is that executives are often slow to accept the need for change; they may have a vested interest in the status quo, or they may feel that time will eventually vindicate their previous choices.
Nintendo Wii
Developing your firms own strategy canvas is never easy. For a start, there will be loads of disagreement over what exactly are the various competitive factors. People will have differing levels of sensitivity about how you compare with your competitors in the various areas. And many managers will be tempted to define utility and value from the perspective of internal users rather than using the customer perspective. Despite all this, if you want to find blue ocean opportunities, youll have to learn how to develop an effective strategy canvas.
Consider the Nintendo Wii. The Wiiis a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 2006. When Satoru Iwata was selected the first non-family CEO of Nintendo, he did not like what he saw. He saw Nintendo placing a distant third behind Sony and Microsoft in the electronic games business. After researching the market place, and realizing that the typical buyer is a young, antisocial male, he wondered why everyone else didnt play electronic games. So, he asked older males, girls, families, and retirees why they didnt play. He got an earful.
The games were too expensive, too complex, too antisocial, and too high tech. So, using four questions from the Blue Ocean Strategy methodology, he challenged his team to get answers never asked before of non-gamers.
* What dont you like about the electronic games This question and others helped them decide what factors could be eliminated that the industry has taken for granted.
*What is OK but way over hyped This helped them decide what factors could be reduced well below the industrys standard.
* What features are there but you would like to see more of This helped them decide what factors should be raised well above the industrys standard.
* What is missing for you What do we need to offer that would make you really enjoy playing games What factors can be created that the industry has never before offered This is the real key to the value.
Result
The result is that the Nintendo Wii has broken all records for sales. Satoru Iwata made difficult decisions, often facing great ridicule, such as when he made the decision not to include a DVD player in the Wii console. That decision dramatically reduced the cost of the Wii and his rationale was that DVD players are available everywhere. Most people didnt need another one.
So, while Sony and Microsoft were reducing their prices below cost hoping to make profit on the games, Nintendo was selling at full price and couldnt keep the Wii on the shelves more than few days. Even at end of the year 2016, Nintendo is leading against Sony and Microsoft.
Now let us see how you can develop your firms strategy canvas:
(1) Get everyone on the same page first  by developing a visual representation of where you are at present. Compare your business to your competition visually. Get everyone to see the bigger picture and not just their own vested interests. Draw up a proposed strategy canvas and debate it. Compare and contrast your strategy with that of your competitors. Invite everyone to fire up their imaginations and participate.
(2) Send a couple of teams of managers into the field  and get them to talk face-to-face with customers. Find out precisely how people use or dont use your product or service. Dont outsource this and rely on second hand reports. Get out and see whats actually happening for yourself. This is the only way youll come up with any strategic insights. If at all possible, spend time with noncustomers and learn why what you offer does not appeal to them.
(3) Hold a visual strategy fair  where each field team presents their suggested strategies plotted on a strategy canvas. Let each team present their proposed strategy in ten minutes or less. Put each strategy canvas on the wall. Give everyone present five sticky notes to vote for their favorites. Tell people they can put all five on a single strategy if they find it compelling. That way whichever strategy is considered best will be immediately obvious. Decide on what your best future strategy can and should be.
(4) Communicate what you decide far and wide  by distributing your before-and-after strategic profiles. Put this on one page for easy comparison. Have management walk employees through the changes. Make this new picture the centerpiece of everything that you do.

Those who previously sold national assets now hurl false accusations
It is unfortunate that those who plotted more than any other leader in the history of this country, to sell or transfer parts of the country to foreign powers, are the ones who are currently making false accusations that the country is being divided or sold, President Maithripala Sirisena said. He was addressing a public rally held in Matale, on Monday (29).
They talk as if they have forgotten how they planned to sell 240 acres of the Colombo Port City land to a foreign country and how they actually sold 6 acres of prime land that housed the Army Headquarters, to Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, the President added.
In response to a former leaders comment on the garbage dump, the President said people know for a fact that it was the previous regime that terrified people at gunpoint and dumped garbage in Kolonnawa, despite many a protest from the local community. He added that this act was no exception to the conduct of that regime, that would open fire on people demanding drinking water as in Rathupaswala or workers standing up for their rights in Katunayake.
The President said the former President has erred again by saying USD 10 trillion, as he miscalculated once on January 8, 2015. What President Sirisena revealed was that out of the Rs. 10 trillion of loans the country has obtained, only Rs. 1 trillion has been accounted for as per the records of the Finance Ministry.
President Sirisena, reminding people that he did not alter the constitution to stay in power forever, said that after the 19th Amendment to the constitution, the real decision-makers are the people themselves.
All should unite to dismiss corrupt politicians, and votes given to parties other than the SLFP or UPFA, is a vote to strengthen such politicians, said the President.

We have nearly 100%  support of Tamil people
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, in a wide-ranging interview with the newest monthly magazine Venasa, said that nearly 100% of Tamil people now maintain cordial relations with members of the armed forces in the North, a clear increase from about 80% of the goodwill they have had earlier towards the Army at the time humanitarian operations were on before May 2009.
Some of pertinent extracts translated into English are mentioned here.
Except for a few outside incidents, Army personnel at all levels have been maintaining high standards of discipline. Eelam ideology still persists, and we maintain surveillance all the time as members of the armed forces, although we do not present ourselves publicly with armaments. It is our armed forces which launched the worlds largest humanitarian operation. Thousands of Tamil people under the LTTE siege fled and reached us in search of our security because they confided in us, Senanayake said.
We afterwards cooperated with the resettlement and rehabilitation processes while adhering to both the military law and the civil law. If any member in the Army has committed an offence, we have meted out punishment and in any Army in the world, those things could happen.
We have cooperated fully with all law suits since it is our duty and the responsibility, but if the conduct of respective investigations does not move forward with the speed it deserves, the Army cannot be held responsible. Therefore, no one can accuse us of not cooperating. Any Army in the world is deployed in areas strategically important to the specific concerns of security and 76% of the civil sector-owned lands used by the Army in the North and East have now been returned and we will continue this process until all such private lands are released under a five-year relocation project of the Army.
When I was the Jaffna Commander, I returned more than 86% of lands belonging to civilians due to prevailing peace prospects in the peninsula. As it is today, there is no threat to national security concerns as such. Even if a threat breaks out, it is the tri-services and the Police who have to intervene. Hence, let them decide where they should be relocated. We normally release lands to respective divisional secretariats and not to individuals because that does not come within our purview.
The Army is now fully committed to nation-building roles, promoting good relations and concerns of reconciliation as the most sought after service provider and that national task would continue in full swing in the future too. We are now dedicated to promoting a capacity-based Army and Army members, despite criticisms of some elements, would spearhead those national targets while assisting in the event of natural disasters, catastrophes, man-made emergencies, etc., Senanayake said.

2017, excellent  year for NDB,  PAT up by 50%
Established in 1979, National Development Bank PLC (NDB Bank) is moving forward in a clearly defined growth strategy with an unfailing corporate legacy that has earned them a solid customer base and a respected and eminent position in the financial landscape.
Over the years, the bank has demonstrated its ability to overcome the challenges of a volatile macroeconomic environment through strong governance and risk management initiatives.
In an interview with Daily News Business, Dimantha Seneviratne, Director and Chief Executive Officer of NDB Bank, highlights the banks successful journey , expansion plans and its contribution towards the development of Sri Lankan economy and the local community.

Excerpts of the interview 

Q: What progress has been made by the NDB Bank since inception in Sri Lanka and how has your brand been accepted by local customers

The National Development Bank PLC, established in 1979 has come a long way since its inception. The Bank has been constantly updating itself to suit the times and the needs of a customer.
We also significantly increased our branch network, and ATM/CDM network. Currently, we have a total of 107 branches and 121 ATMs around the island which ensures that our clientele is served island wide.
Organically, the bank has successfully transformed itself from a pure development bank into a full-fledged, licensed commercial bank where over 50 branches have been added on to the network in the last 5 years. Theres a clear strategy to become more retail and SME-centric in the coming years. With GDP and wealth rising including the regions out of Colombo, the average citizens expectations for a better lifestyle would also rise.
Our challenge is to constantly track lifestyle patterns of our customers. I think with our customer focused strategies in place NDB has been well accepted by its customers and we are committed in developing individuals, families, small business, large enterprises, society and nation towards success in every step of their way.

Q: How has 2017 been so far What factors have contributed to the overall performance of the bank
Based on the financial results that we have published so far, which is up to nine months ended September 2017, I can say that 2017 has been an excellent year for NDB. Profit after tax grew by 50% to LKR 3.3 billion whilst the banks Profit Before Tax (PBT) of LKR 5,679 million was an increase of over 60%.
Profitability was strengthened by strong growth in net interest income (NII). NII grew by 23%, up to LKR 7,656 million, benefiting from improved NIMs as well as loan volumes.
In terms of balance sheet performance, the Banks total assets stood at LKR 371 billion at the end of Q3 2017, a growth of 11% over 2016. Loans grew by 14% equivalent to LKR 32 billion. The growth in loans and advances was from all business and product segments of the Bank, corporate banking, project and infrastructure financing, retail banking and SME financing, which consolidates the position of the Banks effort to reach all market segments throughout the country.
In 2017, the Bank launched three new products, namely, NDB Araliya womens savings account, NDB Savings Planner and NDB Achara for senior citizens. Furthermore, NDB re-launched its Childrens Savings Account, taking a refreshing and novel turn in its offerings and benefits to minor account holders.
The Bank also introduced NDB Business Class, a unique relationship banking proposition for business customers. The launch of these products is anticipated to largely improve the CASA base of the Bank.
One of the key factors which contributed to this enhanced financial performance is the very clear strategic focus with which the business was
driven. The Bank is currently driven on a strategy spanning up to 2020, developed in professional consultation of the International Finance Corporation. The strategy was launched in June 2017.
Our full suite of retail products on both assets and liability sides, fortified by the capital market products offered by our Group companies provides a one-stop shop solution to customers in their financial and capital market needs.
Our well trained and motivated NDB Team is yet another key contributor to the high performance we have recorded so far in 2017.
I can assure you that the full year results for 2017 are highly satisfactory with sound growth recorded in both profitability and business volumes.

Q: What measures have been taken to curtail the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), and to improve Net Interest Margins (NIMs) and capital and the governance structure

NPA's have improved due to sound risk management practices embedded at the loan origination level itself. Continuous monitoring and follow-ups with facilities, sound relationships with customers and well diversified exposures to various sectors have ensured NPAs at satisfactory levels.
In terms of improving NIMS, in reducing the cost of funds, we have largely skewed our funding base to low cost deposits. The introduction of previously mentioned savings products is one aspect which supports this. We are gradually and steadily increasing the composition of deposits within the overall capital base compared to the credit line funds and institutional borrowings levels which was our focus as a development bank. We are also competitively pricing our asset products through a robust ALCO process.
Capital remains a key ingredient to stabilize the Bank in its growth journey. The Bank is soundly capitalized, and is well above the capital requirements mandated by the new Basel III guidelines. The Bank will further strengthen its capital structure as it expands in business volumes.
NDB has always been governed by a very transparent and robust corporate governance framework. The Chairman of the Bank remains to be an independent director. The Board has a precise composition of directors with over 1/3 of them being Independent directors, with vast knowledge and experience from multiple disciplines.

Q: How has the remittance business performed over the years
With regard to remittance business, I believe the adverse economic and the geopolitical conditions in the Middle Eastern region continue to have a negative impact on the worker remittances in 2017 at the industry level. We have also witnessed pressure on the existing "brick and mortar" agent based business model via the digital modes.
At NDB we are actively looking into partnerships for the digitization of money transfer services and already signed up with two such partners in 2017. Remittances are an area we really want to track and grow, given its contribution to the economy and also the Banks fee based income.

Q: How is the Leasing sector performing 
On the other hand, the year 2017, leasing performance was significantly better than 2016. We grew our portfolio by Rs.1.20 billion over the last year.
Overall leasing performance in the industry was also satisfactory due to higher LTV for commercial vehicle and some other vehicles which are being used for business purposes such as tourism, transport with attractive interest rates in the market throughout the year.
Furthermore, the proposed increase in LTV ratio (2018 budget proposal) for hybrid and electric vehicles also will give a boost to the industry.

Q: What is your assessment of the banking industry and what more suggestions do you have for the betterment of the industry

Technological advances are coming up each day. One of the biggest challenge as well as the opportunity that the Banking industry is facing is the technological enhancements and advances made by IT driven tech companies.
Customer expectations are increasing day by day and more and more people expect banking services to be delivered with increased convenience at their doorstep.
We have to be mindful of possible future technological advances because the digital space is no longer limited to traditional banking or financial arrangements.
It is important that banks keep abreast with these developments to stay in the competition. That's the challenge of it. Ensuring technology/ digital driven banking in a 100% precise and secure environment is yet another challenge.
The opportunities provided by technology are that we can reach out to and serve customers faster, and take customer convenience to all new heights. Although these will incur an initial capital cost at the outset, there will be large cost savings from digital banking, mobile banking, etc. in the long run.
It will also be sustainable as we can move away from paper based operations.
The digital fund transfer sphere is seen treaded upon by telcos as well. This is also somewhat a new challenge to banks.
Securing low cost funds is also a challenge, especially to mid-sized banks. If the interest rate differential increases between savings and fixed deposits, customer preference will skew more towards fixed deposits. Banks need to manage this challenge.
High competition is yet another aspect which features the SL banking industry. The industry being overpopulated by too many banks and financial institutions compared to the Sri Lankan population is fact that we all face. Scaling up balance sheets is therefore becoming increasingly challenging, but if we provide more cost-effective solutions to a wider population this challenge can be overcome.
On the other hand, Sri Lankas debt repayments to be paid in latter part of 2018 and 2019 have presented a challenging external landscape. The regulator however has taken corrective actions to face this challenge, by curbing the unnecessary credit growth, especially the import and consumption driven credit growth. It is very important that the fundamental errors in the economy are corrected to this end, we as a responsible bank also aligns our policies towards the national requirements.

Q: With changes in global environment, how do you see the strength of the local banking sector
I think the local banking industry is quite resilient to external environment. We see China rising as a world power and the influx of Chinese investments across the globe including in to Sri Lanka. Some leading banks in SL, including NDB are taking these opportunities. We have our own Chinese Desk to serve Chinese clientele.
The global headline events such as Brexit, terror attacks, etc., do have their cascading impacts on the Sri Lankan banking sector. But I believe we are weathering them well.

Q: Today people are not using branches the way they used to. Do you think physical branch concept for some people is much less relevant than it used to be in Sri Lanka

Banking in the past is perceived by the general public to be a very traditional, conservative and regulated industry. However during the last decade there has been a paradigm change in the way we do business and serve customer needs. All industries have evolved to offer the customer a better and cost effective solution or service. Technology has changed almost every aspect of banking services.
Technology and innovation has played a pivotal role in making farfetched ideas a reality. While the penetration of internet access and connectivity has specifically influenced this in the past, today technology such as automation, artificial intelligence, big data, social media and augmented reality together with personalized communication has changed customer experience in leaps and bounds. As a result even the Sri Lanka consumer is shifting towards these changes which are more convenient and flexible to them as result we have seen a shift towards mobile banking and internet banking, in Sri Lanka where they can bank at the comforts of their homes or on the go.

Q: How does your organization recognise the transition in customer behaviour
We are a customer centric organization and products revolve around the customers wants and needs. We try our best to give the most opportune and the most relevant products and services. Hence NDB attempted into exploring ways and means of using digital platforms to offer its banking services in a user friendly manner.
NDB has entered into its digital banking journey with internet banking, branchless banking, state of the art Mobile Banking App which changed market trends and set a benchmark in the market and other digital touch points which includes 121 ATMS island wide and around the clock banking with cash recycling machines at selected locations.

Q: How do you view the NDB Bank's engagement with exporters
The bank provides a wide range of services to the Sri Lankan exporters and potential exporters by disseminating required information relating to trade facilitation, market intelligence, and incessant export marketing guidance to achieve success in their export business.
NDB funds the exporters in form of pre and post finances. Currently our main exposures on financing of exporters would be tea, rubber, spices and apparel.
In fact, Id say out of the top 30 tea exporters, webank at least 20 top exporters. Same with cinnamon; where we handle at least the top 5 out of the top 10. We will continue our contribution via the corporate banking and middle market sectors and support them.

Q: Years 2016, 2017 saw an increased number of Cyber security attacks in the banking sector. How does NDB Bank deal with these emerging challenges

Cyber security is a major challenge faced by the industry, and it also revolves around the countrys economic growth. Cyber security is one of the areas where we have major concerns. While there certainly was an increase in cyber-attacks in the recent past, the Bank survived most of it because of the periodic steps we take in terms of cyber security.
We periodically conduct security assessment on IT Infrastructure and conduct cyber security awareness programs to educate the staff.
Furthermore, we also conduct internal and external independent audits on a regular basis to keep the network clean. In addition, we also invest in the latest IT security infrastructure so that we will constantly have updated our system on par with the technology advancements.
Our IT Network and Department periodically reviews security policies and procedures and shares thoughts and experience with other financial institutes in CIO forums.

Q: How does NDB Bank make a responsible commitment to the well-being of Sri Lankan people 
Corporate Social Responsibility is a company's endeavour to ensure an increased commitment to operate in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner while pursuing the core interest of stakeholders.
The Bank has a well-designed, established corporate social responsibility policy which will specifically focus towards Education, Environment, and Entrepreneurship.
At NDB sustainability is a holistic concept integrating three objectives of environmental, social and economic sustainability. Hence, NDBs CSR initiatives are aligned not only with the Banks values and objectives but also with National priorities and the expectations and needs of the stakeholders which includes customers, employees and communities.
Our commitment to society is embedded in our day-to-day business operations, where our CSR Initiatives are Strategic and directly linked to the core business objectives with the goal of creating business value and positive social change whilst adding value to the society and environment we live in.

Q: Future plans

The bank is looking at an aggressive growth in the retail and SME space in order to fulfill its future growth aspirations. To support those growth ambitions, most likely the bank will go for capital raising activities in the second half, this year.
In addition, the bank will diversify its product offerings by introducing innovative and cutting edge products for the benefit of the local customers.
NDB Bank believes in a future that allows each individual, corporation or institution to grow financially, which will lead to create a well-established economy and to improve their financial positions.
The bank would make all endeavours to ensure that expectations of all stakeholders would be fulfilled to the best of its ability.

All-women group to contest LG elections in Kantale
Creating history, an all-women group of candidates would be contesting the upcoming election for the Kantale Provincial Council. This is the first time that an all-women team is contesting a Local Government election from the Trincomalee district.
The 2018 local government (LG) elections regulations made it compulsory to include women in every nomination list and there were some nomination lists that were rejected due to the lack of female representatives, placing greater significance to female representation at an election than ever before. It was made mandatory that at least 25 percent of those appointed to LG bodies, be females.
The Eastern Womens Organisation headed by R. G. Podimanike had fielded an all-womens list as an independent group, which was a significant move in terms of women being encouraged to enter politics.
R. G. Podimanike said, This time, it was made mandatory to include 25 percent female representation at the LG polls. As a group that stands up for womens and childrens rights, we felt that by contesting the LG elections and through the Provincial Councils, we could render a better service to women and children, than as a single organisation. Hence, we discarded all our personal political stands and came together as an independent group to contest the election.
The reason we did not to be affiliated to any party was that if we did, then we would have to work according to their agenda. However, there are many problems in the Kantale area that mainly affect women and children. As we have included women of all nationalities, we would then be able to address the issues of the women in these respective areas better, according to their cultural norms and also address issues pertaining to schooling. To achieve this goal, we have selected active women from their respective community organisations, Podimanike added.

Anti-corruption drive will continue
President Maithripala Sirisena said that he will in future continue on a correct political vision no matter what obstacles he would have to face, and carry out his duty as President for the betterment of its people.
He said that when he initiates action against corruption and the corrupt for the betterment of the people, these parties band into one camp and attack him.
The President noted that he would not hesitate to take action against such corrupt figures without any consideration as to which party they belonged to, as he had faith in the people.
The President made this comment at a special media briefing for the Dinamina, held at his official residence yesterday.
He noted that he stepped out of the party he was in earlier, due to its corrupt nature. But having formed a new alliance, if there was corruption there too, he would certainly not accept it as a policy. After the end of the long drawn war, the people expected a free and fair administration in this country. But instead, incidents of killings, abductions including journalists, burning and vandalising media institutions and such destructive acts became rampant in the country.
However, the President pointed out that despite the criticism levelled at this government, people today have the opportunity to live peacefully without fear.
However, he said, if anyone is behaving in a manner that is not acceptable to the people, he would not hesitate to act in fulfilling his pledge to the people.
President Sirisena noted that although the debate on the Bond report and the Presidential Commission to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) is scheduled to take place in Parliament prior to the election based on his challenge, its success could be guaranteed as technical and legal measures have to be presented.
Expressing his views on the delay in legal action against the Rajapaksas on corruption during the previous tenure, he said the current government is responsible for the delay of these legal measures. He said although the consensus government was in favour of initiating such legal action, the UNP should be held responsible for the delay.
The President pointed out that in the upcoming LG elections, if he is made weak, he would not be able to implement measures that the people entrusted on him to do and said he would only be able to implement these measures, if he was given the power by the people and as such the SLFP and the UPFA should be made victorious.
He said the next two years would be more crucial than the past three years and expressed his desire to forge ahead after the February LG 10 polls together with clean and corruption free politicians irrespective of their party or colour.

The Deputy Minister added that his party is ready to have a debate on the Presidential Commission reports before the Local Government election.We have nothing to hide.That is why we took a decision to advance the parliamentary debate to February 6.
We want to divulge who the rogues are.We want to divulge those who associate with the rogues even today, he said.

Ceylinco Life Insurance  launches awareness campaign
Ceylinco Lifes continuing emphasis on the importance of families spending quality time together has found new expression in the latest communication campaign launched by Sri Lankas life insurance market leader.
Building up to another mega family fun event conceptualised, organised and funded by the company, the two-month long campaign seeks to create wider awareness of the harmful effects of parents and children being obsessed with education to the extent where the wellbeing of the children becomes secondary.
Themed Children First, Education Next, the awareness campaign is to be carried out in print, electronic, social and digital media throughout February and March, and will underscorethe importance of giving children the time, space and freedom to think freely, spend time with family and to enjoy their precious childhood. Going beyond mere messaging, Ceylinco Life has announced it will back the campaign up with a signature event for 300 families in Colombo in August to demonstrate the value of wholesome family fun.
As a company that is engaged in a relationship for life with close to a million families, Ceylinco Life has an insight into societys pressing issues, the companys Managing Director Mr R. Renganathan explained.
One issue that is of increasing concern is the intense pressure on children to perform at examinations. This is depriving them of the chance to be children and to spend time with their parents and siblings.
The Children First, Education Next campaign is designed to address this issue.
In order to select families for the Mega Family Fun Day in Colombo in August, Ceylinco Life will conduct a draw for all new policyholders who purchase life insurance between February 1 and April 30, the company said.
The event will comprise of magic shows, rides and slides, bouncers, a merry-go-round, trampolines,
face painting, games and many other fun activities for the entire family.
One of the highlights of the event will be a draw at which one participating family will win a visit to Universal Studios Singapore courtesy of Ceylinco Life, and four other families will win weekend packages to a star-class hotel in Sri Lanka.
Adjudged Sri Lankas Best Life Insurer in 2017 for the fourth consecutive year by World Finance, Ceylinco Life has been market leader in Sri Lankas life insurance sector since 2004 and has close to a million lives covered by active policies.

Chronicling a centurys mission
The names of people, places and events enable one to think of certain social trendsetting during a certain given time. Those who have led a blissful and resourceful life helpful to masses have been handed either as great or noble humans, who traversed a path for others to follow. Such a great and noble portrait comes from the life and works of the noble venerable Buddhist monk who dedicated his whole life to a spiritual mission.
He is known as Most Venerable Rerukane Chandawimala Thera. A peep into his life and works on the part of a Sinhala journalist Janaka Wettasinghe comes out in the form of a remarkable biography titled as Nivi Senasina Rerukane Maha Nahimi (Sarasavi 2017). The chapters that go into the work initially came out as a series of religious features that appeared in Budusarana.
Lively and blissful
In 33 short episodes, the writer cum biographer Janaka Wettasinghe attempts to present a wide spectrum of the lively and blissful life of Most Venerable Rerukane Chandawimala Thera. He commences the writing process as a long journey with its humble beginnings in the life of a village lad who is destined to become a great scholar. The lad eventually follows the religious path culminating by becoming a Buddhist monk, giving vent to a blissful spiritual path.
Having had the chance of going to Burma, the young monk got to know more about the Buddhist texts as well as the Buddhist codes of learning to culminate into the realm of higher insights as found in the metaphysical teachings, known as Abhidhamma. As Wettasinghe traces, the learning of the protagonist is shown as dedicated to a peaceful life which paves the way for the search of solace in the writing process. The compiler shows step by step how the colossal number of books came to be written.
At the outset, the learned monk is depicted as a scholar who writes articles to a periodical titled as Sri Dharma Sri. But the mere contributions to periodical are traced as a beginning. Thenceforth the reader is made to know here the very first Dhamma text titled as Nirvana Vinishshaya comes to be printed. This beginning is shown as a turning point in learning and teaching.
Venerable Chandawimala Thera says that the writing process could be compared to a meditative process enabling to achieve a sublime state of the inner discipline, broadly known in the Buddhist teachings as Samma Sati (Right Concentration) commonly known as mindfulness. Though quite a number of booklets and learned articles have been written on the explanation of the four noble truths, the pioneer commentarial work known as Chaturarya Satya came from the Venerable Thera.
Remarkable writing
The number of times the work is reprinted is a testimony to the fact of its being well received by the masses in the country. It is cited that the most remarkable point about the writing process is that anybody who desires to borrow material thus embedded is given the chance to draw them out irrespective of barriers to copyright.
Wettasinghe surpasses the narrow barriers of the conventional ways of presenting a profile, by the technique of questions asked by disciples and responses on the part of the learned monk.
This technique is seen in Chapter 13, which is titled as Mithyadrustiyen Samyakdrustika Vata (From a heretic stage to the truthful state).
It is made to know that one whole compilation of the teachings of the Buddha comes to be known by the use of the technique in the work titled as Dharma Vinishshaya (Analysis of the Doctrine). The learned monk had utilised the technique in order to help the seekers of the teachings of the Buddha, get to know the deep insights in the canons in a simplistic manner hitherto unperceived. One by one, the works of the Most Venerable Chandawimala Thera had come to be popular. As time passed, the contribution had been instrumental in the acquisition of honour both from home and abroad. He had the honour of teaching Abhidhamma at the university level. He too had the honour of receiving the highest titles pertaining to religious studies from various higher institutes around the world.
As far as possible, the Venerable Thera avoided the narrow social controversies that a monk could easily fall into. This had resulted in the form of a time-saving device for more learning, teaching and basically devoting more time for writing. The two works titled as Abhidhamma Margaya and Abhidharmaye Mulika Karunu.
Hallmark feature
It is said that the learned monk had the clarity of mind to commence one work and conclude the same devoid of many changes in between. This had been a hallmark of the writing process as initiated by him as a discipline. Some works such as Pohoya Dinaya and Bauddhayage Atpotha come as notable popular books as used by both laymen and clergy.
The day to day spiritual material are taken into consideration pinpointing how they could be made to apply as blissful means of existence. In this direction, factors such as generosity (Dana), morality (Sila) and wisdom (Panna) and meditation possessing happiness are taken into consideration. Born on July 19, 1897, the Most Venerable monk passed away on July 4, 1997, completing hundred years of a life devoted to a spiritually resourceful existence. I sincerely feel that this is an ideal work transcending the narrow limitations of a profile and/or a biography.
Each page is packed with penetrative material guiding the reader concerned into the understanding of a spiritual path of a higher human being.

Driving on the Southern Expressway
On the Southern Expressway we are permitted to drive at up to 100 kph which is twice the speed at which we drive on other highways. The reaction time is thus greatly reduced.
All my trips on this expressway had been during the daylight hours, save for my recent last journey at 7.30 p.m. While the day trips are a pleasant experience, the night trip was quite hazardous.
At night at this hour there are long lines of traffic going in both directions and many of these vehicles have their full headlights on leaving you quite blinded. Even though the centre partition ensures that we are not travelling head-on, the glare greatly reduces our distant vision making it quite a strain. It should be mandatory that all vehicles travel only on dipped headlights and the Police Motor Patrol must ensure this. Is it possible to have solar road lighting on this expressway
Another hazard is that older vans and lorries are now on this Expressway, not only travelling relatively slowly but also with no rear lights or even reflectors. There was no evidence of a Police presence and the SUVs were flashing past at 120 kph. During daylight hours when the patrol cars are on duty no one exceeds the speed limit.

Complaints filed against Kiriella, Musthapha for election law violations
The Neethignya Sanvidana Jathika Ekamuthuwa filed complaints against Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and Faiszer Musthapha at the Election Commission yesterday, stating that they had violated election laws by threatening voters.
The written complaints said Minister Musthpaha, reminding the voters that he is the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister, had asked them to vote for his party, if they need financial support for their Local Government Authority.
Making a similar remark, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella had allegedly stated that financial allocations for the LG bodies are done by the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister would only disburse money to UNP-led LG bodies; asking voters not to vote for other political parties due to this reason.
Neethignya Sanvidana Jathika Ekamuthuwa Convener Attorney-at-Law R Manoj Gamage and a group of lawyers filed the complaint.

Countrywide postal voting generally peaceful: PAFFREL
Peoples Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) observed that postal voting all around the country was generally peaceful and added that they have assigned 7,000 volunteers to observe the upcoming election process.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said even though the postal voting was generally peaceful compared to the previous elections, a few instances of canvassing for votes, campaigning close to booths, photographing voters in queues, and the non-registration of voters for postal voting in certain government departments were reported.
Addressing the media at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) in Colombo, yesterday, Hettiarachi said that there is an increase in the level of violence in the past week and most of them being due to violation of election laws.
He said that 19 cases of hospitalization have also been reported and added that the majority of the violence has been reported from the Polonnaruwa district, while the least number was reported from the Kilinochchi district.
PAFFREL National Coordinator Sujeewa Gayanath said 7,000 well-trained and well-equipped PAFFERAL volunteers are currently in place as its officials observers for the forthcoming local government elections. He added that among them, 1,000 were in service during the postal voting at different points and another 4,000 would be placed at election booths, while over 1,500 would function as mobile observers using 350 vehicles to visit areas, where the voting takes place.
In the meantime, PAFFREL commended the efforts of the police, Election Commission, and all political parties for being able to minimize the extent of violence during the past few weeks. Hettiarachchi said they deplore violence against female candidates.
Even though a 25-percent quota was awarded for women by election law, party organizers of electoral seats are accused of ignoring talented women and nominating only those whom they favoured, while some women have been cheated by denying the promises previously given to them, he said. He added that all together, 15 cases of violence against women candidates were reported.

To cut a long story short
Alice Munro - Quotes
The constant happiness is curiosity.
Always remember that when a man goes out of the room, he leaves everything in it behind... When a woman goes out she carries everything that happened in the room along with her.
Alice Munro- Too Much Happiness
A story is not like a road to follow  its more like a house. You go inside and stay there for a while, wandering back and forth and settling where you like and discovering how the room and corridors relate to each other, how the world outside is altered by being viewed from these windows. And you, the visitor, the reader, are altered as well by being in this enclosed space, whether it is ample and easy or full of crooked turns, or sparsely or opulently furnished. You can go back again and again, and the house, the story, always contains more than you saw the last time. It also has a sturdy sense of itself of being built out of its own necessity, not just to shelter or beguile you.
Alice Munro,Selected Stories
Why is it a surprise to find that people other than ourselves are able to tell lies
Its true, isnt it Most of us who write novels, cut our teeth writing short stories. At least its true for me and I know its true for Madhubashini Disanayaka-Ratnayaka, whose first published work was a collection of short stories titled Driftwood. Veteran dramatist Namel Weeramunis first work to be published too was a collection of short stories  Atharamaga (On the Way), which includes the first short story he ever wrote that he allowed the public to see, Pathola Massa (Vines of Snake Gourd) a heartbreaking and evocative description of a poor village family. Similarly, Gunadasa Amarasekera whose latest novel Datusena, had me spellbound when I read it, first wrote short stories (Rathu Rosa Mal)  his Avuwa (Fierce sunlight) no matter in what weather I read it, always brings beads of sweat onto my forehead. This theory applies to writers of the west too. Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, and Mark Twain all wrote short stories before they wrote novels. The only writer I have read who never stepped beyond the short story and allowed her writing to morph into a novel, is Alice Munro.
Munro the first Canadian author and the 13th woman ever to win the Nobel Prize in Literature was born Alice Laidlaw, the eldest of three children, on July 10 1931. Her father, Robert Laidlaw, was a direct descendant of James Hogg, author of The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. Despite this illustrious forebear even though Munro claims that the world of literature played no part in her upbringing, she also writes in an essay in the New Yorker that she came from a family who read a lot.
Reading in our family was a private activity and there was nothing particularly commendable about it. It was a pesky sort of infirmity, like hay fever, to which we might all be expected to succumb; anyone who managed to stay clear of it would have been the one to be congratulated. But once the addiction was established, nobody thought of interfering with it. A couple of years later when I had turned into the sort of child who reads walking upstairs and props a book in front of her when she does the dishes, my mother pointed me out to some visiting aunts with a fatalistic gestureAnother Emma McClure! Emma McClure was a relative of ours who lived somewhere deep in the country, where she had been reading day and night for thirty-five years, with no time out to get married, learn the names of her nephews and nieces, or comb her hair when she came in to town. They all looked at me pessimistically, but nobody took my book away.
And thankfully, Munro didnt grow up to be another Emma McClure. At least, she did find the time to marry. Not once, but twice. She currently lives with her second husband, Gerry Fremlin in the Canadian town of Clinton, Ontario. The house has a deep backyard and an eccentric flower garden and is, as she explains, the house where Fremlin was born. Munro likes to spend her days preparing simple meals with fragrant local herbs. Her dining room is lined floor to ceiling with books; on one side a small table holds a manual typewriter. It is here that she works.
It was a scholarship to the University of Western Ontario that helped her escape from her hometown and step into the wide wild world, where she promptly fell in love with a fellow student. They married after two years at university; her first daughter was born 18 months later, meaning that she inevitably returned in one sense to the domesticity she had tried to shake off. Yet she was also cultivating the life of a writer. Her first collection, Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968 when she was 37, won Canadas most prestigious prize, the Governor Generals Award  and she went on to win this twice more for other collections. In spite of writing collection after collection of short stories Munro, however, claims she did want to write a novel too, one day.
If and when she had enough time. As she writes in one of her short stories, she had to make her stories short because she was too busy bringing up her children and helping her husband run a bookstore. A childs illness, relatives coming to stay, a pile-up of unavoidable household jobs, can swallow a work-in-progress as surely as a power failure used to destroy a piece of work in the computer.
In her own voice, heres how she explains why the novel never happened. So why do I like to write short stories Well, I certainly didnt intend to. I was going to write a novel. And still! I still come up with ideas for novels. And I even start novels. But something happens to them. They break up. I look at what I really want to do with the material, and it never turns out to be a novel. But when I was younger, it was simply a matter of expediency. I had small children, I didnt have any help. Some of this was before the days of automatic washing machines, if you can actually believe it. There was no way I could get that kind of time. I couldnt look ahead and say, this is going to take me a year, because I thought every moment something might happen that would take all time away from me. So I wrote in bits and pieces with a limited time expectation. Perhaps I got used to thinking of my material in terms of things that worked that way. And then when I got a little more time, I started writing these odder stories, which branch out a lot. But I still didnt write a novel, in spite of good intentions.
In an interview given to The Atlantic Munro explained she has never been one to plan out stories before she writes them. You know, Im not sure why this has happened, because when Im writing a story, I dont really analyze it. But once Ive got the story finished and I begin doing things with it, I think that in many ways what Ive written breaks all the rules of the short story. This occurs to me, but not with any particular regret; I figure I can only write what interests me. So I dont try to do anything to make it a more regular story. In fact, if a story wants to go in a particular direction, I let that happen. I just put it out there and see what it does.
Obviously, it does amazing things. The Swedish Academy, announcing the Nobel, called Munro, master of the contemporary short story. Upon hearing she won the Nobel, Salman Rushdie wrote A true master of the form,. Her work was regularly featured in the Best American Short Stories (Richard Ford included two Alice Munro stories in the volume he edited), and Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards; she also was a regular contributor to The New Yorker. Despite these considerable accomplishments, as Jeanne McCulloch and Mona Simpson note in the Paris Review, Munro still speaks of writing with some of the reverence and insecurity one hears in the voices of beginners. It seems she has none of the bravura or bluster of a famous writer, and it is easy to forget that she is one. Speaking of her own work, she makes what she does sound not exactly easy, but possible, as if anyone could do it if they only worked hard enough.
When she heard she had been awarded the Nobel Prize, Munro exclaimed, I would really hope this would make people see the short story as an important art, not just something you played around with until you got a novel. Talking about her life these days, in an interview with The New York Times she said that now that she is in her 80s, she isnt as concerned about aging as she was before.I worry less than I did. Theres nothing you can do about it, and its better than being dead.

Fisherfolk at Welipatanwila, Ambalantota, say they have been deprived of deep sea fishing as a result of sand dunes that block the mouth of the harbour at Welipatanwila. The harbour was set up at a cost of Rs.28 million a couple of years ago. A breakwater to an extent of 375 meters was planned, but it was built up to only 275 metres.

DirectPay and PayMedia facilitate  eLocal Government Payment Services
DirectPay and PayMedia have come forward as pioneers to facilitate eLocal government service payments which was launched on the 29th of January by Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando and Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha.
eLocal government (eLG) services is a project by The Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) aimed at automating essential day to day transactions provided by local authorities. eLG allows citizens to access efficient online transactional services. As digital transactions are faster, more convenient and secure, they are set to become the preferred channel for individuals and businesses to access government services.
PayMedia and DirectPay allow payments for eLocal government services in two different ways bringing digital payment opportunities to millions of Sri Lankans. People who choose to pay through the DirectPay app can simply log in to the application through their mobile phone and pay for the selected eLocal government service. Those who do not have access to a smart device they can simply locate an eLocal Government Payment kiosk, follow the necessary steps and deposit the money into the machine. All payments happen in real time bringing a seamless payments experience 24x7 that has never been experienced by the citizens of Sri Lanka.
PayMedia, is a financial technology (FinTech) company focused on providing solutions for banking, finance and telecommunication industries , offering a wide range of services and has proved itself to be a truly innovative company by bagging numerous national and international Awards. They support more than one hundred and eighty Telcos around the world.
DirectPay, a spinoff of PayMedia is a FinTech startup that is disrupting the digital payments industry in Sri Lanka and aims at providing financial inclusion through cashless means providing affordability and accessibility to all users.Innovations in DirectPay are made possible by LankaClears Just Pay platform along with Cargills Bank PLC and Sampath Bank PLC which opens up opportunities for Startups like DirectPay to leverage technology to innovate and create new mechanisms that truly revolutionize the payments industry and the entire ecosystem as a whole.
This service will reduce waiting times, and long queues, creating a more streamlined and standardized process. Local authorities have greatly benefitted as a result of these new platforms.
The eLG digital transformation has also unlocked a range of productivity and efficiency benefits, saving costs, time and reducing inefficiencies.

E-Government to grassroots
Even as the entire country is fixated on the Local Government Poll slated for February 10, a major development pertaining to local bodies went largely unnoticed. Our local bodies are still deeply traditional and a lot has to be done to take them to the 21st century. This is why the launch of the e-Local Government Network initiative on Tuesday matters. A ceremony in this connection was held with the participation of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, and Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando.
Compared to many of our neighbours, Sri Lanka has an enviable Internet penetration rate, partly thanks to the proliferation of smartphones and mobile broadband devices (dongles). But our private and public institutions have not kept pace with these developments. Granted, there already are online portals for important institutions such as the Department of Immigration and Emigration and the Department of Registration of Persons, which have successfully migrated to online solutions. For example, approved photo studios can directly upload photos of applicants to these institutions. But much more can be done.
Hence the latest move to expand the online presence and scope of the Local Bodies is a welcome move. The facility implemented under the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils and Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure as a joint effort enables the public to make all the payments to the local government bodies through Internet electronic cards. It also has the added benefit of bringing more transparency to Local Government transactions, which will go a long way towards reducing corruption. In fact, speaking at the event Minister Faiszer Musthapha stated that this was a step towards eliminating corruption and malpractices within Local Authorities. There is every chance that voters will opt for younger, professional candidates on February 10, who are likely to be much more honest and dedicated. Moreover, most of them are already familiar with Information Technology applications. This e-Local Government initiative would fit in ideally with their programme and vision. Most development and social welfare projects at grassroots level are carried out through the Local Government bodies. As the Minister mentioned, while ministers exercise their executive authority through the Secretary of the Ministry and while the President exercises his authority through his Secretary, it is finally the Chairman or the Mayor of the Local Government Authority that has to directly carry out this authority and therefore, the political authority has to limit itself to policy decisions. The minister noted that after the new political authority is elected to office, proper decisions would be taken without giving into bureaucracy. Indeed, online transactions will hopefully lead to minimal red tape  we have often seen how people are driven from pillar to post at Government offices including LG bodies to get even a simple matter sorted out.
The Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) has been rendering a yeoman service to expand e-Government services to all areas geographically and subject-wise. Sri Lanka has been able to stay ahead of the curve in the region due to ICTAs tireless work.
As the e-Government network expands, it is vital to ensure that more people can access the Internet from their homes, offices and public centres. This is where the Nenasala kiosk network comes in. The authorities must ensure that even the remotest village has a centre where villagers can access the World Wide Web.
The other impediment is the language barrier. With 90 percent of the Internet pages available only in English, the villager who speaks only Sinhala or Tamil faces a major disadvantage. Many forms of Government departments can only be filled in English, probably to facilitate machine reading, but a solution has to be found. Most people do not have access to laptop or desktop computers, but almost everyone now has a smartphone. This is indeed how most people browse the web now. There are smartphone apps for everything from fitness to stock market prices. Thus there should be greater focus on creating smartphone apps on iOS and Android platforms in all three languages for various Government departments and local bodies. That will help them engage especially with the younger generation. Since the phone is with them 24/7, local government initiatives will only be a touch away at any time of the day.
The Internet knows no borders  we can actively collaborate with people and institutions in other countries to enhance our development potential. For example, India and Sri Lanka already have a joint programme for improving education in Sri Lankan schools using high speed Internet and other modern facilities. We should initiate more programmes of this nature with other countries as well. After all, we can video conference with an entire classroom on the other side of the world without spending a cent. Such technology must be used effectively to enhance the value of our education system.
Yes, the Internet does have a darker side as we glean from news reports, but the overall benefits are much bigger. We have to use such resources for the uplift of all citizens at grassroots level.

I thought it fit at this time to share this reflection with my fellow country women and men because I have been much troubled by the emerging signs of aimless drift in the governance of this nation that have appeared in the past few months. It is the sacred duty of all of us who love this country deeply to give heed to these warning signs, to call attention to the chaotic and open contradictions that are visible with each passing day, if we are not to stumble onto another disastrous period in the life of our nation.
To be sure, part of this anarchic situation is due to the ongoing local government election campaign and the jockeying by different parties to obtain maximum political benefit for themselves, further exacerbated by the uneasy alliance of the two main political rivals in the grand coalition.
But herein lies one of the fatal weaknesses of our shortsightedness where important national interests are made subordinate to short-term political advantages.
Two recent events have sparked my decision to write this letter.
The first, the utterly shameful and revolting conduct of our legislators, including senior members of both the government and the opposition (those who due to their seniority, their long experience and their backgrounds should have known to exercise restraint), during the emergency session of Parliament to debate the report by the Commission of Inquiry into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds on January 10.
It is no excuse to say that these kinds of incidents happen in legislatures all over the world. They are happening all too frequently in our own.
A Code of Conduct for Parliamentarians was a promise held out by the President during the election campaign of 2015. As with several other promises, this too is still pending.
I would like to cite some of clauses of the proposed Code:
To exercise, perform and discharge their powers, functions and duties of public office and also to enjoy the privileges which they are entitled to under any law diligently, with civility, dignity, due care and honour.
Every Member shall be individually responsible to contribute to the effective and efficient functioning of the Parliament.
Every Member shall respect the roles, independence, rights and responsibilities of the Parliamentary Staff.
Every Member shall in upholding the Parliamentary Democracy be responsible to ensure that the Executive Government is accountable to Parliament.
The Members shall not undertake any activity which may cause damage to the reputation and integrity of the Parliament or of its Members or the country.
By any interpretation, our Parliamentarians who have been elected by the people to serve them, paid by tax payers money, who enjoy many benefits that they have voted for themselves, have miserably failed to live up to any of these noble concepts.
The second matter I wish to talk about relates to the visible lack of authority, coherence and unity in the government. The majority of people in this country appreciate and value the democratic freedoms and the space that has been opened up since 2015 and understand the reluctance of the administration to resort to heavy handedness.
People are also aware of the strains and tensions of running a government in these circumstances. A government however is elected to govern, and not to present a picture of indecision, constant bickering and paralysis to the nation.This lack of consistency and the pulling in different directions by the leadership of the nation breeds uncertainty, and impacts harmfully on state administration as well as on overall national confidence.
Finally, I want to touch on the huge menace of narcotics and substance abuse in this country. In my visits to our parishes in many areas of the country, it is very, very common to hear about the easy availability of various types of drugs and of their use by many young people in our country. Not only are their lives being ruined by their addiction, but there is also damage to their families and to communities as well as to society at large due to resultant criminal activity.
Recently we saw and read about a vast quantity of seized narcotics being publicly destroyed in the presence of the President and the Prime Minister. We also frequently read about small-time smugglers or dealers who been detected, arrested and fined or imprisoned. But rarely do we hear about the arrest or prosecution of major figures behind the import of narcotics into the country. I wonder why this is so During the last election campaign, we heard much about drug dealers and politicians who were backing them and about how action would be taken against such persons. Surely it is not the small-time smuggler or the dealer who is behind the huge networks that finance and supply narcotics to the market and who while enriching themselves massively and illegally also callously bring ruin and destruction to the youth of our nation
I call on our leaders and the government to take serious stock of the situation of the nation as we approach the beginning of the seventh decade of our independence, to put aside their arrogant, selfish and foolish behavior, to remember the promises they made to the people three years ago for an honest corruption-free administration dedicated to putting the interest of the people of this county, especially the weak, the powerless and the voiceless foremost, to be true and faithful to the teachings of their own religions.
Into the heaven of freedom, let my country awake.

Facebook bans all cryptocurrency ads
Facebook has said it will block any advertising promoting cryptocurrency products and services.
The company said it was open to emerging technologies but many companies were not acting in good faith when extolling the virtues buying into virtual currencies.
Recently, a wave of new currencies have emerged, seeking to piggyback Bitcoin's huge increase in value.
Facebook urged users to report any ads the company's security measures missed.
It admitted it would not always catch every ad for a cryptocurrency.
We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception, wrote Rob Leathern, product management director for Facebook Business.
That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.
An ICO - initial coin offering - encourages people to buy into new cryptocurrencies before they launch in the hope they are one day worth a lot more money as the coin becomes more popular.
Some companies have used ICOs as a way to raise great sums of money, but without the regulatory burden associated with raising cash though more traditional investment channels.
Because of this, many ICOs have simply disappeared, with little recourse for the investor - a loose term, since those who pay into ICOs do not typically get a genuine stake in the new company. (BBC)

It was a good day for women in Hollywood after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences righted a wrong committed at the Golden Globes with Greta Gerwig bagging her maiden nod in the Best Director category for 'Ladybird'.

Bigelow is the only woman to have ever won the Oscar in the segment.
Actor Natalie Portman had taken a dig at the Golden Globe Awards for having 'all male nominees' in the top five directors list. Gerwig has also been nominated for Achievement in a Feature Film when the nominations for Directors Guild of America Awards were announced. ANI

First female cinematographer nominee for an Oscar
After a wait of 90 long years, one more barrier has been broken at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
According to a report, the director of photography for the movie 'Mudbound', Rachel Morrison made history by becoming the first woman to be nominated by the Academy for best cinematography - a category which was dominated by men for 89 years.
Morrison was quite thrilled with her nomination and said, "The job of the cinematographer is to visualize emotion - things we as women are inherently good at."
She added, "There's no stopping us. Women are so qualified they should just go for it. It's not just about cinematography, it about believing in yourself and that anything's possible."
Morrison has shared that she is looking forward to the day when she's not viewed as a "woman" cinematographer, but just a cinematographer.
"It comes down to statistics. If women are only 2 percent of the working DPs, it's not surprising there haven't been more women [nominated]. I've been reaching out to more women and hiring more women, not just for the camera department but so that they can become cinematographers. If this [nomination] says anything, there's no stopping us," explained Morrison.
Earlier this month, she also became the first woman to collect at American Society of Cinematographers Award in its feature competition.
Her previous credits include 'Fruitvale Station', 'Cake', 'Dope' and 'Sound of My Voice'. She also lensed Marvel's 'Black Panther', which opens next month.
She is nominated for the Academy Award with the likes of Roger Deakins for 'Blade Runner 2049', Bruno Delbonnel for 'Darkest Hour', Hoyte Van Hoytema for 'Dunkirk' and Dan Laustsen for 'The Shape of Water'. ANI

Fitch rates DFCCs Basel III Sub-Debt Issue A+(lka)(EXP)
Fitch Ratings has assigned DFCC Bank PLCs (DFCC, B+/AA-(lka)/Stable) proposed Sri Lanka rupee-denominated Basel III-compliant subordinated unsecured debentures an expected National Long-Term Rating of A+(lka)(EXP).
The debentures, totalling Rs 7 billion, will have maturities of five and seven years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures qualify as regulatory Tier II capital for the bank and include a non-viability clause. The bank plans to use the proceeds to support its loan-book expansion and strengthen its Tier II capital base. The debentures will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. Fitch rates the proposed Basel III Tier II notes one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka). This reflects the notes higher loss-severity risks compared with senior unsecured instruments due to the notes subordinated status. The notes include a non-viability clause whereby they would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
DFCCs National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the banks standalone financial strength. Fitch believes the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.
Fitch has not differentiated the notching on the proposed notes from the notching on DFCCs legacy Tier II notes as it is assumed that the authorities would step in late, moving the point of non-viability close to liquidation. Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk according to Fitchs criteria, as the notes have no going-concern loss-absorption features. DFCCs ratings also reflect its developing commercial banking franchise and capitalisation, which is still high relative to rating peers. The rating of the notes would move in tandem with DFCCs National Long-Term Rating.

Huawei introduces first facial  recognition feature through nova2i
Huawei, the number one growing smartphone brand in Sri Lanka, launched the facial recognition option for their latest smartphone series, the Huawei nova2i. This is the first occasion a Huawei smartphone comes with a facial recognition feature which is available to existing nova 2i customers by updating to the latest software version. The nova2i was recently introduced to the market as Huaweis first quad camera and FullView Display phone. It is considered the best phone with a 13 megapixel camera in the premium mid-range segment. The Huawei nova 2i commanded high demand from customers even before its launch. It is currently one of the top selling smartphone brands in Sri Lanka. Globally the smartphone tops over 3 million customers.
Huawei nova2is latest software upgrade incorporates a convenient way of unlocking the phone screen by pressing the power button to first wake the screen and then use face recognition technology to unlock the screen besides using the fingerprint sensor option. The Huawei nova2i comes with faster unlock speed; only 800 milliseconds to unlock the device, when compared to many other similar smartphone options in the market. This introduction ensures convenient and quick access to ones smartphone.
The Huawei nova 2i is more user-friendly by offering two options, Direct unlock or Slide to unlock. If one chooses slide-to-unlock setting, one can also take advantage of their intelligent notification display--smart lock screen notifications. If the Huawei nova 2i identifies the smartphone user is not the face ID owner, it will automatically hide the information/content from any notifications, such as; SMS, WeChat, Whatsapp, protecting user privacy.
A security based advantage about this new addition to the Huawei nova2i is that the face unlock only works when the eyes are open which would in turn, prevent other people from unlocking the device when the phones owner is asleep for example. The face unlock mechanism has been designed to record over 1,000 data points on the device owners face thus preventing thieves from using photos or videos of the owners face to unlock the device. Data is stored within the Kirin processor's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to ensure maximum security.
The upgraded version also includes a fun Augmented Reality (AR) lens selfie feature. This means one can easily enjoy a more amazing Selfie experience using self-creative backgrounds. Using this creative AR experience, one can super-impose into photos with idols or take a picture standing in front of the Eiffel Tower, Londons Big Ben or even the Sydney Harbour Bridge for example.
The Huawei nova2i also comes with the standard swipe option to unlock the screen where it also displays notifications. The screen would also display the content of notifications if it has verified the owner, and hide key content from non-owner users who would access the smartphone.
Sharing his views about the latest introduction Huawei Device Sri Lanka Country Head Peter Liu said, Huawei nova 2i epitomizes innovation with its First facial unlock feature, and we are happy to introduce this to Sri Lanka for our customers to enjoy greater convenience.
Huawei products and solutions have been deployed in over 170 countries, serving more than one third of the world's population. Huawei began its operations in Sri Lanka in 2005 and is edging closer to become the number one smartphone brand with a strong market share of over 30% in Sri Lanka according to GFK report.

I fight my own personal battles
Even as her latest film Padmaavat drew ire from various feminists including Bollywood actor Swara Bhaskar, Deepika Padukone has claimed the film looks at the power of women.
Today again we are standing up for ourselves with dignity... I find her journey so relevant today, Deepika said about her character in the film, Rani Padmavati.
Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Padmaavat was released January 25 after months of protests and threats. Padmaavat has been facing protests and death threats by a group called the Karni Sena ever since the shooting began in January 2017. The protests continue even now, and the film saw limited release in a few states owing to the violent protests.
The film also stars Shahid Kapoor, who plays the role of Maharawal Ratan Singh and Ranveer Singh, who plays Alauddin Khilji, but it was Deepika who faced the wrath of Rajput community who issued death threats to her.
When Rani has so much strength, why would she need others In my personal life I fight my own battle, I dont need anyone, she added.
When lyricist Javed Akhtar called Padmaavat the Mother India of her career, Deepika was on cloud nine. But what gratified her more was that her parents praised her performance.
My parents have seen the film and they were proud of my work, but there was a sense of disbelief, like they were thinking is she our daughter As I dont stay with them, they dont know much in detail about the role or the film. I want them to enjoy the film as a normal audience. They had no idea about Padmaavat and the story. The last 15 minutes of the film for my parents were tough... they hate it when I die in films, Deepika said.
The lavishly mounted film has so far minted Rs 110 crore at the box office over the weekend and the leading lady is overwhelmed with the response.
For Deepika, playing the part of Rani Padmini in the historical drama was the most difficult role in her decade- long career. This role of a queen had no crutches like she doesnt have a sword, she doesnt get on a horse and goes on battlefield - but there is sheer inner strength and resilience which I had to show through my eyes, Deepika said.

Influential steps
The South East Asian region comprises Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Indonesia and Bali. From ancient times, India and South East Asian region have had close ties with each other. The immigration of Indian population to South East Asian region took place mainly for commercial purposes. Indian influences can be seen in many aspects of South East Asian life. This opened the door for Hindu, Buddhist influences, and for the linguistic and cultural expansion. Mainly in the classical dance forms, social ritual dances, and folk dances, one discerns the similarities. Very likely, the South East Asian dance forms must have been based on the Natya Sastra.
One of the popular dance drams of Thailand was Lakhon.
Leading roles
In Thailand, the dances were largely based on the perennial themes Ramayana, and Mahabharata. One of the most remarkable features in Thai dance except the clown role, all the leading roles are played by women. They wear the masks only when they play the role of devas, demons, and monkeys. It would appear that like Bharatha Natyam womens movements in dance are sinuous movements. But there are not many facial expressions, but the meanings are expounded to some extent by hand gestures.
Lakhon Nai and Lakhon Chattri are two dance forms of Thailand. Both of them are drama based dances. In Indonesia, the evidence is available to show, that during the ancient Muslim regime, rulers extended patronage to the classical cultural dances. Like most of the Indian classical dance forms, Indonesian and Bali dance forms, are deeply associated, with religion.
Firm religious influence could be seen in the Indonesian culture. Famous Indonesian dance dramas depict the Ramayana. Most of the Indonesian dances are not so brisk, and generally, the tempo is slow, in such a way as it provides more opportunity to use the Anga, Pirathi Anga, and Upaanga, movements gracefully, (Head, neck, eye movements, legs, and hand movements, etc). Yet beautiful posturesand graceful stances resemble the stances and postures of various Indian classical dance forms.
Ramayana is the most popular dance theme in South East Asian dance forms. The Ramayana theme still plays an important role, in most of the Indian classical dance forms and in the annual Ram Leela festivals in the Northern Indian states. In Ram Leela, the actors wear masks or semi crowns.
Hindu themes
Bali is not deeply influenced by the Islamic tradition. But it is influenced by the Hindu tradition. Due to the Hindu religious influence, the Bali dance forms are naturally based on Hindu themes. The Wayang Topeng is one of the dance forms in which the dancer wears the masks. Such dance forms resemble some of the rural Indian folk dances or some of the ritual dances of India.
Another Indian folk dance is the puppet show. The puppets are, made out of leather; or cloths. These puppets are activated by twine. The theme of the puppet show must be based on some religious episode, or based on epics. The same type of puppet show could be seen in Bali under the name of Wayang Kuilit.
In Myanmar, there are many classical dances which show the distinct Indian influences. Javanese dances like the dances of India are firmly based on Thala, Laya, and Rhythm. After the 15th century, most of the Javanese dances moved to Bali.
One of the most popular dance forms was Wangang, which is based on Indian puranic stories, mainly Ramayana, and Mahabharata, and another dance itself, based on the indigenous epic called Panje.
In Cambodia like ancient Indian dances, dances were danced in royal courts. In Malaysia and Singapore, classical Indian dances, music, cultural heritage, and languages are still preserved well without much alien influences. Indian classical dance forms, Indian folk dances and Indian ritual dance forms have largely influenced the dance forms and dance themes of South East Asia.

THE LEGACY OF PROFESSOR E.F.C. LUDOWYK AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROMISE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CEYLON
Intellectual seat of inspiration
The Ludowyk Memorial Lecture delivered by Tissa Jayatilaka at the University of Peradeniya on January 17. Second part of this article was published yesterday.
Professor Ludowyk echoed these sentiments in his essay, Mixed Thoughts on an Asian University where he says,
'To fanatical nationalism, the University as it was modelled on English (foreign) institutions, was a sitting target. It is difficult to see how a modern university could have been planned without reference to similar institutions elsewhere in the world. It may be that the English planners believed too strongly in their own institutions. What has to be seen is that both the English and the Ceylonese responsible for the structure of the University were not guilty of malice aforethought, or a subtle desire to thwart the abilities of the Ceylonese, but the conviction that they were giving Ceylon the best kind of university they knewa unitary residential university.
In Jennings scheme, the immediate objective was to provide a residential university of 2500 students. Jennings felt that a university of 2500, could be adequate for the decade of the 1950s while acknowledging that,
. . . if the economy of the island progresses, they (2,500) may prove inadequate even before 1960.
He was confident of being able to expand Peradeniya from 3,000- 3,500, if the need arose. This would include a second medical school of 600 students. Anything above this number would be too large for efficient management.
As early as 1950 Jennings saw the need for a second university in Colombo or elsewhere, if the number of students were to exceed 4,400 (3,500 in Peradeniya plus 900 in the Colombo Medical Faculty). This is the kind of careful planning and thinking ahead that was characteristic of university administration in the days gone by. And, according to knowledgeable commentators, it was how the University of Ceylon functioned in its heyday from 1942-1955. Jennings was prescient in his warning to the powers that be about the dangers of politicization of the University. During the search for his successor, Jennings wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister Sir John Kotalawala which, among other matters, deals with the issue of politicization:
I do not wish to see fourteen years of hard work in Ceylon destroyed by politics in any sense of the word.
Any objective student of the history of the University of Ceylon at Peradeniya will have to admit that not heeding Jennings sage advice, has had a disastrous effect on the institution. Whilst democratization of education was desirable and indeed called for, inadequate and ad hoc planning by non- specialists led to over-crowding at Peradeniya. By 1960, a significant number of entrants to the University of Ceylon could not be accommodated in its halls of residence.
A new category of non-residential or external students came into being. They could attend lectures and tutorials, make use of library and other facilities but had to live off campus. Between 1963-1965, the University population doubled itself and the University could not accommodate the total intake of students to the Faculty of Arts and Oriental Studies for the academic year 1965- 1966. A second Medical Faculty was established in Peradeniya in January 1962 and the Engineering Faculty came into being in 1964.
It was clear that the state had not planned ahead properly to meet the unprecedented expansion from 1959 onwards in the higher education sector, consequent to the introduction of swabasha and the democratization of higher education in general. And as inevitable problems in regard to university administration began to mount, so did the politicization of the University grow. In the hasty search for a possible solution to the challenge of the growing demand for higher education, measures were adopted to solve immediate problems without much thought for the future. The Vidyalankara and Vidyodaya Pirivenas, two Buddhist seats of learning, were hurriedly elevated to universities in 1959.
Mismanagement and student unrest
By the early 1960s, the University of Ceylon had begun to grapple with serious internal problems arising from mismanagement and student unrest. These problems were compounded by external interference in the affairs of the University. The government of the day responded by appointing yet another commission The D.C.R. Gunawardene Commission of August 1962 to look into the causes for this mismanagement and unrest and to recommend measures to arrest them. The commissions report submitted to the government in July 1963, was extremely harsh on the University and contained some startling proposals.
The Commission went as far as to recommend that the University Court, the Council and the Vice Chancellor should cease to function for a period of 18 months so as to cleanse the foetid atmosphere at the institution and to seek to resuscitate the University administration. The Commission wanted a University Grants Commission established and powers and functions of the University vested in it. The government of the day ignored the severe recommendations of the Commission.
The next striking change in the higher education sphere came with the introduction of the Higher Education Act No. 20 of 1966 that made the Minister of Education responsible for the general direction of higher education with a National Council of Higher Education (NCHE) to assist him in the task. As K.M. de Silva has pointed out, this piece of legislation was in every sense a major turning point in the history of university education in Sri Lanka. It certainly led to the demise of the concept of an autonomous university that Jennings had envisaged for us.
From 1966 onwards, the University of Ceylon, suffered one crisis after another. The Minister of Education of the time, I.M.R.A. Iriyagolla was both controversial and unpopular among the academic community. So much so that senior and respected dons of the University of Ceylon who had hitherto kept away from party politics now began to participate in political rallies of the opposition United Front (UF). Many University students and dons openly campaigned for the UF in the election of 1970, partly due to that coalitions promise that if it came to power, it would restore University autonomy and provide for the expansion of university expansion by setting up three new universities.
In keeping with this election promise, the new Minister of Education of the UF government, Badi-ud-din Mahmud introduced a bill to regulate higher education in the country. It seemed to provide for much that was needed: a University Grants Commission to promote the growth and balanced development of universities and a progressive measure to introduce greater staff and student participation in university administration. Soon thereafter the insurrection of April 1971 broke out and there was a strong belief in government circles that university students had played a significant part in organising the event.
Jennings era
Although it subsequently became apparent that university students had played a very minor part in the rebellion, the government withdrew the promised bill and introduced in its place, a totally different piece of legislation that became law on February 15, 1972 as the Higher Education Act No. 1 of 1972. In significant ways, this Act was even worse that the Higher Education Act No. 20 introduced by Mr. Iriyagolla.
The overwhelming defeat of the United Front government in 1977 paved the way for the introduction of yet another higher education law by the new United National Party government. The aim of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 was to return to the traditions of university governance of the Jennings era. Although there were commendable new features in the new legislation, it too began soon to feel like an exercise of changing pillows to cure a headache. One began by now to get the feeling that national politics and university politics were getting enmeshed to an alarming degree. Violence broke out in 1982 after the Students Council elections at Peradeniya in December of that year. And when the university reopened for the second term of the academic year in January 1983 as K.M. de Silva tells us more menacing political influences from the national political scene began to intrude into student activity. Events in the north of the island were beginning to affect the students.
By May of 1983, ugly and unruly events that had never occurred before in the history of the University of Peradeniya, were beginning to take place. Nor have these unsavoury happenings, I regret to note, been recorded in accounts about the recent history of Peradeniya that are available to the general reader. I owe such information as I have on the perilous events of this era to my secondary school Principal and member of the University Council in 1983, Kenneth de Lanerolle, whom I quoted at the beginning of this presentation.
On May 18, 1983, the Council of the University of Peradeniya appointed three of its members with de Lanerolle as Chairman to inquire into disturbances that shattered the peace of the University on the evening of the 11th of May and continued sporadically till the 10th of June. The de Lanerolle Committee submitted an Interim Report after 10 days of enquiry without prejudice to the Final Report (a comprehensive analysis of the entire campaign of violence), both of which dealt with the same phenomenon. The Committee said:
It will be appreciated if all reports dealing with the recent disturbances are evaluated together and are read as one document. However, while the Interim Report was tabled at a meeting of the Council and acted upon, the more important Final Report (issued on December 6, 1983) never saw the light of day.
Prior to his death several years later, de Lanerolle presented me his copy of both reports for future reference, and now let me quote relevant extracts from them to understand how far we have moved away from the ideals of Jennings and Ludowyk. Let me begin with the following:
A sub-warden is known to have summed up the May-June disturbances as a reflection of present day trends in the country. At first glance, this seems too simplistic an explanation. While it is true that a university is a microcosm of the larger world outside and cannot function in isolation, it is at the same time a captive segment pledged to higher education and for that reason, not expected as of necessity to mirror all the ugly features of society, however sick or bitter or fragmented.
In the context of the awful shock that the entire country sustained in July 1983 (just a month after the University disaster), the sub-wardens remark acquires a new significance. We recall what was often quoted in the old (University College) days: What the University thinks and does today the country thinks and does tomorrow. Of course this was an ideal; but it remained in the thinking of pioneers like Robert Marrs and Ivor Jennings and their teams of committed academics. What we seem to have today is a grotesque twist to the University of Peradeniyas leadership role in society. What we intend to engineer at the national level we first try out in the university. This is one reading of the unhappy phenomenon under review.
All, however, was happily, not doom and gloom at that time in Peradeniya. There were those who responded in a humane manner as sensitive and educated members of a community of scholars are expected to. In this desperate situation the de Lanerolle committee tells us:
[The] stand taken by the University Teachers Association is worthy of note. Immediately after the first phase it met in emergency session and among other things requested its members to refrain from teaching until such time as the evicted Tamils returned. At least two professors (at some risk to their person) visited the Halls of Residence at night in order to dialogue with the students. In the Council, however, the Associations decision not to teach met with a mixed reception.
Another happy feature of the disturbance was the kindness shown by several Sinhalese students to colleagues by warning them of possible attacks, advising them how to avoid danger and agreeing to look after their belongings in their absence. One outstanding gesture of compassion was made by a Sinhalese student who had led a Tamil academic away to safety after he had been mauled and abandoned in front of Wijewardena Hall.
Lanerolle Committee Report
If Jennings and Ludowyk could have witnessed these acts of compassion and humanity by the latter day men and women of the University of Peradeniya, they would have been reassured and heartened.
One of the concluding observations of the suppressed de Lanerolle Committee Report is also worthy of quotation because it seems to have (perhaps unwittingly) anticipated the absolute horror of the 1987-1989 period at Peradeniya. Here it is:
What took place at the University of Peradeniya in May June, may, on the surface, not appear very serious, especially after the holocaust of July which overtook the country. But it would be quite wrong to under estimate its significance and, for that reason, to pass it off with a mild rebuff. Great oaks from little acorns grow; likewise great crimes stem from small misdemeanours.
Prof K.M. de Silva in his monograph titled The Sri Lankan Universities from 1977-1990; Recovery, Stability and Descent to Crisis, describes in detail how the system at Peradeniya floundered and slid into deep crisis from 1985-1989. In the period between 1987-1989 in particular, the student members of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) had an iron grip on the universities and they are considered responsible for the assassination of two Vice Chancellors and some others whom they suspected of being security personnel in civilian clothes. Retaliation by the state thereafter was swift and as brutal as the violence of the JVP had been. Before the end of 1989, the leadership of the JVP was eliminated and the universities were reopened after almost six months.
Almost twenty years after this violent phase of the University of Peradeniya, we are presently living in a time, not only here in Sri Lanka but elsewhere in the world as well, when it is difficult to be optimistic. When we reflect on the political situation or the state of higher education in our land, it is difficult not to feel despondent.
Ivor Jennings with able assistance from Lyn Ludowyk and other colleagues laid so secure a foundation for the University of Ceylon at Peradeniya that despite all the problems and tribulations that the University today has confronted since their departure and the negativity around us notwithstanding, one could still end this assessment of the institutions promise and performance on a note of cautious optimism.
The odds against success have been very great, and yet the University has survived with some of its spirit intact and prevailed over a succession of difficulties including a series of catastrophes, that could have destroyed a system with less secure foundations. To those of us who have had the privilege of studying here during better times, it has been an exhilarating and enriching experience. The sadness with which we view the decline and what might have been a great institution is mitigated by the hope that the resilience the institution has demonstrated through very trying times, will ensure a renewal of its spirit, and a fulfilment, in some degree, of the promise of its early days. Even when a mood of pessimism is warranted by the realities of the day, the gloom is often lifted when one contemplates, as Ediriwira Sarachchandra has done in his Curfew and a Full Moon (1978) the natural beauty of its location:
If ever a community of young and old sought the tranquility and inspiration of a natural environment in which to engage themselves in the pursuit of knowledge, they could not have found a place where nature was more kindly or more anxious to please than the valley of Peradeniya. You pass ugly little towns all the way, Yakkala, Warakapola, Kegalle, Mawanelle, till you come to the bridge that goes over the Mahaweli. Then, through the arches formed by the bamboo branches that droop over the river from both its banks you catch a first glimpse of the archaic-looking buildings of the University built there only a little over a quarter of century ago. You turn right after crossing the bridge, and enter into a world that you would never have believed to have been there. A world apart, indeed, which has been often condemned for being so, for being an ivory tower in which the youth of the country grew up without a care for the masses who were not as fortunate as they. But as you go through the campus and see more of it, you wish, however just the condemnation may be, that there were a few more spots on earth left, like it.
The Peradeniya campus is beautiful at all times of the year, but particularly in the months of Durutu and Bak, which correspond to Spring in colder climes. Then, it is like a vast pavilion decked gaily, as if for a festival, with festoons of flowers hanging overhead and yellow petals falling lightly from them to rest in the cool green grass and make a carpet for the feet, while bourgainvillaeas twine themselves into multi-coloured trellises all around. The shimmering vault of the noonday sky resounds to the cry of the kovula rising higher and higher up the scale and ending in a crescendo of longing.
And the nights are enchanting, wrapped in mystery. A thin transparent veil descends on everything, making the jagged edges of the day look smooth and muffling its coarser sounds. The fireflies  one can almost hear them rustling like strands of tinsel in the green darkness of the Cyprus trees. For hours one can watch the silent commerce in the sky of moon and stars and clouds, among themselves, never understanding and not wanting to, what it is all about.
Unfortunately this most glorious season falls in the third term of the academic year, which is examination time for the students. Hence it is rare that they get the time to enjoy the beauty around them, or to make love in the crisp moonlight on the banks of the Mahaweli. All day and half the night, they keep to their rooms and swot, emerging only for the unavoidable meals and an occasional cup of tea and a cigarette. During this term, therefore, the campus is completely deserted, and one feels it is a pity that all the efforts that nature seems to be making to please the human eye are wasted. There is not even a demonstration or a strike to break the monotony that is campus life for a great many of its residents. Only such an event would bring some animation to the senior common room, where otherwise the teachers quietly sip their tea while reading the papers and walk away as quietly.

Kandy SC league champs for another year
Defending champions Kandy Sports Club have already secured the League Championship for yet another year with two more games to spare after their win over Sri Lanka Navy SC in the league fixture played at Welisara last Saturday.
Kandy scored 41 points and Navy managed only 17. Though the Sailors tried to take charge of the game Kandy had the firepower to make it a one sided game. The winners with their classic rugby led 34-3 at half-time.
A big hand should go to play maker Fazil Marija for his ball handling and knowledge of the game which was excellent. It seemed that there was class written in all aspects of his play. Kandys play was far better than the Sailors and fully deserved this win. The sailors were obviously hurt and though they tried their best to play well, there was nothing going in their favour. They struggled for survival in the rough seas of the forwards play and drowned. Kandys defence was good. The sailors couldnt get any momentum and couldnt shift it wider as the winners were off the line so quickly.
A dominant first half from Kandy SC put the game out of reach of the sailors.
Never in the history of Sri Lanka rugby has there been a team as dominant as Kandy SC. They have won all the league games (eleven) and have been the top club in the country for more than 25 years.
They have proved to be invincible, especially in the league and knockouts from 1992 to 2017 and this league win gives them four in a row. They have two more games - next Saturday against Sri Lanka Army followed by the Havelock SC game at Nittawela on 17.
Kandy SC coached by Sean Wijesinghe their success has been due to the forwards and backs. They have two solid props for every match; two towering second rows did their best and were outstanding in loose play.
The fast breaking flankers were there to always to hound the loose ball and were solid in defence and finally the last and the best of them all was the number eight forwards who played in different matches.
The way Kandy SC forwards played it will be good for some clubs to take a few lessons from them.
The scrum half a former captain and present acting captain was outstanding and actually the play maker of the game. Fly half, centers and the wingers were at their best and the last line of defense was well manned.
In their last outing Kandy SC beat Navy SC in their own den at Welisara even though the match had no bearing on the league table, yet it generated a lot of heat among the Sailors . From the kick off it was evident that the boys from the hills had come determined to knock the daylights off the Sailors which they finally did to perfection.
Kandy SC's rugby is under the chairmanship of Lasantha Wijeysuriya, former Antonian, CH & FC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka ruggerite whos advice and guidance has helped them to clinch the title. The man who will be most pleased with the win is their godfather and rightly tagged Mr. Rugby' Malik Samarawickrema.
The Kandy SC squad that made history  (Coach) Sean Wijesinghe, (Assistant Coach) Saliya Kumara, (Team Manager) Kapila de Silva, (Captain) Gayan Weeraratne, Damith Dissanayake, Richard Dharmapala, Shehan Pathirana, Oshan Perera, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Dimitri Wijetunga, Thilina Wijesinghe, Jason Dissanayake, Nigel Ratwatte, Lavanga Perera, Fazil Marija, Lasitha Aththanagoda, Danush Dayan, Dhanushka Ranjan, Asitha Ratnayake, Yakoob Ali, Arshad Jamaldeen, Piyumal Machanayake, Anurudda Wilwara, Ganuka Dissanayake, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Shashika Jayawardana, Heshan Kalhara, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Suhiru Anthony, Ashan Darling, Tharindu Chathuranga, Sanushka Abeywickrama, Heshan Jansen, Diluksha Dange, Kasun Srinath, Chathura Seneviratne, Lakshitha Ranaweera.

Kandy SC a team to emulate
All hail the last brave weekends of this years Dialog league cup and its rugby islanders club reps.
Life for them is very much a Colombo/Kandy story in more ways than one - and survival of the fittest despite the impact and physicality.
Rugbys demand is relentless and compulsive, testing each player on so many levels, week after week ..match after match ..its an appetite that defies science and has little regard for weakness.
Club rugby history in Sri paradise is a long and intrepid tale of British planters traveling the pigskin all the way from sunny England to the exotic shores of our resplendent isle.
Life at the Radella club, Dimbulla/Dickoya and Kelani Valley were quite exceptional and more than inspiring for us curious islanders.
I rather think a defined passage from my avid sports writer and generous rugby heart - Mr Neil Wijeratne, utterly appropriate and right on the button...rugby is part of his oxygen and how fortunate we are to have him around - bragging rights indeed!
Kandy have shown great skill, experience and patience to carve themselves yet another league title and remain unbeaten from game one this season...its a testament to all up there and the structure of Kandy rugby that demands admiration......supporter or not, fan or family.
What absolute pride for Gayan Weerey as captain, Sean Wijeysinghe as coach plus the entire backroom team this season. Carving their name on that trophy has become a habit for the lions and certainly the team to beat every weekend till the rugby concludes, and the warriors ease off to their corners of our island home.
The Kandy story is our new rugby history and defiantly a gauntlet to openly challenge all clubs to beat their style, endurance, skill and finish in the middle.
CH & FC came mighty close and exposed chinks in that armour ..losing in the last 5 minutes of normal time and on a rare off day for Sammy boots Maduwantha.
The Maitland marauders certainly showing how remarkably big their hearts this season and a grand sense of pure pride for all red and white warriors thru the years...especially the likes of Saman tank Jayasinghe, N H Karunasena RIP, Sujantha zippy Kumar, Brumoon Akbar, Ravi upfront Wijeynathan, Anil rock Dassanayake, Imran Salley, Sudesh Abeysinghe, Roshan hitman Perera, Chanka Jayaweera, plus a host of captains who can be visibly proud of the boys this season.
The air of expectation in the clubhouse at Maitland Crescent is sharp to a smile and definitely a few charged heartbeats quicker.
The league battle rages for the top 4 slots behind Kandy .. Navy, Havelocks and CH with absolutely everything to play for ...coaches Jayatilaka, Martis, and Lagga looking to their seniors and rugby skills to prevail...But more a need for solid patience under pressure to absorb it all and finish stronger.
The dream lives nervously each game day and anticipation that the team sticks to the plan ... a concept of sheer adrenaline and tough to replicate in practice.
Lets wish all 3 contenders the best form and less injuries to get there and beef up for the Lady Clifford Cup that openly challenges all faithful near and far.
What a tantalising prospect on our hands and such absorbing match ups in the middle.
No shortage of guts or courage to survive ...But more the skill challenge to outshine and out think your opposite number ..under pressure for the 80mins in the middle.
Great effort by Sri rugby and the collective effort of president Asanga Seneviratne, CEO Priyantha Ekanayake, and the vociferous efficiency of director operations Rohan Gunaratne ..to keep the pressure and maximum possession of that shining oval.
The islanders thrive on good planning and we are certainly hopeful for the first time that things are falling into place, with a wave of cooperation and teamwork.
Naturally working closely with the Minister of Sport and his team a significant step on the right side of our offside line ...our beloved game is all about lines ...from kick off to finish, from goal to deadball, from 10m to 22m, from touch to corner flag ...thats our life in the middle and oxygen when we practice.
Lets anticipate good things, fair play, no chemicals and a brand of islanders rugby that will be inspiring for our islanders from Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Cook Islands and much closer to home in Guam ...what scintillating thoughts to have our brothers praise Sri rugby, its skills and pace that earn respect from the ABs down.
Take heart rugby Sri faithful, we are on our way ...Just a matter of time before you see the flag and step up to meet the worlds best ...that dream is a 7s dream and everything to practice for.
Blessings islanders, enjoy the gladiators weekends.
Cheers indeed!

Labour Ministry to spend Rs. 500 m for development of Sabaragamuwa Province
The Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Ministry plans to spend Rs. 500 million allocated from the budget for the development of the Sabaragamuwa Province to address the needs of the public.
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said he is expecting to get more funds from the President for essential development projects of the province. He was participating in a meeting held in Sankapala, Embilipitiya. The Minister said all development activities of Sabaragamuwa Province would be implemented with the aid of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members elected to local government bodies and added that they would also be the village-level representatives of the President.
He further said that the UPFA has a clear vision, plan, and a process of developing villages through local government bodies. Therefore, it is useless to elect members from a party with no clear vision and plan for local government bodies.
Nobody can destroy the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), but a group SLFPers is attempting to destroy the party by forming the Pohottuwa party, the minister said. Minister Seneviratne added that the Pohottuwa party Chairman G. L. Peiris has no ability to identify the real needs of ordinary people and that he doesnt have the ability to take practical decisions. The minister also questioned whether the Pohottuwa party has a policy.
All members of the Pohottuwa party are attempting to fulfil their wishes by marketting the popularity and peoples attraction of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Lankas Vidya Sivaraja to lead Fonterra's  Malaysia and Singapore business
Fonterra Sri Lankas General Manager of Marketing, Vidya Sivaraja was recently appointed Managing Director of the Malaysia and Singapore business, effective February 1, 2018.
It is the first time a Sri Lankan has led one of the global dairy co-operatives country markets.
Sunil Sethi, Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka & the Indian Sub-Continent, said, Our people are our biggest asset and we want to grow with them as they grow their careers. Vidya is a strong leader with a proven track record. Her story is a reflection of the unique opportunities available to inspiring leaders to take on challenging and interesting work across the globe.
Commenting on her new role, Vidya said, The opportunity is incredibly exciting and I am honoured to step up to the challenge. I am looking forward to working with the fantastic team of people we have in both markets to unleash the energy in our business, strengthen our brands leadership positions and develop high quality dairy solutions to delight our consumers.
Vidya began her career at Fonterra in 2004 as a Group Brand manager and drove the growth of the local dairy business under the Anchor Newdale brand.
In 2007 she was given the opportunity to work on a regional role in Singapore. This experience, Vidya says, made her appreciate the common ground diverse teams had despite different geographies, cultures and ways of working.
My time in the regional team made me learn how to motivate and unite diverse teams. Gaining a better understanding of local nuances and the commonalities across markets helped me develop communication with global and local relevance. Global exposure helps you realise how resilient and innovative you can be, making you think and do things differently to get results.
In 2010 Vidya returned to Sri Lanka as Marketing Director. She took on another challenge and role with the global team in 2013 as Category Director - adding to her experience across 14 markets. Vidya returned to Sri Lanka to head the marketing role for Sri Lanka in addition to developing brands and consumer opportunities for Fonterra's operations across the Indian subcontinent.
Vidyas international career path and leadership roles have made her an obvious role model and mentor to other women in the co-op, and her emphasis on performance and people has made a mark on the Sri Lankan business.
A core part of leadership is about building diversity to harness different perspectives, providing a strong sense of ownership and passion through clarity of purpose and fostering a contagious can do attitude, she says.
In building her marketing team, she actively sought non-core marketing people to source new thinking, searching for personality and attitude over age, experience, gender and qualifications on paper.
Each person has their own strength but everybody needs to come together to do extraordinary things. One of the ways Vidya empowered her team in Sri Lanka to unleash their own potential was to encourage them to exercise their own personal passions  whether at home, with friends or at work.

Lanka's Budget openness, among  lowest in South Asia
Sri Lankas budget openness in the latest survey has scored 44 out of 100, coming in next to last in South Asia, tied with Pakistan.
Open Budget Survey, which scores 115 countries on the openness of their budget process, is the worlds only independent assessment of information disclosure in public budgets.
The recent assessments of the 2013/14 and 2016/17 budget processes have placed Sri Lanka 60th in the world and amongst the lowest ranked countries in South Asia.
In the latest survey, of the 2016/17 budget process, Sri Lanka came in next to last in South Asia, tied with Pakistan. Afghanistan performed better than Sri Lanka, whereas Bangladesh did not.
Compared to the previous, Sri Lanka improved in the information provided each quarter, on revenue, expenditure and debt, Verit Research who conducted this survey in Sri Lanka said.
However, the quality and timeliness of this information continued to fall short of many of its peers.
Sri Lankas budget related reporting is governed by the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act.
Verit Research said the government remains compliant with this law, despite falling short of international standards on the quality and scope of its budget reports.
The research firm proposed three ways in which Sri Lanka can improve, by going beyond the letter of the law and implementing the Act it in terms of its intended purpose.
Verit Research, however, said that in past years Sri Lanka has performed better than in recent years, which points towards several of the above improvements being well within the scope of what is achievable in a short time-frame.
Improving Sri Lankas performance on budget openness requires alignment with international standards, Verit Research emphasized.
According to Verit, this requires the government to make two shifts: Firstly, to go beyond the letter of the law and publish timely budget information in consistent formats.
Secondly, to recognise the gaps in terms of budget information required by the law and publish adequate information that allows for the proper monitoring and scrutiny of budgetary outcomes and compliance.
Sri Lanka has legislation in place that allows for public scrutiny of budget information.
But the shortfalls in implementation, and the gaps in the requirements specified, are resulting in the country coming out in a poor light in international rankings on budget openness. (LBO)

Latifs appeal rejected
Karachi: Former Pakistan opener Khalid Latif Wednesday lost an appeal against a five-year ban for spot-fixing but had his one million rupee ($10,000) fine waived, the countrys cricket body said.
Adjudicator Justice Faqir Khokhar upheld the ban, saying there was overwhelming evidence against Latif, but waived the fine as his career was almost over, Pakistan Cricket Board lawyer Taffazul Rizvi told reporters in Lahore.
Latif, who had shown tremendous early promise as a cricketer but failed to make an impact at international level, played five one-day internationals and 13 T20Is, the last of which was against the West Indies in Abu Dhabi in September 2016.
The scandal surfaced during the second edition of the Pakistan Super League in February last year when Latif was playing for Islamabad United.
Latif, 32, was charged with orchestrating a deal with a bookie that would see his fellow opener Sharjeel Khan deliberately playing two dot balls -- deliveries off which no run is scored -- in the opening match against Peshawar Zalmi in Dubai. AFP

LKI Executive Director delivers lecture in New Delhi
Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute Executive Director Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne delivered a special lecture titled "Role of Sri Lanka in South Asia and Beyond: Emerging New Contours at the Habitat Centre, New Delhi, recently.
The lecture was organized by the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) in New Delhi.
Dr. Panditharatne reflected on four emerging contours and Sri Lankas role in South Asia and beyond. She identified these contours as Sri Lanka in the centre of the Indian Ocean gaining a South Asian geographic identity; Sri Lanka in the past focusing on political diplomacy, but now more towards economic diplomacy; Sri Lanka strategically non-aligned, but cautious and actively engaging with regional powers; and Sri Lanka seeking to demonstrate that it follows regional and international norms.
The presentation encapsulated the discernible shifts in these characteristics. She noted that these four developments in Sri Lankas foreign relations are nascent, but generally positive. Pursued in combination, these developments will elevate Sri Lankas standing, while strengthening its neighbourhood relations, Dr. Panditaratne added.
Dr. Panditaratne also noted in her lecture that Sri Lanka is being rebranded in the present context in its aspiration to be a major trading hub in Asia. Sri Lanka has been able to bring its Free Trade Agreements (FTA) into force, which in turn impact positively on the rebranding process. She stated that economic diplomacy is given priority and adherence to the rule of law and good governance gave a new face to the rebranding process.

## Title: Mega Show celebrates 40th anniversary!

Mega Show celebrates 40th anniversary!
Exactly 40 years ago, Sri Lankas flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, thought that it should introduce an award show for the countrys budding schoolboy cricketers who perform well at under-19 level. That was an era in which there had not been an organized inter-school first XI cricket tournament; forget about school cricket awards show altogether!
There wasnt a single inter-school under-19 tournament some 40 years ago. The inter-school first XI cricket matches were only confined to friendly encounters. Yet, the Sunday Observer thought that it should initiate an awards show to inspire the outstanding schoolboy cricketers at the end of each season.
With that in mind, the Sunday Observer, together with its sole sponsor Haliborange, conducted the countrys first ever inter-school cricket awards show at Nawarangahala, Royal College in 1979. Coincidentally, it was the then Royal captain Ranjan Madugalle who was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in its inaugural year.
The maiden selection ultimately turned out to be the most perfect one as Madugalle went on to captain NCC and Sri Lanka with distinction. Even now, his name is a household one in international cricket as he continues to serve as ICCs Chief Match Referee.
Besides Madugalle, the contest has produced many legendary cricketers including Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga and the worlds highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharn. In addition, several past recipients of the prestigious award had played many other leading roles as coaches, umpires, match referees, managers and cricket administrators.
Several past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winners too had served Sri Lanka cricket in different capacities.
Some of the past award winners paid glowing tributes to Sri Lankas first ever School Cricket Awards show that celebrates its 40th anniversary.
Former Sri Lanka captain and current ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, who was the first ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1978/79, said most of the top award winners had came from Colombo and its suburbs in the past. But, now the outstation schools have come in a big way and its a good sign for the game. The Lake House and the Sunday Observer should be complimented for keeping the show going for all these years. Sponsors are essential. May the show continue for many more years he said.
Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain turned Cabinet Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, who had also served as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket won the main title in 1980 and 1982 rated the mega award as the 'most memorable' in his career. You may go places and win many other awards at higher levels subsequently, but an award won at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event remains the most memorable in any cricketers life. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award twice remains the most cherished moment in my life. Those titles had given me tremendous inspiration and confidence when I stepped into the international arena, the captain cool said.Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-ICC Match Referee, Roshan Mahanama, the first to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer title on successive years in 1983 and 1984, feels that it is a great encouragement for any schoolboy to be adjudged the best schoolboy cricketer for the hard work during a season. I was privileged to achieve one of my dreams. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year on successive years was a memorable one. It was my stepping stone. Becoming the best schoolboy cricketer made me even more determined to work harder to reach greater heights, the former Nalanda captain said.
Mahanamas back to back titles had inspired his Nalanda teammate Asanka Gurusinha to focus on a rich 1985 season. When Roshan Mahanama won this award twice in 1983 and 1984, I felt how prestigious it is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. It is not an award that everybody could win. One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that - work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career, said Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup star who is now functioning as the manager of the Sri Lanka national team.
The winner of the Most Valuable Player award in Sri Lankas victorious 1996 World Cup, Sanath Jayasuriya, said the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer outstation award that he won in 1988 as an emerging schoolboy cricketer from St. Servatius College, Matara was of the best thing that had happened in his early cricketing career. Playing for St. Servatius had brought me immense joy and winning the title gave a tremendous boost and inspiration. Schoolboy cricketers must be motivated, the former Sri Lanka captain and ex-chairman of selectors said.
Former Sri Lanka star cricketer turned ICC Elite Panel Umpire, Kumar Dharmasena, said the schoolboy cricketer title he won in 1989 had been a big inspiration for him. It helped and encouraged me to work hard to win my Sri Lanka cap I must congratulate ANCL and the Sunday Observer for keeping the show going for over 40 years. Lake House has taken the lead to help budding schoolboy cricketers. Development of youth is very important as they will be the ones who will take the country forward, he said.
Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-national coach, Marvan Atapattu, was of the view that the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title he won in 1990 was a certification or a guarantee that he would win the national cap. It was prediction to say that I would play for Sri Lanka. When I had been performing well and scoring constantly for Ananda as a schoolboy cricketer, many considered me as a future national prospect. Although I too felt that I had a chance, there was no guarantee. All those who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title before me had gone on to represent Sri Lanka with distinction. So, when I won the title, it gave me the guarantee that the chance opened to join that select band, the former Ananda skipper said.
The worlds highest wicket taker in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan, the 1991 Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winner said the mega awards show means a lot to young cricketers. When I was picked as the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, it gave me lot of satisfaction and highly motivated me. I became an international cricketer through inter-school cricket and the encouragement that I had got as a schoolboy cricketer. Lake House and the Sunday Observer should continue its good work for the benefit of the budding school cricketers, the spin wizard said.
Former Sri Lanka star and the winner of the prestigious award in 1994 and 1995, Thilan Samaraweera said that his progress as an international cricketer was because of the encouragement he had got at school level. The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer awards show motivated us. I won the main award twice, in addition to the Best Batsman and Best All-rounder awards. That was a tremendous boost for us at that level, he said.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer award winner in 2012, Niroshan Dickwella, who is serving in the current Sri Lanka national team, said that he was privileged to step into the big league through the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show. It gives me great pleasure to learn that the contest has lasted for four decades. This has produced a bunch of great cricketers in the All Island and Outstation competitions. Most of the recipients are doing well in their chosen professions may be cricket or otherwise, the former Trinity star player said.
Meanwhile, the voting coupons-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest are being published in the Lake House national newspapers - Sunday Observer, Daily News, Dinamina and Thinakaran. The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Mega Show is sponsored by SLT Mobitel under the blessings of its CEO Nalin Perera.

Jacqueline Fernandez has an interesting line-up of films. She has been shooting with Salman Khan for Race 3 and has also wrapped up major portions of Tarun Mansukhanis Drive. She has made it big without any godfather in the industry.
About her journey and about surviving in Bollywood, Jacqueline said, The minute youre confident about your craft, youll succumb to stupid choices, take on the wrong roles, work with the wrong people or compromise yourself. When youre not self-assured, you believe you can be replaced. So, you end up being a slave to other people. That should never be the case.
She has been linked with Sidharth Malhotra, Arjun Kapoor and Salman Khan in the recent past. However, Jacqueline has always maintained that she is single. Last year, there were reports about a rift in Sidharth and Alias relationship due to his closeness to Jacqueline. Jacqueline spoke to a leading magazine about her love life. The actress who had once dated director Sajid Khan said in an interview that she is not looking to get married.
She said, I dont find the need to settle down. If I find someone good. But if I dont, no one can stop me from having a child. Sometimes, I wonder if I want to bring someone into this world and put them through this.

November exports up 16%
The external sector performance in November 2017 was supported by continued inflows to the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) mainly with higher foreign inflows to the government securities market, and marginally improved earnings from tourism.
Although a double-digit growth in exports has been recorded, partly driven by the low base recorded in November 2016, the trade deficit expanded considerably during the month with higher imports. Meanwhile, workers remittances continued to decline, owing to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions prevailing in the Middle Eastern region. Accordingly, the BOP recorded an overall surplus of around US dollars 2.0 billion by end November 2017.
Gross official reserves also increased to US dollars 7.3 billion (equivalent to 4.2 months of imports) by end November 2017 from US dollars 6.0 billion recorded at end 2016.
The deficit in the trade balance expanded in November 2017, while the trade deficit on a cumulative
Basis also widened during the first eleven months of 2017 in comparison to the value recorded during the corresponding period of the previous year. This was due to higher import expenditure on account of increased expenses on fuel imports.
Exports continued to record a double-digit growth for the fifth consecutive month in November 2017. However, this growth was partly driven by the low base recorded in November 2016. Earnings from textiles and garments exports contributed largely for this growth.
Export earnings from garments increased for the fifth consecutive month in November 2017 with increased demand from the EU and the USA and non-traditional markets such as Australia, Hong Kong and UAE.
Following the restoration of the GSP+ facility, earnings from garment exports to the EU continued to expand, and in November 2017, it grew by 13.8 per cent (year-on-year), while garment exports to the USA increased by 11.9 per cent.
In addition, earnings from seafood exports increased significantly during the month mainly due to increased exports to the EU market reflecting the positive impact of the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market and the restoration of the GSP+ facility.
Reporting the highest monthly value since November 2011, expenditure on imports increased significantly in November 2017. This was due to high expenditure incurred for fuel imports as a result of significant increase in crude oil and refined petroleum products.
Despite the slower than expected improvement in the current account, the financial account of the BOP continued to strengthen during the month of November 2017.
Sri Lankas gross official reserves increased from US dollars 6 billion recorded as at end 2016 to US dollars 7.3 billion by end November 2017, which are sufficient to finance 4.2 months of imports.

OMENTRA.COM defines future of business procurement
Moving in sync with rapid advancements in digital technologies that are remaking business supply chains and transforming how procurement functions deliver value,Omentra.com, the countrys pioneeronline procurement service provider, has driven superior value to a host of local business entities through their solution.
Nadun Kumara, Head of Operations, Omentra.com, outlined their plans for 2018 and gave an insight into thefuture of digital procurement and how organizations need to rethinkin managing their procurement activities.
He stated In the global arena, transactional procurement is becoming more automated and supplier management is becoming more proactive. Many global conglomerates and SMEs have embraced eProcurement systems and cloud-based procurement tools. However, in Sri Lanka, procurement hasnt commanded the same kind of attention or investment.Current procurement policies and tools are geared towards driving a process, with a lot of rigor and controlsversus an experience or outcome. Our solution was aimed at creating an ecosystem of interconnected suppliers for local companies and a streamlined and simplified method that enables swift decision-making in all procurement activities, thereby eliminating the conventional  fire fighting that procurement executives go through.
Nadun continuedthe current solutions we have made available in the local market will be further enriched with additional data sources and the inclusion of category-level key performance indicators (KPIs). The future will entail in guiding category managers through a configurable process that includes every step in the creation of a category strategy. 
He further explained future solutions will additionally offer more sophisticated analyses like bid-comparisons or best-of optimizations, fueled by comprehensive, category-specific bid sheets, templates, and analysis sets. The increased power and ease-of-use of these solutions will significantly drive up the penetration of digitally managed and optimized sourcing events. These advanced procurement systems will be especially useful in the case of large, high-value outsourcing contracts, which are often governed by complex legal frameworks and dozens of individual service line agreements and KPIs. Future systems will automatically extract all these conditions from contracts through machine reading and match them against continuous streams of invoices, supplier activity and performance data. The value here is huge, considering the high level of manual effort currently applied to contract governance
Outlining the current benefits generated through their solution Nadun said it offers the ability to search and get quotes electronically, make comparisons online and have the ability to connect with suppliers digitally.
The system is also interconnected with suppliers to transmit digital POs and invoices, eliminating the need for invoice matching with the receipt of goods and services being automatically tracked.
He added with more services going digital, procurement should be no exception. Therefore, Omentras plans for 2018 will be focused on aligning and expanding our services to match the changes taking place in the global marketplace in digital procurement and making them accessible to Sri Lankan business entities.
In conclusion Nadun commented Whist this industry is still in their infancy, eventually all of the value drivers of digital procurement will ultimately result in higher efficiency per transaction, superior insights leading to better negotiation results and lower risks through improved foresight. This will mean developing new value propositions, meeting new business needs and integrating data across functions and value chains. Most importantly, it will fundamentally reshape the procurement organization and its capabilities to take on the challenges and opportunities of the expanding global digital revolution.

Piano power
The South Bank Centre was turned into a most sublime piano haven when pianists from around the world gathered to display their mastery at the piano and celebrate the music of their favourite composers.
You name them; they were all there in a weeklong celebration.
What matters most is how they stretch the piano's technique in every direction. The walls vibrated in tumultuous figurations of earthy sounds brought together. The refined sensibilities may differ from one player to player to another but they are all masters at the game. One person who caught my imagination was Cedric Tiberghien, the young French-Canadian virtuoso whose blend of boldness was of reasoning and inspiration at such a young age. There was also the young Russian pianist considered potentially as one of the greatest pianist of the 21st century. These two among all others play with unaffected gusto and powerful lyrical impulse. The clarity of texture and the sense of momentum grips each and every pianist each evening as they perform one by one.
The Royal Festival Hall has been on my agenda each time I visit UK and every visit to this citadel of classical music excites me.
I watched and listened to the distinguished pianist, Andreas Haefliger who has come all the way from Switzerland to join in the series. His is a welcome return and auditorium is packed with no seat left. His programme contrasts with the heady Wagner with the classical ethos of Mozart's beautiful sonatas.
They are balanced against the transcendent music of Schubert's Piano Sonata in B flat major. It is described as beautiful, fluent music-making unimpeded by the physical.'
I find Haefliger to be one of music's great communicators because of his richly coloured interpretations of the Romantic repertoire from 19th century. Gentle on the keyboard as Mozart was, the great Master's work flow in languid liquidity through his fingers on to the keyboard. He provides a fresh insight into Mozart's creative genius as well as a romantic air to Schubert's sublime piano music.
Tonight, he is playing Mozart's piano sonatas, Schubert's sonata, and Wagner's sonata. I am wondering why Haefliger opted for Wagner's Isolde's Liebestod when the composer has a tremendous amount of spectacular scores to select from.
RICHARD WAGNER (1813-1883) No composer has had so much written about him, no one man has had an influence on the course of his art before or since. He was genius, philosopher, a man of letters and a first class conductor apart from being a key composer in history. But Wagner was arrogant and treated his contemporaries with utter contempt. They included great Masters like Verdi and Bach. Wagner's TRISTAN UND ISOLDE (1856-1859) is played tonight. This is a psychological music drama of great importance. ISOLDE'S LIEBESTOD from TRISTAN means (love-death) and is the final name given to Isolda's last and ecstatic declaration of love. On piano, S.447.
FRANZ SCHUBERT (1797 - 1828) Gentle and mild just like his composing, this great of orchestral, chamber and piano music and wrote about twenty sonatas. His symphonies were well received on strings as well and popular in all concert halls with a multitude of sonatas and piano works, Haefliger settled for Piano sonata in B flat, D 960 (1825).
This sonata and other were written in quick succession in the last weeks of Schubert's life. Composed in less than four weeks, they are among the greatest of his works and today, The Royal Festival Hall is paying tribute to this wondrous Master.
WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART (1756-1791) There has never been a child prodigy to match Mozart who died very young at thirty five years of age. Had he lived more, one will not be able to count his music or pack them into a single book or for that matter, a multitude of CDs.
A prolific writer of Romantic music, he became the greatest composer of his day, the finest conductor, pianist, organist, and violinist in Europe. A walking encyclopedia of musicology, no one can match his genius.
Every one adores his music and he is priority on their lists. I need an ocean full of ink and a create of pens to write about his works and no wonder I waited patiently for Haefliger to take on Mozart's Piano Sonata in C.K. 330 and in A.K. 331/00.
They are precious jewels, sparkling and radiantly played. There is hush; I can feel the breathing of those around me. Such is the silence and when it was over, there was a thunderous applause, calling Haefliger to play more Mozart and he did. I think the audience is still not satisfied.
As I rose from my seat to mingle with the crowd streaming out, I was thinking of having Mozart for dinner. He was so full in my mind.
DAY No. 3. If I had Mozart for dinner last night, there were more waiting on the keyboard next day. Chopin had been celebrated over the bicentenary few weeks before by one of UK's nest interpreters, Krystian Zimerman and sad I missed the Chopin series.
The cool breeze outside reminded me of the advent of summer. Little buds swaying upon the bough created the magic of classical music that waited within the portals of the South Bank Centre as the strain of music brush passed all who made their way in. As I took my seat, it was Paul Lewis at the keyboard. His profound interpretation of the Viennese classics stood at awesome range and testified by his award-wining Schubert Sonata series.
He also played Schumann's FANTASLE in C and Liszt's Vellee d'obermann. That was Paul Lewis the celebrated British pianist.
In the next couple of hours, Haydn took centre stage followed by Mozart, Debussy and Mussorgsky among them what I loved most was Chopin's two NOCTURNES Op 48. As the last note faded off, came down the early showers with raindrops making their own classical melodies. The atmosphere was so vibrant and spectacular that people paused in the foyer braving the winds.
