Bay of Bengal countries should merger for prosperity
The Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, highlighted the need for integration of the Bay of Bengal (BOB) countries for common prosperity under a rule-based framework.
He made these views delivering the key note speech at Trincomalee Consultations - 2018, which was conducted by the Pathfinder Foundations Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives recently in Colombo.
The event, convened in collaboration with two New Delhi based think tanks Carnegie India and Vivekananda International Foundation, was sponsored by Japan. The theme of the conference was A Secure and Safe Bay of Bengal for Common Development and Prosperity.
The Indian economy is going to continue to grow fast. The asymmetry between India and its neighbors is going to increase. In such a context it's in the interest of the smaller country to have a rules based framework within which trade, investment etc. take place. Because if you dont have those rules, given the size of the Indian economy, given the rate of growth India is going to record, it will be a much more untidy and potentially more disruptive process, if you don't have a rules based framework to govern the bilateral relationship between the two countries.
The governor also emphasised that it's not often understood that rules based frameworks are actually the protection for small and vulnerable countries. According to the governor, there is a strong rationale for putting this bilateral relationship, whether its Sri Lanka, Nepal or Bangladesh, Bhutan or Myanmar, with a much larger player in the region, within a rules based framework.
Speaking on Trincomalee, the governor said that if the BOB region takes off, the strategic importance of Trincomalee which has been known for millennia would be reinforced even further.
Not only just the port which is very well placed as a hub for the BOB region but also the hinterland around Trincomalee can be developed whereby it can become an engine of growth not only for Sri Lanka but for the broader region as well.
Coomaraswamy also urged that it is high time to come up with a proper mechanism to grasp emerging opportunities in the Bay of Bengal region.
To this end, it is pertinent to negotiate effectively to make sure that national interests of each countries are pursued vigorously within a corporate of framework, the governor pointed out. (IH)

Civilians hold over 1,000 licensed pistols
Defence Ministry Additional Secretary N.D. Panditharatna says civilians hold about 1,300 licensed pistols.
He said 19,000 shotguns were issued to the farmers to protect their harvest from wild animals. He said the Ministry had not estimated how many gun holders had taken licences for 2018.
Nearly 1,000 illegal firearms including pistols and shotguns were handed over to the Ministry by the general public during the amnesty, he said.
Panditharatna said the pistol used by a MPs wife to threaten a private bus driver at the recent Battaramulla incident had not been licensed for 2018.
The Additional Secretary said he did not know the exact number of firearms that the civilian hold. The Defence Ministry does not have the exact figures and relevant details, he said.

Need for good statistics and statisticians for good governance
There are three ways that statistics and statisticians can play a role in good governance, said Professor in Applied Statistics, Chairman, Academic & Training Committee, IASSL and Head of Mathematics Department, University of Moratuwa, Prof. T S G Peiris.
He was speaking at the Institute of Applied Statistics Sri Lanka (IASSL) third International Statistics Conference 2017, under the theme of Statistics for Good Governance.
The event was jointly organized in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), USA and the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa (UoM), Sri Lanka and National Science Foundation (NSF) of Sri Lanka at the Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo.
The IASSL is the only professional body for statistics and has a close relationship with the American Statics Association (ASA).
First thing is necessity for good data as major role of statisticians is to ensuring that data collected for use in policy decisions is of high quality. Collecting massive amounts of data has become easy. Collecting good data remains difficult.
Knowing the difference is crucial for good governance, and is something statisticians are equipped to help evaluate.
The second role of the statisticians is to educate people, ranging from politicians and policy-makers to the general public, on appropriate use and interpretation of data and statistical studies.
The last thing is that the statisticians can play a major role in improving statistical methods for more efficient and accurate data collection and analysis. Data collection and analysis methods need updating to keep pace with changes in society and advances in technology.
Now more than ever, the world is driven by data. Businesses, economies, and entire countries depend, for their success, on its reliability and how accurately it is interpreted. The risk of misinterpretation and misuse, however, is high.
According to Professor Pieris, statistics are versatile and used by many persons and most of users misuse statistics or misinterpret the statistical results.
If the correct inferences are not derived from the statistics, the decision may be wrong and ultimate blame goes to the planner, but not to person who derive wrong information.
Therefore, IASSL is organizing short courses, workshop and diploma in applied statistics leading to charted statistician.
He further emphasized though various degree are offered by private universities in Sri Lanka no degrees are offered in statistics or mathematics by private universities.
The keynote speaker was immediate past president of the ASA, Prof. (Mrs) Jessica Utts, University of California, USA.
The objectives of the conference was to discuss new approaches and methodological tools directed towards improving statistical information towards decision making and good coherence, strengthen the coordination of regional and international initiatives aimed at improving statistical analyses and foster the development of effective and efficient official statistical services.

You dont replace Muhammad Ali - Coe blasts Bolt obsession
GOLD COAST, Sunday: World athletics chief Sebastian Coe blasted the obsession with Usain Bolt as track and field entered its new era without the Jamaican showman at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday.
Coe said there was no shortage of athletics talent for the Games, the first major competition since Bolt's retirement last year left the sport with a void to fill.
This obsession with..., said Coe, before stopping himself and adding: There are plenty of athletes around.
Are we going to replace Usain Bolt Probably not, because you don't replace Muhammad Ali.
But Marvin Hagler and Manny Pacquiao and (Julio Cesar) Chavez and the great boxers came through.
Bolt, the eight-time Olympic champion and 2014 Commonwealth relay gold-medallist, would have been the star attraction and a certain crowd-puller at the Gold Coast.
The competition is also missing world champion hurdler Sally Pearson, a Gold Coast resident and the face of the Games, after she pulled out with an Achilles injury.
Jamaican sprinters Yohan Blake and Elaine Thompson, and Shaunae Miller of the Bahamas now shape as the main athletes to watch during the eight-day athletics programme.
Usain under any set of circumstances has driven our sport and that's a high-class problem to have, and he will remain engaged, said Coe.
But don't construe the fact that we don't have Usain as suddenly we've lost a generation of talent. It's there.
Australia's Dane Bird-Smith and Jemima Montag won the men's and women's race walks as the athletics competition got underway, with the men's hammer and 5,000m finals due later on Sunday.
Elsewhere in Gold Coast, Punam Yadav grabbed India's fifth weightlifting title in the women's 69kg class while Indian shooter Manu Bhaker won the women's 10m air pistol.

19572017 Celebrating 60 years of friendship
Sri Lanka, which established diplomatic ties with the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in 1957, commemorated 60 years of friendship, collaboration and trade (in 2017) with a coffee table book marking the important junctures of this historic relationship.
This pictorial from the pages of the book, depicts a few of those moments of this six-decade-long friendship.
In the introduction, Sri Lankan Ambassador to China, Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku, who with the Embassy staff decided to publish the commemorative volume, points out that Sri Lanka was the first South Asian country to accept the One China Policy in 1950 and in 1952 came forward to sign the historical Rubber-Rice Agreement with China during a critical time where the former was facing a UN embargo. This was the first trade agreement that was signed by China with a non-Communist country, and it has been renewed over 30 years, making it perhaps one of the longest effective trade agreements between any two countries.
In the 21st century, the relationship between the two countries is of critical importance, as Dr. Kodituwakku noted, considering Sri Lankas key position in Chinas One Belt One Road initiative.
President Xi Jinping, when he responded to the Sri Lankan Prime Minister at the recent Belt and Road International Forum, said, Sri Lanka was known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, but from now onwards, it would become the Pearl of the Maritime Silk Road.

ADB initiates plan for Colombo-Trincomalee  Economic Corridors
In keeping with the Sri Lankan governments development strategy, Vision 2025, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has initiated a comprehensive development plan for the Colombo-Trincomalee Economic Corridor (CTEC) to address some of the development challenges faced by the country.
An economic corridor development plan with a potential to generate 1.2 million new jobs by 2030 is also being proposed by a recent study of the ADB.
The corridor development plan seeks to address regional imbalances in the country through regional development and by extending the strengths of the Western Region to the other end of the CTEC and along the corridor. Trincomalees proximity to potential transport gateways and position as a key tourist attraction can be leveraged to establish it as a complementary location to Colombo on the eastern end of CTEC and along the corridor. The node shows potential for emerging as a hub for light manufacturing. The nurtured development of Trincomalee will balance the corridors growth by increasing the competitiveness of the eastern part of the corridor, which will help to address regional imbalances in the country.
Pilot economic corridor development initiatives will focus on an east-west corridor that can flourish by taking advantage of existing international gateways, such as the Bandaranaike International Airport and Colombo Port, which are located at the western end of the corridor. The proposed Central Expressway, which is about 280 kilometers long, will act as the spine of the corridor.
An influence area of 50 kilometers on either side has been selected, which cuts across 6 provinces and 10 districts. The districts in the influence area cover 42% of Sri Lankas total area, account for 58% of the total population and contribute 86% to industrial output.
To implement the economic corridor, it is necessary to identify economic centers that can be prioritized for development and made ready for attracting investments, said Utsav Kumar, ADBs Country Economist for Sri Lanka. This will help channel valuable resources in a focused manner, thus maximizing the potential benefits of the corridor. Aligning them with existing transport spines helps generate synergies that further boost the potential of the corridor.
The right mix of industries needs to be promoted in order to develop effective and efficient production clusters along the corridor. Acknowledging Sri Lankas competitiveness in traditionally strong sectors such as apparel, food processing, and rubber and rubber products, the study proposes to build on existing strengths by upgrading the performance of these sectors as well as to focus on identifying newer sectors in which Sri Lanka can improve internal competencies and diversify into other sectors.

All fiction is crime fiction
In this episode, V.V. Ganeshananthan and Whitney Terrell examine the omnipresent American comfort narrative of mystery and crime fiction. Why do we love crime stories so much How do they shape the way we think about a whole host of real-world issues from the Mueller investigation to Black Lives Matter and the shootings of young black men by police They are joined for this discussion by Mat Johnson, author of the novels Loving Day, Pym, Drop, and Hunting in Harlem, the nonfiction novella The Great Negro Plot, and the graphic novels Incognegro and Dark Rain.
Mat Johnson: The mystery form is the fundamental structure of contemporary storytelling, and the mystery comes out of the European Enlightenment and the idea that you can look at chaos and by applying your intellect you can come to an understanding through reason as opposed to just saying, God did it, right But it has a direct impact on the story.
The first story starts with Edgar Allan Poes The Murders in the Rue Morgue and builds on that with Sherlock Holmes. But if you break down the mystery story, where you start with the conflict, and you try to solve that conflict and your initial attempt fails because the most obvious person didnt do it or the storys over, so you have to go through these pages of research. And by going through this research you build other experiences, you get other information, and then you come to a different understanding, that instead of it being A, it turns out it was B. Thats basically the structure for most contemporary novels. Even the loosest sense, if you have the most abstract novel, youre still compiling information as you go through the piece until the end, where you reach some sort of larger understanding. So, I think that the way we think about story is already based on the mystery.
Whitney Terrell: Right.
MJ: But if you look before the Enlightenment, Beowulf does not fit that way of thinking. The Iliad does not fit that way of thinking. So, its kind of like mainlining story. You add on to that that we live in a society where most people follow the rules, and many of us may consider a crime at different points. But even more than considering crime, I think we consider the consequences of a crime. Like, What would happen if I did this So, to watch people just break societal norms in a very direct way, is incredibly fulfilling. Whether watching that documentary Wild Wild Country about the Ashram in Oregon or listening to Serial, the podcast, or any of the other true crime things, I think were fascinated by those moments because they in themselves are interesting. But they also end up saying so much about how we think about the world.
V.V. Ganeshananthan: I never really thought of all stories as mysteries, but I suppose they are. I gave a lecture on conflict to a bunch of undergrads, and I was giving them an old Frank Conroy analogy, which is: your reader is a person climbing a mountain with a bag, and theyre collecting rocks of information, and if they get to the top and theyre carrying rocks they dont need, they feel angry that theyve been carrying weight they dont need. WT: My students are going to love that because I use that one all the time.

APL opens new office premises in Colombo
APL reaffirmed its commitment to contribute to Sri Lankas regional hub ambitions as the global ocean carrier inaugurated its new office premises in the business centre of Colombo.
APL, which celebrates 170 years of global shipping in 2018, said that Sri Lankas neighbouring economies such as Bangladesh and India that trans-ship significant cargo volumes via Colombo have continued to grow robustly, auguring well for Sri Lankas prospects as an Indian Ocean hub.
Colombo began container operations with APL when vessel SS President Tyler first berthed in Queen Elizabeth Quay (QEQ) in December 1973. Having served Sri Lanka for the last 45 years, APL expressed its commitment to keep sailing this voyage with Sri Lanka as she pursues Vision 2025; and builds her new port city to promote the country as a trading hub.
Sri Lankas Vision 2025 involves a trade policy revamp to enable an export-driven economy; and port infrastructure and services expansion to capture the growing trans-shipment trade across production networks in the East and markets in the West.
Customers at the new office
As a global carrier, APL will support the course by facilitating market connectivity through reliable shipping services and solutions.
Today, APL offers six weekly mainline services including the Far East Express 6 (FX6), China India Express (CIX) and Pendulum Loop 1 (PE1) services among others. FX6 links Sri Lanka to the key European ports of Rotterdam, Felixstowe and Hamburg. CIX connects Colombo to Central China, South China, Singapore and the Indian ports of Nhava Sheva and Pipavav. Meanwhile, PE1 offers an extensive coverage across Southeast Asia before calling Colombo and then bound for the U.S. East Coast.
Going the extra mile for shippers, the carrier also pledges to elevate customer service experience through active engagements. In fact, APL was recently lauded as the 'Best Carrier for Customer Service in the Trans-Pacific Trade Lane' at the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers' 24th Award Ceremony in Sri Lanka.
This award marks a vote of recognition for APLs service excellence by customers and peers in the industry.
Sri Lanka sits strategically in the middle of the Indian Ocean and the Maritime Silk Road, making her a critical gateway for an efficient cargo flow within and beyond the Indian Subcontinent.
Sri Lanka remains an important market for APLs development in the Indian Subcontinent where APL has also started commercial operations in Maldives in March this year.

Bayern overcome bizarre own goal to clinch another title
BERLIN, Saturday - Bayern Munich clinched a sixth successive Bundesliga title with five games to spare on Saturday by winning 4-1 win at Augsburg despite falling behind to a bizarre own goal.
Bayerns celebrations looked in danger of being delayed when the ball went into their net off their own defender Niklas Suele. However, Corentin Tolisso and James Rodriguez replied for the Bavarians before halftime before Arjen Robben and Sandro Wagner put the finishing touches in the second half.
Bayern, who have 72 points from 29 games, moved 20 ahead of Schalke 04, who later lost 3-2 to lowly Hamburg SV.
It was a remarkable personal achievement for Bayerns 72-year-old coach Jupp Heynckes, who came out of retirement in October to replace Carlo Ancelotti for his fourth stint at the club with Bayern five points off the pace.
He led them to 19 wins in 22 Bundesliga matches on his way to claiming a fourth Bundesliga title as coach, all with Bayern.
Id like to send my best wishes to Carlo Ancelotti in Italy, said Heynckes. This title is also for him. He is a fantastic coach.
Defender Jerome Boateng, under no pressure, lost control of the ball and was dispossessed by Sergio Cordova leaving the Venezuelan with only Sven Ulreich to beat.
Cordovas shot was blocked by the Bayern goalkeeper but ricocheted off the hapless Sueles face and into the net.
Bayern equalised out of the blue when Tolisso was left unmarked to head in from Joshua Kimmichs cross in the 32nd minute and the Bavarians took the game by the scruff of the neck.
Rodriguez slipped the ball home from Juan Bernats clever backheel six minutes later and the Colombian also set up Robben for the third when he hooked the ball back from the touchline just after the hour.
Bayern, who have won 28 German titles altogether, had eased up by then but there was still time for Sandro Wagner to score a fourth in the 86th minute.
Augsburg dominated the first half-hour and took an 18th-minute lead with one of the oddest goals Bayern have conceded for a long time.
HAMBURG LIFELINE
Hamburg, the only-ever present club in the Bundesligas 55-year history, moved off the bottom of the table and handed themselves a lifeline when Aaron Hunts 30-metre strike in the 84th minute gave them the points against Schalke.
Naldo headed Schalke into an early lead before Filip Kostic, and Lewis Holtby put Hamburg in front. Guido Burgstaller then swept home a rebound to equalise just after the hour.
Hamburg, 17th in the 18-team table, were replaced at the bottom by Cologne who were held 1-1 at home by Mainz 05 in a relegation dogfight.
Jonas Hector gave Cologne an early lead but Pablo de Blasis levelled five minutes into the second half for Mainz who are in 16th place, the relegation playoff spot, with 27 points.
Hamburg are still five points adrift of Mainz with Cologne a further point behind.
Bruno Labbadia claimed his first win since taking over at VfL Wolfsburg when they beat Freiburg 2-0 away with two goals from Daniel Didavi.
The win moved the Wolves two points clear of Mainz 05 and only one behind Freiburg, who are still not out of the woods.
Thorgan Hazard scored two second half goals, the second from a penalty, to give Borussia Moenchengladbach a 2-1 win over Hertha Berlin after Salomon Kalou had put the visitors in front.

## Title: Best time of the day to work out

Best time of the day to work out
Working out shouldn't feel like a chore, but with dozens of variables to nail down before hitting the gym, it certainly can. Did you remember to eat before your spin class Did you pack the right shoes in your gym bag Did you get enough sleep the night before
But there's one thing you can get right about your workout: the timing.
Some research suggests it's best to sweat it out early in the morning on an empty stomach to help speed weight loss and boost energy levels; other studies conclude that squeezing in your fitness routine later in the day, once your body is naturally warmed up, is a better idea.
Chris Jordan, an exercise physiologist who created the viral Johnson & Johnson Official 7-Minute Workout  a fitness routine that combines the benefits of strength training and cardio for a full-body burn  takes a slightly different approach.
"The best time of day to work out is the time you're most likely to work out," Jordan told Business Insider. Jordan, who has worked as a fitness consultant for the US Air Force in Europe and is now the director of exercise physiology at the Johnson & Johnson Human Performance Institute, said he experimented with various timing windows for his fitness routine before settling on afternoons.
He said afternoons worked the best not only for his schedule  which is jam-packed with work and playing with his 4-year-old  but for his body, which can feel stiff first thing in the morning.
"What I like about working out in the afternoon is that I'm loose, I'm not typically as tired, and my muscles aren't stiff like they sometimes are in the morning," Jordan said. "Plus, it's a great break, and I get so much energy afterward."
Morning vs. afternoon workouts
If you're partial to working out early in the day, however, there's great news for you: Some studies suggest that an early-morning workout on an empty stomach helps speed weight loss and boost energy levels by priming the body for an all-day fat burn.
Exercising first thing in the morning may push the body to tap into its fat reserves for fuel instead of simply "burning off" the most recent snack or meal.
Plus, working out early could mean you get more sunlight  something that's key to setting your body's internal circadian rhythm. One study found that people who basked in bright sunlight within two hours after waking tended to be thinner and better able to manage their weight than those who didn't get any natural light, regardless of what they ate throughout the day.
"There are some pros and cons with whatever time you choose," Jordan said. "Maybe you're a bit sluggish in the morning, but if you choose that time, then at least it's done for the day, and you're not going to skip it when unexpected things come up."
The most important thing about a fitness routine is that you're able to stick with it. Whether that means waking up at the crack of dawn to hit the track or cutting out of the office for an hour or two in the afternoons matters less than how well it jibes with your schedule.
"If you need to plan ahead, plan ahead  schedule it," Jordan said. "The most important thing is to do it on a consistent basis."

## Title: A boost for FDI
## Supertitle:

A boost for FDI
Foreign investors look for two key factors before committing their hard earned funds to any country  political and economic stability. The dust has now settled on the No-Confidence Motion brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and a new Cabinet is likely this week. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are committed to continue the National Unity Government until 2020. This will no doubt ensure political stability.
The Government has also ensured economic stability. The Rupees slide has more or less been arrested, the Colombo Stock Exchange is performing well and many mega development projects are underway. There is more good news - Sri Lanka has recorded its highest ever Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in 2017 amounting to US$ 1.913 billion rising by a sharp 138% compared to inflows of US$ 802 million in 2016, the Central Bank confirmed on Friday.
The infrastructure sector saw the maximum FDI inflow of 61%, while investments into the manufacturing sector comprising 20% and 19% in services. The highest FDI came from China, followed by Hong Kong, India and Singapore. Sri Lanka is targeting to achieve US$2.5 bn in 2018 and US$5 billion by 2020 in FDI as work on developing several new export promotion zones has been initiated.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is essential for any developing country to strengthen the economy and create jobs. Sri Lanka, which liberalized its economy exactly 41 years ago, is known as a premier investment destination in South Asia. There is intense competition for FDI among developing nations. This is why Sri Lanka must offer the right projects and the right investment climate for foreign investors. In other words, our product must be unique and different.
Sri Lanka now has a great opportunity to reinvigorate its FDI prospects thanks to a slew of foreign investment projects led by the US$ 1.1 billion Hambantota Port. Sri Lanka needs enhanced investments for economic growth for which there are no short cuts. It is also vital for the domestic private sector to be more robust for growth to pick up.
Creating a climate conducive to investments is very important. The Board of Investment (BoI) was established with this aim in mind, but even the BoI has not been able to totally eliminate the copious amount of red tape involved. Some investors, driven from pillar to post, have left the country and taken their investments to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. This aspect should be addressed and investors should get a seamless experience from the time they come in with the proposal to the opening of their FDI project(s).
There was one other hidden factor that had driven investors away  corruption. Many foreign investment projects launched during the previous Governments tenure were grossly overestimated, with the additional amount reflecting the corruption element. There should be no room for corruption at any level in the approval process for FDI.
Foreign investment should not be considered as a panacea for all ills. Sometimes all we need to have are better managed enterprises, public or private. There is no debate that certain loss-making and debt-ridden state-owned enterprises should be restructured and streamlined to serve the public in a better way. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are also an ideal solution. The authorities should explore PPPs in transport, utilities, ports, tourism, construction, housing, health care, financial services, information technology and mining and minerals sector.
Sri Lanka should seek more foreign investments in the power and energy sector, given the imperative need to phase out thermal power and rely more on renewable energy. Fossil fuels, with the exception of coal, are generally expected to run out in the next 100 years. In this backdrop, several alternative energy projects have already been announced by the Government. Concessions and incentives should be granted to local and foreign investors who seek to implement wind, solar and even ocean wave energy projects. This will help reduce the massive fuel import bill which exceeds US$ 6 billion a year.
Many countries face myriad challenges in attracting FDI due to the volatile global economic conditions. These issues relating to FDI will be addressed at the three-day mega global event, Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) that takes place at the Dubai World Trade Centre on April 9-11, 2018.
The conference will focus on: Driving sustainable development through FDI; investment in the Fourth Industrial Revolution; how technology is changing the future of productivity and growth; public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects, Sovereign Wealth and Private Equity Funds and their role in investment.
The AIM is being held at an opportune time, given that global investment is seeing a bumpy recovery as worldwide FDI flows reached US$ 1.52 trillion in 2017. According to the World Investment Report published by the United Nations Council on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), FDI to developing economies such as Sri Lanka remained stable, at an estimated $653 billion, two percent more than the previous year. Sri Lanka must position itself as a gateway to South Asia and indeed, Asia itself to secure a bigger slice of this global investment pie.

Cabinet reshuffle before New Year
A Cabinet reshuffle will be made before the Sinhala and Hindu New Year as agreed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday evening, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
He said that during the same meeting between a group of UNP members led by the Premier and the President on Saturday to discuss the future activities of the government, the UNPers demanded the latter to remove the 16 SLFP Cabinet Ministers, State and other Deputy Ministers who voted for the No Confidence Motion against the Premier in Parliament last week, from their positions in the government since they had no moral right to remain in those positions of which the head is the Prime Minister.
He made these observations during a press conference held at his official residence in Colombo 7.
Minister Kariyawasam further said that the President said that he would meet the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Central Committee on Monday (today) and would discuss the matter there and keep the UNP informed of their decision on those members.
Queried by the media on the division ratio between the UNP and the SLFP, of the 16 ministries that is to be removed, Minister Kariyawasam said that it had to be considered following the SLFP Central Committee meeting today.
The UNP is looking forward to see those 16 being removed from their ministerial portfolios, Minister Kariyawasam said. So the UNP officially informed the President that we are unable to work with the SLFP Ministers who voted for the No-Confidence Motion moved against the Premier, the Minister said.
He also said according to his learning that the 16 SLFP members were ready to resign except for two, that is Minister S.B.Dissanayake and Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara. I heard them say that they would act on the instructions of the President, Minister Kariyawasam said.
He said further that the Prime Minister further instructed the UNP backbencher Parliamentarians to withdraw their No-Confidence Motion that they handed over to the Speaker last week against Ministers S.B.Dissanayake, W.D.J.Seneviratne, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Susil Premajayantha, Chandima Weerakkody, Dayasiri Jayasekara and Dpeuty Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala as it was not a decision of the party.

## Title: The chimerical creatures of Unica Zrn

The chimerical creatures of Unica Zrn
In 1970, after over a decade of intermittent hospitalization for mental illness, Unica Zrn committed suicide by jumping out the window of the apartment of her longtime companion, the Surrealist artist Hans Bellmer.
Zrn is best known as the author of anagrammatic poetry and the semi-biographical novellas Dark Spring and The Man of Jasmine, but she was also a visual artist. She had a preternatural skill for creating phantasmagorical worlds. Her pen-and-ink drawings were exhibited at galleries throughout Paris and Berlin, and she participated in the 1959 International Surrealist Exhibition. Her artistic practice, often eclipsed by that of her husband, confounds her literary legacy.
Zrn was born in 1916 and raised in the Grnewald suburb of Berlin. Her fathera writer, editor, and cavalry officer whom she adoredwas frequently absent, and she detested her mother and older brother. In Dark Spring, she alludes to suffering verbal and emotional abuse from her mother and being raped by her brother. When she finished school, she began working for Germanys national film company, Universum Film AG.
Losing custody
She claimed to know nothing about the violence being committed by the Nazis until 1942, when she heard an underground radio broadcast describing the conditions of the concentration camps. That same year, at the age of twenty-six, she married Erich Laupenmhlen, a much older wealthy man who worked for Leitz Cameras, manufacturer of the Leica camera. Seven years later, they divorced, and because she had no money to pay for a lawyer or to provide for her children, she lost custody.
In 1953, while working as a freelance writer for West Berlin newspapers, she attended an exhibition of Bellmers work at Galerie Springer. Shortly after, she abandoned her freelance writing in Berlin (her final radio play aired in 1954) and moved with Bellmer to Paris. There they lived a largely reclusive life in various hotels. She became pregnant multiple times, but never again gave birth. Zrn endured many back-alley abortions during her second marriage.
With Bellmer as her entre, Zrn met Pariss leading Surrealists. She began experimenting with anagrammatic poetry and automatic drawing, in which the artists hand moves freely across the page in an attempt to express the unconscious. In 1954, she produced Hextentexte (Witches Writings), an illustrated manuscript consisting of five drawings and corresponding anagrams.
Zrn had a sophisticated conception of the relationship between words and images. One drawing, accompanying a text titled Wir leben den Tod (We Love Death), portrays a sprightly creature with an alligator-like beak, marching in profile, its body covered in highly detailed patterns. Another drawing depicts a flying creature with multiple wings and thin, scaly armsit looks like the animal kingdoms equivalent to an antiquated airplane. The anagramsfilled with motifs of death, love, and sorrowinvest the images with a sense of melancholy. At the same time, the chimerical creaturesrendered in black India inkinvest the writing with an ineffable joy.
Clouds of smoke
In Oracles and Spectacles, an unpublished book of drawings and anagrams from the 1960s, Zrns filigree lines form interconnected faces, dizzying swirls of human and cephalopod-like bodies that billow through the picture plane like clouds of smoke. She employs the Surrealist practice of automatic drawing, but her gossamer line work and fantastical flourishes evoke decorative motifs of Art Nouveau and grotesqueries. In her personal life, Zrn located her sense of identity in her relationships with others, particularly men. She embraced Bellmers dominance: the original manuscript of her novel The Man of Jasmine attributes authorship to the wife of Hans Bellmer. She fell passionately enamored of the Surrealist writer Henri Michaux, whom she saw as the embodiment of the original man of Jasmine, a recurring figure from her childhood dreams whom she describes as her image of love. According to the art historian and literary critic Mary Ann Caws, Zrn once said, I always need a companion to tell me what to do  They just have to say, Now you do this, now you do that.
In The Man of Jasmine, she describes an anonymous someone traveling through the body of the narrator, modeled in her image, and turning it into his home. This sense of housing an other echoes her feeling of being divided between two rolesthat of the artist and that of the passive muse. The Trumpets of Jericho, her most sophisticated and novelistic anagrammatic work, begins with an unwanted pregnancy and a rejected baby. Here, repulsion simmers beneath the surface of creation. The child, the product of one of seven possible lovers, is deformed and monstrous, a hideous creature. Yet his birth gives rise to a dreamlike fantasy recounted through fluid prose poetry.

## Title: Chivalry
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Chivalry
Many entrepreneurs and bosses believe that chivalry is dead. And they may certainly know what they are talking about. That is because they have been at the butt end of boorish behaviour by either colleagues or business professionals they deal with. Just this week I spoke to a young woman business executive, named Shanthini, who seemed miffed by a male colleagues ill-mannered conduct.
And I dont believe anyone could have blamed her. Now just picture this episode and you will certainly endorse her statement. Shanthini and her marketing executive colleague Anthony were on their way to a business meeting with a client.
When entering the glass doors to the clients office, Anthony pushes the heavy door open and barges his way through first. He does not consider that his female colleague is just a step behind him. Without any concern for his fellow worker he releases the door which promptly closes in the young womans face.
As expected, Shanthini is quite upset at Anthonys obvious lack of manners. Clearly, Anthony a young executive ambitiously attempting to claw his way to the top has displayed callous disregard for conduct expected of a gentleman. As a high-flying managerial prospect did he not realise that it is customary for a gentleman to not only open any door for a lady, but to respectfully usher her through before making his own way in As a matter of fact, whoever reaches a door first, irrespective of gender, needs to hold the door open for the person behind. It is such a simple task and yet so many of us fail to do it.
Anthony is a far cry from the noble Sir Walter Raleigh who flung his cloak over a puddle so that Queen Elizabeth 1 would not muddy her dainty feet. Not that he was expected to stoop to such deeds of gallantry at any event. But the art of being a gentleman is not as simple and well defined as it used to be during Elizabethan times.
So let us revert to the question that haunts the convention of ethics in family, community, business, and personal relationships. It is right to ask ourselves, whether chivalry is really dead. Many entrepreneurs think so. More significantly, do we display chivalry in our business, courtesy in expression, and generosity in activity Courtesy, generosity, and a chivalrous attitude must survive if commerce is to be carried out smoothly, if deals are to be made and relationships are to be maintained.
Yes certainly, rude behaviour is on the rise posing a hazard to businesses both big and small. There is a high price one has to pay for this incivility, because it can damage business prospects to a great extent. Worse still it can wipe out an enterprise altogether.
How many times have we been met with rudeness, poor customer service, a lack of political correctness, or improper etiquette I am certain we all have, at one time or another. And, as a result, as you are obviously aware we resolve never to return. Yet, because we dont speak out or report the incident, the problem persists, creating an environment in which a lack of respect, courtesy, and customer service flourish.
It should be the responsibility of every management to provide training resources if they expect their enterprises to succeed. Training in consulting services, productivity and efficiency is no doubt important. But more important is the one that is becoming a lost art in todays business world. That tool is the everyday practice of common professional courtesy.
To be sure, there is a tremendous amount of pressure in todays business world, particularly in the harsh economic environment we are all dealing with. Pressure may be a reason for a lack of courtesy, but it is certainly no excuse for it. In fact in the turbulent market we are facing professional courtesy is more important than ever. There are many examples of a lack of courtesy in the workplace, some of which we have all been guilty of at one time or another.
It all comes down to being respectful of peoples time and valuing it as much as you do your own. Returning phone calls and emails, particularly if you reached out to someone and asked them for something, is an acknowledgment that their time is as important as yours and that you appreciate their efforts. Other things, like focusing on proper introductions, handshakes and greetings, convey respect for peers, clients, and business associates, and go a long way in cultivating other peoples image of you in the workplace.
Everyone, and that includes the customer, the staff and the entrepreneur, must take personal responsibility in demanding the restitution of those attributes that have been lost or thought to be dead. And that means chivalry in the workplace and in business.
Any entrepreneurs essential code of conduct and practice is to be kind, polite, customer friendly and responsible for civility in the business that he/she runs. It is important that we consider the needs of the customer and that we treat others as we would want to be treated. When someone is rude or acts completely out of character, refuse to partake in the incivility or to respond with like sentiment.
It is unacceptable and rudeness should be politely acknowledged and filtered through a courteous response that signifies the entrepreneurs creed of character, morals, and values. Good manners open doors that degrees, position and money cannot. As entrepreneurs, learning the importance of interpersonal skills based on courtesy, knowledge, and respect for others can generate opportunities, build relationships, and create a solid customer base.
Chivalry isnt dead, nor should any business owner or customer allow it to be.
Courtesy is a very important act of expression in a business setting. Smother people with politeness and kindness. Use your words generously to everyone around you. To be courteous is to be liked and remembered. These are two things that every business wants for who will buy from a place they dislike or couldnt remember.
Be courteous in words and in actions to generate a positive force that everyone will be attracted to. People are attracted by positive energy like a moth to a flame and your etiquette will be the generator and motivator for people to come to you. In business, courtesy is too important to ignore and those who do will be cast out eventually.
In a business world full of stress and pressure, a little professional courtesy can be a key to your success. And the good news is that the ability to be courteous is in all of us . We may have set it aside for a while, but we can reinstate it and practice it just as easily! [emailprotected]

Clarke offers to play for Australia after ball scandal
SYDNEY, Sunday - Retired cricket Test captain Michael Clarke on Sunday offered to play for Australia for free to help the team recover after the downfall of his successor Steve Smith over a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
Smith and vice-captain David Warner were stripped of their leadership roles and banned from the sport for one year after a plot to alter the ball's condition during the third Test in March.
I would do anything to help the Australian cricket team, the 37-year-old told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph.
Age is age. Is 17 too young I've never cared about age. Brad Hogg played at 45. I don't think it's about a number. I think it's about commitment and devotion.
It's like getting back on a bike. I'm as fit and healthy as I've ever been. The time away has been great for my body.
The former batsman, who is in India to cover the IPL and comments on the sport for Australia's Nine Network, said he had messaged Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland but had not received a reply.
The ex-skipper retired in 2015 after his 115th and final Test of the Ashes series against England and said his experience could be useful for the embattled team either on or off the field.
I've experienced a lot of great things in cricket but some tough times as well, he told the newspaper. I've got the experience to help these young players and that's where our focus should be right now until the other guys come back. Smith, Warner and bowler Cameron Bancroft -- who was banned for nine months -- decided not to challenge their sanctions imposed by CA last week. This means Smith and Warner will not be eligible to play for Australia until March next year, with wicketkeeper Tim Paine appointed captain.
Clarke said the ball-tampering affair, as Australia slips to fourth in the world Test rankings, could set the team back for years. - AFP

Devotees who had gathered to participate in the pooja had run for their lives after spotting the reptile.
Some poosaris and devotees watching from a safe distance had seen the cobra entering the pot after emptying it and coiling inside it. After about half an hour, it had left the pot and slithered into the nearby thicket.

CSE, the Global Reporting Initiative to deliver ESG guidance
Expanding its commitment to fostering effective ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance and communication among Sri Lankan listed companies, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) formalized an arrangement with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to provide guidance to listed companies on ESG disclosures in Sri Lanka.
GRI is an independent international organization that has pioneered sustainability reporting since 1997.GRI helps businesses and governments worldwide understand and communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social well-being. The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards are developed with true multi-stakeholder contributions and rooted in the public interest and are the first and most widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting.
GRI and the CSE will jointly undertake surveys and studies amongst listed companies and investors to gauge their knowledge, determine their capacity on sustainability reporting and identify the types of technical assistance and capacity building needed to improve awareness and institutionalize sustainability reporting within their organizations. CSE and GRI will also collaborate to conduct workshops, seminars and other forms of training for representatives of listed companies.
In what is of particular interest to the CSE, GRI will also facilitate regional peer-to-peer learning with other stock exchanges and capacity building for CSE staff through workshops, seminars, and trainings. GRI will also provide input to the CSE on the development of a comprehensive ESG guidance document in-line with GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards.
Commenting on the collaboration, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike stated; As a member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative, the CSE actively engages in its commitment to promote improved ESG disclosure and performance among listed companies. Through our collaboration with GRI, the CSE intends to foster greater awareness among our listed entities on the fact that ESG practices can be as beneficial to companies as they are to investors and that a strong focus on ESG can provide a basis for strong business results.
The collaboration with GRI will offer us the opportunity to deliver internationally renowned ESG reporting expertise and know-how here in Sri Lanka, which would be of benefit to all our capital market stakeholders, Bandaranaike added.
Earlier this year, the CSE in collaboration with Tundra Fonder hosted the CSE  Tundra Fonder Sustainability Forum to explore the catalytic potential of private finance in embracing and advancing ESG perspectives in the operations of Sri Lankan listed companies.
The exchange also recently launched a publication titled Communicating Sustainability: Six Recommendations for Listed Companies, to assist listed companies in addressing ESG factors in their capital market communication. The e-version of the publication is available for download at www.cse.lkunder the publications section.

Empathy in autism
This week Dr. Miyuru Chandradasa, MD Psych, University of Kelaniya - Sri Lanka (Overseas Leave), Monash University - Australia (Honorary) speaks about Autism, a disease that affects many in the world and in Sri Lanka.
Q  What is autism
A - Autism is a lifelong developmental condition that affects the way an individual reacts and interacts with other people and the environment. The condition is termed as autism spectrum disorder by medical specialists. The word spectrum is used as there is a range of deficits or difficulties between persons having this condition. Some people with autism would live near-normal lives; however, others may have long-term problems related to independent living and may require extensive support due to their social communication deficits and learning issues.
Q  What are the clinical features of autism
A - Boys are affected more than the girls. The early symptoms are evident in the first few years of life. An individual who is affected would have both social communication difficulties and repetitive restricted behaviour. The social communication deficits would include lack of emotional reciprocity, poor non-verbal communication skills and deficiencies in understanding social relationships. In regards to restricted and repetitive behaviour, the affected child would demonstrate stereotyped acts or utterances, insistence on sameness, fixated interests and an abnormal reaction to sensory stimuli.
Q  How can autism be diagnosed
A - The diagnosis of autism requires extensive clinical and structured assessments. This should be done by a medical specialist trained specifically in neurodevelopmental disorders. A child psychiatrist would gather information from clinical observations, information from parents and teachers and structured tools before coming to a diagnosis. The diagnosis would be done according to standard internationally known criteria which are used worldwide. Most widely used criteria are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders constructed and published by the American Psychiatric Association and International Classification of Diseases by the World Health Organization. In addition to this, a culturally relevant pictorial screening tool has been developed for Sri Lanka.
Q  Explain the Aetiology of Autism
A - The exact cause of autism is not known. There has been much scientific research over the decades on possible causes for the disorder. What is certain is that it is a brain disorder related to the development of neuronal pathways. However, the reason why these abnormalities occur is exactly not known. The genetics have a significant role to play in the causality of the disease and autism is one of the conditions that are heavily influenced by genetic variations. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of autism all over the world. The reason for this increase is not clearly identified at present. A study by a group of researchers led by Professor Hemamali Perera in 2009 showed that the prevalence of autism in Sri Lanka is 1 in 93 in the 18-24 month age group. It is possible that over the last decade this ratio has increased.
Q  What are the treatment available for autism
A - At present, the main mode of treatment for autism is intensive behavioural interventions that are more effective when employed in early life. The behavioural interventions aim to improve sustained eye contact, joint attention, pragmatics, which is the social use of language and other behaviour deficits. Apart from this, specific cognitive therapies are used in adolescents and adults. In addition, there is a limited role for medications in autism for behavioural improvements, which should be carefully prescribed and monitored by a medical specialist. These treatment methods have been studied extensively in many countries and proven to be reasonably effective and safe. Many international organisations such as the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom only recommend these well researched behavioural and limited pharmacological treatments. A study by a group of researchers including child psychiatrists Professor Hemamali Perera and Dr Sudarshi Seneviratne, published in 2016 has found that home-based early behavioural interventions are effective to improve symptoms of children with autism in Sri Lanka.
Stem cell therapy
A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell obtained from an organism. These cells can differentiate into other types of cells. They can produce the same type of cells as well. Stem cell therapy uses stem cells to prevent or treat disorders. The commonly used stem cells are from the bone marrow of the treated individual and at times from the umbilical cord blood.
Risks of stem cell therapy
Many of the specific stem cell therapy methods for disorders are still being experimented. On most disorders, there is only a limited number of studies at present. Therefore the potential risks of these forms of therapies are yet to be identified. The past experience has been that in some forms of biological therapies, the adverse effects are only identified many months or even years after the therapy. Therefore, the possible long-term complications are not certain at present. Because these therapies are not well established, it requires a great deal of monitoring and control by an independent external authority. At present, there is no such committee to oversee the execution of stem cell therapy by various individuals in Sri Lanka. Since the public health services are not heavily involved in many specific forms of stem cell therapy, there is no uniform structure or monitoring of the procedures and outcomes. There is no approved method to report any adverse reactions or complications. Stem cell therapy is costly and this could potentially become a pathway for people to provide services that are driven by commercial goals rather than health outcomes.
Stem cell therapy in autism
There have been a small number of published studies on using stem cell therapy in children with autism spectrum disorder. These studies have been done mainly in the United States of America, other Western countries and India. Most of the studies have been done on a very small number of highly selected patients. The results are not practically relevant when a study is not done in a naturalistic setting and recruits only selected patients in small numbers. Many of the studies are not controlled studies. That means this method of treatment has not been compared with other types of management for autism and the results are not that valid. In addition, the limited studies published have been done over a short period and the long-lasting effects are uncertain.
There have been few studies published recently. In a controlled trial done in California in the United States and published in April 2018, the researchers did not find any significant benefit of stem cell therapy using umbilical cord blood cells for children with autism spectrum disorder. Another study done by a group of scientists in Italy and United States and published in 2014 using foetal stem cells stated that at present this form of therapy for autism is controversial.
Q  Is the therapy recommended
A - At present, there is inadequate scientific evidence on stem cell therapy in autism. The minor benefits shown by certain limited studies are doubtful and require to be further explored by large-scale controlled studies. In conclusion, stem cell therapy is not recommended for any aspect of autism spectrum disorder in the current context.

Enhancing voluntary social services sector
A new Act to regulate NGOs had been approved by Cabinet but suspended on account of protests regarding some of the features in the new Act. There is confusion amongst planners and activists. Many have forgotten the letter and spirit of the term voluntary social services. This country from around the 1950s had a rich tradition of voluntary contributions by citizens. Due to the war and Tsunami terminology, frameworks and perceptions changed. A nexus between finances and organisations developed. Very many local entities were left out of these equations. It became unsustainable nominally the subject matter traditionally vested with the Ministry of Social Services.
Existing regulatory framework
Non-profits are formed and mostly registered through Acts of Parliament, Trusts, as CBOs, Societies, Associations, with the Registrar of Companies or the Registrar of NGOs or willed in Estates of individuals. Currently tax on funds of NGOs is exempted if they are engaged in- poverty alleviation, underserved regions and communities; provision and facilitation of infrastructure and livelihood means including activities that meet basic needs of people particularly targeted at rural communities; management and protection of natural resources; enhancement and value added component for quality of life and increased levels of income of those in poverty; assistance to vulnerable and institutionalised children and those differently abled.
2015 Vision
One of the key issues to be resolved is the greater involvement of the hundreds of thousands on local village initiatives. The voluntary social services sector must take into full the benefits and the needs feeding up from Grama Rajya through up to national level. The government alone cant do everything and a top-down state is too often oppressive rather than enabling. By involving more citizens in decision-making and allowing local providers, statutory and voluntary, to pool resources and deliver the best service then, we will be ensuring Local Governance in the Grama Rajiyas to generate the change required.
A framework of collaboration
A model/framework of collaboration, rather than competition, needs to be set up which would mobilize wider social forces to deliver outcomes. Targeted priority areas need to be identified to focus support where the need is greatest - the least affluent and disadvantaged communities, where there specific common hardships.
Collaboration with civil society - the voluntary sector, faith groups, trade unions, businesses - is needed. We need to see a fundamental change in the role business plays - not just more corporate social responsibility programmes but pursuing a purpose that serves society. In its simplest terms a civil society organisation is not a commercial organisation but is a not for profit organisation.
The framework envisaged should preserve the notions of volunteerism, charities and social enterprises found in the regions and should be registered where essential under the Voluntary Social Services Act. NGOs engaged in advocacy receiving funds should not come under the Voluntary Social Services Act. NGOs engaged in technical interventions should conform to national sector standards and maintain communication with mandated agencies of government.
All recipients of fund transfers from overseas should be filtered by the Central Bank through existing anti-money laundering and anti-terror filters.
A communication platform should provide technical educational content for civil society entities and highlight their work to generate, develop and showcase/share new ideas to help people to come together in their neighbourhoods to do good things. Where needed smaller entities requiring accounting and reporting services should be supported by a back office entity.
Civil Society organisations can be organised into specialist groups, and some may have the capability to span across several groups- vertically via specialist skills and horizontally via organisational levels. All Service providers need to be legally accountable for the services they provide.
Government  commercial  nonprofits should become partners in areas of comparative advantages which accrue the greatest benefit for the country. The spirit of volunteerism should be nurtured early for Voluntary Social services to survive in Sri Lanka.
The country should allow tax remissions for those funding Voluntary Social services and allow for families to bequeath assets for such work. Concepts such as social impact bonds should be introduced. The spirit of volunteerism should be promoted. The enterprise should not become bureaucratic.

External sector   improves in January
Sri Lankas external sector demonstrated an improvement in January 2018 with higher inflows to the financial account in spite of the widening of the trade deficit.
While earnings from merchandise exports increased, expenditure on imports also increased significantly outweighing the performance in export earnings during the month.
Nevertheless, reversing the moderating trend observed during the last year, tourist earnings recorded a notable growth during January 2018.
Workers remittances, which marked a set-back in 2017, also recorded a considerable growth on a year-on-year basis in January 2018.
Meanwhile, the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) continued to experience higher inflows in January 2018, with foreign investments in the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
At the end of January 2018, gross official reserves of the country amounted to US dollars 7.7 billion, equivalent to 4.3 months of imports.
The deficit in the trade balance expanded in January 2018 surpassing US dollars 1 billion for the second consecutive month due to significant level of imports offsetting the increase in export earnings. Earnings from exports continued to record double-digit growth (year-on-year) reaching US dollars 965 million in January 2018, partly driven by the impact of the low base as export earnings contracted by 3.8 per cent in January 2017. Export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco,
petroleum products, rubber products and tea contributed largely to the growth in exports.
In addition, export earnings from textiles and garments increased moderately during the month due to the increase in earnings from garment exports to the EU and the USA by 4.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively.
However, earnings from coconut exports declined significantly in January 2018 along with the decline in volumes of coconut kernel products such as desiccated coconut, coconut oil and copra as a result of the low domestic production of coconut due to drought conditions.
Import expenditure surpassed the US dollars 2 billion mark in January 2018 for the second consecutive month mainly due to high import bills incurred on fuel.
The average import price of crude oil increased to US dollars 72.04 per barrel in January 2018 from US dollar 57.39 per barrel in January 2017.In addition, following the reduction in taxes on electric motor vehicles in the Budget 2018, import expenditure on personal vehicles increased owing to high imports of electric motor vehicles.
Foreign investments in the government securities market witnessed a net inflow for the eleventh consecutive month in January 2018 in comparison to the net outflow recorded in January 2017.
Rupee depreciates by 2%
Reflecting the developments in the domestic foreign exchange market, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 0.6 per cent against the US dollar in January 2018 and by 2 per cent so far during the year up to 5 April 2018.
Furthermore, reflecting cross currency movements, the rupee also depreciated against other major currencies during this period.

Fuel price revision in the offing
A price revision of fuel distributed by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is in the offing, according to highly placed government sources.
The Indian oil company, Lanka IOC has already increased their prices to be on par with the world fuel price hikes. However, CPC prices have remained static for nearly a month incurring heavy losses.
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S Samaratunga.
The weekly loss due to this has been calculated at Rs.266 million, Petroleum Resource Ministry sources said.Taking all this into consideration, an oil price revision is likely according to Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S Samaratunga.
He said the need for the pricing formula is essential and they were in the process of finalising the matter with the Petroleum Resources Ministry. Dr. Samaratunga told the Daily News that they were in the process of finalising a fuel price formula to be implemented after the Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
He however said they would have to meet with Petroleum Resources Development Ministry officials to finalise the proposal. This price revision formula will need to be sanctioned by the Petroleum Resources Ministry before being tabled in Cabinet.
Another official also confirmed the final price formula will be submitted to Cabinet for approval following discussions between the two ministries. Petroleum Resource Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe recently said that a pricing formula is essential if CEYPETCO is to remain sustainable.
CEYPETCO was said to be incurring a loss of Rs. 266 million weekly following the fuel price hike by Lanka IOC.
He had said that the Ministry and the CPC were in agreement that a pricing formula was the only way out of the crisis, adding that a mechanism needed to be worked out by the Treasury first.
The Finance Ministry has agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that as part of the sequence on energy pricing formula, it would implement a cost reflective price formula for fuel which would be approved by cabinet by March 2018,a similar mechanism for electricity by September 2018 as a condition for the US$ 1.5 billion loan taken. This is referred to as non-commercial obligations (NCOs).

German Police stumped by van attackers motives
GERMANY: German investigators were puzzled Sunday morning by the motives of a man who drove a van into a crowd at an open-air restaurant the day before, killing two people before shooting himself.
So far there are no clues to a possible motive for the act, said Martin Botzenhardt, senior prosecutor in the northwestern city of Muenster where the attack happened, in a statement issued in the early hours.
We are pressing hard on our investigation into all possible avenues. Late Saturday, authorities were near-certain that there was no Islamist connection to the violence in the historic centre of Muenster as had initially been feared.
The two people killed were a 51-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man, both from northern Germany.
As well as the dead, police said 20 were injured -- six of them seriously -- amid the broken and upturned tables and chairs seen strewn across the pavement in images of the scene.
Police had to wait for a bomb disposal team to clear the vehicle used in the attack after noticing suspect wires inside. In the end, they found only the weapon used by the 48-year-old driver to kill himself, a blank-firing pistol and some powerful fireworks.
A search of the mans Muenster apartment late Saturday turned up more fireworks and a deactivated AK47 assault rifle.
Police have appealed to the public for information about the attack, setting up a website where people can upload photos or videos.
There was a bang and then screaming. The police arrived and got everyone out of here, an employee of the restaurant hit by the terrace told NTV.
There were a lot of people screaming. Im angry -- its cowardly to do something like this. Armed police cordoned off a wide area around the scene of the attack, urging residents to avoid the city centre to allow investigators to get to work amid initial fears the country had suffered another extremist assault. Germany has been on especially high alert for Jihadist attacks after several claimed by the Islamic State group.
But in the Saturday afternoon attack, inflicted as locals and tourists enjoyed a sunny spring day, there was no indication at the moment that there is any Islamist connection, said North Rhine-Westphalia state interior minister Herbert Reul.
Media reports said the driver, identified only as Jens R., had a history of mental health problems.
Public broadcaster ZDF said the man had recently attempted suicide while rolling news channel NTV said he had spoken of a desire to bring as much attention as possible to his death.
ZDF also reported that he had possible links with far-right movements.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was deeply shaken by the incident and everything possible will be done to determine what was behind this act and to help the victims.
The presidents of Russia and France, Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron, each sent their condolences.
The attack is the latest in a string across Europe in which vehicles have been used to attack crowds of people in public places.
In a Berlin attack in December 2016, Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri hijacked a truck and murdered its Polish driver before killing another 11 people and wounding dozens more by ploughing the heavy vehicle through a Christmas market in central Berlin.
He was shot dead by Italian police in Milan four days later while on the run.
In France, the Islamic State group claimed a 2016 truck attack in Nice on its July 14 national holiday that killed 86.
And in Spain, the jihadists also claimed a rampage along Barcelonas Las Ramblas boulevard in August 2017 that killed 14 and left more than 100 injured.- AFP

Are human qualities and values instilled by religions
Gift of spiritual life
It is very obvious to intelligent people that the political culture in general and the quality of politicians in particular, in Sri Lanka, is at a very low level.
Hence it is time that religious leaders closely examined the quality of social and political life in Sri Lanka and the quality of religious instruction and formation given to schoolchildren and the adult adherents and the nature of the religiosity, the human qualities and values instilled in them. Genuine human qualities and values need to be firmly rooted in minds and hearts before their being raised to a higher level by religious enrichment and spiritual refinement.
The widespread prevalence of uncivilized and anti-social life and conduct is evidenced by the distorted relationships triggered among the people by the criminal activities as well as political activities some people are engaged in. Dishonesty and fraud in high places and the great social destruction caused thereby, as well as the petty antipathies among ordinary people contaminate society. All this go to show that the essential interior life of the people in our society is not at all a healthy one. We are great boasters of the exterior life we display before all. Today even prominent rogues and high society swindlers wish even to remain as ministers and appear as people with a good reputation. They proclaim to all and sundry their political ideologies even while they are known to have indulged in highly irregular administrative activities and scams that favoured their kith and kin and political supporters. They are enemies of civilization, liberty, truth and justice. And their barren lives remain devoid of social and religious values.
QUALITY OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
Relgious leaders and authorities of education should come together to review the quality and content of religious education imparted to children and the life-changing teaching imparted to the people.
Children learn moral and ethical behaviour at home and in school in accordance with religious doctrine. However good the textbooks may be, the teachers instructions could turn out to be detrimental to society due to the harmful attitudes that are communicated to students. Social cohesion and harmony in any community is built on effective communication of the true and just human, social and spiritual values. They should examine the social impact of religious education and dispassionately examine the quality of their particular contribution to society. Do they positively contribute to fraternity, human solidarity and social cohesion and harmony, national unity and peace or do they undermine them and create social communitarian, religious dissension, dissatisfaction, friction, disturbance, disunion and provoke violent behavior among people
The composite units of society are not homogenous; they need not be.
People may differ in their views, in their choices and way of life, in the goals they pursue. The richness and vitality of any society is also in its diversity, variety and complexity. Yet in spite of multiplicity and plurality there should also be a consistency that pervades large sectors of society that does not militate against incorporation into a cohesive togetherness. It is this overarching interconnectedness that makes of diverse communities one people, one nation. Though Sri Lankas people have yet failed to achieve this oneness, there is a felt striving towards it as there is a perception that it is imperative.
They have failed to achieve social harmony due to the ghetto mentality of social and religious communities and due to the reservations and fear they entertain about the other communities they are strangers to and ignorant about. These attitudes are perpetuated by what is communicated and instilled in the minds of the people of various communities. Many remain indifferent to the safety and happiness of others. That they are responsible for the well-being and peace of others is not sufficiently understood nor has it been imparted to them.
Today, it is not enough for leaders and followers of religions only to avoid among themselves antagonistic and warring attitudes in the name of religion. They should see that the acceptable common values in the core of different religions are not numb and frozen but animated and buoyant among them. This would mean that human, fraternal and cordial relations are cultivated and made part and parcel of religious culture. We need to admit that without this ingredient of human warmth and fraternal concern for one another, religions not only lack but unthinkingly undermine the essence and spiritual vitality they should have.
Certainly religion has been a significant aspect of human society and culture since the beginning of civilization. The origins of religious beliefs among our ancestors may remain uncertain, yet the great world religions started as the movements of enlightenment and revitalization for communities seeking more comprehensive answers to lifes problems.
The easiest way to define religion is to refer to it as a life according to a belief in essential values, or conduct of life in keeping with the worship of a god or gods. However, whether we choose to believe in a divine power or not, there is a diversity of religious beliefs and practices which capture the minds and hearts of people and have an influence on their everyday lives.
Over the years, we have witnessed the religious groups establishing powerful and persuasive motivations in people by creating conceptions of what is right and wrong, moral and immoral. It seems apparent that for a great number of people, religion provides the strength and help required to deal with persistent challenges of life. Nevertheless, the hypocrisy presented in some of the beliefs and lack of any concrete evidence for their basic teachings can appear nave to those not raised in such a community which practices their religion with devotion and commitment.
It is important to recognize that religion and religious movements have a massive impact on our society. Generally, these influences are varied; both negative and positive influences can be found. It is right to remain tolerant to the harmless or beneficial effects of religious practices. However, following the recent attacks against religious groups, it is apparent that negative aspects sprouting from a religious tradition which create mayhem in the community, which usually are rooted in extremist groups, should be ultimately controlled and eradicated.
Majority of the religions are exclusive to their beliefs and that distinctiveness may remain so. But unfortunately, some religious leaders openly or subtly, encourage fanaticism and even violent intolerance against the people of other faiths. This is perhaps the most unmistakable display of hypocrisy. The idea of religion being a force for peace and reconciliation gets negated as it is opposed with the violence and wars allegedly fought for the preservation of a religious tradition or in the name of God. The sense of self-righteousness seen in some religious movements could lead to a sense of superiority which justifies violence and even killing in the name of religion or God.
FREE TO EMBRACE OR REJECT
This is manifestly opposed to the frank and civilized dialogue among religious leaders and believers in which one comes to a better knowledge, understanding, appreciation, evaluation of the enlightenment in the teachings and practices of anothers religion. In any case, every human being should remain entirely free to embrace, practice and propagate ones religious beliefs, philosophical or political beliefs without causing any violence to others. At the same time, everyone should be free to remain uncommitted to or non-violently reject a religion or adopt a religion, philosophy or a political ideology of ones choice. That is a human right.
RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION
A minority of religious extremists have been known to practice terrifying and repulsive acts of hostility and sadism to promote their goals, in the ways that are exploited by the ones in power, reinforcing the negative stereotype in the media which portrays religion as a narrow-minded and dangerous cult. Another example of a negative effect which religion has on the lives of individuals is the discrimination against certain minorities.
Religion has been criticized over the years for its harmful effects to both individuals and society, such as brainwashing, holy wars and terrorism. Many argue that all religious beliefs are irrational and unreasonable having no scientific explanation. To some, Marxs description of religion being the opium of people, still appears relevant as some religious movements in some parts of the world seem to lead their adherents to control others through inhuman, anti-social terrorist ways as if they are drugged by religion. Marxists such as Lenin, Stalin and Mao too, to carry out their political projects, resorted to the most despicable ways of eliminating human beings in addition to eliminating any other political view, making Marxism itself an opium.
PURE RELIGION ENHANCES LIFE
For many, their religious beliefs are the stimulus to become better people and to make the world a better home for all. Most of the people who strive to live according to their religion not only experience a serenity as a result of liberation from interior and exterior shackles but also derive strength to do good to humanity.
They overcome their fears, maintain a hope for better things to come; they see their Teacher or God as a benevolent protector, a refuge and a loving strengthener of the upright and just life. Often overlooked, one of the most positive aspects of religion may be that individuals and communities find comfort through their belief in a divine power, finding strength to endure even incorrigible injustice rather than creating disturbing dissension and even more unjust social anarchy and class war and turning to more popular ways of numbing the mind such as lust of the flesh, worship of mammon, drugs or alcohol.
Religious leaders without yielding to the temptation of partisan politics, or getting captured by gifts and entrapped in the snares that cunning political leaders lay, should fearlessly denounce wickedness, dishonesty, hypocrisy, selfishness and criminality in politics and boldly summon their people and the political leaders to righteous living in accordance with the teachings of their respective religions.
Researchers have found that a vitally spiritual life contributes to hopefulness and ability to cope with life, less sadness and worry, enhanced relations with others, better health and more interior peace.
These should permeate the whole of our society especially due to the religious leaders active promotion of truly religious values clearly showing what uncontaminated and pure religion is that enhances life.

Kabir queried on withdrawal of hostel facilities
The hostel facilities for second year students studying for the Higher National Diploma at Ampara Hardy Technical College have been withdrawn due to complaints of serious ragging at the institution. Accordingly, around 450 students of the 550 second year batch have been asked to leave the college hostel.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa in an additional question to Higher Education Minister Kabir Hashim in Parliament on April 04, drew the latters attention to the matter, requesting him to take necessary steps to resolve the issue. There are about 550 second year students who study for the Higher National Diploma at Ampara Hardy Technical College. The college has provided hostel facilities to its students for 30 or so years. Now the authority has sent the hostellers away. There are about 450 students who reside away from Ampara who are affected by this decision, MP Jayatissa said.
Answering on behalf of Minister Hashim, Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage said that the reason for withdrawing hostel facilities for these students is the serious ragging taking place at the institution.
Ragging at this institution has become extreme, Deputy Minister Gamage said. There is a large file of complaints on ragging. I met the second year students who use hostel facilities as well as those who do not. The students who use hostel facilities told me that they will not rag new students any more."
"However, the second year students who do not use hostel facilities say that it is better to withdraw the facility as the ragging will continue.
She also said that they are looking into the possibility of using two separate buildings for the first and second year students as there is enough space available. The first year students will be taken in by this May. So we are planning to hold discussions with the parents of these students as well. We are hoping to brief Minister Hashim after these discussions.

Last thing you want is a bookworm
Since the great ancient library at Alexandria burnt to the ground in 48 BC, with the loss of up to 700,000 irreplaceable scrolls, libraries have been under threat. These days, its from government, both local and national, who see libraries purely as a cost and very rarely as an opportunity.
My guess is that three-quarters of the people reading this have fond memories of libraries: some from childhood, some from last Tuesday. Libraries matter and they always will. Meanwhile, for those of us who have a favourite desk in the library and are liable to leave and work elsewhere if someone is already sitting in our spot, comes this brief, but invaluable, little book.
Its a collection of weird facts and stories about libraries. And where was it researched You guessed right. Its published by the Bodleian Library in Oxford, where I sat staring out of the window some 35 years ago, and which has taken a copy of every new book published in the UK since 1662.
Fire and flame have long been banned from the Bodleian to protect the books, which meant that opening hours were severely limited to daylight until artificial light was finally installed throughout the building in 1929.
Here, at last, is a rundown of the Dewey Decimal system of library classification, with which I have been strangely fascinated for years. Of the ten major classes (or categories), only the prolific writer Isaac Asimov is said to have been represented in nine of them. The only category he failed to produce a book in was 100  Philosophy.
The largest library fine ever paid was for the childrens poetry book Days And Deeds, by Burton E. Stevenson, which was taken out of the library in Kewanee, Illinois, in 1955 and not returned until 47 years later. It accrued a fine of two cents a day, which came to $345.14.
The polar explorer Ernest Shackleton was a bibliophile and once took a printing press on one of his expeditions. He thus became the first person ever to publish a book on Antarctica, where he printed and bound Aurora Australis in 1909, using wooden boards fashioned from a tea chest.
Before the British Library Reading Room opened to the general public, famous people allowed in included Bram Stoker, Thomas Hardy, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (better known as Lenin), George Orwell, Virginia Woolf and Mahatma Gandhi. There are 13 Presidential Libraries in America. Barack Obamas is in Chicago and isnt expected to be completed until 2020. Will Trumps library have any books in it
Ms Cock-Starkey lists eight Enemies of the Library: vandals, pests, light, humidity, temperature, fire, flood and pollution. Insects are a particular menace. Acquisitions of old books are often quarantined to ensure against infestations.
At the Rococo Library in Portugals Mafra National Palace, a colony of bats is allowed to live there to eat the book-damaging bugs.

Lion Tambwe equals Super Rugby record, Crusaders go top
BUENOS AIRES: Golden Lions' Madosh Tambwe scored a record-equalling four tries in a Super Rugby match Saturday and Canterbury Crusaders reclaimed top spot in the New Zealand conference.
Democratic Republic of Congo-born Tambwe matched 15 other players since 1996 with Australian Joe Roff first to score four tries in a game.
The 20-year-old winger took just 54 seconds to open the scoring in a 52-31 rout of Western Stormers in Johannesburg during round 8.
He completed his hat-trick within 13 minutes and added a fourth try 12 minutes into the second half of the South African derby.
On a profitable day for wingers, George Bridge and Manasa Mataele scored two each for defending champions Crusaders in a 40-14 triumph over the Argentine Jaguares in Buenos Aires.
In other matches, Australian sides New South Wales Waratahs and ACT Brumbies won convincingly and Waikato Chiefs edged Auckland Blues in a New Zealand derby.
Waratahs hammered the Japanese Sunwolves 50-29 in Tokyo, Brumbies beat compatriots Queensland Reds 45-21 in Canberra and a penalty try earned Chiefs a 21-19 win over Blues in Hamilton.
Tambwe is the second player to score four tries in a match this year after Ben Lam of Wellington Hurricanes.
The Lions winger, who left DR Congo capital Kinshasa at an early age to be educated in Johannesburg, refused to take any credit for his achievement.
It is entirely due to my teammates that I got those try-scoring opportunities, said the man-of-the-match award winner. - AFP

Man City denied title by famous United comeback
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City must wait to annex the Premier League title after an amazing Paul Pogba-inspired fightback from two goals down saw their biggest rivals Manchester United earn a famous 3-2 win to ruin the Etihad Stadiums dream party on Saturday.
City, needing to win to wrap up the English top-flight title with more games to spare than any other side in history, seemed to be coasting to the landmark, leading their neighbours 2-0 at the break with goals from Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gundogan.
Yet just when it seemed United were being outplayed to the point of embarrassment, they launched an astonishing comeback soon after the break with Pogba, previously anonymous despite a new flashy blue hair-do, striking twice in two minutes.
Then, with City losing their composure, Chris Smalling was left free to volley home the winner from Alexis Sanchezs freekick in the 69th minute to seal a memorable win.
Now instead of a morale-boosting celebration, Pep Guardiolas side have been forced to wait to clinch their third title in seven seasons and cannot be guaranteed the title even if they win at Tottenham Hotspur next Saturday.
Their lead over United has been cut to 13 points with Jose Mourinhos team in pole to earn the runners-up spot as they have 71 points from 32 games, four points clear of Liverpool (67 from 33), who earlier drew 0-0 at Everton, and Spurs (67 from 32), who won 2-1 at Stoke City.
If City beat the in-form Spurs at Wembley, they will still not be able to celebrate the title unless United fail to beat bottom club West Bromwich Albion the following day.
City, who suffered their first home league defeat for 16 months, were left to look back on the most deflating of evenings.
They missed a host of first-half chances, had an obvious penalty turned down, were denied by the brilliance of United keeper David de Gea and finally saw the profligate Raheem Sterling hit the post from point-blank range.
United manager Jose Mourinho, though, was all smiles, especially as his match winner turned out to be the misfiring Pogba, who was reported by Guardiola to have originally been offered for sale to City before he was signed by United.
If the accusation from his agent is that he wants to go to other clubs, his price has gone up, smiled Mourinho.
Citys defeat completed their wretched week after the 3-0 mauling by Liverpool at Anfield in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday and they now face a European exit in the return on Tuesday night.
Earlier, Everton and Liverpool had served up a surprisingly bloodless affair in the 231st Merseyside derby, while Spurs prevailed with a double from the in-form Christian Eriksen at Stoke.
The Goodison Park match, which did not feature a single booking  a remarkable occurrence amid one of Englands fiercest derbies  saw Liverpool soak up a late spell of Everton pressure to stretch their record unbeaten run in Merseyside derbies to 17 games.
Yet without the leagues top scorer Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in a very different starting XI to the one that outplayed Manchester City, Liverpool looked to have the Champions League return on their minds.
The draw, though, allowed Spurs to move alongside them with a sixth straight league win as they defeated Stoke, whose relegation fears in 19th place were only heightened. Harry Kane made his return for Spurs after nearly a month out with injury but it was Eriksen who orchestrated the victory with two goals in 11 second-half minutes, taking his goal tally to five in three games in all competitions.
At the other end of the table, West Broms plight only worsened as Swansea City came from behind to draw 1-1 and keep the seemingly-doomed Baggies 10 points from safety with just five games left.  Agencies

Messi bags hat-trick as Barca equal La Liga unbeaten record
BARCELONA, Saturday - Barcelona forward Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Leganes on Saturday which took the Catalans 12 points clear at the top of La Liga and also meant they equalled a Spanish top-flight record of 38 games without defeat.
Messi curled in from a free kick to break the deadlock in the 27th minute.
Five minutes later the Argentine doubled the lead, taking one touch to control a through ball from Philippe Coutinho before delivering a cool low finish. Nabil El Zhar pulled a goal back for 14th-placed Leganes in the 68th minute. However, Messi made sure Barca kept all the points by hitting his third with three minutes left, controlling the ball on his chest and calmly chipping goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar from close range.
Barca have not lost in the league since going down 2-0 at Malaga on April 8 last year and the win saw them match Real Sociedads unbeaten run between 1979 and 1980. Ernesto Valverdes side are also undefeated in the Champions League this campaign.
Its a historic record which gives you an idea of how competitive the team is, Valverde told a news conference, stressing that the record also belongs to predecessor Luis Enrique, who oversaw the first seven games of the unbeaten run at the end of last season.
I cant explain how we have done it, all we try and do is focus on always winning the next game. The Catalans are top of La Liga with 79 points after 31 games and have a 12-point advantage over second-placed Atletico Madrid, who visit champions Real Madrid in a local derby on Sunday.
Despite the huge margin his side have at the top, Valverde continued to
resist talk about his side being champions-elect.
When you start to feel like you are the champions, thats the moment you
begin to make a mistake, he said.
We still havent won anything and theres still a danger we wont win it.
We have to keep fighting until the end, just like our other rivals.
Sevilla suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat at Celta Vigo as their former striker Iago Aspas struck a hat-trick in a rampant second-half display. Spain forward Aspas scored all his goals in the space of 21 minutes, taking his La Liga goal tally this season to 19.
Sevillas 20-year-old defender Guilherme Arana bundled the ball into his
own net to put the home side ahead towards the end of the first half and Vincenzo Montellas side fell apart after the interval. Sevilla are seventh in the standings and will drop down to eighth and out of the European places if Girona win at Real Sociedad on Sunday.
Real Betis climbed up to fifth and edged closer to a return to European
football next season by beating Eibar 2-0 at home, while Alaves beat Getafe 2-0.  Agencies

Milo to host Kids Zone and Tag Rugby Carnival
The Bradby Fiesta 2018 will mark the zenith to a festive April in Colombo by adding a carnival atmosphere to a historic rivalry, in the form of a game of rugby. Bradby Fiesta 2018 is the rugby carnival organized to coincide with the Colombo leg of the game of rugby played between Royal College, Colombo and the Trinity College Kandy, known around the globe as the Bradby Shield. The Colombo leg of the 74th Bradby Shield being the first of two games is scheduled to be held on the April 21, at the Royal College, Sports Complex.
The Bradby Fiesta was originally organized by the Royal College Union (RCU) to accommodate those who miss the opportunity to witness the live action at the venue - due to seating constraints - to experience the game live on giant screens placed at Bloomfield Grounds, situated adjacent to the Sports Complex. Over the years it has grown into a much anticipated carnival and an after party.

Mother of twin boys gives birth to rare set of twin girls
Doctors told a Colorado mother of twin boys to try her luck at the lottery after revealing she was pregnant with another set of rare identical twin girls against 10-million-to-one odds.
Casey Saunders, 27, thought the doctor was pulling her leg when she said the mother of twin boys was expecting yet another duo, the odds of which are one in 70,000.
On top of the already impossible-seeming odds, the babies had developed inside the same placenta, a condition that only occurs with about one per cent of twin pregnancies and can cause fatal complications in the womb.
After spending the final two months of her pregnancy in the hospital while doctors monitored the twins, Casey and her partner Eugene Goree welcomed baby girls Maya and Laia on December 3.
Four months later Casey has shared her unlikely story with Daily Mail Online.
Casey, an optometric technician, had her boys Hayden and Cameron when she was 17 years old, and nine years later she learned she and her partner Eugene were pregnant again.
When she went in for her first ultrasound she had the excited boys in tow.
On the way to the ultrasound they were arguing over who was going to get to hold the baby first, she said.
I thought the sonographer was trying to tease me when she said there were two heartbeats because she knew I had my twin boys with me.
The technician saw the monitor and told Casey: You should go buy a Powerball ticket when youre done here.
She was pregnant with twins - again.
I was shocked. I called Eugene and said: Youre not going to believe this, she said.
He was surprised but really excited from the beginning.
Casey said shes never tried to calculate the odds of a pregnancy like this one because theyre too complicated - but its clear that her girls are extraordinarily unlikely.
The odds of having identical twins are about one in 250, which is considered to be a relatively small number statistically speaking.
The likelihood of having two sets of identical twins is an infinitely smaller one in 70,000, meaning that Casey had about a .0014 percent chance of having twins again. On top of the already miniscule odds, the twins were revealed to be monoamniotic monochorionic, which occurs in less than one percent of twin pregnancies.

Markets in the week ahead are likely to move in line with developments on the political and economic front, although at a slower pace as markets close for the traditional New Year holidays.
CBSL eases policy rates
The CBSL eased policy rates at its 2nd monetary policy review for the year, the first policy change since its hike in March 2017.
The favourable developments in inflation and inflation outlook as well as lower than expected real GDP growth (3.1% in 2017, cf. 4.5% in 2016) led the Monetary board to reduce the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25 basis points to 8.50% while the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) was unchanged at 7.25%.
The CBSL noted that Gap between actual and potential GDP growth of the country has widened further, and its monetary policy easing measure is thus expected to address the near term tepid growth prospects.
The continued slowdown in urban food inflation levels in 2018 meanwhile, is expected to be reflected in national inflation levels for the month and the CBSL anticipates both headline and core inflation levels stabilizing at targeted mid-single digits during the remainder of 2018.
On the external sector, Jan18 export performance improved both in terms of price and volume; however the trade deficit widened further due to imports outpacing exports.
Moderate inflation in Q118 and the gradual depreciation in the nominal exchange rate meanwhile helped the real effective exchange rate (REER) indices record a gradual adjustment, thereby improving countrys competitiveness under the flexible exchange rate regime.
The CBSL has purchased USD 300Mn to-date in 2018, to improve international reserves in addition to net purchase of USD 1,644Mn in 2017.
CBSL remained positive about the fiscal performance in 2018, with implementation of the Inland Revenue Act (IRA) with effect from 1st April 2018 along with other reforms expected to improve revenue administration.

Police had reportedly filed a B report in courts against 36 suspects who were found to be involved in last week's clashes between the Ceylon Workers Congress and Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya at Maskeliya, following a dispute about electing office bearers to the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Police said that the said 36 individuals had been identified through CCTV camera footage of the clashes.
They were to be issued with a notice to appear in court in the near future.
Police had to be summoned to restore order to the inaugural meeting of the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha held at the Ambal Hall which escalated into a clash on March 28. Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya members later held a protest outside the Ambal Hall, which too descended into chaos as supporters of the two parties began to throw brickbats at each other, injuring many and damaging public and private property in the process.

A special ceremony to honour acts of valour of police officers was held on Saturday with the participation of IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
Police officers who risked their lives to net drug lord Makandure Madush's drug ring on May 9, 2017, were awarded prizes.
The police had conducted this raid after the Narcotics Bureau filed a secret report in the Maligakanda court and the raid was conducted with the help of Sinnaiah Suresh. Police Constable Abeywickrama (49446) died during the raid and Constable Constable Kumara (67055) succumbed to his injuries sustained in a shootout, following a betrayal by the main informant to the police. The IGP presented Rs 1.2 million to Abeywickramas wife and Rs. one million to the kin of Constable Kumara.
The actions of the Sergeant Jayawardene (1176), who prevented entry to the LTTE vehicle from which a bomb was detonated at the main gate of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, was commended by the IGP. The officer who was body-checking the women entering the premises at the time, had identified the LTTE gunmen running directly towards the temple and had locked the main entrance gate preventing the gunmen from entering the premises.
The bomb was detonated at the main gate and thus destruction to the sacred Tooth Relic was averted. IGP Jayasundara commended this act of bravery which happened 20 years ago with a cash prize of Rs. 500,000, a special prize and a salary increment.

In 1995, when James Wood first arrived in Washington to take up as the post as the de facto lead book critic at the New Republic, American literary criticism was in a mess. Genteel, mandarin presences, whose names have disappeared along with the memory of their pieces, still presided over the major magazines and reviews.
Who now scours the archive to see what Robert Adams or Robert Towers  or, for that matter, John Updike  had to say about any novel of the period Several of the original New York Intellectuals  Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Elizabeth Hardwick, Susan Sontag  were still in operation but they no longer touched much new fiction, and their vigilance of the social reality around them had precipitately diminished.
The most promising critics of the younger generation had moved away from the political preoccupations of their predecessors into almost exclusively moral terrain. What was an acceptable way to fictionalize the experience of the Holocaust How would the internet ruin reading What happened when you wrote an incest novel without irony
Establishing identities
Wood immediately registered as a different quantity: a rigorous aesthetician, a disciplined swooner, he appealed not only to argument but tested the reading experience against the actual, lived experience of the world. Beyond simply fulfilling the basic duty of the reviewer, which Edmund Wilson once described as establishing identities for books, Wood came closer than anyone to fulfilling Henry Jamess maxim that criticism should serve as the beautiful gate to enjoyment.
If this were a James Wood review, now would come the Hussar-dash of simile: James Wood was like an early-career Jesuit gunning for a Bishopric, dispatched to restore order to dissonant congregations, swinging his thurible with steady intensity, reintroducing pungencies we had all but forgotten back into our deprived nostrils. Unlike that of so many of the critics around him, Woods felt much closer to the writing of writers.
His writers criticism, as he called it, bustled with elaborate metaphors and brazen generalities. His summaries of novels often competed with the plots themselves. In Woods view, part of the underlying health of any novel was its ability to survive this exercise, which he called passionate redescription. By the late 1990s it was almost beside the point that he signed his name to his pieces: we knew him by the style alone.
Formal task
What distinguished Wood from most of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors was his focus on matters of aesthetic liberty over social justice, and the suggestion that there was a choice to be made between them. He once described the formal task of fiction as the establishment of a licensed freedom. By this he meant that the novel is an art form that, through its very method, can avoid the theological and ideological impulse by cleaving to uncertainty, multiplicity, doubt. The novel, he wrote, moves in the shadow of doubt, knows itself to be a true lie, and it is here, for Wood, that the forms fealty to the real can be found <U+200A>a fealty that he sees as fiercely secular.
The most alive characters in the modern novel, he suggested, were the result of their authors cultivating a kind of productive imprecision about their being, an indication of bottomlessness, in which the unknowable triumphed over the knowable, and unreliability over transparency. But the novel was also more than that for Wood: he showed how free indirect discourse, when managed nimbly enough, could become an enactment of freedom, yielding characters who seemed to exercise a sovereignty that they shared to some tantalizing degree with their creators.
One of the reasons Wood has taken such an interest in an imperviously religious novelist such as Marilynne Robinson is that Robinson tries to reclaim some of these secular virtues of the novel as mislabelled religious gifts (a kind of Protestant religious freedom).
The brisk, dictatorial narration of Muriel Sparks fiction likewise earns Woods approval because her characters are equipped to outwit her own batterings. In these gaps of self-knowledge, which readers can fill in for themselves, Wood sees opportunity for the kind of improved, novelistic consciousness that can heighten readers sensitivities to the real world, granting them an almost priestly advantage over peoples souls.
Pseudo-religion
Since the beginning, Wood has sought to guard literature against claims of its being a kind of canonical religion, or pseudo-religion.
Like a zealous new district attorney  all right then, enough  he was, shortly after his arrival in DC, bringing charges against some of the most egregious smugglers of religiosity back into literary criticism  Harold Bloom and George Steiner  whose worship at the altar of greatness turned out to be little more, in Woods view, than the work of vague mystics intent on obscuring our sense of the intimate craft and minute choices behind fictional creations, of celebrants devoted to the polished product rather than the artifice of the form.
If Steiner, one of Woods predecessors at the New Yorker, was one of the young Woods targets in bravura reputation-crushing, Wood was equally merciless towards another New Yorker elder for close to the opposite reason.
He accused Updike of worshipping a complacent God and writing fiction that, in its promiscuous, sensory overflow that swallowed his characters, threatened to make all of its dramatizations of the agony of faith appear like one shiny, smooth surface.
(This dissent on Updike separated Wood from Updike admirers such as Martin Amis, Ian McEwan and Christopher Hitchens, and showed that he belonged to something more than the English cult of the mid-century American sentence.) More than anything else, for Wood, Updike failed in the novelistic duty of helping readers to appreciate the arc of their own lives and, just a little bit, their own deaths. - Times Literary Supplement

President will decide our fate - Weerakkody
Vocational Training and Skills Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said they are ever willing to forfeit their ministerial portfolios at any time. They have communicated this orally and in writing to the President who is the leader of their party.
Speaking to the media after attending a ceremony held in Galle on April 7, Weerakkody said it is the President who will decide whether they will remain ministers in the Cabinet or relinquish office to become ordinary MPs. Others who were vociferous about the matter cannot make a decision about their status.
He said that they voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) in keeping with public opinion after complete disregard of their positions. They had to take that stand as politicians elected by the peoples mandate. As a person who secured the largest member of preferential votes from the Galle District, he had a duty to bow his head to public opinion and vote in favour of the No-Confidence Motion.
They have given only a bit of their mind during the NCM debate. They would come out with the balance if anyone brought a No-Confidence Motion in Parliament against those who voted for the NCM against the Prime Minister. He would also challenge those who demand a UNP-only government to show how they would set about it and face the consequences, the minister said.
Weerakkody said they were completely against intimidating media institutions to celebrate a shaky victory achieved in Parliament by moving a few heads here and there on various ruses.

Primary export income increase to US$ 454 mn in 2017
The export income from primary exports increased to US$ 454 million in 2017, up 39% from the US$ 326 million income in 2016, said Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage.
Speaking at the launch of the EU Technical assistance to the agriculture modernization project at Hotel Shangri-La in Colombo last week he said that this trend clearly indicates that Sri Lanka is in the correct path to achieve the primary industry sector exports target which is US$ 1.5 billion by 2025.
The Primary Industries Ministry has implemented a number of productive programmes in the past two years to realize the government objective to help export earnings achieve a broad-based improvement.
The primary industry sector consists of about 25% of the total manufacturing units and 15% of the total work force in the country. The export earnings from this sector have averaged around Rs. 48 billion per annum for the period from 2012 to 2015.
In 2015, the Ministry of Primary Industry was established to give more priority for primary industries to achieve a broad based improvement in the export earnings.
However, the Sri Lankan manufactures in the sector is still working with various difficulties. In my opinion, the high cost of production, outdated technology, low volume of production and product quality, lack of skilled labour, lack of training and insufficient financing facilities are some of them.
The government institutions and international agencies need to give the fullest cooperation to device the necessary strategies to overcome these difficulties in an efficient and coordinated manner.
Some of the EU funded projects, intends to help Sri Lanka to promote the export of high value agricultural commodities in future. This objective is planned to be achieved enabling the relevant sectors to work on a better regulatory framework including registration process of companies, system of surveillance and certification, better link to the market through knowledge, public-private partnerships, and adopting better technology.

Realizing dreams at the top of the world
Months of physical and mental preparation have culminated in the departure of a brave son of Sri Lanka, Johann Peries, on his second attempt to scale Mount Everest. Setting off for the two-month expedition, Johann hopes to be successful on this attempt to scale Mount Everest and make his country proud.
Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak of 8,848m above sea level in April 2016. However, Johann managed to reach a height of 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, before technical difficulties forced him to descend.
Not one to give up easily, this time round, Johann is part of a larger team led by International Mountain Guides (IMG), a globally renowned mountaineering company, with experience in leading several successful Mt. Everest expeditions.
Enthused by the support and love from fellow Sri Lankans to scale the worlds highest peak, Climb Everest with Johann was launched to make every Sri Lankan a part of Johanns journey. Each step taken by Johann on the mountain can be sponsored for Rs.100 per step and sponsors can support as many steps as they want. The expedition fees include IMGs logistical support, Sherpa and guide support, all climbing permits, expedition food and accommodation, porterage, communications, oxygen, insurance and helicopter rescue, as well as regular access to the IMG medical clinic at Everest Base Camp.
An Everest expedition requires a large financial commitment and every step sponsored by you will go towards financing the expedition and covering all the associated costs. The total cost of the expedition amounts to USD 58,600.
Being a dedicated outdoor adventurer and mountaineer, Johann leads an active lifestyle, with regular fitness training. Training for his second attempt to scale Mount Everest, included cardio, high intensity cardio, strength training, swimming and yoga; high-altitude fitness training including jogging, running and climbing in Nuwara Eliya to get accustomed to a higher altitude; long-distance swimming; special high-altitude training in Ladakh in January 2018 and rock-climbing.
Johann has an impressive track record in mountain climbing. Johann was part of a four-member Sri Lankan team to successfully summit the highest mountain in Africa, Mt. Kilimanjaro.
Their expedition was via the Lemosho Route, which is the longest route to the summit, thereby allowing the team maximum time for acclimatization and thus a safe summit attempt.
Johann was one of the only two out of the five-member team of climbers to successfully summit Island Peak in Nepal, in 2012. Due to the climbs technically challenging nature, Island Peak is considered as one of the training peaks to be summited in preparation for expeditions to the summit of Mt. Everest.
An artist inspired by nature, Johann is a hair-designer by profession and adventurer by choice. His passion for the great outdoors and his creative soul have struck a perfect balance and is evident in his work, life and interests. Johann began his hair-designing career 25 years ago. Taking his innate flair in the beauty and fashion culture a step further, he re-established the local industry to meet international standards by introducing new concepts in bridal-designs and attire, conceptualizing and make-up. Today he is one of the most sought after hair and beauty designers, and amongst the few Sri Lankans in the industry to be globally acclaimed. Presently Johann runs seven salons, four in Sri Lanka, two in Melbourne and one in the United Kingdom.
His career as an artist began long before his venture in to the fashion industry; initially as a professional singer with Mary Anne Singers spanning over 20 years, as an actor in the local English theatre, and as a professional dancer competing and performing at local and international levels.
Johanns interest in exploring the great outdoors was impressed upon him at a very young age by his father, when the duo regularly explored the Knuckles Mountain range in Sri Lanka. This passion drives him to conquer mountains both in Sri Lanka and around the globe. If you wish to be part of this expedition, log on to www.johanneverest2018.com -HS

Revolutionary inclusion
They are gifted in so many ways. They have courage and they are ready to compete. They are admirable athletes- men, woman and children. And it is an honour and privilege to meet them. They may be different but they are an inspiration to everyone else. If they can cope with their problems, then that is something we all can learn from. The Special Olympics is the worlds largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. They have proved that nothing is impossible and that problems are actually opportunities to rise above ones circumstances and celebrate humanity.
Basketball bronze medalists (boys)
The Special Olympics will be held in Abu Dhabi from March 14  21, 2019.
Daily News met up with Chairman, Special Olympics Serendib (Sri Lanka) Dr. A.G.N. Kariyawasam who updated us on Sri Lankas involvement in the Special Olympics.
Kariyawasam feels that helping disabled people in Sri Lanka is his calling and his duty and responsibility.
I have lived in the UK for the last 35 years, and moved to Sri Lanka to look after intellectually disabled people totaling more than 700,000 people in Sri Lanka. They are cornered and ill -treated and put in a category that says they can do nothing for this country. This is far from the truth because actually they can do so many things that even a regular person cannot do, said Dr. Kariyawasam.
Kariyawasam stated that we need to recognize what they can do, highlight this and give them recognition so they might be a benefit to society and it will also benefit them because often they are marginalized.
I have realized that, physical education and sports are the most effective pathway for them to realize their potential. These intellectually disabled have an IQ level of under 70. For those people even though educating them might be a problem, you can train them. If you train them, you will see astounding results. They can perform tasks so efficiently that even a normal person would find hard to do. According to the way you look at things, their limited capacities may actually be more of a help than a hindrance depending on the situation. For example, the blind man can hear better than a person with vision. If ones ability is down the other abilities work at greater efficiency, explained Kariyawasam.
The Special Olympics was founded in July, 20, 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was the sister of John F. Kennedy. Their sister Rosemary was born with intellectual disabilities. Shrivers inspiration for the Special Olympics came from Rosemarys disability.
More than 4.9 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 172 countries. So what we do is, we put them to sports exposing them to events and competitions. So these individuals come out and show their abilities. We also do medical check- ups and vocational therapy so they themselves can recognize what they can do which will help them survive, stated Kariyawasam.
Sri Lanka has been divided into 25 districts which have been placed under the care of directors, so those areas might be controlled. The 50th Anniversary of the Special Olympics is just around the corner. It came to Sri Lanka in 2004. But unfortunately it did not run properly.
I came down to Sri Lanka in 2014 and started it again. Though it is successful, we need some help to ensure the sustainability of the program. For this, one can volunteer to help. We have leadership programs as well to identify the leaders amongst them. We need a place for them to stay so we need help from the government or any voluntary organization. We want all these partners to join with us, and help these deserving people, added Kariyawasam.
Kariyawasam stated that they have faced challenges and difficulties at a time when there was little support. This is because there is very little awareness concerning intellectually disabled people. People do not understand that these intellectually disabled people can contribute to a holistic society.
However with awareness the willingness will come naturally. I believe the citizens of our country will definitely help if we put it to the masses. People would like to help but have no proper idea concerning the situation. So the only path set before us to raise awareness. It should be of national interest. If we have the support then anything is possible. But we need help from volunteers. But due to the rat race in the country, people can only think of their own families. They also work all the time, pointed out KariyawasamThese children are very innocent and they need love. They are very expressive and trusting. However the good news is that there are people who love these children. Even the adults, who are intellectually disabled, are like these children.
Our disabled people arrived at the air- port with gold medals, but there was nobody to accept us. This is sad to say. I am not blaming anyone but this is because there is no awareness. We have been to Australia, Austria, China, America, Greece and Abu Dhabi. But we need funds, said Kariyawasam
Kariyawasam however pointed out that intellectually disabled people who come from poor families face a very serious problem. How can they buy their air tickets They need someone who can be of help when paying for the air ticket, and also for the sports items and sports gear. Normally to get the Special Olympics accreditation there are so many things to do. We entered it in 2004. It however collapsed in 2012.This is because a proper job was not done. They scrapped Special Olympics Sri Lanka and when I came back I could not get the name back. So it went like Special Olympics Serendib. It happened in India and Japan as well. Washington DC is the governing partner.
So I came here in 2014. So the governing body of the Special Olympics tried me out. I did my job properly and then they accredited us, and I am now able to send people abroad, said Kariyawasam.When you look at the outside appearance of these intellectually disabled people you might immediately jump to conclusions about them. They are such nice people because they have no concept of malice or jealousy. They are not selfish. No competition. That is the beauty. But they play cricket like Sanath Jayasuriya. But they are not allowed to play because of these prejudices. But they are batting on. They follow instructions. When they are asked to score a target they go and do it. In football you only need to tell them what to do and they go and accomplish it. I can cry when I see all this. If we at least can buy our air tickets that will be giant step. If we can get the sports gear that too will make such a difference, said Kariyawasam.

The campaign for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is led by the UN in Sri Lanka together with the Ministry of Education in partnership with Hatton National Bank and the Presidential Secretariat in an effort to reach out to school students from across the country to design and implement an SDG based project in their communities.
The launch of these Goals, created a landmark moment in creating a much better world without leaving no one behind by 2030. However, achieving these 17 SDGs is everyones responsibility.
Speaking about the students role in contributing to the SDGs, Secretary to the Ministry of Education, Government of Sri Lanka, Sunil Hettiarachchi said, "This student led campaign shows good potential to serve as an excellent platform to pave a path towards achieving the SDGs in Sri Lanka".
Since the launch of the campaign on 24 October 2017 commemorating UN Day, over 700 schools submitted their proposals and upon evaluation by the partners of the campaign, 50 SDG-centered proposals were selected representing the 25 Districts of Sri Lanka. These schools will now be linked with relevant experts and institutions, enhancing the students' capacity to mobilize the communities around to help Sri Lanka achieve the SDGs.
Speaking about the Campaign, Director, ILO Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the UN Communications Group Chair., Simrin Singh said, "Taking action for the SDGs is a collective effort. From the youngest student to the most experienced teacher, schools play an important role in spreading the word that everyone has a responsibility. The question is no longer if you want your classroom to connect to the world; the question now is simply when.
Speaking about the role of the private sector, Chief Human Resource Officer/ Deputy General Manager of Hatton National Bank, L Chiranthi Cooray said, At HNB we are going to support young Sri Lankans to be part of and practically experience sustainable activities and their results. This programme would be extremely significant to create awareness on the SDG and the triple bottom line for a sustainable planet.
Engaging youth is vital to Sri Lanka achieving the sustainable development to eradicate poverty, address climate change and build peaceful, inclusive societies for all. These projects will help students raise awareness of the SDGs in their communities and also contribute to the 2030 Agenda. In this regard, ensuring the sustainability of these projects is imperative.
Also speaking, Additional Secretary to the President, Rohana Keerthi Dissanayake said, "This campaign recognizes the prominent role school children play in building the country with the concept of the sustainable development. President Maithripala Sirisena and the Government of Sri Lanka stands committed to support this programme to ensure that these projects are sustainable, reaching all communities across the country.

SLFP MPs supporting NCM have no moral right to remain in government: Sagala
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) parliamentarians who supported the Joint Opposition (JO) sponsored No Confidence Motion (|NCM) had no moral right to remain in the government ranks anymore, Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
He was addressing the gathering after handing over a newly built house to Kamal Priyantha and his family of Siyambalagoda, Pitabeddara. Kamal lost his house due to floods recently.
The house was built with contributions from the Sri Lanka Police Seva Vanitha Unit and members of the Community Police Committees in the area.
Minister Ratnayake said Members of Parliament made a correct and bold decision on April 4 to defeat the NCM brought against the Prime Minister and the government.
When the two parties in the Yahapalana government worked hard to defeat the motion, a section of SLFP parliamentarians supported the motion. Although people were questioning the governments stand on SLFP members who supported the motion, the more relevant question was whether those members had the moral right to remain in the government any longer, the Minister said.
Ratnayake said a majority of SLFP MPs who supported the motion were those who entered Parliament through the national list.
The UNP on its part had announced the party reorganisation work beforehand. The reorganisation should be done according to future needs. The past three years were spent on planning development work for the country. The ensuing two years would be devoted to implementation and action, the Minister said.
The governments sole objective was to ensure a better future for the country and its people. Unless this was done, they would not be accepted by the people at the next elections, the Minister said.

Smokey violets are here
This make-up trend is said to be a game-changer in the make-up world this season. Violet hues have been making the rounds, and the best way to experiment with this hue is to do a smokey eye with it. Some people think that smokey eyes are daring and a night-time look. But the truth is when these smokey eyes are highlighted with subtle hues then they can be showcased during the daytime as well. With a few simple steps you can achieve this sophisticated look without looking like a goth chick or an easter egg. Style Caster
How to achieve the look
* Start off with a lilac shimmery eye shadow as the base colour.
* Pack on some black to the outer corner and blend it out so that there are no harsh lines.
* Use a slightly darker shade of purple in the middle of the eyelid to create a smooth transition between the lilac and the black. This goes without saying, but blend so that it looks flawless.
* Find a peachy pink shade and use a fluffy blush to apply it above the crease. This gives it a natural gradient.
* Apply kohl or eyeliner to the lower lash line and smudge it out to give it that smokey effect.
* Tightline your upper water line in order to give your lashes a fuller look.
* Apply mascara, and your purple smokey look is complete.

Speaker unveils Weera Madugalle Nilame Statue in Matale
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya unveiled the new Weera Madugalle Nilame statue opposite the Matale Library and launched the Madugalle website at the 199th death anniversary commemoration of Weera Madugalle Nilame in Matale recently.
National Heroes including Madugalle Nilame who led the Uva Wellassa Rebellion in 1817 and 1818 were earlier named traitors by the British Colonial regime. President Maithripala Sirisena was instrumental in clearing their names from that stigma and naming them national heroes recently.
The commemorative lecture was delivered by Viraj Balasuriya, Lecturer, Fine Arts University.
In the past, there was a group of citizens with greed for power who betryed the nation for monetary and other gains. It was a pity to see certain sections in the present day society too inclined to betray the nation for political and other petty gains.
It was to dispel such anti-national feelings that the government was speaking about national unity and working towards achieving that, he said.
Jayasuriya said he highly appreciated the steps taken by the President to clear the names of members of the national liberation struggle from the stigma attached by British imperial rulers and name them as national heroes.
He said he also wished to thank the Weera Madugalle National Foundation for organising the fitting commemoration ceremony.
Plantation Industries Deputy Minister Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Matale Mayor Diljith Aluvihare, Provincial Council Member Rohana Bandaranayake, former Minister Nandimithra Ekanayake, Weera Madugalle Foundation President Bernard Madugalle and Secretary M.W. Somaratne were present.

Sri Lanka relegates to Group III in 2019
Sri Lanka will play in the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group III in 2019 as they lost their relegation tie against Indonesia 3-1 at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association Clay Courts yesterday. As visitors won two singles and the doubles rubber to claim the tie win, the remaining singles rubber did not play yesterday.
Harshana Godamanna kept Sri Lakan hopes alive winning the second singles against David Susanto 6-3, 6-1 on Saturday after Sharmal Dissanayake lost the first singles rubber over Indonesian number one Christopher Rungkat 6-4, 4-6, 3-0Ret.
Godamanna and Sharmal were defeated by the strong Indonesian pair Christopher Rungkat and Justin Barki in easy straight sets to bag the doubles rubber win and Godamanna lost his second singles against Christopher Rungkat in an exciting three-setter 4-6, 6-4, 6-7.
Godamanna, 33, who played his 51st Davis Cup tie was recognized for his long and invaluable service to the country by the International Tennis Federation before action got underway when he received an ITF Commitment Award. The left-hander then went on the clay courts and proved how much Sri Lanka will miss him in the future, especially in singles, as he dominated Susanto.
Im really proud to get this award, Godamanna said. It wasnt something I planned for or aimed at but it is pretty cool to be in the company of a couple of other Sri Lankans who have given their commitment to the Davis Cup which is a special event.
He is a worthy recipient of this award for he has given a lot to the country, said Suresh Subramaniam, president of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka and a former Davis Cup member too.
The other local recipients of this award are the late Bernard Pinto and Arjun Fernando. Godamanna first represented Sri Lanka at the Davis Cup in 2002 and has now played a record 51 ties including 94 matches  69 singles and 25 doubles  with a 43-15 win-loss record in singles and a 26-10 doubles record.
If I continue after this year, it will be mainly playing doubles. This will be my swansong in singles but I leave with the team in good shape as we have three guys, Sharmal (Dissanayake), Yasitha (de Silva) and Alex (Fairbanks) who are all good prospects for the future. In the past we have depended on one or at most two players but now we have a solid core, Godamanna pointed out.

STAX launches digital offering
STAX, the leading management consultancy in Sri Lanka, announced the launch of a new suite of digital solutions geared towards unleashing the full potential of Sri Lankan corporates.
Regardless of whether a start-up or a long-established business, the newly developed offering is aimed at delivering continuous value throughout the digital value chain.
The STAX offering comprises of a comprehensive suite of services aimed at addressing the core digital requirements of Sri Lankan businesses. Their proprietary Digitization Index is an entry-level solution aimed at assisting companies to identify their current digital positioning in relation to their competitors and global industry benchmarks.
This allows these businesses to understand where they currently stand on the digitization spectrum, and take corrective, or in some cases proactive, steps to ensure long term sustainability.
Stax also supports clients in developing end-to-end digital roadmaps which cover every aspect of an organization from digitalizing customer interactions to optimizing internal operating processes. To ensure value realization, STAX offers implementation support across all its services, ensuring the effective operationalization of strategies.
Stax believes that to remain competitive in todays world, radical digital reinvention is needed. Simply having an e-commerce platform or digitizing customer interactions is insufficient. Real digital reinvention requires rethinking the business itself.
These circumstances create unprecedented challenges, but are also capable of yielding organization-defining success for those firms that can analyze trends and understand their meaning; taking agile decisions that will redefine their core value proposition, Stax Managing Director, Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera said.
Geared towards providing Sri Lankan corporates with the tools necessary to evaluate, launch and grow their digital presence, the Stax approach to digital strategy allows for businesses to analyze key demographics, refine product offerings and accurately gauge consumer behaviour to generate unmatched returns on their digital investments.
With the types of technological advancements that have been steadily entering the Sri Lankan market over the recent past, most corporates are keenly aware that now is the best time to be making investments into the digital space, and to explore opportunities for future growth.
There are already numerous examples of how the changing face of digital is driving economic growth and levelling the competitive playing field, enabling anyone from start-ups to established players to disrupt and compete head-to-head with market leaders through the deployment of a smart digital strategy. Therefore, Stax is confident of a major boom in digital investments over the short to medium term, Dr. Gunasekera explained.
Founded in Boston almost 25 years ago, Stax has earned a reputation for delivering rich insight-driven consulting solutions that open-up incremental and transformative growth opportunities for clients.
Its clientele spans a diverse range from mid-sized corporates and family businesses to some of the worlds largest investment funds and Fortune 500 companies. With its entry into the Sri Lankan market in 2005, the company is now Sri Lankas leading management consulting firm with a well-established reputation for in-depth fact-based analysis and invaluable business insight.

Telecom manpower employees will be fully supported until their problems resolved: Rajitha
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne promised his full support to Telecom manpower employees until their problems are completely resolved.
He said problems faced by these employees should be settled step by step.
Although Telecom is a private company, it operated on its own without being a burden on the government.
Dr. Senaratne was addressing a meeting held at the BMICH, Colombo to mark the absorption of 452 Telecom manpower employees to the permanent cadre of the company recently. Dr. Senaratne, who said that communication was an integral part of the governments development effort, added that the balance 1,000 manpower workers in Telecom should also be granted job permanency.
Discussion was the best means to resolve problems. Chairman of Telecom is the brother of President Maithripala Sirisena and he should use the sword in his hand in the proper manner, the Minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said that the system of deploying workers on contract basis was first started by the Bank of Ceylon .
As a politician and trade union leader, he had taken an active part in getting them absorbed into the permanent cadre. Bank of Ceylon contract workers obtained permanent status after a struggle. Telecom manpower workers too obtained job permanency after a struggle. However, Chairman of Telecom had promised to absorb all manpower workers into the permanent cadre by the end of 2019, the Minister said.
Now their salaries should be increased as they contributed towards bringing the yahapalana government into power, the Minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said the manner the company recruited manpower workers was questionable. They were fully aware about the sources which gained financially from it.
These sources earlier loved money more than the country. They waited for the opportune time and defeated the previous regime to steer the country on the correct path rather than to install another leader, he said.
He said the government had performed that duty and brought about a clear change for the better.
Sri Lanka Telecom Chairman Kumarasinghe Sirisena and the members of the Board of Directors and Telecom employees were present.

Trip ends in death for five
A trip by a group of garment factory workers from Hanwella ended in tragedy when five of them were drowned in the Dalukoya, a tributary of the Huluganga in Panwila after wading into it for a bath on Saturday afternoon.
They were identified as Shirlene Andira Benz (26) Gajana Sivanandan (26) Fathima Asma Niyaz (23) Mahen Susil Manjula (30) and Priyankara Premakumara (28).
They had been carried away by a sudden surge of water in the waterway due to heavy rain experienced in the area.
The Police said their bodies were found about a one kilometre downstream from the black bridge two hours after the tragedy. The deceased are residents of Kandy, Gurudeniya, Ganemulla, Wattala and Kirindiwela. Police investigations are continuing.
Meanwhile, villagers in the area said they had not seen such a surge in water levels at Dalukoya for the past 7 years.
Haja Mohideen, a resident in the area told the Daily News that warnings have been issued not to bathe in the Dalukoya but many people especially those come from outside ignore them.
He said those who come from outside could get fooled by the calmness and the depth of water levels of Dalukoya but when there is heavy rain upstream the speed and the water levels could surge suddenly and unexpectedly which is what happened on that fateful Saturday.

United endeavour to enhance economy
The change of regime in 2015 January raised peoples aspirations for a positive social and political transformation. Many people felt that the country could move away from the conflictual past to a more peaceful future. They also expected that their myriad of problems could now be managed by a regime committed to the well known principles of good governance. But, after three years since the formation of the new government, peoples hopes have been largely dashed and the country is embroiled in an unprecedented political crisis and nobody knows how we are going to get out of it.
As I pointed out in several articles in these columns immediately after the formation of the new regime in 2015, some of the key constituents of the new regime represented extremely contradictory political views that it was virtually impossible for them to pursue a collective programme of reform. This was evident throughout the three year period and this became quite clear whenever the government leaders were forced to take a firm stand on important public policy issues. Yet, they could not do so because the regime was caught between two very different ideological positions that I have described as corrosive neoliberalism and violent ethno-nationalism in the political domain.
As is well known, neoliberalism was embraced by many countries since the late 1970s and some of them have since then made many economic gains by way of FDI, technology transfer and rapid economic growth. China is the most notable example in the world but there are many others in East Asia and elsewhere. Though deficient in terms of democratic governance and civil liberties, the technocratic nature of the regimes enabled these countries to manage their economic development process in an efficient manner by making necessary public investments in such areas as education, research, institution building and essential infrastructure development without wasting borrowed money on economically and socially useless projects. But, Sri Lanka by and large mismanaged the development process and allowed industries we had built over many decades to collapse.
Agro-based industries
We put all our eggs in one basket, i.e. the garments industry and, with increasing wages due to inflation and devaluation of the rupee, many people started migrating to other countries. Many low end garment enterprises migrated to countries with cheaper labour. Successive governments were happy to promote the exodus to earn much needed foreign exchange, without realising the negative effect of labour migration on the domestic economy, in particular rural agriculture.
The neglect of agriculture resulted in loss of employment and livelihoods in rural areas, increasing food prices and declining crop diversification. Instead of scientifically managing the sector, populist governments took short term, popular measures to appease the rural voter, making the latter dependent on subsidies such as highly subsidised inputs and income support. Yet, many youth had no interest in agriculture due to its precarious nature as a source of income.
The main reason was that agricultural sector has remained stagnant due to lack of crop diversification, neglect of agricultural research leading to almost total collapse of agricultural research institutions, devaluation of agricultural extension and the lack of development of agro-based industries to create more lucrative employment opportunities in rural areas. Moreover, liberal import policies led to the collapse of many rural industries, forcing many people to leave rural areas.
Persistently low public investments in education did not help improve its quality, making many of the products of public educational institutions unfit for highly skilled and productive employment in a competitive labour market. This situation encouraged the private education sector ranging from private tuition classes through international schools to private higher educational establishments in urban centres. Products of private educational institutions and those who returned from overseas education filled most of the vacancies in the private sector.
Meanwhile, the products of public educational institutions in general were left out of more lucrative employment in the corporate sector. The situation became serious with the rapid expansion of the public university system over the last three decades without commensurate increase in budgetary allocations for general and higher education.
While the quality of education either stagnated or declined, successive governments continued to absorb university graduates into state institutions to fill non-existent jobs. Almost random deployment of new recruits in diverse state institutions without any training or preparation not only did not contribute to their performance and productivity but also created a demoralised and frustrated youthful workforce.
Public finances
The stagnant or even declining state revenue due to diverse reasons coupled with gross mismanagement of public finances deprived many important sectors of adequate resources. The most notable among them have been public transport, health and higher education and research. Neglect of health and public transport has resulted in the stagnation of public transport and health services, forcing many people to find private solutions, making the situation even worse. As regards the neglect of research, consequences have been even more damaging to the economy.
As is well known, both developed as well as developing countries today compete with each other on the strength of their technological capabilities. Countries that invest heavily in R and D usually have an edge over the others because the former can either improve the quality of their export products or introduce new products into the global market. Many East Asian countries have done extremely well in this regard.
Global university rankings put many East Asian universities ahead of the universities in other parts of the non-western world. The same pattern is evident in the registration of patents across the world. Most recent university rankings show that none of the South Asian universities appear in the first hundred universities in Asia, let alone Sri Lankan ones. None of our universities is included even in the first 2000 universities in the world.
As indicated above, it is research and development that enable countries to improve production processes or introduce new products into the market. So, it is critically important to invest in R and D. Since there are no large industrial firms in Sri Lanka with their own infrastructure for research, public financing of research is indispensable. Yet, governments have not given high priority for research, and the consequences are clear.
One practical way to address the issue would have been to actively pursue joint ventures with overseas firms with high technological capacity. This would have helped the country not only diversify the product mix but also convert raw materials currently exported into finished industrial products. This would have also helped develop our own technological capacity through technology transfer and the development of skills among local employees.
What is outlined above shows the developments challenges we have faced over the years and how we would have overcome them by adopting strategies that have worked in other countries. But, what had been missing in the case of Sri Lanka has been the absence of an enlightened political elite.
Our political leaders have been either extremely inward looking, confined to their close social circles in Colombo, reproducing themselves through exchange of favours and sharing the social surplus produced by hapless masses through corrupt practices or extremely archaic and parochial, making use of backward segments of society to gain and retain power and privilege for them and their retinue while preventing the country from making any progress on any front. What is common to both the elites are corruption and abuse of power.
Rapid economic growth
As a result, neoliberalism that has enabled many countries in the region and elsewhere to promote rapid economic growth has been turned into an extremely corrosive force by one faction of the political elite that thrives on gross inequalities and injustices in society, the other faction has used ethno-nationalism to lead the country on a downward spiral of inter-community discord, corruption, economic stagnation and increasing misery for the vast majority of ordinary people. As a result, today, the country is torn between two powerful but equally negative political forces.
The challenge before the right thinking citizens is to find an alternative path to development, public welfare and national unity, that helps the country to move away from both corrosive neoliberalism and violent ethno-religious nationalism. The future well-being of the ordinary masses will depend on whether the progressive political forces succeed in taking the country on the alternative path mentioned above.

Villa manager Bruce rounds on own players after defeat
LONDON, Saturday - Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce accused his players of letting themselves and the supporters down after a limp 3-1 defeat to Norwich City effectively ended their hopes of automatic promotion from the second-tier Championship.
Winger Josh Murphys curling 25-yard strike was the highlight for Norwich as fourth-placed Villa succumbed to their third defeat in five games to remain seven points behind second-placed Cardiff City, who have a game in hand.
The players have let the supporters down - and they have also let themselves and the team down, said Bruce.
Fulham look the only side who can catch Cardiff, whom they trail by two points having played a game more, after Aleksandar Mitrovics ninth goal in as many games earned the Londoners a 1-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday.
Matej Vydras 20th goal of the season helped Derby County stay on course for a playoff spot with a 3-0 home win over Bolton. Sixth-placed Middlesbrough ensured an unhappy return for former manager Aitor Karanka to the Riverside by beating his new side Nottingham Forest 2-0.
Close behind, Millwall beat Bristol City 2-0 to extend their unbeaten run in the league to 15 games.
At the other end, Sunderland look doomed in 23rd place after squandering the lead to draw 1-1 at Leeds United. Barnsley, however, could yet spring an escape after beating local rivals Sheffield United 3-2, a result that effectively ends the Blades playoff hopes.
Hull City definitely look safe after thumping Queens Park Rangers 4-0.  Agencies
