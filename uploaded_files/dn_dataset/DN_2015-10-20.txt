Govt MPs raise questions over 'time lines'of commission reports
The Government MPs Group yesterday raised a question as to why the Udalagama and Paranagama Commission reports were not tabled in Parliament before the adoption of the UNHRC resolution over Sri Lanka.
They had raised questions over the timelines of the release of the documents when the group met at the Parliamentary premises yesterday.
Responding to their questions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said tabling the Udalagama and Paranagama reports in Parliament after the UNHRC resolution was strategically advantageous to the country.
The Prime Minister has also told the Government MP group that these reports have extensively dealt with individual cases and made recommendations. Meanwhile, Minister Rajitha Senaratne, speaking at the group meeting, had said that the public should be made aware of the parametres and the composition of the war crimes inquiry mechanism.
"If there is an involvement of foreign judges and prosecutors," the minister said, "that should be done in line with the country's existing laws."

Govt. to probe former Colombo University VC
The government is planning to probe former Colombo University Vice Chancellor Kumara Hirimburegama for handing over campus land to a private company, Parliament was told yesterday.
A property donated by late Dr. Shiva Chinnathambi to set up a girls hostel was
given on contract by the former Vice Chancellor of the Colombo University Kumara Hirimburegama to a private company to run a mall for two years, University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said the CID and the Presidential Commission looking into corruption have been notified of this and they are investigating the matter.
The minister also said the CID is investigating what happened to the furniture and other goods that were in the house at the time it was donated. JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake raising a question said the CID has a complete report of the furniture that had been there in the house and an MP sitting in the front row in Parliament had allegedly taken them away.
That particular MP was sitting on the fifth seat from the seat of the Leader of the House. If possible, the government could take him into custody.
Minister Kiriella said this in response to the oral question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa.

According to Minister Karunatilleke, four main facts will be highlighted at the programme and they are: the importance of drinking clean water, importance of eating nutritious food, avoiding unhealthy food and avoiding tobacco and alcohol.
The programme organised by the UNESCO section of Royal Collage, Colombo, has been accepted by all schools in the Colombo Educational Zone and assisted by the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry, World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF and NATA.
Minister Karunatilleke said the funds allocated for free health and education will be further increased from the next budget and it will surpass the allocations made by the previous government.
Sri Lanka has controlled communicable diseases similar to developed countries but NCDs are rapidly increasing. Children are also becoming victims of NCDs. Over 15 percent of school children in Colombo city are overweight.
This is a very timely programme organised to save our future generation from NCDs and make them healthy, he said.

Kondaya goes to HRC
Former convener of the IUSF, a member of the Activists for Human Rights Organisation and the Lawyers for Rights Udul Premaratne yesterday lodged a complaint at the Human Rights Commission on behalf of Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya.
He was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi in Kotadeniyawa and released on Monday.
"I met Dunesh recently and he requested me to appear for him as the aggrieved party in the case of rape and murder of Seya. He told me that the CID did not allow him at anytime to meet a lawyer or seek legal advice. He also told me that he had never made a confession as reported in the media and he did not know anything about what happened to Seya," Premaratne said.
He told the Daily News that according to information revealed by Dunesh, the CID had severely assaulted him when he was in their custody and they had taken his signature for a confession prepared by them.
"They also did not allow Dunesh to meet anyone else," he said.
"The CID on Monday requested the Minuwangoda Magistrate to release Dunesh as his DNA report did not match with the samples taken from the scene of the crime. But they previously said that Kondaya had in detail confessed about the murder. Now it is doubtful, why they requested the magistrate to release him without taking legal action against Dunesh for misleading the police and CID if he had made such a confession," Premaratne questioned.
The Police and the CID have tarnished Dunesh's image. He has been physically and mentally affected, he said.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said a suspect could not be named as an accused just because he or she had made a statement to police in connection with a crime.
He said a statement by the suspect held no legal value until police investigations found evidence to prove that the statement was true.
ASP Gunasekara said: "A statement doesn't make a suspect an accused or he cannot be named as the main suspect in a crime. As the Police Spokesman, I never said Dunesh Priyashantha confessed to the crime. All he did was make a statement".
He said the police had to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt based on the evidence that had been collected and however, admitting in Court to having committed a crime can be considered as part of the evidence.

New laws to curb social media slander
The Justice Ministry is contemplating new laws to control defamation and slander over social media following a proposal by the Law Commission to consider such cases as offences punishable under the criminal law.
More than 2,000 complaints involving Facebook and Twitter were reported to the authorities in the first seven months of this year, newly released figures revealed. According to Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT CC), officers across the country saw a sharp rises in the number of people complaining that they had been abused, harassed and threatened on the popular social media sites. The soaring volume of crimes associated with Facebook and Twitter has placed increasing pressure on the authorities.
Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe responding to the proposals by the Law Commission at a public event said his ministry was currently studying several proposals in this regard and hinted that new laws might be drafted soon.
According to Police, Facebook slander has been the main reason for several suicides which occurred in recent times, with the victims mainly being youth.
Meanwhile, SLERT CC says that around 80 percent of social media complaints revolve around fake accounts.

No misconduct on part of Red Cross technical officer
An inquiry panel has exonerated a technical officer of the Sri Lanka Red Cross against whom a complaint had been lodged by a beneficiary, that the former demanded sexual favours for fast tracking payment to rebuild her house in Kilinochchi. Following is the official statement issued by the SLRCS: "In early October, the SLRCS Kilinochchi Branch received a written complaint from a Red Cross beneficiary, that a SLRCS technical officer requested sexual favours in return for faster process of payments of a cash grant to rebuild her house.
The woman in question had qualified for the grant under the Red Cross Post-Conflict Recovery Programme in Mulakavil, Kilinochchi. The programme is funded by the Indian government. The SLRCS and IFRC take any allegation of this nature extremely seriously and appropriate action was immediately taken to investigate the complaint.
The President of SLRCS launched an inquiry which was carried out by several members of the SLRCS Governing Board who visited Kilinochchi. However, this initial inquiry proved inconclusive.
The President and the office of the IFRC in Sri Lanka then launched a second inquiry and appointed a five person panel which comprised of men and women from the IFRC and from the SLRCS headquarters and branches. A representative from the Consulate General of India in Jaffna also joined the panel.
The panel began its inquiry on October 11 in Kilinochchi. They interviewed the beneficiary who made the complaint and 15 other people including nine SLRCS staff members. On October 16, the panel sent its findings to the President of SLRCS.
In its conclusions, the panel found no credible evidence to support the complaint relating to misconduct on the part of the SLRCS technical officer. The panel did find that the allegations had an internal dimension which will be addressed in accordance with the constitution of the SLRCS.
The Red Cross believes that it is vitally important to ensure transparency in responding to such a complaint. Despite the fact that no evidence was found from the inquiry to support the allegation that was leveled, under the instructions of the President of SLRCS, the report and documents from the inquiry was handed over to the Ministry of Law and Order and Prison Reforms on October 20, 2015, in the event that they decide to take the matter further.
Red Cross give beneficiaries of the Indian Housing programme only technical assistance not cash. Sri Lanka Red Cross Society does not at point get involved in providing cash directly to the beneficiaries of the Indian Government sponsored 50,000 housing programme in Sri Lanka."

Over 4,000 MBBS doctors unable to obtain transfers granted by PSC
Over 4,000 MBBS doctors are stuck in their work places without being able to obtain the transfers granted to them by the Public Service Commission (PSC). The Hospital Directors are ignoring the order given by the Commission, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr.Nalinda Herath said.
Addressing media in Colombo yesterday,Dr. Herath said that a doctor who is acting as the Public Relations Coordinator to the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister is purposely preventing the GMOA from meeting Minister Senaratne. "Therefore, the GMOA will inform the Public Service Commission about the Health Ministry officials who ignore the orders given by the commission," he said.
According to Dr. Hearth, state hospitals located at rural and difficult areas do not get qualified doctors due to this situation. The Health Ministry officials are trying to use the issue in order to transfer doctors according to their wishes without implementing the proper and accepted transfer system.
Meanwhile, during a recent ceremony held at Maradana, Suduwella Minister Senaratne had stated that the reason for closing down some rural hospitals is stopping the recruitment of Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) and Assistant Medical Practitioners (AMP). Around 12 rural hospitals in the Kandy District had been closed down due to lack of doctors. Minister Senaratne had also stated that there is a shortage of doctors in Sri Lanka and it will exist at least for another eight years. The medical students who are now in Medical faculties will not be able to meet the country's demand for doctors. It is wrong if recruiting RMPs and AMPs stopped giving into the demands of trade unions because the demand for doctors' service exist in the country cannot be met without RMPs and AMPs.

Police force  enhancing rights of the people
The police is the official organization that is responsible to protect people and property, make people obey the law, find out about and solve crime, and catch people who commit crimes. According to the Departmental Orders an OIC of a local police station is responsible to ensure proper investigation of crime, maintenance of law and order and effective preventive action against crime. An OIC is also responsible for giving proper instructions to the personnel under him and the maintenance of good discipline. There are others such as ASPs, SSPs, DIGs and IGP who oversee the police duties for enhancing the rights of the people.
Policing is a unique and demanding career. It is however incredibly  physically and emotionally  a stressful job. If we need to take our country forward, as law enforcement officers, Police officers, are required to be fully well aware of their proper responsibilities towards the people and the country.
In my view, police officers represent the government in power. How they behave and their conduct effect the good name of the government  in other words police officers are government representatives for all purposes. It is, therefore, imperative that police department should be compelled to live up to the highest possible standards of professional policing. Does this happen
Crime and violence
The Vision as it appears in the official web site of the Police  Towards a peaceful environment to live with confidence, without fear of crime and violence. Can the citizens be happy that the Police have lived up to the VISION The former Secretary of Defence in a speech at the opening of the Sri Lanka Police at Thimbirigaskattuwa, Negombo sometime back had emphasized the urgent need for reorientation of police functions to suit the current needs of the country after being heavily involved in operations connected with the thirty year war. According to him the police personnel had forgotten their role as peace officers owing to their preoccupation with the war.
The former Secretary of Defence had also referred to media reports carried practically every day about police indiscipline, misdeeds, abuse of power, brutal treatment of suspects under arrest and other inadequacies. It must also not be forgotten particularly in the police department promotions were never considered by the previous regime without political interference and thrust. I recall a certain Chief Minister openly stated that his policy was to give preference to those belonging to his party. The same Chief Minister has accused that police personnel change overnight similar to changing clothes. It speaks volumes because there have been instances when eligible police officers could not get their due promotions without political support.
Sri Lanka Police, If they need to raise the standards of the police force in order to make it a professional police force, now that the Police Commission has been established, they should be provided with good advice and counsel to help them to perform their duties within the law in a consistent manner using the powers and duties, conferred to them by statutes and specific orders without political interference.
The former Defence Secretary had also pointed out that the police force must restore its image to play its role efficiently and effectively in reducing, if not eliminating, crime and social indiscipline. It is therefore the responsibility of the newly elected government to take meaningful steps in that direction.
Illicit drug business, liquor, politicians conniving with unlawful activity such as gemming, sand mining, jungle clearing for giving government lands for political henchmen, timber felling etc. had continued unabated owing to political patronage during the former government. The law enforcement officers should be pressurized to strive hard to behave ethically  to do the right thing. Can they do it Do they uncover crime
Due to poor quality of service of police personnel, there has been severe criticism for using force or violence.
A good police officer should be driven by a strong and sincere motivation to help better other peoples lives and situations, protect those who cannot protect themselves and make a positive development in the country. They should feel a sense of duty and commitment to community notwithstanding the inherent risk and dangers of the job.
The fundamental duties of a police officer therefore include serving the community; safe-guarding the lives and property; protecting the innocent; keeping the peace; and ensuring the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice.
Police Commission
In order to achieve all these objectives, they should perform their duties impartially, without fear or favour, affection or ill will and without regard to status, sex race, religion or political involvements. In addition, they should also treat all citizens equally, with courtesy, consideration and dignity. The restoration of the Police Commission will no doubt contribute to the upliftment of the image of the police force.
It must be pointed out that the last parliamentary elections can be quoted as a good example how to improve the police force. The Commissioner of Elections and the IGP were able to carry out their duties impartially to ensure clean, independent and unbiased election because there was no political interference.
It has been revealed that the police force does not have the necessary personnel adequately to man the police stations now scattered all over the country. In addition, if the police service needs to be improved; the principle of meritocracy in recruitment and a better class of recruits will have to be attracted while retaining capable and dedicated men, and paying them better salaries than at present. Most importantly, political interference should be discouraged totally, an essential criteria for the future.
I am extremely fortunate for having had the opportunity to work with a team of excellent police officers in my present capacity (Secretary to the Presidential Commission) in PRECIFAC. I have identified (from an administrative point of view) the team led by ASP Lalith Abeysekera, and Chief Inspector Geethika Bodhipaksha, possess the following core competencies of law enforcement/investigation officers:
 Ability to use good judgment and problem solving skills,
 Capacity for excellent multi-tasking skills,
 Ability demonstrate courage and taking up responsibilities,
 Capacity for engaging in good team work and ability to collaborate,
 Ability to be resourceful and show initiative,
 Capacity to demonstrate assertiveness in abundance,
 Ability to show empathy, diplomacy and compassion
My honest feeling is that the police force is not short of good, honest and capable officers. They are not being allowed to work independently and majority of the serving police officers are frustrated. The police force is a neglected department because their wages have not been looked into by a single government in the past.
Police takes care of numerous duties such as VIP, child, environment protection, vehicular traffic management etc. and they do not therefore have ample time to engage themselves on their other legitimate duties. Police officers are excessively over-burdened and inadequately paid  these are matters that needs to be addressed without delay. Criminal Investigation Department is another unique department that has earned a good name having been able to track down offenders and suspects, analyse criminal offences etc.
A police sergeant with nearly two decades or more in service does not take even fifteen thousand rupees home at the end of the month, which is extremely low compared to other public sector employees. The police force is so badly underpaid and they should be paid better if the government intends to take the country forward. A police sergeant told me that he did not have the money to pay the electricity bill. Out of sympathy, I paid the bill because he has school-going children. I am personally aware his wife earns a little extra for the family by making halapa and the government must consider a decent salary for the police officers in the first place.
Higher educational qualifications
A policeman in the course of his duties naturally comes across all types of people in society. In my view, the seniors expect undoubtedly, a young man just over 56 dressed in a uniform with a baton and a whistle could perform the duties well  this needs to be changed. Men who could be developed to be an excellent police officer cannot be found on highways and byways. They should be carefully sought after. In the past a good athlete or a cricketer or a stout centre-forward will be preferred to a guy who possesses higher educational qualifications. We should look forward to recruit educated, capable young men to man the police force. Having recruited capable young men their promotional path should be secured because it was political henchmen who got promotions, when in fact capable, honest, straight-forward office stagnated without political support. The newly established Police Commission must initially take necessary steps to upgrade the police department; because they are responsible for ensuring a high standard of professionalism. Meaningful steps also needs to be taken to enhance their level of professionalism and competence. Commission should ensure that they deal firmly when they find police officers bring discredit to the police force.

Political trifles, nave alliances and revealing revelations
President Maithripala Sirisena's sibling Dudley Sirisena, a businessman who often operates behind the scene when it comes to political matters, facilitated meeting between President Sirisena and former Western Province Chief Minister, UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunga last week. The meeting was held at President Sirisena's personal residence at Paget Road.
The UPFA Parliamentarian, needless to say, is still a staunch backer of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is facing a surfeit of issues on the anti-corruption front. When the former President appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Large Scale Corruption last week, Ranatunga was among the few SLFP MPs who accompanied him. It is in this context that the meeting between President Sirisena and Ranatunga can be interpreted as a significant development from the viewpoint of SLFP supporters.
At the meeting, which lasted for more than half an hour, the former Western Province Chief Minister urged President Sirisena to think twice before dissolving the UPFA coalition. He said the party should work with the UPFA at the forthcoming Local Government election and should give recognition for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He stressed both President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa should work together to strengthen the party's campaign for the Local Government election fixed for early next year.
During the meeting with President Sirisena, Ranatunga also urged his party leader to protect himself from whom he termed as 'tale carriers' who have surrounded the President. He said such elements had already caused a great damage to the party.
President Sirisena, in response, did not explicitly say he would allow the party to work with the minor stakeholders of the UPFA. The President said he would "do the needful" to protect the unity of the party and strengthen the SLFP.
The Parliamentarian's meeting with President Sirisena suggests that the party is already in a state of confusion over the Local Government polls. Although the President has expressed willingness to lead the party's campaign for the Local Government election, the rank and file is doubtful whether the party will be able to achieve a significant victory at the election. It is obvious that the party's defeat at the Parliamentary election in August will make a debilitating impact on the SLFP campaign in March. It is in this context that the party is desperately looking for trump cards to turn the tables on the UNP, which will enter the electoral fray with a clear edge.
Meanwhile, eight political parties in the opposition are now holding discussion to contest the election as a new opposition alliance. The eight parties are minor constituent parties of the UPFA and they are of the firm belief that the SLFP will distance itself from the coalition before the March election. National Freedom Front, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, Desha Vimukthi Janatha Party, Lanka Sama Samaja Party, Communist Party of Sri Lanka and Democratic Left Front are the parties that are currently holding discussions to form an opposition coalition. They are already in touch with a group of SLFP MPs who are die-hard supporters of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It would be questionable to some as to how parties such as the National Freedom Front and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya work could form an alliance with traditional left parties like the LSSP and the CP. While the NFF and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya demonstrate ultra - nationalist leanings, traditional Left parties push for devolution of power and a comprehensive political solution to the Tamil question.
Former MP N.Raviraj
Prof. Tissa Vitharana
"When working within a coalition, parties do not have to agree on all matters. We will have our ideological differences. But, we will work together with a common understanding when it comes to core matters," LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitarana told the Daily News. He added that his party, while working within the framework of a leftist coalition with three other political parties, is also exploring the possibility of entering into a broader alliance with other political parties of the opposition.
It is now clear that the war crimes inquiry mechanism, suggested by the US and other member nations of the UNHRC, would be the main rallying point for the parties in the opposition striving to form a new alliance ahead of the election. While the NFF, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and other ultra nationalist parties dub the domestic mechanism as an attempt to betray "war heroes", the old left parties claim the domestic inquiry amounts to undue interference by the US and other powerful western nations. This has allowed them to find a common ground where all eight parties could work together as an alliance in their battle against the government.
The SLFP, on the other hand, has extended its support to a local inquiry mechanism supported by international stakeholders such as the UN and Commonwealth. The UNP and the SLFP, two main partners of the national unity government, are on the same page about measures towards accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Therefore, there is a serious difference of opinion between the SLFP and other stakeholders of the UPFA over the war crimes inquiry mechanism.
Main objective behind opposition political alliance
It is nave to believe that these parties are strong enough to field a formidable team that can pose a challenge to mainstream political parties at an island wide election. The discussion to form an alternate political alliance is nothing but a pressure tactic to prevent the SLFP from pulling out of the UPFA alliance. If and when the SLFP decides to go solo, it will plunge minor constituent parties of the UPFA into a precarious situation. Such a situation will compel the UPFA minor parties alliance to draw a section of SLFP MPs into the alliance. This group, in all probability, will be the section supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This will lead to a split in the SLFP before the Local Government election.
The SLFP MP group held a meeting with President Sirisena on Monday evening to discuss the party's plans for the Local Government election. At the meeting, the President said the Local Government polls would be held under the new electoral system. It was a strong indication that the Local Government election might get delayed a few more months, as the Election authorities are yet to finalize delimitation.
The SLFP think tank believes that delaying the Local Government election would be advantageous to the party as the President can use that 'interim period' to consolidate his power and strengthen the party. The President launched a drastic reform process in the party immediately after the Parliamentary election and consolidated his power in all key decision making bodies of the party. The SLFP top rung think that holding the Local Government election under the new electoral system would give the SLFP some additional time to tie up the loose ends of its machinery and to come out of the 'defeatist mentality' stemming from the party's defeat at the Parliamentary election.
President Maithripala Sirisena has entrusted Minister S.B. Dissanayake with the task of finalizing party reforms before the Local Government election. Dissanayake, who became a strong Maithripala loyalist after the Presidential election, is a person who has adopted a hostile approach towards minor constituents of the UPFA. Dissanayake's appointment as the 'competent authority' when it comes to party reforms is a strong sign that the party is drifting away from the UPFA.
Gammanpila - Dinesh - Prasanna - Bandula meet at Gamini Lokuge's house
Gamini Lokuge, MP
Meanwhile, several representatives from the opposition parties, including Udaya Gammanpila, Dinesh Gunawardena met with a group of SLFP MPs at MP Gamini Lokuge's house in Colombo on Monday night to discuss the way forward. The SLFP group included Lokuge, Bandula Gunawardena and Prasanna Ranatunga. At the meeting, they unanimously agreed that the SLFP should not abandon other political parties of the opposition when it comes to the Local Government election. However, the issue is the SLFP MPs who attended the meeting do not have significant national level responsibilities.
However, the group arrived at the agreement to hold 'balamandala' level meetings, across the country, to pressurize the party's decision-making bodies to work hand in hand with minor parties of the UPFA. It was somewhat similar to the plan they adopted to ensure nomination for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest on the UPFA ticket at the Parliamentary election.
Pilleyan linked to three high profile murders
Former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan has already been arrested in connection with the murder of former TNA MP Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan. In addition to that, the investigations are underway into the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda and murder of Nadaraja Raviraj. Interestingly, evidence gathered by the CID so far points to a connection of some sort among the three cases.
Pararajasingham was shot at while attending a Christmas mass in 2005 in his hometown Batticaloa. Nadaraja Raviraj, an outspoken Tamil Parliamentarian, was killed in Colombo on November 10, 2006, and journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, a vociferous critique of the previous government, was disappeared two days before the Presidential election in 2010.
The former TNA parliamentarian s murdered a day after he led a protest opposite the UN office in Colombo against the alleged death of 45 civilians in Vakarai due to bombings. Two persons on a motorbike shot at him while the politician was leaving his personal residence in Narahenpita. His bodyguard Lakshman Lokuwella also died in the shooting.
The CID made a significant breakthrough in investigations into Raviraj's murder when it arrested three Navy officers in March, over the matter. It was later revealed that the main suspect of the Parliamentarian's murder had fled to Switzerland. He was identified as Cheran, a person who worked closely with members of the Sri Lankan military.
The CID has now sought assistance from the Swiss government to arrest Charan who is presently in hiding.
Charan is said to be a close ally of the former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan. According to Police sources, the firearm used in the murder of Raviraj had been given by a military officer. The same officer, interestingly, came under investigation in connection with the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda too.
CID investigations revealed that the military officer in question had handed over the weapon to Pilleyan and subsequently Pilleyan had given it to Charan.
Four people have been taken into custody so far over the murder of Raviraj and two of them have agreed to become state witnesses.
In another development with regard to inquiries into Raviraj's murder, the CID, on Tuesday, informed Colombo Additional Magistrate that the Attorney General has given instructions to conduct a non-summary inquiry into the killing of the former MP.
Filing a further report before Colombo Additional Magistrate Nirosha Fernando, the CID informed that the non-summary inquiry into the incident is to be held in respect of six suspects including several navy officers.
The Court was further informed that the Attorney General has given instructions to conduct the non-summary inquiry within a period of two weeks and the suspects who had been out on bail were noticed to appear before Court on next hearing date.
The CID also told Court that they were yet to receive a DNA report in respect of the blood samples. Two suspects Prasad Hettiarachchi and Gamini Seneviratne, who were arrested in connection with the incident, were ordered to be further remanded till November 3 by the Additional Magistrate.
CID reaches breakthrough in investigation into Eknaligoda disappearance
Investigations into the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda also reached an important stage last week with the CID finding evidence to suggest that the journalist was killed a few days after his abduction.
The investigation teams have unearthed evidence to suggest that he may have been killed and dumped in the sea off Trincomalee, following his abduction in Colombo.
Police said Ekneligoda may have been taken to a camp in Soriwila in the Manampitiya area before being murdered and dumped in the sea off Trincomalee. According to sources, one of the suspects under arrest in connection with the case has said that Ekneligoda's body was first buried in Soriwila.
"The CID teams handling investigations found information to suggest that Eknaligoda's body had later surfaced due to the flooding of the pit and following this, the body had been removed from the site and had been dumped into the sea," a highly placed Police source told the Daily News.
Investigations revealed that two Army Intelligence Division members, who are already in CID custody, abducted Ekneligoda in 2010. They were former LTTE members belonging to the Karuna faction.
It is believed that Eknaligoda may have been killed in a transit camp at Mannampitiya, which was under the control of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, and Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan. At the time Eknaligoda was abducted, Pilleyan had acted as the officer in charge of the camp. Placing an army camp under a para-military group leader alone is a serious lapse on the part of the military!
Meanwhile, information has surfaced that Ekneligoda's disappearance was due to direct orders by a high ranking individual in the defence establishment during the time of the previous regime. Eknaligoda was abducted two days before the Presidential election in 2010.
At present, 11 suspects including several Army Officers are still in CID custody and investigations are ongoing. Among them are Lt. Col. Shammi Kumara Ratnayake, Lt. Col. Siriwardena, Staff Sergeant Rajapakse, Corporal Jayalath, retired Sergeant Maj. Ranbanda, Sergeant Maj. Upasena, retired Corporal Ranjith Rupasena, Corporal Anurajeewa and ex-LTTE intelligence members Thavendran and Satya Master. In addition, the CID has also questioned Brigadier Aruna Wanniarachchi, a senior military officer who was previously attached to the intelligence wing, for nearly six hours, in connection with Eknaligoda's disappearance.
Investigations ruffle certain military feathers
Police sources hinted at the possibility of a former official, who played a significant role in the defence apparatus in the country, being questioned by the CID over the journalist's disappearance. The official is already facing numerous investigations on the anti-corruption front.
The CID teams took the suspects to the Girithale Army camp last week, under the protection of the Military Police, to identify places where the abducted journalist was allegedly kept. It was revealed that the journalist had been detained at the Girithale army camp for more than five days. During the first two days, he had been questioned over a booklet titled 'family tree' and his alleged associations with former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who was then a Presidential candidate. After questioning, the journalist had been subjected to torture for nearly three days.
However, investigations into the cases involving Raviraj and Eknaligoda have ruffled a lot of feathers among sections of the defence establishment in Sri Lanka. Some members of the defence establishment are of the view that the investigations have exposed the names of intelligence wing members who operated under the radar during the final phase of war against the LTTE.
The information surfaced during the investigations into the cases of Eknaligoda and Raviraj highlighted the fact that some top echelons of the previous rule had used intelligence wing operations as a tool to cover up legal acts.
When the matter was raised at top level discussions within the government, President Maithripala Sirisena has stressed the need for carrying out investigations into the killings as such acts could not be justified, at any cost. The government has also assured the international community that it will carry out investigations into the murders of Eknaligoda and Raviraj without leaving space for undue political interference. The progress of the two investigations will also come into play when the member nations of the UNHRC assess the success of the Sri Lankan government's war crimes inquiry mechanism, after 18 months.

Russia can't bomb its way to peace in Syria: Obama
US: Asserting that the only way to end the civil war in Syria was through a legitimate, inclusive government there, US President Barack Obama has said that he hopes Russia would soon realise it can't "buy peace" in the war-torn country through air strikes.
Obama's statement comes in the backdrop of Moscow continuing to bomb ISIS targets in Syria.
"(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin believes that if he continues to do what he's been doing over the last five years -- and that is prop up the Assad regime -- that the problem will be solved. Our belief is that we have to go after ISIL and violent extremist groups," Obama told reporters at a White House news conference "But the magnet that the civil war there is serving in bringing in foreign fighters and recruiting people to this extremist cause will only go away if we're able to get a political track and a legitimate, inclusive government inside of Syria," he said.
So there's no meeting of the minds in terms of strategy between the US and Russia, Obama said. "But my hope is that as we continue to have these conversations, and as I suspect Russia starts realising that they're not going to be able to bomb their way to a peaceful situation inside of Syria, that we'll be able to make progress on that front," the US President said. The only understanding that the US has with Russia is how do they de-conflict in the event that their planes might be occupying similar space over Syrian skies.
"So in that sense, we've arrived at an understanding and some channels for communications. Where we will continue to differ is in the basic set of principles and strategies we're pursuing inside of Syria," he said. - AFP

Sajin Vass allowed to go abroad
The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered the temporary release of the passport of former Foreign Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena for five days.
While ordering to temporary release the passport on medical grounds, Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya observed that the suspect would be allowed to travel only to Singapore and ordered that the passport be returned to Court custody on November 3.
The former MP informed Court that that he wanted to travel to Singapore for medical treatment and moved Court that he be permitted to leave the country for five days from October 25 to 30.
The former MP's passport had been impounded in relation to a case of non-declaration of assets and liabilities. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against him in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975.

Sangaree's son wins New Riding for Liberal Party
Gary Anandasangaree won the New Riding of Scarborough-Rouge Park for the Liberal party, beating the Conservatives after the party dropped candidate Jerry Bance late in the campaign.
Anandasangaree, a lawyer by profession, is the son of veteran politician V. Anandasangaree, who is the leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).
Anandasangaree surged ahead of the the other candidates with an overwhelming majority of the vote. Conservative Leslyn Lewis came in a distant second, followed by NDP candidate Rev. Kantharatnam Shanthikumar.
Riding was thought to be a close three-way race, but Bance was dropped in September after he was reportedly caught on camera urinating in a coffee cup in 2012 in a highly publicised scandal.
The departure of Bance left the party scrambling to find a new candidate late in the race, opting for Lewis as a fill-in candidate. Riding is brand new in this election and was created by combing pieces of three others: the eastern portion of what used to be Scarborough-Rouge River, the Scarborough portion of the former Pickering-Scarborough East and part of Scarborough-Guildwood.
Scarborough-Rouge Park stretches from York region south to Lake Ontario.
If the boundaries were the same in the 2011 federal election, voters would have voted 34.8 per cent Liberal, 31.6 percent Conservative, and 31 percent NDP.

SC issues notice on Justice Minister
The Supreme Court yesterday issued notice on Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe to appear in Court on November 12 in connection with 11 Fundamental Rights petitions filed by prisoners who are allegedly serving illegal jail sentence imposed by Magistrates exceeding their jurisdiction.
Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justices Rohini Marasinghe, Priyantha Jayawadena and Upali Abeyratne issued notice on the Justice Minister to inquire about the facts in this regard.
The petitioners stated that under Section 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, a

Senior Counsel Kalyananda Tiranagama with Sandamalee Ekanayake instructed by Shyama Gamaarachchi appearing for the petitioners stated that one petitioner had been kept in illegal custody in prison since May 2010 after he has completed serving all sentences lawfully enforced on him. Counsel further submitted to Court that the petitioner was serving an illegal jail sentence of 72 years.
Tiranagama further informed that a woman prisoner has been sentenced to 66 years imprisonment, including a jail sentence of 22 years.
They had cited the Attorney General, the Commissioner General of Prisons, the Superintendent of the Mahara Prison and the Minister of Justice as respondents in the petitions.
The petitioner N. P. A.. P. Anura Saman Kumara of Bokalagama stated that he was sentenced to 116 months imprisonment by the Attanagalla Magistrate's Court in 2013 exceeding its jurisdiction for default of payment of arrears of maintenance in a case.
The petitioner stated that according to the Prisons' Department, the government is spending about Rs. 300 a day for the maintenance of a prisoner in custody and the public funds amounting to over Rs. 1,044,000 (300 x 30 x 116) will be wasted to maintain the petitioner till he completes serving this illegal jail sentence imposed by the Attanagalla Magistrate's Court exceeding its jurisdiction.

Governor tales
Sir Graeme Thomson 1931-33
The state Council replaces the Legislative council by an order of this governor. The latter council had been steering the administration of Ceylon since its inception in mid 19th Century till it was dissolved in April 1931. .
But we are in the dark about more intimate details about him that will be furnished now.
Graeme Thomson was born in August 1785 and was Oxford educated in Classics. However he deviated to the branch of transport, culminating as Director of transport and his services were much sought after especially as it was war time.
A close associate of Lloyd George, the then PM of England he was once described by him as Greatest since Noah in the transport field. A crisis rising in shipment he was sent in charge of the war time shipping programme in the USA. All in all, Thomson made his mark as a great patriot during the First World War.
Soon he was appointed Colonial Secretary of Ceylon. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in change of stations but he was one of four governors who had earlier been appointed colonial secretaries. Each had been popular in their own way that made the
Come back too easy. During this governor's stint as colonial secretary he had acted in governor's capacity too. Then as though to reflect the spreading dimensions of the Suddha Empire he went to British Guiana as governor and later to Nigeria in the same capacity.
This time in Nigeria he exhibited his broad vision by a scheme of co-operation among all West African Govts. Now subject to British rule. However he succumbed to many a health problem and soon he was posted to Ceylon where the famous Dr. Lucian de Zilva began his ministrations.
Anyway the tides of politics began fermenting him and the order in council for dissolving the old legislative council and replacing it with the new state council was issued.
But from the initial stages of the sittings of the new council , the Sinhala ministers got boisterous and pleaded radical changes. Thomson had been receptive to demands when he was colonial secretary but now that he was holding the reins his attitude had changed.
Becoming cautious to the suggested steps to create fundamental changes in the constitution he gave in, in a small measure.
That was to examine any specific pints in the following areas ,
* Method of election of Ministers
* Reallocation of functions of the executive committees
* The public service commission ---its layout as proposed by the Donoughmore commission.
However illness overtook him again and fortunately for contemporary recorders, Dr. Lucien de Zilva maintained a diary where hilarious data as to the refusal to take a fee from the highly placed patient are given . We owe it to HAJ Hulugalle for raking up such matter.
Just as John Anderson was the first and last governor to die on our soil , Grahame Thomson was the first and last governor to die en route home and that on official duty. The secretary of state had summoned him to discuss the memorandum of the board of ministers asking for a revision of the constitution. The governor was buried on the way at Aden.

Sri Lankan experience to mitigate world humanitarian crisis
These past two months Sri Lanka figured significantly in the deliberations that took place on important topics in Geneva, which is one of the key venues for gatherings of the United Nations. In September the country took a central place in the deliberations of the UN Human Rights Council where it co-sponsored a resolution on itself that called for truth, accountability and justice in relation to its past conduct of the war against the LTTE.
In October last week Sri Lanka again got attention at the final consultation of the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in Geneva which brought together nearly one thousand humanitarian workers from all parts of the globe. One indication of the country's visibility was the role played by Sri Lankan media personality Chevaan Daniel who obtained the official position of master of ceremonies for the duration of the three day consultation on account of the Maharaja group of companies' humanitarian work and hence became a part of the WHS Secretariat that guided the consultation to a successful conclusion.
The holding of the consultation came with the severe crisis that the world faces due to humanitarian catastrophes taking place today which has seen millions of people displaced and on the move.
The most violent manifestations of this crisis have come primarily from the Middle East, where a group that uses terror and operates outside of international law, the ISIS is causing havoc and taking over large chunks of territory of formerly sovereign countries and is establishing state-like structures in them.
The consequences of these conflicts in the Middle East have led to a massive wave of migration last seen over seven decades ago during the Second World War with people from formerly prosperous countries such as Iraq, Libya and Syria fleeing their countries by the millions.
The media images of people who never thought that their ordered lives would be turned upside down on the run to safety are haunting ones, and have prompted many countries, especially in Europe which had restrictive immigration policies to open up their borders to cope with the humanitarian crisis.
One of the Sri Lankan humanitarian workers at the consultation, Raga Alphonsus, who worked during the war years in Mannar made a presentation that drew much commendation from those who engage directly with refugee populations on the ground. He pointed to the importance of ensuring the dignity of those who had become refugees. He called for sanctions against those organizations that engaged in violating the dignity of people who had been displaced by imposing solutions on them without consulting them.
Drawing on his experience in working in the Sri Lankan situation, he said that those who had become refugees needed to be treated with respect, their views obtained, and their solutions taken into consideration.
This calls for inclusion of the victims in the decision making process, which dignifies them. If this is not done the resentments that are generated can become another source of problems as in Sri Lanka especially after the war.
Human dignity
This aspect of inclusion needs also to be extended to the international community's efforts to grapple with the world humanitarian crisis. At the consultation in Geneva there was great emphasis given to the need to empower people to cope and recover with dignity through humanitarian action that puts people at its heart and makes them the primary agents of their recovery. This dignifying of people also needs to be promoted through an educational process that is introspective and self-critical.
This is especially needed where refugees are resettled in places outside of their home areas where other populations live.
There is a need for anti-racism education and campaigns to enable their inclusion in the societies that will need to accommodate them.
As most of the refugees pouring into Europe at the present time are Muslims, it becomes important that the fears and prejudices of the host populations should be addressed through civic education campaigns.
Sri Lanka has considerable experience in this regard as evidenced by the Sudu Nelum (White Lotus) movement formed by the government during the period of President Chandrika Kumaratunga and by civil society organizations to support a political solution to the armed conflict with the LTTE.
However, it was evident at the consultation of the World Humanitarian Summit that the greater emphasis was on the mobilization of financial resources at the level of states and multilateral donor agencies to cope with the refugee crisis. The shortage of finances is a major cause of the stress.
Representatives from Pakistan said that their country had been hosting up to four million refugees from neighbouring countries including Afghanistan for many years without international attention being focused on their plight and on the need to obtain more financial assistance to support them and ensure their dignity, safety and opportunity to rebuild their lives in a resilient manner.
One of the main issues to be taken up at the World Humanitarian Summit has been the issue of mobilizing adequate financial resources. While financial assistance has increased it is not adequate due to the enormity of the need. In 2014, for instance, more financial resources for humanitarian purposes were obtained than ever before in history. But the deficit in the UN's budget for humanitarian purposes was also the greatest ever.
With tens of thousands of refugees being taken into Western countries which have traditionally been donors to third world countries, the funds allocated to those third world countries, including Sri Lanka, to cope with their own humanitarian problems is likely to get reduced. This has negative consequences for those countries which have been depending on international support to successfully resolve their own humanitarian problems. It will also make it more difficult to respond to the targets set by the international community, as evidenced in the resolution on Sri Lanka of the UN Human Rights Council.
Root causes
Sri Lanka is particularly unfortunate in this regard, as at the very time it is making the turn to ethnic reconciliation and good governance the externally given financial resources to ease the path of transition are drying up or likely to be withdrawn. This will also make it harder for the government to counter the mounting propaganda by the political opposition that it is on the wrong track in having responded positively to international pressures, such as the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka.
There is another lesson that Sri Lanka can share with regard to coping with humanitarian crises. This is the importance of addressing the root causes of conflicts that give rise to humanitarian crises. Today it is generally accepted in Sri Lanka that the prolonged ethnic conflict and war, and failure of the former government headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were due to ignoring the root cause of the ethnic conflict and believing that economic development would suffice to pave the way for reconciliation and sustainable peace. By ignoring the need to politically resolve the conflict, the Rajapaksa government alienated the ethnic minorities and totally lost their electoral support. The new government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has made sure that there is not active discrimination against the ethnic and religious minorities. However, they have yet to reform the centralized nature of the state and the ideology of the state that identifies with the ethnic majority.
At the World Humanitarian Summit there was a similar phenomenon. Although many speakers referred to the need for political solutions that would address the humanitarian crises, there was no clear analysis of the political problems that had given rise to the humanitarian crises.
The outcome of Western powers seeking to impose their notions of good governance and democracy on societies that are not yet ready for it can be seen in the breakdown of the state and tragedies that have unfolded in the Middle East. At the same time it is necessary to be critical of the violent terror of the ISIS that has been born in the womb of those Middle Eastern societies. This was also the case with regard to the LTTE which even today sections of Tamil society are unwilling to criticize. The recent statement of the TNA leadership in which there is introspection and self-criticism is an example for Sri Lanka and the international community even though it is likely to come at a political cost to them if the government does not reciprocate and show results on the ground to the affected people.
The TNA statement has been oft cited, and it is useful to cite again. It said "We also accept and undertake to carry out our responsibility to lead the Tamil people in reflecting on the past, and use this moment as a moment of introspection into our own community's failures and the unspeakable crimes committed in our name, so as to create an enabling culture and atmosphere in which we could live with dignity and self-respect, as equal citizens of Sri Lanka."
Any reform that addresses the roots of conflict requires that the people, victims, perpetrators and outside supporters, are brought into the process of change. If they are not brought in, it is more likely than not that they will reject those reforms even though they are in the larger interests of all. The solutions to problems best comes when all sides becomes aware of their contribution to both the problem and its solution. This requires much education work at all levels of society, both national and international, that promotes self-criticism and introspection.

Teacher arrested for alleged assault of student over school uniform
A teacher in charge of discipline was arrested by Mirigama Police for allegedly assaulting a student who came to school in a tight uniform. The teacher in question has allegedly cut the uniform with a pair of scissors and later assaulted the student.
The student concerned was admitted to the Mirigama hospital and later transferred to the Gampaha district hospital
The teacher concerned attached to W. Senanayaka Prep School in Meerigama, Gampaha, suddenly decided to deliver a student from his discomfort associated with his seemingly tight school uniform last Monday (19), he could not do otherwise than settling upon a blade to perform his desired task. A blade perhaps seemed easy to get by and user-friendly at he same time.
He called the boy, Nimesh Savich, who is a year-11 student of the school, and made the profound announcement to get the much wanted attention of other students. "This shirt is too tight for Nimesh."
He held the blade in his hand and cut the short sleeve of the boy's school uniform shirt with his preferred instrument.
He pauses for a moment of satisfaction." these trousers are also too tight for him,"says he. He proceeds to slit a section of the student's trousers too. Nimesh, summoned by his teacher is standing before him as his clothes are being cut off as if he was in an Emergency Room (ER) of a Teaching Hospital. His eyes are helplessly cast down at his feet.
He was lucky that his religion teacher did not notice the pair of shoes he was wearing. They looked scruffy and worn off too. Had the teacher seen them, he would have cut them off too. Nimesh had just a pair of uniforms to wear to school, now that it has been reduced to a single pair by his teacher.
Nimesh is not the kind of student who gets to stand face to face with a wardrobe of ten to twenty school uniforms. His father is a mason and his mother is a garment factory worker. They have been finding it difficult to make ends meet. It was due to financial constraints of the family that Nimesh had to manage with just a pair of school uniforms.
Nimesh's parents have lodged a complaint with the Meerigama Police station on Monday (19) about this incident. No parents would send their children to schools to suffer humiliation or to see some wise guys in the school's teaching staff make their children look like ER patients in class rooms.
The complaint was recorded under the minor category of complaints, said sources at the Meerigama Police Station. It is likely that this case will be settled for a song.
Our attempts to contact the Chief Minister of the Western Province and the principal of the school in question for comments on the incident were unsuccessful. When contacted by us, the school officials said that the principal was attending his chores and was not in a position to respond.

Thousands of rhinos, 500 poachers; grim toll in the hunt for prized horns
Hundreds of illegal hunters of the rhinoceros in South Africa's Kruger national park have been shot dead by rangers in the past five years, but the temptation of a rich reward to end an impoverished life in Mozambique keeps them coming
The well-heeled tourists filing through the modest airport at Hoedspruit - Afrikaans for Hat Creek - look carefree and expectant. Guides are standing by to transport them to luxurious bush lodges offering spa treatments, campfire dinners and dawn and dusk game drives offering a potential glimpse of Africa's "big five".
But something is different from the safaris enjoyed by the privileged generations of the past. At the 36,000-acre Moditlo private game reserve near Kruger national park, for example, the rhinos do not have horns - they have been removed for their own safety. And during night safaris on dirt tracks under the majesty of a star-studded sky visitors are warned not to use torches, lest they be confused with poachers. When guests - usually affluent and white - gaze from air-conditioned bedrooms into the perfect darkness of the bush, few are likely to consider the murderous chase taking place there between poacher, ranger and rhino. For the poachers - usually poor and black - the risks are immense, but so are the rewards.
"When you look at the impoverished communities around us and the unemployment rate in South Africa, you'd have to be naive to think it's not going to explode," said Tim Parker, a warden managing Moditlo and Thornybush Nature Reserve, where anti-poaching costs have gone up 500% in the past three years. "Soon there are going to be gun battles. I can see it coming."
South Africa has more than four-fifths of the world's rhino population. Poaching is at an unprecedented level, driven by demand in countries such as Vietnam, where horns, used in traditional medicine or as a middle-class delicacy, fetch up to $65,000 (42,000) a kilo, more expensive than gold. A record 1,215 rhinos were killed last year, almost treble the 448 lost in 2011. As of late August this year, 749 rhinos were known to have been poached - 544 of them in Kruger park, where officials estimate 6,000 well-armed poachers are at large.
But there is another, less reported death toll. Nearly 500 poachers from neighbouring Mozambique alone have been shot dead by rangers in Kruger park over the past five years, it was claimed recently. Joaquim Chissano, Mozambique's former president, said 82 alleged poachers from the country were killed in the first half of this year, describing them as "destitute, poor people recruited by crime networks who make the real money ... Each of these dead Mozambicans means more poverty for his family, because they can no longer count on him to fight for better living conditions," Chissano noted.
In Massingir, Mozambique, the illegal rhino horn trade has been as alluring and disorienting as a gold rush. Earlier this year, Bartholomaus Grill, a German journalist at Der Spiegel, reported that about 20 leaders of poaching gangs are thought to live in Massingir "and their houses are unmistakable: ostentatious villas rising up out of the bush between shacks and adobe houses with tiled exterior walls and tinted windows covered with metal bars".
When Grill and Swedish photographer Toby Selander visited the home of a notorious poaching kingpin, they were taken hostage by an angry mob and felt lucky to escape with their lives. The kingpin, not the police, seemed to be calling the shots.
Poverty is suffocating in Massingir and opportunities are scarce. To young men, killing a rhino and delivering its horn can seem a quick way out, earning them as much as 100,000 rand (5,000) a kilo. To some communities rhino poachers are role models, according to the US state department, based on interviews with nine focus groups in Massingir and other local communities.
"They do good things for their communities - send children to school, build nice houses, drive expensive cars and wear expensive clothes," one interviewee said.

Trump blames George Bush for 9/11, Jeb defends brother
US: Donald Trump has claimed a lot of things in his quest to maintain high ratings for his United States presidential campaign, but preventing the 9/11 terrorist attacks that shook the US and the world is a new pretence. Even for Trump.
Trump, the flamboyant front-runner in the 15-candidate Republican field, provoked a tit for tat with rival Jeb Bush last week by saying Jeb's brother, George W. Bush, must share some of the blame for the four co-ordinated attacks that killed nearly 3000 people, because it occurred during his "reign".
Then, Mr Trump said he had "a bigger heart" and was "more competent" at handling the challenges such mass catastrophes bring. But maybe that claim wasn't enough to generate debate - or massive headlines - so on Sunday, Mr Trump went a step further.
"I'm extremely tough on people coming into this country," he said on the Fox News Sunday programme.
"I believe that if I were running things, I doubt those families would have - I doubt that those people would have been in the country." The 19 hijackers in the attacks all entered the United States legally on temporary visas, although a 9/11 commission report criticised flaws in the system that handled their applications.
Mr Trump said his own tough stance on illegal immigration would have made it difficult for the attacks to be carried out in the first place.
He had already grabbed headlines for calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers, promising to deport 12,000 Mexicans, planning to build a great, big wall on the Mexican border (paid by the southern neighbour's government) and failing to curb anti-Muslim sentiment when he had a chance. Mr Bush said Mr Trump's comments about the September 11 attacks called his credibility into question.

UK's new plans to block teenaged militants travelling to warzone
UK: British parents worried that their 16 and 17-year-old children might travel to Syria or Iraq under the influence of militants will be able to apply to have their passports removed, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday.
He will say that defeating Islamist extremism "will be the struggle of our generation" as he reveals new laws to disrupt radicals operating in Britain.
Under the current passport rules, parents can apply to have the passports of under-16s removed by the authorities.
However, Mr Cameron will say this will now be extended to under-18s amid fears that terror groups such as Islamic State are using social media websites like Twitter to radicalise teens and convince them to travel to Syria. Mr Cameron will say the measures are to be included in a new anti-extremism bill containing a range of measures.
"A key part of this new approach is going further to protect children and vulnerable people from the risk of radicalisation by empowering parents and public institutions with all the advice, tools and practical support they need," he is expected to say.
The new measures are aimed at disrupting a steady stream of young Britons lured by the Islamic State's radical ideology to join the militant group fighting in the Middle East.
As part of the plan, extremist Islamists and hate preachers will be treated like paedophiles and banned from all contact with children, Mr Cameron will announce. .
He will also announce sweeping new powers for the Disclosure and Barring Service to ensure that anyone with a conviction for terrorist or extremist activity is automatically banned from working with children and vulnerable people - in the same way as those convicted of sexual offences against children.

Improve public transport or face consequences - experts warn
Vehicle registrations on the overdrive
Road traffic in the Colombo city reached unmanageable levels this month. New traffic plans were implemented and abandoned. The Police Traffic Control Unit had been struggling to find a solution, but none seems to have worked. The reason, there are more cars on the road than ever before.
As the private vehicle usage spedup, the cash-strapped transport ministry is crawling behind in search of sustainable solutions.
With EPF and ETF arrears of Rs.11 Billion due to be paid to employees for the past five years, the solutions are slow to come. "It is impossible to provide and improve the quality of the transport system when there are financial issues within the ministry," Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera said, defensively.
The collapse of the public transport system push people to opt for alternate options, explains Prof. Amal Kumarage. "It is a theory of demand and need. The prevailing public transport system in Sri Lanka does not even meet the basic needs of the people," he said.
Registration of vehicles in September have reached an all time record of over 15,000 brand new and reconditioned vehicles. This is an increase of over 50 percent from the previous month and over 400 percent, when compared to the same period the previous year.
The numbers have been rising for months and would continue to rise, experts warn.
"In a few years time, we would have to wait in queues for more than two hours just to enter Colombo," warns Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan.
There were 429,556 vehicles registered last year. This year, by end of September, the Department of Motor Traffic had already registered 491,632 vehicles, half of which were motorcycles.
"This is because there was a concessionary scheme for government servants to purchase motorcycles. We saw a rapid increase," explains Commissioner of Motor Traffic Jagath Chandrasiri.
In addition, the low interest rates for vehicle loans and lease options too, have contributed, he claims.
Registration of vehicles with below 1,000 CC engine capacity had also rapidly increased over the last two years. Out of 15,107 vehicles registered last month, almost 90 percent or 12,500, were small cars with less than 1,000 CC engine capacity.
"Tax concessions provided by the last budget was the main contributor for this increase, while the majority, almost 99 percent of the vehicles are financed," Chandrasiri said.
The increase in registered vehicles pose another problem. Many main cities in the country are struggling to acquire adequate parking facilities for the increasing number of vehicles entering city limits each day.
This is especially true in Colombo, explains Prof. Kumarage. "There are no adequate number of parking areas in many parts of Colombo," he said The answer to this problem is to provide high quality public transportation with features of 21st century to overcome these issues, a mantra repeated by many experts for a long period of time.
This is not a new phenomenon, claims Dr. Gunaruwan. Many developed nations have successfully managed to overcome road congestion by developing the public transport system.
"Owning a vehicle is the right of a person and we are unable to use draconian laws to restrict them, but we could improve the public transport system to reduce vehicle usage," he said.
Critical of the current solutions provided by different authorities to address the issue of vehicular traffic on the roads, Prof. Kumarage explained that sustainable results could not be achieved by implementing a one way road system.
"Not every road in Colombo face huge traffic jams and the authorities need to make plans to reduce traffic in those areas and an acceptable and reliable traffic plan has to be implemented."
However, Colombo has no proper transport system, he said. Such a system has to be initiated and maintained to overcome the current problems in the road system. "Solutions cannot be arrived without establishing a standard system in the country," he said, emphasizing the need to approach the problem in a holistic manner. The Transport Ministry currently possess 6,000 CTB buses which they maintain. However, they have no immediate plans to add to the current fleet, Somaweera explained.
The number of CTB buses have not reduced, while the Transport Ministry has managed to maintain the number of 6,000 buses.
"Discussions are in progress to improve the facilities of the CTB buses. The Ministry has already taken measures to improve the infrastructure of bus halts," he explained.
The Ministry of Transport faces several financial problems, claims Somaweera, adding that discussions are on going with the Treasury and other higher officials who are involved in formulating policies to overcome the current problems.
"It is impossible to provide and improve the quality of the transport system when there are financial issues within the ministry. The EPF and ETF of employees for the past five years are being paid, while the ministry has arrears amounting to Rs.11 Billion," he claims.
Improve railways system - Experts say
Improving financial status of the population is increasing is private vehicle ownership. With enhanced financial capability of the people, a private car has become a necessity, explains Dr. Lalithasiri Guneruwan.
"The change of attitude of the public and the increasing trend to lead a luxurious life style means they spend more leisure time outside making it difficult for the public transport system to meet their needs. This pushes them to own a private vehicle."
In Sri Lanka, vehicle ownership increases when the per capita ownership of the people go high.
The trend is common in other countries that have recorded a similar per capita range. "When per capita income further increases, the demand for vehicle ownership will stabilize as they already own vehicles.
The draw backs in the public transport system is also another reason for the people to prefer their own vehicles. Constructing roads is not the solution, he explains. Infact, 'more roads would increase the demand for more vehicles.' Building more roads is an economic cost, Dr. Gunaruwan claimed. Improving the standards of the public transport is the only option and the government should encourage the people to use public transport. The problem is in the high level of vehicle usage, "ownership of a car has no impact," he highlighted.
Improving the railway system of the country is imperative to address the current crisis in transportation, he claims.
"The bias attitude towards the railways department has to be changed. The market for the railways is already established, but it has to be improved, adding that more investment and effort has to be channeled towards improving the railways," he claimed.
Unlike current Sri Lankan policies, many developed countries have implemented strict measures to manage ownership of vehicles, imposing stringent controls on vehicle importation, need of car permits, slapping on high taxes.
"At the same time, they improved the standard of the public transport system," Dr. Gunaruwan elaborated on the types of policy measures to be taken.

Write genuinely, edit brutally!
You are my ocean-poem.
The one I have written
but cannot show the world.
When I go to a land
where there is no ocean,
I will say, like an
island-woman,
I miss the sea.
You will know what it is
I am saying.
 an untitled poem from vivimariev.blogspot.com
Dr. Vivimarie Vanderpoorten is a Sri Lankan poet whose compilation of works Nothing Prepares You won her the Gratiaen Prize 2007, and consequently launched her into local literary renown. She followed it up with Stitch Your Eyelids Shut in 2010, which took us further into her outlook on Sri Lankan politics and our two-decade civil war. Her writing was described by Gratiaen panelist Dr Sinharaja Tammita Delgoda as gentle, reflective minimalism, which touches the soul [her] poetry is like a shadow passing your face.
We meet her now five years later, between her English lectures at the Open University of Sri Lanka, for a chat about her career and her thoughts about Sri Lankas changing literary scene.
Q: Your first book was more emotive and personal, while your second got more political, what will your next be like
A: Im working on my third book, but Ive been tinkering with it for five years now and Im not yet satisfied enough to see it published. I think it will be a kind of mixture of my first two books.
Q: As a teacher of English, your classes are a sort of training course for aspiring writers. What are some of the key lessons you give them
A: Well actually we teach more academic writing than creative writing, though were considering introducing a creative writing module soon. I try to teach them about how politics intersects with writing, and how to appreciate different cultures, so theres the lesson of social cohesion.
Q: Literature students at university are potentially the next generations authors. How do the Sri Lankan youth respond to literature
A: Students actually hardly read today. They read the curriculum textbooks but reading for pleasure - has become a rare thing. Its because everything has become so utilitarian. Even education is now just a marketable commodity  but learning is much more than a set of skills to get the best job. There needs to be a discourse around this.
Q: Your work has been translated into Sinhala and Tamil. Do you feel like language is a kind of barrier in Sri Lankas literary scene
A: Yes it can be but there are more and more translations coming out now, and comparative literature (comparing writings of different languages) is becoming a thing here. It helps to have more bilingual writers, like Hashana Rambukwella and Liyanage Amarakeerthi.
More people are writing now and all the awards, poetry readings and Open Mics are helping this happen. There needs to be dialogue between Sinhala, Tamil and English writing.
Q: Do you have a target audience for your work
A: Not really. I think I write for myself. There is a wide range of people  from students to old people  who have expressed appreciation for my work.
Q: Is there a reason why your second book of poetry dived deeper intolocal politics Do you feel Sri Lankan writers have a responsibility to address larger political issues and reconciliation
A: I guess I wrote more about it as a result of just living through the height of war in Sri Lanka and dealing with the aftermath. I think any writer should address larger issues, since we are products of this society and we reflect it too.
Q: Who are you reading these days
A: I like Yasmine Gooneratnes poetry, and work by the current Poet Laureate of Britain, Carol Ann Duffy. Im reading Faiz Ahmad Faizs Urdu poetry, some Palestinian poetry, and I also enjoy the Sinhala works of Amarakeerthi and the young poet RuwanBandujeewa.
Q: The Galle Literary Festival has been criticized by some as being too expensive or targeting only a certain class of Colombo people, while the recent Annasi&Kadalagotu Literary Festival was much more localized and open to the public. What do you think the future of Sri Lankas literary scene will be like
A: I think theres a great future. Its the beginning of a very interesting phase. There are different media of literature now, and a digital culture, which makes everything more available.
And the boundaries between media are blurring  for example theres Colombos ImaadMajeed who writes poetry and raps it as well.
Q: Many say that writer and poet are not wise career options in an increasingly industrial world. What would you say to that
A: Its true, you need to keep your day job. But at least prose or fiction writers are definitely more popular than poets  people are more likely to pick up your book if its a story than a work of poetry.
Q: Some argue there is an obvious lack of literary criticism in Sri Lanka and a lack of English publishing houses and therefore a lack of literary development  do you agree What can we do to improve this
A: Yes I completely agree. Theres a trend in Sri Lanka to either overly praise the writer, or completely denounce them  there needs to be a degree of professionalism in review writing and criticism thats constructive.
Maybe we can make this happen by creating a separate magazine for just reviews.
We need to change our culture - become more open to criticism, and not take it so personally.
There are countless Sinhala publishing houses but its true, there are few English ones, plus they often have a discouraging mantra poetry doesnt sell.
Q: Any advice you would give to young people who want to be published authors some day
A: Write genuinely. Edit your work brutally. Rewrite.
And I know people who write poetry but who just dont read poetry  you need to read the works of other poets.

Writers who took themselves way too seriously
Morris M
It cant be easy being an author. Aside from having to put up with lawsuit-happy chancers claiming you stole their work, you also have everyone wondering if youre about to drop dead before you can finish their favorite series. But while most authors deal with the pressures of fame by keeping it as real as possible, some deal with it by transforming into self-obsessed jackasses.

Nicholas Sparks Badly
Misjudges His Own Reputation
Not every overly serious writer responds in the heat of the moment. Sometimes, theyre simply enamored with themselves 24/7. In 2010, Nicholas Sparksthe author of The Notebook and similar booksgave a joint interview with Miley Cyrus to USA Today. Incredibly, he managed to come off as the more annoying of the two.
Despite being possibly the most one-note writer in existence, Sparks believes hes unique.
When asked by the interviewer what genre he worked in, he replied, There are no authors in my genre.
No one is doing what I do. When asked to name his favorite tale of youth, he immediately cited one of his own books. He also compared his writing to that of Hemingway, Sophocles, and Shakespeare and declared Cormac McCarthys work pulpy, overwrought, [and] melodramatic.
Finally, at the end of the interview, he claimed: In mine, you never know if its going to be a happy ending, sad ending, bittersweet, or tragic. You read a romance because you know what to expect. You read a love story because you dont know what to expect.
Apparently hes never heard of the Nicholas Sparks formula meme.

Anne Rices
Amazon Meltdown
Gothic horror author Anne Rice has never been one to take criticism lightly. After readers trashed her novel Memnoch the Devil, she opened Blood Canticle by having the main character insult readers for being too stupid to understand it. But when Blood Canticle itself received some awful Amazon reviews, Rice went into full bloodsucker mode.
In a 1,200-word diatribe posted to Amazon, she lashed out at readers who were interrogating (the book) from the wrong perspective. Aside from calling them arrogant and stupid, she also took time to personally target specific reviewers who had made such awful statements as Anne, you really should have an editor. Then, she provided a blow-by-blow account of the novel along with a commentary on exactly how brilliant it really was.
Did we mention that she posted this all under a five-star review of her own book
Rice is no stranger to Amazon. Over the years, shes left somewhere in the region of 200 reviews on the site.

Alice Hoffman Unleashes Twitter Hell On Her Critic
Even if they have trouble dealing with Amazon, most authors can at least deal with professional critics. Not Alice Hoffman. The award-winning childrens novelist took her novel The Story of the Sisters so seriously that when Roberta Silman gave her a merely okay review, she decided to destroy her.
Taking to Twitter to vent her anger, Hoffman spent 27 tweets calling Silman a moron before going a step further and calling in the cavalry. Posting Silmans private phone number and email online, she invited her fans to call her up and harangue her for daring to call her novel predictable. Hilariously, she got the number wrong, and Silman isnt on Twitter anyway, so had no idea anything was going on at all.
Hoffman apologized a couple days later, issuing a weak statement through her publisher that tried to absolve her of any blame. But by then, the damage had been done. From now until the end of time, anyone Googling The Story of the Sisters will instead get the story of how Alice Hoffman went crazy over nothing.

M.R. Mathias And The Overbearing Ego
A self-published fantasy author, M.R. Mathias has written a few books that pull in decent reviews on the Kindle Store and seems to have the sort of loyal following thatd make any self-publisher smile. Unfortunately, he also has an ego so far out of proportion to his fame or talent that it practically obscures the Sun.
In 2012, Mathias got in an argument on a fantasy message board. A mod had done what mods do and moved his self-written advert from the main forum to the self-published and small press sub-forum. Most of us would have probably let it be. Most of us are not M.R. Mathias.
In a post thats jaw-dropping in its self-entitlement, Mathias informed the world that theres nothing self pubbed, or small, about books written by M.R. Mathias. He took multiple potshots at other forum members. He then accused the mods of jealousy and declared that his 92k Twitter followers wanted to know why they were persecuting him. When someone mentioned that they hadnt read his books, he responded with: If you chose not to read one of the best fantasy trils ever written then by all means take a pass.
When the mods finally banned him, things got even crazier. Mathias took to Twitter to declare that he was outselling Tolkien and that if his detractors had read his books, theyd be on his side.

Candace Sams Reports Readers To The FBI
Your first thought when you read the name Candace Sams was likely who Author of such books as Electra Galaxys Mr Interstellar Fella, her work isnt exactly on a par with Alice Hoffman or even Nicholas Sparks. But she can sure outdo them in the meltdown stakes. When an Amazon reviewer left her latest novel one star, Sams launched a blistering online attack that left her own reputation in tatters.
Posing as another reviewer, she accused her detractor of being a frustrated romance novelist who could not get his/her work published. She also called them a coward and left somewhere in the region of 400 angry posts. But the real howler came when she threatened to call the FBI.
In her final messages, Sams claimed the bad review amounted to cyber stalking and that a federal offense might have been committed. She then promised to press charges, before swiftly logging off and deleting all her messages. Thankfully, numerous sites saved them, preserving for future generations the true insanity of Candace Sams.

Richard Dawkins Cant See the Joke
In 2013, science writer and celebrity atheist Richard Dawkins had a brush with airport security. Just before he boarded a flight, his jar of honey was confiscated for breaching the liquids allowance. Dawkins fired off an angry tweet claiming Bin Laden has won, triggering a Twitterstorm of mockery. Rather than admit hed perhaps overreacted and having a laugh at himself, Dawkins turned the incident into a moral crusade.
Taking to The Guardians Comment is Free section, Dawkins delivered a hectoring, 850-word rant about why there was absolutely nothing funny about a celebrity scientist having his honey confiscated. He repeated his claim that this was a victory for Bin Laden and derided the Internet for what he saw as puerile attempts to make light of his calamity. He also utterly freaked out on Twitter, managing to somehow make a collection of honey-themed words written on a screen sound like the howlings of a madman staring into the abyss.

Emily Giffin Cant Handle Mild Criticism
Chick-lit author Emily Giffin has been writing novels since around 2002. Shes appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list and had one of her books adapted into a film. In other words, youd think she would be confident enough by now to deal with mild criticism. Youd be wrong.
In 2012, a long-term Giffin fan left a disappointed review on Amazon. Although she felt Giffins latest wasnt up to scratch, she still took care to praise Giffins earlier works. Giffin saw this mild critique went psycho on its writer.
Taking to Facebook and Twitter, she called up legions of fans to tear all negative Amazon reviewers to shreds. Since reading a romance writer is apparently like following a crazy cult, the original reviewer was deluged by over 100 messages all telling her what a moron she was. Meanwhile, Giffin claimed the attack was justified because the reviewer had insulted her husbanda lie that conveniently overlooked the conversation chain displayed on Amazon for everyone to see.

Ayelet Waldman Really Wants To Be The Best
Most aspiring authors would kill for the sort of glowing review Ayelet Waldmans 2014 novel Love and Treasure got from the New York Times. Not Waldman. Instead of relaxing in the warm glow of critical adoration, she threw a gigantic hissy fit because the paper had left it off their 100 Notable Books of 2014 list.
In a series of tweets that have to be seen to be believed, Waldman claimed Love and Treasure is a fking great novel, claimed shed spent the whole morning sobbing on the couch, and then went on to trash-talk the quality of other books on the list. She tried to make herself into the good guy by promising to donate a dollar to a scholarship fund for each new preorder of her book. When people called her out on the full extent of her entitlement, she refused to apologize.
The craziest part Love and Treasure was acknowledged by The Washington Post in their Top 50 Fiction Books for 2014 list. Walden reacted with thank you.

J.D. Salinger Doesnt Get Parody
One of the most important components of copyright law is the ability for other artists to use your material for parody. Without this legal loophole, wed have no Airplane or Naked Gun, and Matt Groening would be the most sued man on Earth. But J.D. Salinger apparently didnt get the memo, because when a Swedish writer penned a spoof sequel to Catcher in the Rye in 2009, he tried to sue the guy into oblivion.
Claiming the sequel was a rip-off pure and simple, Salingers lawyers tried to get the book banned in every territory they could, succeeding in the United States. They also denied that it was in any way a parody, despite being written by a man whod previously published such weighty, serious fare as The Macho Mans Drinkbook: Because Nude Girls and Alcohol Go Great Together and The Pornstar Name Book.
Although most reviewers agreed the novel was clearly a parody or commentary (and also pretty awful), Salinger refused to drop the suit or give any ground. He was still fighting his corner when he died a year later, protecting his legacy from a spoof no one would otherwise have bothered to read.
