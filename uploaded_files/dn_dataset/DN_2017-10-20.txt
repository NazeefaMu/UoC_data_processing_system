Premier explains issues overSouthern Expressway construction
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe explained in Parliament yesterday the issues regarding the construction of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Beliatta and the measures taken to resolve them.
The Premier was participating in the adjournment debate on Expressways and Highway projects taken up in Parliament yesterday.
Payments cannot be done haphazardly and some have to be submitted to a committee and approved. The Southern Expressway from Matara to Mattala were designed to be completed in four stages," he said.
"The problematic segment of the expressway is the 30km from Matara to Beliatta. The initial estimate to construct it was Rs. 103.28 million and a 5.82 metre was planned to be a flyover," the Prime Minister said.
"A section was to be constructed through the Dandeniya forest reserve. The Central Environmental Authority had approved it based on the approval of the Forest Conservation Department. But the approval has complications. The Highways Ministry reported the matter to the Cabinet Economic Sub-Committee. Accordingly, officials were called and the matter was discussed. Prior to this, they had not approved nor objected," he said.
"It was after the change of government that they objected. The Environmental Authority and the Forest Conservation Department reported that by constructing the expressway, the Dandeniya forest reserve would be split in half which would hamper the movement of wild animals in the forest reserve.
"The Cabinet Committee intervened to resolve the issue. We discussed at length.
We were only able to take two initiatives. One was to avoid the forest reserve and construct the expressway. The other to construct the expressway through a tunnel. But it was reported that it would cost a huge expense for the alternatives, the Premier said.
"The Highways Ministry was instructed to formulate a plan to construct a flyover with minimal harm to the forest reserve. This was a policy decision.
The Economic Management Cabinet Committee also took a policy decision to construct a flyover. This decision was endorsed by the Cabinet," he said.
"The flyover length increased by 500 meters, estimated to cost an additional Rs. 2.7 billion.
Then another problem was encountered when constructing section from Matara to Beliatta.
The construction company had notified the Highways Ministry that the soil layer was thicker than expected.
"Measures were taken to obtain feasibility reports in this regard. Taking into consideration expert advice, it was decided to increase the distance of the flyovers in the Matara-Beliatta by 2.28 km to 9.1 km and to manage the loan facilities.
This was approved by the Cabinet.
These were the measures that were taken. Reports from experts in the field were obtained. Now this cannot be changed as work has already commenced.
We are looking into the issue to determine if there were any shortfalls and to see if expenditure could be reduced, the Prime Minister said.

Police intervened in Hambantota protest, only when it turned violent
Police did not intervene as far as the protest in Hambantota was peaceful, but they had to when the protest turned out to be violent, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
The Minister, responding to a question posed by MP Dinesh Gunawardena under standing orders 23(2), told Parliament yesterday that the protesters arrested during the demonstration in Hambantota on October 6 were charged of committing several offences such as violating a court order, contempt of court, damaging public property, assembling illegally and disturbing the duties of police officers and assaulting them.
He said 28 persons including MPs Namal Rajapaksa and D. V. Chanaka were arrested. He said the two MPs were later granted bail as they informed court that they need to attend a Youth Summit in Russia. MP Namal Rajapaksa, being a lawyer, must have taken part in the protest knowing the consequences. Now he had somehow escaped and the others who followed him are in, he said.
Commenting on the assault on a journalist by a Police officer, the minister said two separate investigations were being conducted by the Police and the National Police Commission into the incident. He assured that further action would be taken once the investigations were over. He said he would look into the transfer of the Police officer to Matara.
The Minister said he would look into the issues over the arrest of MP Prasanna Ranaweera during the protest.
Those who behaved violently were arrested, including a person who claimed to be a journalist. He had not been engaging in anything related to his job at that moment, but had actively taken part in the protest, he said. The Speaker said he would look into the reasons for the arrest of MP Prasanna Ranaweera.

Kiriella rebuts expresswaycorruption allegations
Proper tender procedures followed
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday denying corruption charges against him went on to comment that he has Rs. 400 million in his bank account and therefore he does not want to cheat money from expressway projects.
Responding to a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who stated that mega frauds had taken place in the construction of the Central Expressway, the Minister said: We do not need others money. We have been rich since the days of ancient kings. My wifes grandfather had over 30,000 acres of land in Balangoda.
My grandparents too had properties equal to that. We both worked in courts and usually gave Rs 2.5 million per year as tax on our income. I have 400 million rupees in my account. We do not need to steal from others.
The Minister told the JVP leader to lodge complaints at relevant authorities if he has any complaint against the Minister or his officials.

Speaker calls forspecial team to probe COPE findings
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he told the Finance Ministry to appoint a special team to study the reports of Committee of Public Enterprises (COPE) and take appropriate action on their revelations.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday when COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti insisted on follow up action on the findings of COPE reports presented to the House.
Tabling the fourth report of COPE that included findings on 15 public institutions summoned before the committee from September 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017, Handunnetti stressed the need to uphold the accountability to boost public confidence in COPE reports and Parliament.
Relevant Ministries and Ministry Secretaries should take appropriate actions on the findings in COPE reports. Ministerial level or political actions are needed against those who are responsible for the questionable dealings mentioned in them. Then only our efforts will be meaningful, he told the House.
Speaker Jayasuriya said he had already paid attention to this matter and discussed with the Finance Ministry on assigning a special team to study the COPE reports and take action.
---------------------------
Development priorities should be identified: Champika
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, observing that a staggering sum of Rs 1,331 billion is to be spent on constructing 356 km of expressways from 2016-2025, emphasised the need to re-think on the countrys development priorities.
The minister, joining in the adjournment motion moved by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday, questioned whether the debt-ridden economy of the country could afford to spend such a large sum to construct expressways.
He said the Government could build two fully fledged medical colleges from the money it spends to construct 2km of expressway.
He said the money spent on 3km of expressway would be sufficient to resolve the garbage problem in the entire Western Province.
The sum Sri Lanka has to pay for loan installments and interests is record high in 2018-2019. We need to find Rs. 1,800 billion in 2018, and Rs. 1,900 billion in 2019 to service the debts. Loans obtained during the Rajapaksa regime accounts for 84 percent of that sum.
Given the economic plight the country is in, we need to be extra-cautious on future state investments.
When we are investing billions of rupees in highway construction, naturally we will have to cut down the funds on education and health among others. We have to identify our national priorities and act accordingly, the Minister said.

Ratnapura district flood affected being provided relief
Paying compensation to the flood affected in the Ratnapura district and selecting suitable lands to rebuild their homes have already commenced, the Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister said was responding to an oral question raised by MP Premalal Jayasekara.
"Rs. 400,000 will be granted to purchase a land and Rs. 1.2 million to construct a house. The land acquisition from estate companies is in progress," the Minister said.
He said the Government has already paid compensation for 3,545 applicants. The disaster destructed 728 houses in the Ratnapura district completely while damaging 10,886 houses partially, the Minister said.

JVP wants forensic auditon Central Expressway project
The JVP yesterday in Parliament demanded to temporarily halt the Construction of Central Expressway and conduct a forensic audit on it by appointing a Parliament Select Committee.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake moving an adjournment motion on the Expressways already constructed and to be constructed in future", highlighted several grey areas of the project.
MP Dissanayake urged the Government to reveal the local agent behind the Japanese Company which undertakes the Central Expressway construction. The MP revealed that the same local agent is behind all other phases of the project.
The entire project is under the grip of one individual and Parliament would like to know who that person is, he asked.
Even though the Government boasts about bringing down the construction cost from Rs. 159 billion to Rs. 134.9 billion, it is still higher than the engineering estimate which stood at Rs. 123 billion. We urge the Government to halt the project and investigate the entire process, he said.
The MP charged that a corrupt circle that includes several politicians, police and army personnel, administrative officials, media owners, dealers and several in judiciary is in operation plaguing the entire country.
The former regime was toppled for rampant fraud and corruption.
Now it is evident that only the heads rolled in January, 2015 and that the same system continues, he said.
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said the true picture of these projects would come out when the probe starts. Some who tried to defend the Bond scam when it first came out are now silent with the latest revelations.
We want the Expressway projects be probed, he said.
Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said he has no objection to carrying out a forensic audit. He said the Auditor General in his reports in 2015, 2016 and 2017 confirmed that his Ministry had no large scale corruptions.

Four hotels close to the Hambantota International Cricket Stadium were selected to be developed in view of the 2011 World Cup matches.

Even though the Kalpitiya integrated tourism project commenced in 2008 on an estimated cost of Rs. 5,521 million to construct holiday resorts with 4,000 rooms and infrastructure facilities and the work was to be completed in five years, not a single room had been constructed despite an expenditure of Rs 88 milion as at Dec. 31, 2014, the report said.

Compared to 2015, the Government had reduced the loss of the Airport by Rs 1,553 million in 2016. The airport was constructed by obtaining a loan USD 190 million from China Exim bank. Seven institutions, Omega Global with Claymore Hill Advisory and Aviation Resource Group International, Sakurai Aviation Limited, Care Aviation (Pvt.) Ltd, VINCI Airport, Disel and Motor Engineering PLC, Sierra Networks (Pvt.) Ltd, and Madelon, had expressed their interests to invest in the Mattala airport.
The COPE has inquired from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation authorities of the status of the investigations conducted into the Hedging deal and found that the loss caused by the deal which was at Rs. 10.2 billion as at January 2016 had increased to Rs. 14.06 billion as at December 31, 2016.
The report stated that Rs 1.7 million had been spent by the National Transport Commission to print stickers of destination boards and details of emergency telephone numbers in three occasions in 2015 and the monies had been spent without following proper procurement procedures.
The NTC has spent Rs. 37 million to renovate a part of a building to regulated provincial buses using GPS technology but it has not been utilised.

Party leaders meeting next week to iron out delays to LG polls

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today in Parliament proposed to hold a Party Leaders Meeting next week to sort out remaining legislative issues and clear the path to hold the much delayed Local Government polls.
The Premier made this proposal when Joint Opposition (JO) Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena raised concerns over the possibility for LG polls to get delayed even beyond January due to fresh legislative issues that have cropped up.
MP Gunawardena pointed out that the relevant Gazette notification which was due this week to facilitate LG elections has been further postponed and that the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry is to bring in another Amendment bill to the Local Authorities Ordinance to rectify the language discrepancies in the previous Amendment.
MP Gunawardena suggested a resolution must be made in Parliament to rectify the existing technical issues rather than presenting another Amendment.
Nobody can challenge the validity of a Parliament resolution and therefore we can proceed swiftly and hold the LG elections, he said.
However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya pointed out that Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha does not agree to the proposal made seeking to move the resolution.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha has consulted the AG and he has informed that an Amendment Bill is necessary for that purpose, he said.
The Prime Minister said Minister Musthapha is to present the necessary Amendments at the next Cabinet meeting, due to be held on Tuesday and that a Party Leaders Meeting could be scheduled afterwards in order to come to an agreement.
I will also consult the Attorney Generals opinion over the matter. The issue over Ambagamuwa and Kalmunei will also be included. LG polls will not be delayed any further, the Prime Minister said.

People being easily misled about new constitution - AFRIEL
A survey led by the youth organisation AFRIEL, has found that the knowledge of the people in the North and South regarding the process of adopting a new constitution was minimal and thus people were being easily misled about the new constitution.
AFRIEL representatives handed over their report, Constitution for Peoples Governance -A youth led programme to promote public support for a new constitution, public opinions and recommendations to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The report encourages the government to have an efficient mechanism between policy makers and the people to share truthful information about the drafting process of the new constitution and encourage the participation of the public in the constitutional reforms process.
AFRIEL established in 2013, is a youth led organisation mainly focused in the North seeks to empower youth in the North and South and have them bridge the ethnic divide.
A conference held in 2015 with political party representatives and civil society organizations had led them to conduct this survey in the 22 districts of; Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Ratnapura, Galle, Hambantota, Matale and Matara with the participation of 5,796 individuals.
The 8000 member strong organisation said in the last year alone racially motivated political groups had been very active in spreading false propaganda over the constitution and that these need to be countered with the truth. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe addressing the media said the Constitutional Assembly which is scheduled to meet next week will hold a debate on the matter and discuss how to proceed forward with it.
AFRIELs report showed that opinions in the North and South did not favour an Executive Presidency and that they wanted it abolished as promised.
When it comes to Social, Economic and Cultural rights, land ownership, right to decent employment, to be eligible for welfare schemes and have access to it without discrimination, right to freedom of religion, citizenship to those who had fled the country during conflict, right to obtain administrative and judicial services in their own language, freedom from torture and disappearances, freedom of peaceful assembly, right to education in their mother tongue, to have the state and citizens hold the right to protect the environment and a stronger Election Commission which will ensure the right of franchise featured prominently in the group discussions held in the North and South.
The report further noted:It is evident that the Sinhalese majority is now in fear of protecting their indigenous identities while the minorities are facing a challenge where their identities are being questioned. Hence, it is necessary for the law makers to take decisive political decisions to build a united country while focusing on the fact that it is vital to create a broadly educated society to achieve such feat. But the Sinhala majority has been deceived continuously to achieve narrow minded political motives targeting the majority Sinhala votes, which eventually has paved way for distance and disbelief among the communities to grow.

Plantation workers get new housing complex
A new housing complex named 'Green Housing Scheme' for plantation workers at Gunakelle group, Passara was recently declared open by Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram.
Addressing the gathering after the opening Minister Digambaram said, that certain politicians are still giving false promises to gain their votes. But they will not have any place in the Country in the future. Under the Yahapalana government we are serving the people in unity by explaining the reality to them.
Digambaram said he never gave false promises to his people as alleged by his opponents. What ever said and done the government had rendered some positive service for the welfare of all plantation workers.
The Minister said that the new housing scheme was conceptualized by them. On this day we have vested 48 new houses on plantation workers families. More such housing projects would be launched in the region in the near future in stages to provide brand new houses to plantation workers to replace their line rooms.'

Digambaram said that the plantation and Human Development Trust too had assisted the new housing project. A sum of nearly Rs. 650,000 had been spent on each house so it was the duty of beneficiaries to maintain the houses properly. More and more services would be rendered for plantation areas in the future. This would include the rehabilitation of the road network and measures to uplift the socio-economic and living standards of the plantation workforce, Digambaram added.
Digambaram said that they were fully confident of gaining a bigger victory at the forthcoming elections. Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya President R. Weeran, Plantation and Human Development Trust Chairman M. Anthirasigamani and several others also spoke.

PM slams mischievous media spin  ; Malwatte Chief Prelate denies opposing new constitution
The Chief Prelate of the Malwatte Chapter rejected media reports which mischievously suggested that he opposed any Constitutional reforms, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday(19th).
The Most Venerable Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera told the Prime Minister that privately-owned newspapers and TV networks misled the public into believing that he objected to a new statute being formulated.
The Prime Minister was addressing the media after accepting a report on Constitution for Peoples Governance - A youth led programme to promote public support for a new constitution, public opinions and recommendations by the Sri Lanka College of Journalism and three other organizations, at the parliamentary complex yesterday.
After seeing the headline news items in the Lankadeepa, Divaina and the Daily Mirror, the Prime Minister said he contacted the Chief Priest who assured him that he had not made any comments opposing the reform process.
The venerable monk said he did not make such remarks nor was he in the country at the time, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told reporters in parliament.
He challenged editors of the private newspapers which front-paged the misleading report yesterday to explain their reasons and also publish his (Prime Ministers) comments in full in their publications.
You have carried falsehoods about the Malwatte Chief Prelate at a time when he was not even in the country, the Prime Minister said pointing to reporters from the newspapers he identified as having carried the mischievous reports.
Can you give an assurance that you will give the same prominence to my comments on this issue, the Prime minister asked the reporters, but none offered a response.
He said they could telephone their editors to get their reasons, but again no one accepted the challenge.
The Prime Minister noted that views of the Most venerable Malwatte Chief Prelate on Constitutional reforms were well known.
The Chief Prelate told Dinesh Gunawardena, a stalwart of the Joint Opposition earlier this month, that he believed in the honesty and the integrity of both Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena.
When the two leaders ruling the country have given such an assurance there is no point in questioning its validity, the Malwatte Chief Prelate told Gunawardena.
The monk told firebrand MP Gunawardena that a new Constitution was yet to be drafted and it was only at the discussion stage and urged the opposition to constructively participate in the process to ensure peace and stability in the country.
The Prime Minister said he was not opposed to newspapers giving space to dissenting voices, but it was unfair by the public to distort facts and mislead readers.
He said the Daily Mirror, Lankadeepa and the Divaina newspapers had yesterday front-paged the report with photos of the Malwatte Chief Prelate giving the impression that the remarks they carried were from him.
However, the Prime Minister said the basis for the newspaper report appeared to be a press conference given by the Diyawadana Nilame (chief lay custodian of the Temple of the Tooth).
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who started his career as a journalist before Lake House newspapers were nationalised in 1973, also offered a journalism lesson to the offending newspapers.
If the press conference you reported was given by the Diyawadana Nilame, should you not use his photograph rather than the picture of the Malwatte Chief Priest who is out of the country, he asked.
A relaxed Prime Minister asked reporters from the Daily Mirror, Lankadeepa, Divaina and television networks Hiru and Derana to check with their editors and explain why they decided to give a twist to the Diyawadana Nilames press conference to give a false impression that it was the view of the Malwatte Chief Prelate.
The lay custodian had referred to a decision of a Kaaraka Sangha Sabha (Working Committee of monks of both Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters) which had preceded the latest announcement of the Malwatte Chief Prelate earlier this month supporting efforts of the President and the Prime Minister in bringing about political reforms..

Ponni samba down by Rs. 4
Lanka Sathosa further reduced the price of imported Ponni samba from Rs.84 to Rs.80 per kilo with effect from midnight yesterday in order to offer relief to consumers hit by high rice prices.
Lanka Sathosa Chairman Dr.T.N.K.B.Tennekoon said that consumers can purchase Ponni samba at the reduced price from 370 Lanka Sathosa outlets across the country.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said paddy production in the country has fallen by 50 percent due to the recent drought, leading to the high rice prices. That is why,the Cost of Living Cabinet Sub Committee, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, made a decision to bring down the prices of several rice varieties with effect from last month.
Tennekoon said as per the new retail prices, a kilogramme of White Nadu is Rs.77, White Kekulu Rs.64,Ponni Samba Rs.84,and an imported broken rice variety is Rs.60, while the wholesale price of a kilo of White Nadu is Rs.73 and White Kekulu Rs.63.
He further said that there has been a very slight pickup in sales growth in the last month with the reduction of rice prices.
Dr.Tennakoon said the Cost of Living Cabinet Sub Committee meeting met the day before yesterday and decided to further reduce the prices of samba rice from Rs.84 to Rs.80 per kilo.
Lanka Sathosa will also formulate a programme to enable consumers at village level to buy rice at the same prices available at Lanka Sathosa outlets, from their retail shops. Therefore,the Regional Managers of 370 Lanka Sathosa outlets in the country will meet village level trade associations representatives to offer rice stocks at Lanka Sathosa prices.
When we reduce the prices, the other super market chains also follow suit, he said.
He said that Sathosa also expects to reduce the prices of several other essential items,such as, sprats, canned fish, potatoes and big onions in a bid to bring down the cost of living.
The Lanka Sathosa Chairman added that the Cabinet has approved the importation of rice through Sathosa which would result in rice being sold for a much lesser price in the future.
Lanka Sathosa will import 500,000 metric tones of rice and around 1,00,000 metric tones of Nadu rice has already been brought to the country, while another stock of 1,00,00 metric tones of rice will arrive next month.
In order to provide coconut at low prices to consumers, islandwide Kapruka societies have been informed to supply coconuts directly to Sathosa outlets.
"There is a decrease in coconut production due to the drought especially in the Kurunegala district. "We have received only around 75,000 coconuts eventhough we have a daily requirement of 45,000 coconuts,he added.

Poor village girl sacked from school on false pregnancy charges
A Grade 10 school girl attached to a government school in Madatugama in Kekirawa is receiving treatment at the Dambulla hospital due to a silly draconian punishment meted out to her by her woman Principal.
The girl belongs to a family in Hewenthennegama, Madatugama languishing in abject poverty. Many a day she attends school without any food as foregoing meals is common with their family. On this particular day too she had attended school without breakfast. She had suddenly vomited in class as her stomach was totally empty. Thereafter, three other girls had informed the Principal about the incident alleging that she was pregnant. Without ascertaining true facts the Principal had summoned teachers in the disciplinary committee and after a secret discussion summoned the girl's parents to the school and issued a letter of termination saying the girl is sacked from school as she was expecting'.
The poor parents who were clueless of the whole matter had obtained a loan of Rs. 500, taken the girl in a taxi and admitted her to Dambulla hospital relating the whole story to the doctors including their predicament. After a protracted medical examination the doctors had concluded that the girl was neither pregnant nor a victim of any sexual abuse.
Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. Gamini Senanayake when contacted said the hospital VOG had medically examined the girl and issued as all clear certificate. Dr. Senanayake said they had lodged a complaint with the Children's and Women's Secretariat about the entire story.
They were keeping the girl under observation at the hospital until she got over her psychological trauma caused by the false accusations leveled at her. The girl's mother D. M. Somawathie (57) said a teacher spoke to her on the telephone on October 12 and summoned her and husband to school.
When they went as requested, the teachers told them to take her away from school alleging that she was pregnant. Although the daughter vehemently denied the charge in deep mental agony, they persisted with their stand. She said her daughter was a bright student with great learning skills and a group of girls had made the false complaint through sheer jealousy. Their family could not even face the neighbours as the story had spread in the village like wild fire.
Their intention was to get their daughter back to the same school in order to prove her innocence.
School Principal S. K. Godakanda who was contacted on the phone said they had to sack the girl due to indiscipline.

Port of Rotterdam aims to set up multifuel bunker station
The Port of Rotterdam has set sights on a new multifuel bunker station for the refueling of LNG and other cleaner fuels.
The port authority has signed a letter of intent with PitPoint.LNG, a joint venture formed by PitPoint clean fuels and Primagaz Nederland BV, to investigate the realization of such a project.
Krabbegors/Duivelseiland at Dordrecht Inland Seaport has been designated as the location for this bunker station.
The realization of a multifuel bunker station reflects the Port of Rotterdam's commitment to play a pioneering role, as the administrator of the biggest port in Europe, in energy transition within Europe. In this way, we will encourage the use of LNG as an alternative to fuel oil in shipping, Ronald Paul, COO for the Port of Rotterdam, said.
Dordrecht Inland Seaport is the most inland seaport in the Netherlands. It forms the meeting point of the shipping lanes for the cities of Amsterdam - Rotterdam - Antwerp, and the main shipping route into Germany: the ideal location for a bunker station of this type, Pitpoint.LNG said.
Over the coming period, the duo intends to focus their efforts to further explore the feasibility of the multifuel bunker station. As informed, this will include holding discussions with potential customers, partners and suppliers to see how the supply and demand for cleaner fuels can be effectively matched.
Whether it's hydrogen, electric, biodiesel or LNG/CNG, a central aspect of the investigation is the requirement that all fuels supplied by the multifuel bunker station should produce fewer harmful emissions than traditional fuels. This includes fuel for ships, trucks and/or commercial vehicles with the aim of working together to achieve cleaner air and a better living environment, the company said.

The Government should take immediate measures to recommence academic activities of the eight medical faculties, Science Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayanth said.
He was giving ideas and proposals before the Public Commission on SAITM Conflict and Finding Solutions convened for the second time yesterday at the OPA in Colombo.
Students have been boycotting lectures for over nine months now. If I am the Minister, relevant to this field, I will never hesitate to abolish SAITM as an immediate solution to the crisis in medical education, the Minister said.
He further said that the crisis in medical education has affected the entire education system of the country as well as the health sector. The government and policy makers should pay their attention to strengthen state universities.
The Minister charged that the SAITM Management had misled the cabinet of ministers of the then government which granted permission to begin SAITM.
The approval had been taken to set up a higher education institution called the South Asian Institute of Technology and Management and later they have substituted Medicine for Management.
Frontline Socialist Party convener Pubudu Jagoda stressed the importance of taking immediate measures to stop recruiting new students to SAITM and ensure justice for the students currently studying at SAITM.
The Public Commission on SAITM Conflict and Finding Solution comprises Prof. Krishantha Abeysena of the University of Kelaniya, Dr S.M.S.Samarakoon of the Colombo University, engineer Ananda Ranasinghe, engineer Upali Rathnayake and gynaecologist, Oncological Surgeon Dr. Sarada Kannangara.

SLTDA stands by its statistics
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) says that they study many areas when publishing tourism arrival statics before releasing it.
In response to series of adverse publicity in this regard the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has forwarded the following release to refute the findings made against the statistics compiled by the Department.
The relevant data with regard to tourist arrivals is obtained by SLTDA from the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system of Department of Immigration and Emigration. Though the arrival data is utilized, only the relevant categories are taken into account, that are within the definition, while other categories are excluded from the statistics. Therefore, utilization of such selected data cannot be considered as problematic.
As mentioned in the report, the survey is conducted not solely to capture earnings. There are other objectives as well. However, the survey is not the primary instrument used to formulate the tourism earnings number. Average duration and arrivals are mainly based on the data obtained from the Department of Immigration and Emigration.
In terms of the issue of the sample, it is important to highlight the fact that the selection of the sample is not totally based on the number of arrivals from respective countries. While the base of the sample is selected from a stratified sampling method and it is further calculated from a model which considers the expenditure patterns of the tourist as well. Strict procedures are followed to ensure error free data and reliability tests and programme validation checks are applied at the end. The rationale in selecting the relevant sample sizes from Germany and UK against India and China is rather profound than the more visible factor of the arrivals.
The data captured in the questionnaire is basically based on the 37 questions included in the questionnaire. They have been included to capture a holistic picture. However, the questionnaires are being revised on yearly basis according to the market research needs.
The questions on spending have been included to get an overall idea and not to dig into details about the expenditure of the tourists. Including such lengthy information in the survey questionnaire will not be effective in generating valid data. It is expected to obtain such detailed information from Tourism Satellite Accounting system. The preparations are already underway to conduct certain surveys for the Tourism Satellite Accounting in collaboration with Department of Census and Statistics and Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
The rationale of collecting separate data on transit passengers in this survey is that their input is also vital in terms of marketing information. Therefore, it is difficult to ignore their contribution in this regard.
Apart from the above factors the following points should be raised with regard to the methodology used for the research report of CCC.
There is a serious issue of validity in generalizing the research findings to the tourism industry of Sri Lanka, given the fact that the sample consists of only 15 in depth interviews with industry leaders and a survey of 37 industry players from limited fields whereas the tourism industry consists of 3,549 registered establishments (with SLTDA) including registered accommodations, travel agencies, restaurants, spice gardens, tourist shops etc. Furthermore, there is no indication of these 37 industry players though the list of industry leaders has been provided. Therefore, there is a serious flaw in the methodology used for the study, which brings the authenticity of the study into serious question. In other words, the selection of sample and the sample size does not indicate the application of accepted scientific methods. On the surface, the content of the report seems to be a manifestation of personal opinion of the few industry stakeholders consulted.
Scientific method in research is a systematic approach to researching questions and problems through objective and accurate observation, collection and analysis of data, direct experimentation and replication of these procedures. Yet it is clearly evident that the research is subjective and biased.
The standard way of calculating the month on month growth in arrivals in many countries is by comparing the percentage changes with the corresponding month of the previous year, due to variations in tourist arrivals (Peak and off peak months) that characterize the industry. Sri Lanka being a seasonal destination the above practice is the most applicable method. Yet it was noticed that in Table No. 1 the calculations of month on month growth in tourist arrivals have been calculated by considering the % change from the previous month in the same year. This type of calculation misinterprets the real situation while creating a distorted picture about the growth. Therefore, this cannot be considered as an accurate way of analysis. The below table I & II provides an authentic depiction of the M-o-M growth in arrivals.
Method used by the Researcher to Calculate M-o-M Growth in Arrivals in the Research report
Table No.iii depicts the international tourist markets in comparison to Sri Lanka. A closer look at the figures reveals that Sri Lanka has the highest average percentage change from 2008 to 2016 which indicates to the fact that Sri Lanka has a sound industry when compared to other countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and India which maintains a robust industry. A considerable growth can be seen from 2009-2016. Therefore, when considered the percentage change it is clear that Sri Lanka has achieved the highest average percentage growth of 18.4% among the countries compared. Further, Sri Lanka has achieved the highest average percentage change of increase of arrivals in 2009 and 2016, compared with the same countries in the list. Therefore, it is incorrect and misleading to conclude that Sri Lanka has fallen behind without a valid base to support the argument.
Constructive evaluation is a necessary component to evaluate and improve the performance of an institution or an industry. Yet these should be based on authentic and credible information. In the absence of credibility such evaluations can be considered as assessments that lack rigour. We would also like to bring to your notice that the Special Committee Report on Revisions of New Tourism Law (2006) highlighted that both UNWTO and PATA have recognized the Sri Lanka Tourisms basic tourism data system as one of the best systems in the world. Further this system continues to improve with modern techniques for collating tourist information.

Toddy tappers FR fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by a toddy tapper challenging the activities of Kitulgala Police to produce persons who refuse to comply with the wrongful demands to provide toddy free of charge, before Courts purportedly in relation to illicit liquor offenses, was yesterday fixed for support by Supreme Court.
Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep fixed the petition for support on January 23 next year.
Gamaralalage Siril Kumara of Kitulgala filed this petition along with two other relatives naming Inspector Chanaka Wijeratne, the OIC of Kithulgala Police Station, SI Gunasena, SI Senaratne, Sargent Sandamal, Sargent Guanwardena of Kitulgala police station and IGP Pujitha Jayasundara as respondents.
The Petitioners stated that various officers of Kitulgala Police engage in the wrongful and illegal practice of requiring persons engaged in the lawful business of toddy tapping in the Kitulgala area to bribe the said officers of the Kitulgala with quantities of toddy for their consumption. They said Kitulgala Police engage in the wrongful and illegal practice of producing persons who refuse to comply with the wrongful demands to provide toddy free of charge, before Courts purportedly in relation to illicit liquor offenses. They occasionally prosecute various persons on the false basis of possession of illicit liquor to meet the prosecution targets set by the superior officers of the Police Department. Such persons prosecuted in such manner are compelled to plead guilty for the possession of small quantities of illicit liquor and pay penalties ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 15,000. The failure to comply with such illegal demands results with further harassment and intimidation by the police officers.
The Petitioners stated on July 28 at around 4.30 pm the 3rd and 4th Respondents arrived at the 1st Petitioners residence and took into possession a small quantity of toddy which was lawfully tapped by the 1st petitioner and claimed that the 1st Petitioner has illegally tapped toddy.
When the 1st Petitioner offered to provide the permit issued by the Department of Excise, the 3rd and 4th Respondents refused to accept the said document stating we dont care about those things, and demanded that the 1st Petitioner prepare himself to go to the Police Station.
The petitioners stated that the 1st Petitioner having not committed any offense, as he lawfully might, refused to comply with the unlawful and illegal instructions given by the 3rd and 4th Respondents, being well aware that the 1st Petitioner would be falsely and wrongfully arrested, remanded overnight and produced before the Magistrate of Ruwanwella on a possession of illicit liquor charge. Thereafter, the 3rd and 4th Respondents forcefully dragged the 1st Petitioner out of his residence and assaulted the 1st Petitioner whereupon the 1st Petitioner collapsed to the ground due to the excruciating pain he was subjected to.
The Petitioners state that the brazen attack on the 1st Petitioner who was laying on the floor in pain was in full view of those who were gathered including the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners, who commenced recoding the incident using their mobile telephones.
They stated the assault on the Petitioners, the wrongful and arbitrary arrest of the Petitioners and institution of action on false and fabricated charges leveled against the Petitioners are violative of the 2nd Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 11, Article 12(1), and Article 13(1) of the Constitution.
They further sought a sum of Rs.5 million as compensation from the respondents. This petition had been filed through counsel Thisya Weragoda, Iresh Seneviratne and Niluka Dissanayake.

Three men taken to their heels, leaving a motorcycle behind upon seeing a Police jeep coming their way were caught by a Police party that chased the trio.
The incident occurred at a place off the Bariyar-Handiya junction on the Mahiyanganaya-Panas Eka-Giraandurukotte road on October 17 afternoon. The officials later seized a roll of black adhesive tape, 3 mobile phones, a paper cutter, a roll of plaster, a pair scissors along with a toy pistol, 2 grenades and the motorcycle that belonged to them. There were three backpacks too with the trio.
A Police official in Giraandurukotte, the old capital of the Mahaweli Zone C, giving a brief account of the capture, said that the men in question were loitering at a firm on its payday. The men, below 30, were from the Naamal-Oya area, Ampara; the Kekirihena area, Mahaoya and the Meegahakivula area, Viyaluva.
An anonymous tip-off about the men had led the Police to rush to the location where the suspects were loitering. The way they behaved and the things seized from them have led the officials to believe that the trio had arrived at the place for a robbery.
The men were to be produced before Court in Mahiyanganaya, along with the seized possessions by Police during and after the capture.

UK banks exposed to money laundering
The UK Chancellor has asked financial regulators and the Serious Fraud Office to review whether banks HSBC and Standard Chartered are linked to a corruption scandal in South Africa.
Lord Peter Hain has raised concerns the banks may "inadvertently have been conduits" for laundered money.
The Labour peer is due to raise the issue in the House of Lords later.
The Treasury said it had sent Lord Hain's comments to financial regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Lord Hain told the BBC he had written to Chancellor Philip Hammond saying a whistle-blower had indicated the banks "maybe inadvertently have been conduits for the corrupt proceeds of money". The peer is due to raise the issue in the House of Lords later.
A Treasury spokesman said: "We take allegations of financial misconduct very seriously, and have passed Lord Hain's letter on to the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant UK law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office, to agree the right action," a spokesperson said.
The BBC's correspondent in Johannesburg, Andrew Harding, said Lord Hain's letter was "a new twist in a giant corruption scandal that is shaking the South Africa state, and damaging the reputations of a number of global companies".
At the centre of the allegations are South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and a wealthy business family, the Guptas.
Zuma and the Guptas strongly deny wrongdoing, and say they are victims of a "politically motivated witch-hunt".
But leaked emails and official investigations have fuelled claims that the Guptas have bought influence in government in order to loot state enterprises.
In South Africa, the scandal has already ruined British public relations company Bell Pottinger and damaged auditors KPMG, which removed its top executive team in the country.
A spokeswoman for the FCA said it was already in contact with the banks named by Lord Hain and would "consider carefully further responses received".
Standard Chartered said: "We are not able to comment on the details of client transactions, but can confirm that following an internal investigation accounts were closed by us in 2014." HSBC declined to comment.
Lord Hain, a leading anti-apartheid campaigner who grew up in South Africa, urged UK authorities "to track that stolen money down and make sure that British financial institutions help return it to South African taxpayers".
It is claimed that money was taken out of South Africa via Hong Kong and Dubai.

UN tells China to release human rights activists and pay them compensation

TheUnited Nationshas demanded that China should immediately release prominent human rights activists from detention and pay them compensation, according to an unreleased document obtained by the Guardian.
The report, which has not been made public, from the UNs human rights council says the trio had their rights violated and calls Chinas laws incompatible with international norms.
Christian church leader Hu Shigen and lawyers Zhou Shifeng and Xie Yang were detained and tried as part of an unprecedentednationwide crackdownon human rights attorneys and activists that began in July 2015. The operation saw nearly250 people detainedand questioned by police.
Hu was jailed for seven and a half years and Zhou was sentenced to seven years on subversion charges, while Xie is awaiting a verdict.
The appropriate remedy would be to release Hu Shigen, Zhou Shifeng and Xie Yang immediately, and accord them an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, said the UNreport seen by the Guardian, adding thatChinashould take action within six months.
The UNsworking group on arbitrary detention, which reviewed the case, rejected Chinese government claims the three men voluntarily confessed to their crimes at their trials and said their detentions were made in total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating to the right to a fair trial.
The group is a panel of five experts that falls under the UNs human rights council, of which China is a member. While its judgements are not legally binding, it investigates claims of rights violations and suggests remedies.
China promised to cooperate with the group when it ran for a seat on the human rights council in August 2016, when it also pledged to make unremitting efforts to promote human rights.
The groups report on the Chinese activists said the trio were subjected to a host of rights violations, including being denied access to legal counsel, being held in incommunicado detention and their families were not informed of their whereabouts for several months.
Their detentions were due to their activities to promote and protect human rights, the UN found, while the opinion also encouraged China to amend its laws to conform with international standards protecting human rights.
Although Xie was released on bail after a trial in May, his wife, Chen Guiqiu said her husband was far from a free man.
State security agents rented a flat across the hall from his and Xie has 12 guards stationed 24-hours a day outside his building, Chen said. Police follow him whenever he goes out and despite the constant surveillance, he has to prepare reports for state security agents every four hours on what he has done and who he has spoken to.
But Chen welcomed the UNs report and said she felt vindicated.
Of course, he didnt commit any crime, his arrest was completely illegal and Im glad the UN, a very objective party that represents the international community, can see that, said Chen, whofled to the USearlier this year.
I hope this will put pressure on China and make them think twice the next time they consider arresting people on political charges.
Paying compensation would show the government admits they harmed our family, that they were wrong to subject us to more than two years of continuous harm, she added.
During his detention, Xie wasbeaten and forced into stress positions, his legal team said, with one interrogator telling him: Well torture you to death just like an ant.
Ambassadors from countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, wrote to Chinas minister of public security in February,voicing concernsover the torture claims and calling for an independent investigation.
The working groups opinion cuts straight through the governments lies and shows that the arrests were always about retaliation against lawyers for protecting human rights, said Frances Eve, a researcher at theNetwork of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. The government put enormous resources into their propaganda campaign to smear human rights lawyers as criminals, deploying state media, police, prosecutors and the courts.
During the course of the panels investigation, the Chinese government said the men were jailed not because they defend the legitimate rights of others but rather they have long been engaged in criminal activities, aimed at subverting the basic national system established under the Chinas [sic] constitution. The UN rejected this claim.
Critics say Hu was arrested for leading anunderground church, which works outside the government-sanctioned system. He previously spent 16 years in prison for distributing leaflets on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent bloody crackdown.
Zhou is a prominenthuman rights attorneywho founded the Fengrui law firm that was at the centre of the 2015 government war on law. His firm represented dissident artist Ai Weiwei, members of the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong and a journalist arrested for supported protests in Hong Kong.
The UNs working group on arbitrary detention previously told China to release Liu Xia, the wife of the Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in detention in July. Liu Xia has been under house arrest since 2010, when her husband won the prize, despite never being charged with a crime.

Unequal economic development, land admin,  ageing population hinder Vision 2025: WB
Among key constraints to Sri Lankas growth are unequal economic development across provinces, land administration and an ageing population, the World Bank (WB) has said in its website, commenting on the governments Vision 2025 programme, which sets out a course of reforms to make the country more competitive and lift all Sri Lankans standards of living.
Vision 2025 reforms range from the pressing need for labour law reform to restructuring social safety net programmes and boosting technology acquisition and digitisation.
The World Bank says that as Sri Lanka looks to the future, the country needs to address the needs of a rapidly ageing population.
Further, it says land administration in Sri Lanka is impeding economic development. As noted by the government, the islands archaic land policy is inefficient and underdeveloped and reform is urgently needed.
Among a slew of programs focused on underserved communities and regions is the World Bank-supported North East Local Services Improvement Project, which helped improve infrastructure and the delivery of public services in isolated communities in the North and East Provinces.
Other similar priorities comprise an expanding portfolio on infrastructure, including urban development, roads, flood protection and water supply.
In this context, the Governments commitment to supporting private-public partnerships (PPPs) to reduce reliance of public funds for infrastructure will require greater private sector financing. This is central to the World Banks strategy to maximize finance for development through the participation of the private sector.
Sri Lankas old-age income protection is not adequate for its rapidly ageing population. Today, the Public Servants Pension Scheme (PSPS) covers about 10.3% of the labour force and provides a generous benefit at a high and growing cost of about 1.4% of GDP.
The growth in civil service headcount and payroll suggests that pensions costs will only grow, testing state coffers, the World Bank says in its website.
Reforms are also needed for pension systems like the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees Trust Fund (ETF), to ensure they are a reliable support for an aging and vulnerable population, while also proving sustainable and affordable for the government, the World Bank says.
The World Bank is committed to supporting the Governments efforts to strengthen social safety nets.
The main welfare programme, Samurdhi, was established in 1996 and has a force of 26,000 civil servants but many of the beneficiaries have been in the program without review since its inception.
Reform is long overdue, the World Bank says.
Having identified many of the problems and possible solutions, the test of V2025 now lies in implementation, the Bank says.
Many critical steps have been taken toward realising the vision outlined in this document, but sustained commitment will be required to see it through, the World Bank says.
To see this become a reality, deep and system-wide reforms are needed toward reducing poverty and creating prosperity for all Sri Lankans.

USAID partners $12 mn YouLead employability,  skills development project
In an ambitious drive to tackle youth unemployment, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) along with the business leaders and the Sri Lankan Government unveiled YouLead , a new employability and skills development project yesterday.
The YouLead is a $ 12 million initiative that USAID and its project partners will collaborate for a four -year period to help young Sri Lankans between the ages of 16 and 35 to become more competitive in the labour market.
The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Atul Keshap speaking at the inaugural ceremony stressed the need to train and sharpen the capabilities of the Sri Lankan youth to cater to the demand of both local and international job market.
In addition, the Ambassador underscored the need to support innovation and start-ups culture in Sri Lanka. Citing human talent of Sri Lanka as an inspiring and amazing story to the world, the ambassador reiterated the US government support to develop skills and help realize the dreams and aspirations of local youth.
The ambassador also expressed hope that Sri Lankans could look for a bright future despite all the suffering, trauma experienced by them over the last two -three decades.We will fully invest in the success of the Sri Lankan people and project like You Lead would help Sri Lankans contribute to the greater happiness and prosperity of the economy.
We want to see Sri Lanka as a truly democratic, prosperous, happy and reconciled country in the future. While stressing the need to better prepare the youth for employment opportunities arising from burgeoning tourism sector, which alone requires another 300,000 workforce by 2020, as well as construction and Maritime sector, he said that it was high time to take proactive measures to take these industries growth to the next level by addressing the acute labour shortage in these respective industries. Noting that youth as the future of the country, he emphasised that 70% of unemployed people in Sri Lanka are youth aged between 15-29.
Echoing the same sentiments expressed by the ambassador, the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Chandima Weerakkody said Sri Lankas biggest challenge as of now is the issue of youth unemployment.
We have already taken measures introduce school curriculum to match the existing and future talent on par with the international job market demand.Through these initiatives, it is intended to reduce the gap between employer and employee and we believe that it is high time to take speedy
actions to attract youth into potential sectors like tourism, construction and maritime.
Speaking on women unemployment in Sri Lanka, the Minister claimed that women participation in tourism sector accounts for 9 % and the same situation applies to the women representation in the parliament.
Women are prevented from joining tourism sector due to Sri Lankan thinking. The YouLead, will also engage the private sector and the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training on skills, knowledge, and capacity-building activities that aim to increase youth employability and sustainable self-employment.
YouLead regional focus is on the provinces with the highest youth unemployment, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Southern and Northern Provinces. The project also aims to foster increased opportunities for self-employment by improving the skills of young entrepreneurs and working with financial institutions to encourage more lending to youth-led start-ups. Given the substantial number of unemployed women and their 35 percent workforce participation rate, YouLead will encourage more women to enter the workforce and take up in-demand careers.

Yan Oya farmers falling from frying pan to oven
It is leant that the construction work of Yan Oya reservoir has been completed. But the filling water to the reservoir bearing a capacity of 145,000 a.f. delayed due to the slow resettlement process. This episode was disclosed at the recently held Anuradhapura district Agriculture Committee Meeting.
The Yan Oya reservoir project land officer H. Ranasinghe said that 81 and 137 farmer families respectively in Horowothana and Gomarankadawala DS divisions who lost housing due to the emergence of the Yan Oya reservoir are being resettled. Still the Yan Oya has not been closed to enable to fill the reservoir as the people vehemently oppose it on the grounds of complicated and delayed resettlement process. Although housing lands are shown, muddy lands are yet to be demarcated for starting cultivation. Recently the Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Gamini Vijith Wijayamuni Zoysa met these families at Wahalkada project office.
He promised to submit a cabinet paper to pay compensation for cultivation seasons being deprived of to the destitute farmer families to empower their livelihood. This would be paid monthly up to Rs. 8,000 per family until they have got the first harvest from the cultivation in the paddy lands yet to be allocated, Ranasinghe added.
It is leant that as a result of the tug-of-war between Forest Conservation Department and the Central Environmental Authority, the removal of trees in the landscapes allocated for house construction not allowed by the forest conservation department, sans the approval at the C.E.A. Both these institutes come under the Environment Affairs Ministry.
A group of aggrieved farmers facing the resettlement problem in Yan Oya also represented their plight to the government agent and the D.A.C. A victimized farmer G. Abesinghe said that they volunteered to offer their houses and paddy lands for accommodating the Yan Oya reservoir. But even though the reservoir has been completed, the resettlement facilities are delayed and still dragging on with a promise that all infra-structural facilities would be provided given by the project officials and that 50 families have come to live under Omarakada Tank.
We don't have drinking water, transport facilities including approach roads electricity and sanitation facilities and above all any livelihood sustenance support. No muddy lands given and we understand that still muddy lands are being surveyed. We have been facing threats from wild elephants risking our life in the thick darkness in the Omarakada jungle area. Funds for constructing houses are paid in installments thus delaying the construction.
We are starving and suffering untold hardships, Abeysinghe unfolded the pathetic and bitter plight of them in Yan Oya with tears.
Anuradhapura government agent R.M. Wanninayake consoling the farmers in distress emphasized that he would immediately converse with the Yan Oya reservoir Project Director and the Project Officials as well as Forest and Wildlife Conservation Officials regarding the immediate possible solutions for the problems. He instructed the Divisional Secretary Horowpothana to make arrangements to pay the housing compensation to the farmers in full to enable them to finish housing construction and the payments of Rs. 8,000 life supporting allowance to the affected farmers.

Brandix launches Blood Drive marking  10th year as corporate donor
The BrandixGroup has announced the launch of a four-month Blood Drive at factories across Sri Lanka to mark the milestone 10th anniversary of the Groups annual contribution as a corporate blood donor to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS).
Recognized as the largest corporate donor of blood in Sri Lanka for the past seven years consecutively, the Group has donated a cumulative24,513 units of blood to the NBTS over the past decade, with the campaign of 2016-17 resulting in the collection of 4,090 units of blood,the highest volume donated in a single year.
The 2017-18 Brandix Blood Drive commenced at Brandix Athleisure, Polonnaruwa and Brandix Fast Fashion, Mirigama and was followed by a collection at the Groups Head Office in Colombo recently. Over the next four months, teams from the NTBS will visit Brandix manufacturing locations on designated days to collect blood from volunteers among the associates employed at them.
It is heartening see that the enthusiasm of our associates and their commitment to the causehas not wavered over the 10 years of this annual blood drive, commented Ishan Dantanarayana, Chief People Officer of the Brandix Group. Their civic consciousness is steadfast and continues to inspire us to expand this initiative each year.
Beside the annual recognition bestowed on Brandix by NBTS for the past seven years for being the largest corporate blood donor in the country, the Group was also honoured with a plaque in 2013, in acknowledgement of an aggregate 10,000 pints of blood donated voluntarily by its employees by end 2012.
According to the NTBS, donations of this scale over a significant time period are necessary to meet the organisations requirements. By being geographically widespread, the Brandix campaign increases supplies of blood in many areas, including those that do not usually receive donations of significant volume compared with areas like Colombo. Brandixs blood donation campaigns are also extra significant as they are conducted on weekdays instead of the general norm of weekends.
This is particularly helpful in sustaining blood platelets, which have a lifespan of five days, for use during the course of the week.

Chinas economy grows 6.8% in 3Q
Chinas economy grew at 6.8 per cent in the third quarter year on year, slightly below the previous period but still above the governments full-year target, boosting President Xi Jinpings effort to consolidate power at a five-yearly Communist party congress.
Chinas economy grew 6.8% between July and September according to official data released Thursday, slowing slightly from the previous quarter.
The growth rate, which compares expansion with the same three months in the previous year, met forecasts. The latest GDP figures are still above Beijings annual growth target of 6.5% for 2017.
The worlds second-largest economy is trying to rein in debt and contain a housing bubble without hurting growth. Those efforts are expected to have weighed on economic activity in some parts of China, but growth has been supported by higher-than-expected rise in trade and bank lending.
The result followed growth of 6.9% in the first and second quarters of the year.
A less supportive fiscal policy stance and slower credit growth should result in a slowdown over the coming months, said Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard.
Leaders meet
The figures come as China holds its Communist Party congress to determine the countrys direction for the next term.
President Xi Jinping said the country will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors, amid disappointment from some foreign executives and analysts about the pace of reform.Chinas economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development, Mr Xi said when he opened the congress on Wednesday.
The country wants to wean its dependence away from export-led growth and toward domestic consumption. Since the global financial crisis, Chinas economic growth has slowed, from an average of 10% a year in the previous three decades to a rate of 6.7% last year. BBC

Falling meteorite maybe  radioactive, researchers warn
Colombo University Physics Professor Chandana Jayaratne confirmed to the Daily News that reports of people sighting a fireball in the Southern skies and loud sounds akin to an explosion is that of a meteor entering the earths photosphere.
This was spotted around 8:30pm yesterday in many parts of the country, not just over Southern skies. Even people who were in Nuwara Eliya and Colombo too had seen a fireball in the sky, he said. However the sound was only heard in Matara since the meteorite was between 150 to 200 km above sea-level from there.
Prof. Jayaratne however warned that falling debris could be radioactive in nature and warned people not to touch it. We dont know the degree of radioactivity, so we advise people not to touch it and inform us immediately.
He added that meteorites enter the earths photosphere at a speed of 65km per second and can self-combust on entry which gives it the fireball like appearance that many people had reported as seeing.
The explosion could have caused damage, but it broke into small pieces, which happens often. People should not touch those pieces because it can be radioactive and potentially harmful."
On Wednesday night, people had reported seeing bright illuminating lights and some have heard explosions. It was not immediately clear the cause of the bright lights or the sound of the explosion.

The mobile phone has become an essential accessory and a lot of their activitiesnews, entertainment, social networking, and conferencing among other areas happen on the mobile phone. So why not banking Despite this being an easy question, to deliver this requires significant investments in technology and how we work. Engaging closely and building alliances with the ICT industry in Sri Lanka is a key aspect.

Most transactions will be conducted through digital payments as opposed to cash and cheques today.

Journalists must tell  the truth - President
Journalisms first obligation is to tell the truth, President Maithripala Sirisena asserted yesterday.
The President said that journalists should use their pen to give accurate and truthful information to the public without resorting to biased or false news reporting.
President Sirisena lamented that some present-day journalists were trying to protect corrupt politicians for personal gain.
Similarly, there were those who threw mud at political opponents.
The President made this observation,addressing a gathering, on the occasion of the issuing of a felicitation stamp for iconic media personality the late D.B.Dhanapala at the Library and Documentation Board, Colombo yesterday.
Journalists must always choose what is right, respect the truth and be fair in their writing, the President said. The President also said the time has come to have hundreds of capable and quality journalists of late D.B.Dhanapalas calibre to have an ethical and more advanced media sector.
While highlighting the importance of impartiality from a journalist, the President added that the country needs hundreds of D.B.Dhanapalas to streamline the media field.
The President noted that Dhanapala was an exemplary character in the field of journalism moreover for the ethical standards he maintained in the profession.
His pen worked efficiently,impartially, whilst without any favouritism. His talents, capabilities and knowledge in the journalism field were borne out by his strong backbone, the President added.
President Sirisena added that the exemplary,impartial journalistic career of Dhanapala showcases how a journalist should perform in the media field without any bias.
It can be seen that some journalists are feeding out of the pockets of certain corrupt politicians. These media persons do not dare to utter a single word against the fraud and corruption of these politicians. But,they never hesitate to level baseless allegations against other innocent politicians, the President said.
The President said that there are, both, pluses and minuses in the countrys print media sector.
President Sirisena added that late D.B.Dhanapala did yeomen service to the local media field, especially to the print media sector.
During the last few decades, it was observed that journalists were badly suppressed. They (journalists) were killed and assaulted while a significant number of journalists fled the country fearing for their lives. Besides, we saw not only the properties of journalists but also media organisations being set on fire. But that situation has completely been changed. No journalist is harassed or suppressed, the President added.
President Sirisena said that the media should play a responsible role, instead of rousing people through negative news. The President added that the media is duty bound to be the driving force of the country, towards prosperity, to create a better future. The President stressed that the media should act in a responsible and acceptable manner while following media ethics and norms,so as to cultivate a positive attitude among the people.
Even though it is regrettable to mention, the Sri Lankan media has not clearly understood the duty expected of them, the President added.
President Maithripala Sirisena also recalled starting his career as a provincial reporter for Lake House newspapers when he was 19 years and urged practitioners of his former profession to remain independent.
President Sirisena became a school reporter for the childrens newspaper Mihira when he was in his early teens. When I was in grade seven or eight of Royal College, Polonnaruwa, I applied to contribute articles to the Mihira and about a week later, I got a letter saying I was accepted.
He said he later had three full time jobs, the first being a provincial correspondent for the Lake House Group of newspapers when he was 19 years old. From 1970 to 77 he worked for Lake House and later joined the SLFP paper Dinakara in 1977. He was also a grama sevaka before joining full-time politics.

Wimaladhamma Thera said that the comments he made on Wednesday were his personal opinion and not a collective decision taken by the Karaka Sabha of the Malwatte chapter.
He went on to say that the Mahanayake of the Malwatte chapter was currently overseas and matters related to the constitution will be discussed when he returns.

MullenLowe Sri Lanka strikes  Gold at Effies again
MullenLowe Sri Lanka has once again taken home the Gold Award in the Foods category at the recently concluded 2016 Effie Awards for their innovative and inspired work on Marmites 'Mealtime Magic' campaign.
The ceremony, which was held at the Waters Edge, saw only four Gold Awards being handed out on the night. The full service agency was also awarded a Bronze Award in the Personal Care category for Rexonas 'A Lesson in Body Odour' and adjudged as finalists in the Home Supplies and Services category for their Surf Excel 'Raja Weda Poddo' and Vim 'Diviyata Disne' campaigns, respectively.
Our recognition at this years award show is a testimony of the agencys commitment to meaningful, hard working campaigns. Awards are not a result of an agency teams effort alone, but a true partnership with likeminded clients who collaborate to bring the best out of us, said Thayalan Bartlett, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), MullenLowe Sri Lanka.
Marmites 'Mealtime Magic' was conceived to update the brands image for a new generation. This was done by creating 'mite' combos by giving everyday dishes a delicious twist by adding Marmite.
Rexonas 'A Lesson in Body Odour' sought to tackle the under-penetration of deodorant in the country by educating the public in its necessity. This was done through a social experiment that placed people in a familiar situation and proved the need for deodorant.
Surf Excels 'Raj Weda Poddo' tried to take children away from their modern gadgets and back to the creativity of the playground by asking them to think differently. They were asked to build a toy out of waste items found around the home and Surf Excel packs and tag the photo on Facebook.
Vims 'Diviyata Disne' was born to empower homemakers, the unsung heroes of the family. Vim helped these homemakers hone their skills through workshops so they would be able to supplement their income. MullenLowe had won a Gold in the Packaged Food category for Marmite, a Silver in the same category for Knorr, and a Bronze in the Finance category for LOLC and took home the coveted 'Most Effective Agency of the Year' title at the Effies last year.
As it stands, the agency holds two of only eight Gold Awards that have been awarded in the history of the Effies in Sri Lanka.
A global symbol of achievement with award programs honouring effective marketing communications in 42 countries and 6 regions, the Effie Awards have been held in Sri Lanka in partnership with the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) since 2008.
MullenLowe Sri Lanka is the local office of the MullenLowe Group, a member of the US$7.6 billion Interpublic Group (IPG) - one of the world's leading organizations of advertising agencies and marketing services companies headquartered in New York.

The Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhas will be divided into six Pradeshiya Sabhas, increasing the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya district by another four, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News on Wednesday, the Secretary said a collective decision was reached in this regard on Tuesday at a meeting chaired by Minister Faiszer Musthapha and attended by the JVP, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Minister Mano Ganesan and other upcountry political parties.
He said the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha which has a population of about 210,000 would be divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas and the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha, which has a population of about 190,000 would be divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas. However, the Secretary explained that the current number of members in those respective areas will not increase as a result of the formation of new LG authorities. That was the agreement reached, he said. He said the political party representatives who took part in the meeting gave their verbal agreement to this arrangement, adding that those political parties were asked to make their recommendations in writing to the Ministry by next week. He pointed out that the upcountry Tamil Parties were insisting that those new local government bodies must be included in the upcoming LG polls.
We held the Gazette indicating the number of members in each LG body due to this reason. It will be issued soon after we receive the written recommendations of the Political Parties, he noted.
