National policy, authority to facilitate SMEs
A National Policy Framework and a National SME Authority will be established to facilitate the SMEs but not to regulate them, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
The Minister was addressing the inauguration of Aadhayam 2017 yesterday at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
Minister Bathiudeen said the Ministry together with the National Enterprise Development Authority is to introduce the National SME Policy and National SME Authority.
The policy is ready to be published and Cabinet approval was also given to establish the Authority, the Minister said. Minister Bathiudeen said over one million registered SMEs and MSEs are in Sri Lanka and each provides employment to three people on average especially in rural areas.
We believe that SMEs are 75 percent of the total number of enterprises in the economy providing 45 percent of employments and contributing to 52 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With the increasing trend of globalisation, the service sector has become the driving force for growth and development, he said.
He said the Ministry has commenced a four-year project of USD 9 million to introduce SMEs trade commodities in regional and EU markets. and he said the project was to enhance the export trade commodities of SMEs in Sri Lanka.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Lovita Ramgutte said the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity.
As Sri Lanka aspires to become a higher middle income country, we believe that SMEs and entrepreneurs present an important opportunity to develop the existing potential in the country,she said.
Aadhayam 2017, a national trade fair organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka, will be held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (Colombo) on July 14, 15 and 16. The three-day trade fair will showcase over 200 entrepreneurs, producer groups and organisations from 10 selected districts of the country: Ampara, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Monaragala, Mullativu, Puttalam, and Vavuniya.
The Aadhayam 2017 is going to create a favourable platform for Sri Lankan small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to promote them and help them connect with each other and expand into larger markets and make important business partnerships for national and international trade. The event is organised in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of Canada, the European Union, and the Government of Norway.
Thee producers have been supported by the UNDP under the Governance for Local Economic Development (GLED) programme, projects supported by the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of Canada, the European Union and the Government of Norway.
The UNDP has partnered with government counterparts at local and national level and institutes such as the National Design Centre (NDC), Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), and Industrial Services Bureau (ISB) to ensure the sustainability of the producers.

You only have one body Boris Beckers advice to Andy Murray
Andy Murray's defence of his Wimbledon title ended with him limping to defeat in his quarter-final against Sam Querrey on Wednesday.
The 30-year-old Briton will retain his world number one ranking for now, because Novak Djokovic was forced to retire from his match against Tomas Berdych later on the same day.
But what should Murray and his injured hip do next
Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker explains how top tennis stars cope with advancing age and chronic injury - and why we should not give up hope of seeing the Scot manage a third triumph on Centre Court.
'AGE IS ONLY A NUMBER, BUT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BODY'
Novak Djokovic gets treatment for his injured right elbow. AFP
The next Grand Slam is the US Open, from 28 August. Murray, the 2012 champion, lost in the quarter-finals in New York last year. Before then, he is scheduled to play at ATP tournaments in Montreal from 7 August and Cincinnati a week later.
Becker: Andy Murray's defeat should not be seen as the beginning of the end of his chances of winning another Grand Slam. Absolutely not.
I think what has happened so far this year has actually proved that, the older you get, the better you are - look at Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, what Serena Williams was doing and what Venus is doing now. They are all older than him.
Age is only a number, but you only have one body. Andy has to look after his.
He has got to think long-term, not worry about making the US Open - if he is moving there like he did at Wimbledon, then he won't win it anyway.
So, the worst thing that can happen if he skips New York is that he misses one Grand Slam - that doesn't matter, because the Australian Open is around the corner at the start of 2018.
His ranking should not be a concern either. Again, he will not defend it if he is not healthy, so he should just forget it.
He has been there and done it and he does not have to prove anything anymore that he is good enough to be number one.
'LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM RAFA AND ROGER'
Rafael Nadal pulled out of the French Open in May 2016 with a wrist injury and did not play again until the Rio Olympics in August. He won his 10th title at Roland Garros earlier this year. Roger Federer missed the final five months of 2016 to recover from his knee injury but returned to win the Australian Open in January.
Becker: With this injury, there are limitations to Andy's movement. There are some players who depend more on their serve who can get quick points, but Andy relies on his speed and footwork, which are an integral part of his game.
That is why he needs to be 100% fit. It's no good for him to be 75% - yes, he is maybe good enough to get to the quarters, like he did here, but he is the number one in the world and he enters tournaments to win them.
The Tour is a gruelling schedule and I would give the same advice to Novak too - rest.
They should both look at the examples of Rafa and Roger. Look at what they have done since coming back fully fit.
Nadal struggled last year with injuries, so he took some time off to get fully fit and look what a year he is having.
So maybe that is a lesson learned for Andy and Novak to really take care of their bodies - take their time and get healthy, and don't play when they can't.
'ANDY HAS TO BE HONEST WITH HIMSELF'
Murray admits he has managed his hip condition since he was 22. He has also suffered from chronic back pain that affected him earlier in his career, and he had surgery on an injured disc in 2013. Djokovic revealed after his Wimbledon exit that his elbow has been bothering him for more than 18 months.
Becker: Injuries are part of tennis. Most players have niggles and pains right through the year and usually you are able to manage them with the physios and recovery schedules you are given.
But in Grand Slams you play longer matches and there is more chance they can flare up.I understand why Andy played Wimbledon, because it is his number one tournament every year, and he was also the defending champion. He was desperate to make it work.
I was always the same. In hindsight, I should not have played some of my matches but, in the heat of the moment, I always wanted to play the next round or the next event.
But you run the risk of doing yourself more serious damage if you play on, and that happened to me. I had my struggles with certain injuries, especially with my right ankle, and I am paying a heavy price today.
Andy is now at the point where he needs to be really honest with himself because if he can't run, he can't play.
It looked bad for him on Wednesday but he probably does not know yet what is going to happen next.
I credit him for not wanting to use the hip injury as an excuse for his defeat but he needs to get a couple of opinions from doctors before he thinks about coming back.
'YOUR MOTIVATION CHANGES WITH AGE'
Becker won Wimbledon twice as a teenager in 1985 and 1986. His last Grand Slam victory was the 1996 Australian Open at the age of 28. He retired at the age of 32 in 1999.
Becker: Turning 30 is a milestone for a tennis player but it is not a reason to be injured more. That is down to the amount of tennis you play, and how you deal with your injuries.
The attractions for me when I was unable to play were always the same - every week brought another tournament and more ranking points, and of course you want to get back to doing something you love.
I am sure Andy is the same - that desire to keep playing tennis is not his problem, but I think emotions are the wrong things for him to follow right now. He has to follow logic and just think about the rest of his career. As you get older it does get harder to come back. If it is a new injury every year then it is manageable. If it is the same injury for a number of years, then eventually it can affect your mind-set - and that is the crucial thing here.
In my experience, your motivation changes with age. It cannot be the same at 30 as it was at 20, and you cannot have the same motivation to win Wimbledon again when you have already won it once, because the second time is not the same.
You have to find different ways to stimulate yourself, because ultimately that is what prolongs your career and means you keep coming back.
Look at Roger Federer, who is playing the best tennis ever at the age of 35 because he has got everything right in the rest of his life too.  BBC

Afghan charged over smuggling asylum-seekers to Australia
AUSTRALIA: An Afghan man who reportedly made millions of dollars smuggling asylum-seekers to Australia by boat has been extradited from Indonesia and charged with 10 offences, Australian police said Friday.
Ahmad Zia Alizadah, who was flown from Jakarta to Perth on Thursday, is accused of charging 263 asylum-seekers between US$ 4,000 to US$10,000 each for the perilous boat trips, The Australian newspaper reported.
Although such extraditions remain rare, they are part of the conservative government's tough policy on asylum-seekers, which includes turning back boats or sending those apprehended to isolated Pacific Island camps.
Alizadah, 35, was extradited and charged with 10 offences for allegedly organising four such journeys from Indonesia to Australia between 2009-2010. People-smuggling is a crime with global dimensions that can only be tackled through hard work and cooperation with our international partners, the Australian government said in a statement.
Under the current policy, boatpeople are held indefinitely at the centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island while their refugee applications are processed, and are blocked from resettling in Australia.
Since the measures were adopted, Australia has marked more than 1,000 days since the last asylum-seeker vessel reached its shores. Such arrivals were almost a daily occurrence under the previous Labor administration.
Canberra, which insists the measures are necessary to prevent deaths at sea, has faced widespread criticism by refugee advocates and medical professionals over the Pacific camps' conditions.
The Manus camp is set to close by October after a PNG Supreme Court ruling declared that holding people there was unconstitutional and illegal, with the detainees relocated to third countries such as the United States and Cambodia, or resettled elsewhere in PNG.
The harsh policy also stoked tensions with Jakarta, amid allegations two years ago that an Australian official paid the captain and crew of a boat carrying asylum-seekers thousands of dollars to turn back.
Under the previous Labor government, at least 1,200 people died trying to reach Australia by boat between 2008 and 2013. Almost 850 vessels carrying 51,798 asylum-seekers arrived in Australia between those dates, according to figures complied by the Australian parliament. - AFP

AG objects in CEJs writ petition against Port City project
The Court of Appeal was yesterday informed that the Attorney General had preliminary objections challenging the maintainabillity of a writ petition filed against the Chinese funded Colombo Port City Project.
When the writ petition came up before Court of Appeal President, Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya, the petitioners were directed to make their oral submissions regarding the preliminary objections on August 8.
In its petition, the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) cited the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Director General of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources, the Central Environmental Authority, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, the Chinese Harbour Engineering Company and the Attorney General as respondents.
The CEJ said a sea area of 575 acres opposite the Galle Face Green was being reclaimed by the Chinese Harbour Engineering Company for the Port City Project.
It said the Director General of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource had issued a no-objection letter to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in relation to the so called Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report in September 2014 while the second respondent has issued the final approval for the so-called EIA study pertaining to the project and they have approved the so-called Environmental Management plan submitted by the Chinese Company.
The CEJ said according to the so-called EIA study, the primary objective was only to reclaim 300 acres and the EIA study had been prepared based on that assumption, but the Chinese Harbour Engineering Company had planned to reclaim a sea area of 575 acres which was almost double the area taken in to consideration for the EIA study which was approved by the first and second respondents.
Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Sugath Atapattu appeared for the petitioner.

Chile officials FIFA ban trimmed by CAS
Lausanne, Friday: FIFAs former World Cup evaluation chief Harold Mayne-Nicholls is free to return to football after his three-year ban was reduced to two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday.
The Chilean was suspended from all football-related activities in July 2015 after being found guilty by FIFAs ethics committee of asking for personal favours.
Mayne-Nicholls, a former Chilean football federation president, was in charge of evaluating the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. He wrote the report that gave Qatar the worst ranking of the candidates for the 2022 World Cup finals which the wealthy Gulf state went on to win.
Mayne-Nicholls notably asked for favours from Qatar for members of his family.
He was originally suspended for seven years but had his ban reduced to three years last April, with Fridays CAS ruling meaning his suspension has now run its course. AFP

Chuck Blazer, key figure in FIFA corruption scandal, dies at 72
Chuck Blazer, a former FIFA official who helped blow open the United States investigation into corruption in soccers governing body, has died, according to his lawyer. He was 72.
Blazer, a large, bearded figure, was involved in US soccer for years. At one point, he was the number two for the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF).
He died at a hospital in New Jersey, according to his lawyer Mary Mulligan.
During his twenty years as CONCACAF General Secretary, Chuck Blazer was instrumental in bringing the federation into the modern age. His misconduct, for which he accepted full responsibility, should not obscure Chucks positive impact on international soccer, Mulligan said in an emailed statement to CNN. He devoted thirty years of his life to soccer at all levels of the game, with his involvement ranging from coaching his childrens youth teams to serving on FIFAs executive committee.
Blazer had been in ill health for some time.
At a court hearing in 2013, Blazer told a judge he had rectal cancer and had undergone 20 weeks of chemotherapy at the time, according to an unsealed transcript of the proceedings. He also said he had diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Bruce Arena, the head coach of the US Mens National Team, offered his condolences to Blazers family, according to the teams Twitter account.
GUILTY PLEA
Reports in 2015 surfaced that Blazer said he didnt even fill out tax forms, yet alone pay them.
Blazer amassed $11 million in unreported income according to Richard Weber, the director of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division at the time, and eventually pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering and income tax evasion in 2013. He forfeited nearly $2 million at the time and the US Justice Department said he agreed to pay an undisclosed second amount at the time of sentencing.
FIFAs ethics committee then handed him a lifetime ban.
According to court documents, Blazers sentencing was scheduled for April of this year, but Mulligan had requested a six-month adjournment.
Blazers case and the entire investigation sparked renewed scrutiny into corruption at soccers highest levels. The former head of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, was handed his own ban in 2015.

Defoe bids tearful farewell to best mate Bradley
London, Friday: The funeral of Bradley Lowery, one of the iconic faces of last season's Premier League season as the devoted Sunderland fan battled a rare form of cancer, drew thousands of mourners onto the streets on Friday.
Lowery died last Friday aged just six of neuroblastoma, and his parents wore football shirts to the service to honour his love of the sport.
England striker Jermain Defoe, who formed a special attachment with Lowery during his time at Sunderland, flew back from his new club Bournemouth's training camp in Spain to attend the funeral of his "best mate".
The 34-year-old striker dressed in an England shirt broke down in tears following the funeral.
Bradley's mother Gemma paid a moving final tribute to him at the service saying he had "a smile so big and beautiful it could brighten any room" and described him as a "real brave superhero".
"For now, my baby, we'll say goodbye, we'll meet again our superhero high up in the sky".
Balloons and tributes adorned the roads leading to the church where the service took place, in the village of Blackhall Colliery in the north-east of England.
A bag-piper preceded a horse-drawn carriage bearing Bradley's coffin as it wound its way down streets lined with mourners largely wearing football shirts -- honouring a request from his family -- with the attendance so huge they were lined three deep according to the BBC. Following the carriage were Gemma and father Carl -- also dressed in football shirts -- whilst Defoe was just behind them and people dressed up as Batman, Spider-Man and Captain America accompanied the procession.
Some Sunderland players and members of staff also were part of the procession which passed by his former school where teachers and pupils lined up with many in tears.
The service -- which the family had said was 'open to everyone' and was broadcast on speakers for those who couldn't access the church -- was followed by a private ceremony at a crematorium.
Hundreds of tributes were also on view outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light.
Football players and clubs from across the world also posted tributes online to the youngster.
- 'We'll never forget your courage' -
Spanish club Villareal posted: "Forever Bradley Lowery. We'll never forget your courage. Rest in peace dear fighter."
A vigil and minute's applause took place in Newcastle city centre at the same time as the funeral, while balloons were released at noon (1100GMT) at Sunderland's ground.
Lowery was first diagnosed with the cancer when he was just 18 months old and his courageous battle was exposed to a wider audience at the beginning of last season.
At the Premier League game between Everton and Sunderland his name was chanted by both sets of fans in the fifth minute -- as he was then five -- and Everton then donated generously to the fund for his proposed treatment in the United States.
The funds raised will now be placed in a foundation in his name, according to Sunderland.
Despite his failing health his spirit and resilience were remarkable and he went on to jointly win the BBC Premier League goal of the month competition in December -- converting a penalty past Chelsea reserve goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at half-time of their game.
He subsequently received 250,000 Christmas cards.
Defoe was a regular visitor to his home and he and Lowery were given the honour of being listed on the race card for the world's most famous steeplechase, the Grand National, in April this year.
The race organisers allocated them number 41 on the card -- 40 are legally allowed to race -- with the youngster listed as the jockey and Defoe as the trainer, and naturally the silks (colours) were the red and white stripes of Sunderland.
Sadly things by that stage had deteriorated further with a new tumour detected at the base of his spine.
By the time his sixth birthday had come round last month Lowery was back in hospital but Defoe celebrated it with him once he was discharged. AFP

Ervine counters Herath threat with pristine century
Zimbabwe comfortably placed on opening day 344-8:
For one moment it looked like Zimbabwe was going to be rolled over again by the subtle left-arm spin of Rangana Herath who was their nemesis in the last series when he grabbed two wickets for 36 runs in a morning spell of nine overs and reduced the visitors to 38-3 on the opening day of the one-off Test played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
However left-hander Craig Ervine stood tall for his country as he carved out only his second century in a dozen Tests to ensure Zimbabwe didnt lose the advantage of winning the toss and batting first on a pitch that was tailor made for it.
Zimbabwes early loss of wickets  they went to lunch at 96-4 was compensated in the afternoon and final sessions of play when Sri Lanka were allowed only four further wickets while 248 runs were added.
Ervine was the cornerstone on which Zimbabwes total was built. He held one end up beautifully playing Herath and the other bowlers so comfortably that it gave his partners some confidence to hang around and build useful partnerships with him.
Theres no doubt that Zimbabwes batting runs deep till their captain who bats at number nine and from 70-4, Zimbabwe recovered to 344 for eight wickets through stands of 84, 41, 65 and an unfinished ninth wicket stand of 62 off 99 balls involving Sikander Raza (36), Peter Moor (19), Malcolm Waller (36) and Donald Tiripano (24 n.o.) with Ervine.
For the left-hander Ervine who hails from a cricketing family (father, uncle and brothers have played cricket) yesterday's knock came at a time when Zimbabwe needed it most. He brought it up off 146 balls with a paddle sweep which he used to good effect during his tenure at the wicket. Overall he has faced 238 balls and hit 13 fours and a six and most importantly it was a pristine knock that the entire team would be proud of especially weathering the heat and humidity for nearly 5 hours. It was a career best knock beating the 146 he scored against New Zealand at Bulawayo in August 2016. Each time Sri Lanka broke through, Zimbabwe was able to stage recoveries through useful partnerships that contribute to their final total.
That seven of the eight Zimbabwe wickets to fall on the opening day was taken by the spinners creates an illusion that the wicket is helping spin, but it is not so. It is still perfect for batting and none of the deliveries bowled by the Lankan spinners spun across or beat the bat. The fact that no catches went to hand tells a story in itself of how the pitch is playing. It has during the day flattened out and become slower allowing the batsmen the liberty to counter any turn if there is with comfort. Old war horse Herath once again bore the brunt of the bowling reeling off 30 of the 90 overs bowled for the day for figures of 4 for 106 that took him past Waqar Younis (373) and Malcolm Marshall (376) in the all-time list.
Zimbabwe capped 22-year-old right-hander Tarisai Musakanda.

Federer steps into Wimbledon land of the giants
London, Friday: Roger Federer stands just two wins away from a record eighth Wimbledon title but faces a perilous trip through the land of the giants if he is to become the tournament's oldest champion.
The 35-year-old Swiss has defied time and logic to reach a 12th semi-final at the All England Club where he will face Tomas Berdych, the 2010 runner-up, on Friday.
If he gets past the Czech for the 19th time in 25 meetings, Federer will face either Sam Querrey or Marin Cilic in Sunday's final. The contrast between the 18-time Grand Slam title winner and the other three contenders could not be more stark. Federer stands 6ft 1in (1.85m) and weighs in at 187lbs (85kg); Berdych is 6ft 5ins (1.95m) and 200 lbs (91kg).
Querrey and Cilic tower over him at 6ft 6ins (1.97m) and 210lbs (95kg) and 196lbs (89kg) respectively.
Federer, bidding to reach an 11th final at Wimbledon, is therefore aware of the physical threats posed by his rivals.
"All three guys are taller and stronger than I am," said Federer.
"I've got to figure out a different way, carve my way through somehow with my slice and my spins, my consistency.
"Being the favourite or not the favourite doesn't matter. These other guys are all big hitters. I feel like they will have their say in the outcome of the matches.
"They've got big serves, big forehands, they are big hitters."
Federer has made the semi-finals without dropping a set and has been broken just three times.
He even managed to match Milos Raonic -- who boasts the second fastest serve of the tournament at a blistering 142mph (228.5km/h) -- with 11 aces in his quarter-final victory.
Federer is the second oldest semi-finalist after Ken Rosewall who finished runner-up in 1974 at the age of 39.
He is also the overwhelming favourite after 'Big Four' rivals Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic suffered injury-hit exits on Wednesday and Rafael Nadal lost in the last 16.
Federer is reaping the rewards of pruning his schedule with Wimbledon just his seventh event of 2017. He skipped the 2016 and 2017 French Opens which were won by Djokovic and Nadal.
After losing to Raonic in the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, he shut down his season to rest a knee injury which had already required surgery earlier in 2016.
He came back in January this year, won the Australian Open for his 18th Slam, added the Indian Wells-Miami Masters double before hibernating again through the clay court season.
Former champion Boris Becker hailed Federer's new approach.
"Federer is playing the best tennis ever at the age of 35 because he has got everything right in the rest of his life too," Becker told the BBC.Berdych, meanwhile, will not be overawed by facing Federer having defeated him in four sets in the 2010 quarter-finals on his way to his only appearance in a Slam final.
Four years younger, 11th-seeded Berdych came to Wimbledon ranked outside the top 10 for the first time since 2009.
He knocked out eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem in five sets in the last 16 before seeing Djokovic retire with a right elbow injury in their quarter-final. Berdych is in the Wimbledon semi-finals for the second successive season after a poor year at the Slams in which he exited the Australian Open in the third round and Roland Garros after two matches.
"Roger is an exceptional tennis player, he's the greatest of them all. It's a great challenge to have the opportunity to play him," said the 31-year-old.
Querrey, meanwhile, has reached a maiden semi-final at the majors at the 42nd time of asking.
The 24th-seeded American, who knocked out 2015 champion Djokovic 12 months ago, proved that was no fluke by downing defending champion Murray in the quarter-finals on Wednesday.
The 29-year-old is also the first American man to reach a Grand Slam semi-final since Andy Roddick reached the Wimbledon final in 2009.
Querrey trails 2014 US Open champion and seventh seed Marin Cilic 4-0 in head-to-head meetings.
Two of those clashes have been at Wimbledon -- in 2009 and 2012.
The encounter five years ago was the second longest match in Wimbledon history at five hours and 31 minutes, something Cilic doesn't want to experience again on Friday.
"Hopefully it's not the longest one ever," he said of a match decided 17-15 in the final set.
However, with Querrey and Cilic having fired 231 aces between them at the tournament, a long afternoon cannot be ruled out.

Government to double agricultural exports
The government plans to double the 30 percent agricultural export by introducing new technology.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said although the price of paddy was high, the income did not increase owing to the low harvest.
The paddy harvest dropped from 4,200 mt per hectare to 3,700 during the previous regime due to the low quality fertilizer given by the previous government, Gamage said during a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium yesterday.
Countries like China and Vietnam obtain a harvest of 7,500 mt of paddy per hectare. Farmers in Sammanthurai reap a harvest of 6,500 mt per hectare while it drops to 4,500 mt in Uhana and 3,500 mt in other areas, Minister Gamage said. This disparity is a result of the practices they use in their cultivation. We are planning to introduce technology and increase the harvest per hectare.
Gamage said the government has also decided grant loans for those who use technology and for new businesses at an interest rate of 6.5 percent. He added that the rest of the interest rate will be borne by the government to increase production for export.
The government will allocate money through the next budget for this purpose, Gamage said. We are compelled to do so.If we dont how could we settle the interest rates of the loans of the Rajapaksa regime.
He said that the government has a plan to double the 30 percent agricultural export by introducing technology. Countries like China and Vietnam get a harvest of 7,500 mt of paddy per hectare.

He also said that the government has a plan to create an opportunity for women to increase their income by maintaining a home garden. He added that with the provision of pepper, cinnamon and minor crops to 2.5 million households, the government has a plan to increase production.

Govt. to buy pepper from farmers within two weeks
The government has decided to buy pepper from farmers within two weeks to maintain a stable price in the local market, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
He said that in ordr to implement the project he would work within this week to get funds allocated from the Treasury following obtaining the Cabinet approval.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium while refuting the allegation by Joint Opposition member Ranjith Soysa that the pepper price has dropped in the local market due to the import of pepper from Vietnam.
The pepper is not imported from Vietnam to Sri Lanka for local consumption, Minister Gamage said.
The reason for the drop in pepper prices in the local market is due to a drop in the world market.This is due to an excess pepper harvest this year,the Minister said.
He said that the annual pepper consumption was met by a harvest of 300,000 tonnes, but this years harvest has topped 450,000 tons.
Minister Gamage said that there is a BOI company that exports processed pepper.
It only had imported 500 tons of pepper for its production, Minister Gamage said.
It had processed 220 tons of pepper and had already exported. I sent my officials today and checked if they had the rest with them. The rest was in their stores. Therefore, it had not been released to the local market. It is pointless to stage protests but to find a solution, the Minister said.
Primary Industries Minister Gamage said that pepper in Sri Lanka is of a high standard. He added that India does not impose a tax on pepper that they import from Sri Lanka but they impose a tax on pepper imported from Vietnam.
We have to find out if Indian traders get Vietnamese pepper imported to India via Sri Lanka with the support of Sri Lanka,the Minister said.
The Minister also pointed out such a practice of exporting Vietnamese pepper via Sri Lanka to India is not healthy for the Sri Lankan pepper export market as substandard pepper would be damaging to the country.

Govt slow to implement UNHRC resolutions - Special Rapporteur
There has to come a point where the international community runs out of patience, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson said yesterday.
He warned that the governments progress in achieving the key goals set out in Resolution 30/1 of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was not only slow but seems to have ground to a virtual halt.
Addressing a media briefing held at the UN Compound in Colombo at the end of his four day visit to the island, Emmerson delivered a tough indictment on the governments role in sticking to its promises made in Geneva, four months into the extension it received from the UNHRC. Emerson during his visit had met Prime Minister, Secretary to the President, Defence Secretary, Foreign Affairs Minister, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister, Prison Reforms Minister, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister.

He also met the Commanders of the Tri-Forces, heads of the Police investigation arms, detainees under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), Minister of Justice, Attorney General, civil society members and the Chair of the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission.
Emerson however noted that he did not doubt the the good faith of the Prime Minister or those whose influences who wish to see the delivery of the objectives.
The Prime Minister, he said had promised that, once the current process of counter-terrorism reform had been completed, the Government will pass legislation paving way for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to be established and set up an Office of the Special Prosecutor to bring criminal charges against those involved in the most serious atrocities committed on both sides of the conflict.
He also noted that Army Commander, Mahesh Senanayake had made a public commitment to ensuring that members of the armed forces who had committed crimes will be brought to justice.
Despite the assurances however, the Special Rapporteur reproached the government for its slow progress in passing legislation, prosecuting cases of human rights violations and dealing with the cases of detainees charged under the PTA.
According official data provided to him by the Attorney Generals Department, out of 81 prisoners currently in the judicial phase of their pre-trial detention, 70 had been in detention without trial for over five years and 12 had been in detention without trial for over 10 years.
He asked that these individuals be released on bail immediately or bring them to trial within weeks or months and not in years and decades.
Emerson also explained that the PTA which allowed for uncorroborated confessions made to police officers as the sole basis for convictions, had fostered the endemic and systematic use of torture within the security apparatus of the country.
In addition, he noted that only 71 police officers had been proceeded against for torturing suspects since available records began.
He added that state torture was still very much the norm in the country as a result of the PTA and that detainees had complained of torture as recently as October of last year.
The Attorney General in the meantime had informed Emerson that in the last two years they have been reviewing the cases of all those in PTA detention and making executive decisions to consent to bail, to divert individuals to rehabilitation programmes or to reduce or drop criminal charges where appropriate but senior members of the department had stated that they were severely understaffed and resource scarce.
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister in turn had observed that steps were underway to avoid any new arrests under the PTA and to use the general criminal law wherever possible.
With regards to the new counter terrorism legislation proposed by the government however, Emerson noted that it too allowed the admission of confessions under police custody at trial and that was a red line which did not cross well with international standards. Furthermore the Government has undertaken to engage in a process of constructive dialogue with my mandate in an effort to improve the draft legislation before it is placed before Parliament. There is still time to get this legislation right and for it to become a new cornerstone of a new order in Sri Lanka, he said.
The progress of the legislation to date however has been painfully slow and has in turn delayed the wider transitional justice package, Sri Lanka promised to deliver. This inertia reflects the certain vested interests in the security sector who are resistant to change and above all to accountability and their representatives in Parliament and government, said Emerson as he stressed that it was up to the people to decide whether they are to tolerate those who seek to obstruct peace and seek to foster unrest which could break into violence.
With 20 more months to go before the extension given by the UNHRC comes up for review once again, Emerson said it was very uncertain whether Sri Lanka in its current status can meet the objectives it has set for itself within the timeframe it has committed itself to.
All should not pull together to support the government for the benefit of all to deliver its objectives, as these commitments were not set by the international community but by Sri Lanka itself for the benefit of peace for all of its people. Those who wish to characterize this as something the UN is imposing on the country is silly and are lacking in information to be able to understand it, said the Special Rapporteur.

Mayweather, McGregor take trash-talk tour to New York
New York, Friday: Floyd Mayweather was on the attack on Thursday, branding Conor McGregor a quitter as the four-stop tour hyping their cross-combat superfight hit New York.
"Eejit" and "Circus Clown" were the tamest epithets the former welterweight king, who retired from boxing with a perfect 49-0 record in 2015, threw at McGregor, one of the biggest stars of mixed martial arts.
"(He) didn't quit once, didn't quit twice, quit three times!" said Mayweather. ""Real fighters never give up."
McGregor, a two-division champion in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has conceded three defeats in 24 bouts, all by submission.
The two men are set to face each other in a boxing ring in Las Vegas on August 26 in what could be the richest fight in history.
Thursday's show at the Barclays Center, home of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets, drew a pro-McGregor crowd of more than 13,000.
It was the third such production in three days, with one more scheduled for London on Friday aimed at pumping up interest in the bout -- although both men seemed to be running short of inventive invective even if the animosity between them is actually growing.
McGregor eschewed his sharp-tailored suits for a bare chest and white fur overcoat -- which he swept from his shoulders as he took the stage to offer a flexed-arm pose that inflamed the crowd.
The Irishman then paced impatiently as Mayweather, draped in an Irish flag, made his way to the stage and they took their positions for the ritual staredown from opposite sides of the podium.
A giant step forward from each had them nose to nose and brought more cheers from the crowd before McGregor launched into a lewd, crude address.
"No one's going to stop me walking around this place like I own it," he said.
Mayweather, meanwhile, was all indifference until it was his turn to launch into his profanity-laced response.
After a little back-and-forth with the crowd, he showered McGregor with handfuls of dollar bills from his backpack -- a day after McGregor mocked the paltry stash of cash "Money" had brought to their promotional stop in Toronto on Wednesday.
"They're all ones!" McGregor said.
"Because that's all you're worth," Mayweather replied.
Mayweather, one of the most accomplished defensive fighters in history, admits there's a level of uncertainty in the entire undertaking.
"Nobody knows that squared circle like me," Mayweather told reporters. "I know angles. I know where to touch you at. I know what you don't like. I don't have to watch your tapes. That's something I'm blessed with.
"But, he's unorthodox," Mayweather added. "So it'll definitely be something different in the ring. I just have to keep my composure."
But McGregor says he's relishing his underdog role -- and will adapt just fine to the boxing ring.
"I have a very high fight IQ," he said. "I understand when to go and when not to. I'm very confident whether it's in a ring or an octagon ... I'm going to have my way with him."
In the meantime, McGregor said, the whirlwind promotional tour wasn't wearing thin for him.
"I'm not tired of this," said. "It's really a lot of fun. We'll keep it professional for now.
"Floyd is saying a lot about me tapping out, but he's never had a true fight," McGregor added. "He knows nothing about the game that I'm involved with. We'll see who is quitting on August 26." AFP

Modi was ill-advised to visit Israel Worse, to make it a Love Fest
While the prime ministers visit to Israel is not objectionable, what is shocking is that it took place as if Palestine is a myth and that the only reality of the Holy Land is Israel, Israel and more Israel
Ever since the Palestine question was brought before the United Nations by the British in 1947, India has shown a balance, a sense of perspective and of history in its response to Israel. It has wanted to be and has been singularly fair to the two principal communities involved: the worlds war-ravaged Jews who settled in the new country with British help, and the doughty Arabs whose lands were alienated. Indias position has been appreciated, respected by all for its honesty and integrity.
When Israel was formed, under international aegis, India recognised the new state. When Israel attacked and occupied more land in Palestine, turning hundreds of thousands of Arabs into refugees, India said that was wholly wrong, outrageous. And since the occupation continued, with Israel becoming more and more bellicose, India held back diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv and upwardly calibrated its ties with Palestinian leaders, notably Yasser Arafat. No Indian Prime Minister, from Jawaharlal Nehru who first recognised Israel, to Narasimha Rao who initiated diplomatic ties, to A.B. Vajpayee who received a visit from the then Israeli Prime Minister, right up to Manmohan Singh, ever visited Israel. It was important to make the statement, to Israel, to the Arab world, to the world at large that so long as Israel was expansionist, and sought to dominate or conquer even the rest of Palestine, violating numerous resolutions of the UN, Israel was an offender. Justice to the worlds Jews is one thing, Zionism quite another.
Arab counter-violence
India did not exculpate Arab counter-violence either. It knew that justice for the Arabs is one thing, Hamass violent acts of terror quite another.
But at the core, India saw that the problem was the ground reality of Israels holding on to Arabs greatly prized lands, which Israel had seized by force, in the face of international objections and UN resolutions in the passing of which India was always vocal, even vociferous. Until that ground reality of occupation remained unchanged, Indias fair and just and humane policy needed no change.
And now, it has changed.
I believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi was ill-advised to make his just-concluded trip. Worse, to make it a love fest.
Before going into the implications of the visit, a review of the history of that problem is essential.
As long as one hundred years ago, on August 23, 1917, the House of Commons discussed the subject of Palestine for the Jews in what has become famous as the Balfour Declaration, so named after the then British Foreign Secretary, Arthur James Balfour. As the only Jew in the British Cabinet at the time, Edward Samuel Montagu, who was later to be a Secretary of State for India, could have been expected to support the idea of Palestine for the Jews. But Montagu being a fair minded man, he did the opposite.
He passionately opposed the motion and submitted a memorandum to the cabinet in which he said: Zionism has always seemed to me to be a mischievous political creed, untenable by any patriotic citizen I assert that there is not a Jewish nation When the Jews are told that Palestine is their national home, every country will immediately desire to get rid of its Jewish citizens, and you will find a population in Palestine driving out its present inhabitants, taking all the best in the countryIt is quite true that Palestine plays a large part in Jewish history, but so it does in modern Mohammedan history I would say that the Government will be prepared to do everything in their power to obtain for Jews in Palestine complete liberty of settlement and life on an equality with the inhabitants of that country who profess other religious beliefs. I would ask that the Government should go no further.
Montagu was heeded by Balfour in part, but not in the main. The declaration of November 2, 1917, stated His Majestys government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.
A separate state of Palestine thus got mandated, mandated by Britain.
Indias long history of balanced engagement
In 1937, Nehru wrote to Krishna Menon about the Indian National Congress stand: Our position is that Palestine must be essentially an Arab country and independent. Further, that the Arabs and Jews must meet together and compose their differences on the basis of Palestinian independence.
In November 1938, as World War II was looming, Gandhi wrote in Harijan on the revived bid for a Jewish homeland in Palestine: The Palestine of the Biblical conception is not a geographical tract. It is in their hearts. But if they must look to the Palestine of geography as their national home, it is wrong to enter it under the shadow of the British gunThey can settle in Palestine only by the goodwill of the Arabs. And then, unforgettably, in the same journal on November 26, 1938: Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct. The mandates have no sanction but that of the last war. Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home.
Crime against humanity is no ordinary chastisement. And it was, essentially, a chastisement of the British, who were violating their promises to the Arabs and even the qualifications under the Balfour Declaration for the rights of the non-Jewish people of Palestine.

Mothers ultimate sacrifice for peace
I lost two sons who joined the army to bring peace to this country within a month 11 years ago, 60-year-old Pattiyagamage Malini pointing to the photographs of the two soldier sons she lost during the war, said.
Being inspired after listening to Radhika Hettiarachchi speaking about her project her stories a first-hand study of the plight of mothers from the north and south and their strength in the face of adversity, their hopes for their childrens and Sri Lankas future, I visited P G Malini of Lolangara, Ratmale in the Dikwella Divisional Secretariat area of the Matara District.
The road leading to Malinis house is called Ranaviriu Abesiriwardena Mawatha in memory of Malinis two sons, Sargent Ranjith Rasanka Abeysiriwardena and Lance Corporal Nuwan Budhdhika Abeysiriwardena of the Sri Lanka Army, who sacrificed their lives within a space of a month in Muhamalei and Mavilaru to bring peace to the nation.
I was born in 1957 and married young. I am a mother of 10 children, five boys and five girls. Ranjith Rasanka (Raja) and Nuwan Buddika were the eldest among boys. It was Nuwan that I lost first. He was only 21 years old. Nuwan was born on February 19, 1985.
"He wanted to join the army like his elder brother and enlisted inh the 8th Gemunu Regiment on May 25, 2004 just after his 16th birthday," Malani recalled.
"I was devastated when I got the news that Nuwan was injured at Mavilaru on August 10, 2006 and died. His body was laid to rest on August 13 and his alms giving was held on August 17, 2006. Then I looked forward to the day of my eldest son completing his term of service. My hopes were shattered when I was informed of his death a few days later (September 9, 2006), she mourned.
"Ranjith or Raja as we used to call him was my eldest. He was born on October 4, 1975 and he enlisted in the 1st Wijayaba Regiment on March 16, 1994 at the age of 19. He served in the north until he died at the age of 30 in a terrorist attack at Muhamalai on September 9, 2006, she said.
Ranjith was building a house next to ours and was looking forward to getting married and settling down. I have some solace as I have many children but many mothers lost their only child in the mission to bring peace to the nation. It was with great difficulty and hardship that my husband Sumathipala Abeysiriwardena, who was employed with the Irrigation Department, and I
raised our children. We had to protect them during the 1988/89 uprising in the south.
I did not oppose when they asked me to join the army as it was to protect our nation. I have another son in the army at the moment, she said.
"I pray every day that there never be another war in our country," she said.

Renovation work on the Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line, which has been suspended for many years due to war, will recommence soon, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said. Minister de Silva made this observation during an observation tour of the Polonnaruwa Railway Station recently. The minister said the renovation project will be completed within two years. 
He said over 12,000 sleepers are required for the renovation of the 90 kilometre railway line between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa. Around 10,000 sleepers have been brought to the site. Trains run on the line at about 60km per hour due to many bridges and over 60 culverts. But, trains will travel at a speed over 100 km per hour after renovation, he said.
Encroachment by people on lands belonging to the Railway Department is a main reason for the delay of renovation. Steps will be taken to remove unauthorised occupants according to circulars approved by the Cabinet, the minister said.

North Central Province (NCP) Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara has launched a project to develop and preserve Kebithigollewa springs taking into account the value of them in providing clean drinking water for the area.
The programme was initiated recently by commissioning the development of the Gonameriyawa spring. A protective fence, storing tanks and a solar powered illumination system were installed under the programme.
The Kebithigollewa springs provide water to the people in the area, while tanks and wells dry up during even a short drought. Sinhaya, Udangawa, Dambagaha, Ambagahawewa, Dunuke and Kalawedi springs are some of them that continue to provide water for the people during droughts.
The water quality tests show that water of these fountains is 100 percent clean.
Kebithigollewa divisional secretary Chandana Anurudda Piyadasa said he has submitted a report on the importance of Kebithigollewa springs to the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the North Central Provincial Council for necessary action.

The public should not panic over the enactment of a new Constitution since the government or an individual cannot enact it alone, City Planning and Water Management Minister Rauf Hakeem said.
He made this observation responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the various disputes that arose among the Opposition Members of Parliament and the Buddhist clergy.
Minister Hakeem said most people have a fear of the enactment of a new Constitution. But the members of the Government will never support to bring a Constitution that would badly affect the country or its citizens.
The minister said Buddhism's foremost place won't be changed in the new Constitution. Parliament has the final authority to pass the Constitution. The President or the Prime Minister cannot do it alone, he said.
"We extend our support for a Constitution which the whole country can accept," he said.

Ranatunga seeks probe into 2011 World Cup defeat
Colombo, Friday: Former Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga on Friday demanded an investigation into the country's 2011 World Cup final defeat by India amid allegations of match fixing.
Ranatunga, 53, in a video posted on his Facebook page, said he was shocked by Sri Lanka's six-wicket defeat in the final at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai.
"I was also in India giving commentaries at the time. When we lost, I was distressed and I had a doubt," Ranatunga said. "We must investigate what happened to Sri Lanka at the 2011 World Cup final."
"I cannot reveal everything now, but one day I will. There must be an inquiry."
Without giving names, Ranatunga said players could not hide the "dirt" with their clean white cricket clothing.
Sri Lanka, batting first, scored 274-6 off 50 overs and appeared in a commanding position when Indian superstar Sachin Tendulkar was caught for 18. India turned the game dramatically thanks partly to poor fielding and bowling by Sri Lanka.
Local media have raised suspicions of Sri Lankans throwing the match, but there was no formal call for an investigation till Ranatunga's outburst.
Ranatunga's spokesman Thamira Manju told AFP that he was writing to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe complaining about the state of cricket in the country.
There have been recriminations in the country since Sri Lanka suffered a humiliating 3-2 loss to bottom-ranked Zimbabwe in a five-match one-day series on home soil this month.
There is also growing tension between Sri Lankan sports authorities and players about the use of managers, including an agent who represents more than half the national team.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera has said he wants to regulate agents in cricket in a bid to prevent the possibility of one individual fixing matches using a network of players under his management.
Former Skipper Kumar Sangakkara, who led Sri Lanka in the 2011 World Cup defeat, has publicly defended his manager, a foreign national, who is also an agent for many other local players.
Last year, the International Cricket Council imposed a three-year ban on a top Sri Lankan official Jayananda Warnaweera for failing to cooperate with an anti-corruption investigation.
Warnaweera, a former Test player who was facing a two-year domestic ban over allegations of involvement in match-fixing, failed to attend interviews with an ICC anti-corruption unit.
Sri Lankan players and umpires have been accused of match fixing in the past, but Warnaweera was the high ranking official to be found guilty and penalised.
Sri Lanka's cricket board suspended a fast bowling coach and sacked a part-time employee for their alleged roles in approach to two Sri Lankan players to arrange a defeat by West Indies at Galle in October 2015.
An unnamed man linked to a bookmaker had offered the two players some 10 million rupees (around $70,000) to lose the match.
Betting is illegal in most of the cricket-mad Indian subcontinent, but backstreet bookmakers -- many with underworld links -- still flourish.
Although no big-name Sri Lankan player has ever been convicted of corruption, several former stars have made allegations of match fixing or spot-fixing -- when players deliberately bowl or field badly to give away a set number of runs. AFP

Rising Star Vinod victorious in Pin Fernando Trophy final
Shirani prevails to win Pam Fernando Trophy 2017:
The Pin & Pam Fernando Trophy 2017 Finals worked off at the Ridgeways, Royal Colombo Golf Club Course on Friday, saw two enthralling matches followed by some eager Golfers.
Vinod Weerasinghe, a rising star of Sri Lanka Golf, joined a select band of Pin Fernando Trophy winners, displaying a solid match temperament, but above all, good steady Golf. Vinod, playing off a 4 Handicap, had to give 10 strokes to Tyronne Weerackody in the Final, but Vinod withstood the early pressure of giving a stroke per hole in the first 5 holes. Tyronne managed to win the 1st hole, lost the 4th even with a stroke and was All square after 5. Then Vinod got in to top gear with no strokes given for the next five holes and quickly built up a 4 up lead after 10. Vinod lost the 11th to a stroke but immediately stretched the lead to be dormie 5 up playing the 14th. Tyrone pulled back one by winning the 14th but Vinod halved the 15th to seal the Match and lift the Pin Fernando Trophy 2017, 4 & 3.

Sangakkara six smashes spectator's mobile phone
LONDON, Thursday: Steven Finn was an unlikely batting hero for Middlesex, hitting the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket win over Surrey at Lord's in the T20 Blast.
In front of more than 27,000 fans, Middlesex needed 26 runs to win with 30 balls left and seven wickets in hand.
But veteran Surrey off-spinner Gareth Batty (4-14) sparked a collapse before last man Finn's cameo won the match.
Also in the South Group, Essex beat Somerset by 22 runs and Gloucestershire defeated Kent by six wickets.
Middlesex opened their T20 Blast campaign with a tied match against Gloucestershire on 7 July and their first home outing in this season's competition offered just as much drama.
Batting first, Surrey appeared on course for a sizeable total when Kumar Sangakkara and Ben Foakes were scoring freely just after the powerplay.
Sangakkara's 70 off 42 balls was full of craft and invention - a scooped hook off a Finn short ball brought him four runs, while a lofted drive sailed over cover for six and unfortunately smashed the screen of a spectator's mobile phone.
The Sri Lankan left-hander lost partners frequently and Surrey's total of 158-9 off 20 overs looked slightly under par, albeit on a pitch that was difficult for batsmen to score against the spinners.
That was exemplified by Surrey captain Batty, who dragged his side back into the contest at a time when Middlesex looked to be cruising towards victory.
Batty accounted for the dangerous Brendon McCullum, as well as England pair Dawid Malan and Eoin Morgan, during his spell as he posted the best bowling figures in the tournament so far.
Middlesex lost six wickets for 20 runs to leave them six runs short of victory when Finn strode to the crease, and he survived a huge lbw shout from Ravi Rampaul before hitting a full toss through mid-wicket for four to settle an enthralling contest.
Finn, who has scored a Test half-century for England and is nicknamed "The Watford Wall" because of his robust defensive batting technique, took his career total of T20 runs from 45 to 49 in helping Middlesex to victory.

Sri Lanka- Bangladesh leaders meet: Boost for economic and trade relations, New agreements signed
President Maithripala Sirisena and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina pledged to carry forward the long-standing bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on a solid foundation.
Both leaders emphasised this when President Sirisena met with the Bangladeshi Prime Minister in Dhaka yesterday for bilateral discussions.
The President and the Bangladeshi Prime Minister drew special attention regarding entering into a trade agreement between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and the setting up of special economic zones.
During the meeting, it was discussed in detail regarding introducing a new programme to exchange experiences in the agricultural and fisheries sectors of both the countries as well as to jointly take action to combat terrorism and to cooperate in the field of information technology.
Attention was also drawn to seek technical knowhow from Bangladesh to increase rice production in Sri Lanka.
The Bangladeshi Prime Minister expressed her happiness over the visit of Sri Lankan President to Bangladesh and commended the freedom and democracy ensured in Sri Lankan society under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Bangladeshi Prime Minister further emphasised that bilateral ties between the countries must be carried forward in a firm manner and Bangladesh is willing to work helpfully with Sri Lanka in the field of economy as well as to foster regional cooperation.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also pointed out the importance of the two countries working together to find solutions to the common issues affecting the two countries, like drug trafficking and illegal immigrants.
President Sirisena who mentioned about investment opportunities in Sri Lanka, stated that the government is ready to provide every required facility for Bangladeshi investors.
He invited the Prime Minister of Bangladesh for a state visit to Sri Lanka. The Bangladeshi Premier, who accepted the invitation, said her visit will help strengthen the strong bonds between the two countries.
The agreements and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were signed in the presence the two leaders. - PRESIDENTS MEDIA DIVISION

Sri Lanka-Bangladesh ties
President Maithripala Sirisenas current State visit to Bangladesh is significant in several ways. It will mark a new zenith in bilateral relations between the two nations, both of which are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
Sri Lanka has had fruitful relations with Bangladesh since its creation in 1971. Successive Governments in both countries have continued and enhanced this relationship and the Presidents current visit is a testimony to the strength of that friendship. In fact, President Sirisena began his tour with a visit to the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi where he paid a glowing tribute to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (founder and first President), saying Sri Lanka is a proud partner of the Bangladesh he envisioned. I am pleased to see that Bangabandhus vision for this nation is being realised by his daughter Sheikh Hasina, the President wrote in the visitors book.
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are a clear example of South-South cooperation which is essential for the developing world. As South Asian countries reach Middle Income status, foreign aid per se will dwindle. This is a blessing in disguise for developing countries who should give preference to trade and cooperation among themselves instead of looking to the traditionally rich countries for conventional OECD assistance.
In this context, the 14 instruments signed between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka during the Presidents visit can be described as a fillip to South-South and intra-SAARC cooperation. The agreements relate to cooperation in coastal shipping; agriculture; education; investment; information and communication technology; and cooperation between the two Central Banks, Foreign Service institutes, think-tanks  Bangladesh Institute of International Strategic Studies and Sri Lankas Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies. There will be agreements relating to radio, TV and films as well. Agreements for cooperation between two standards testing institutions, news agencies, Chittagong BGMEA Fashion Institute and Sri Lanka Textile and Apparel Institute, are also envisaged.
Some of the agreements will see fruition very soon - Bangladesh shippers have already welcomed the decision by their Government and Sri Lanka to launch a joint venture container feeder service between the two countries. The service by state-owned Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) and Sri Lankas national ocean carrier Ceylon Shipping Corp. (CSC) will increase competition and routing options.
Sri Lanka already has Free Trade Agreements with several SAARC countries, but not Bangladesh. This anomaly will be rectified soon. Confirming the matter, Bangladesh Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque said they have also agreed to sign Free Trade Agreement (FTA) within this year to boost trade cooperation.
Bangladesh exports to Sri Lanka sharply increased in the just concluded fiscal year as the figure totalled US$ 42.24 million registering a 38.76% growth over the previous year. In 2015-16, the exports amounted was US$ 30.44 million. Pharmaceutical products constituted the largest part of the exports with $13.87 million. As of 2015-16, bilateral trade between the two countries stood at US$ 75.62 million and the trade is in favour of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka exported products worth US$ 45 million to Bangladesh during the same period.
There is a huge potential for expanding trade once the FTA comes into operation. In fact, the paucity of intra-SAARC trade reflects a lack of will on the part of SAARC authorities to developing trade and investment within the region. The concept of a South Asian Free Trade Arrangement (SAFTA) has been there for some time, without any real progress being made. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka should take the lead in reinvigorating intra-region trade, even though the two countries compete for trade with the outside world in categories such as garments.
People-to-people contact is also another factor that contributes to a positive relationship. SriLankan Airlines already flies to Dhaka, but Biman Bangladesh should also begin flights to Colombo. The eventual easing of visa regulations on both sides will also facilitate travel between the two countries. Sri Lanka could also attract more Buddhist pilgrims from Bangladesh, which has around 600,000 Buddhists.
Sri Lankans have also watched with avid interest and joy the relentless rise of Bangladesh in world cricket. Coincidentally, one of the finest Sri Lankan cricketers is behind the roaring success of the Bangladeshi Tigers  Chandika Hathurusinghe has moulded the Tigers from a team that was languishing in the cricketing wilderness to perform fiercely and take the Number 7 slot in ICC ODI rankings, ahead of Sri Lanka (Number 8). Cricket is a passion that unites Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis and both countries should strive to play more matches with each other.
Sport is just one more way in which the two countries have come together. Bengali and Sinhala are linguistically similar and the people share a culture inspired by Asian values. The President's visit is a golden opportunity to reaffirm these timeless bonds.

Still waiting for new constitution
Wide spread discussion has started on the coming constitution though no proposal has been given to the constituent assembly so far. Excellent! All other problems should recede and allow time for this fundamental discussion. We can start from accepting that Lanka is the home of several nationalities and smaller communities. Scientists say that all three nationalities Sinhala, Tamil and Muslims are ethnically identical, while Vedda and other smaller communities are slightly different. So we can stop talking about ethnicity and confine the discussion to nationalities and national unification.
We all believe we have a right to this island. In such a situation solution should come on the basis of equality, autonomy and the right of self determination. If we cannot agree, and become Lankans all, sadly country will break up with UN intervention as it happened in Serbia. Or we live in continue rivalry and terror until foreign intervention.
Asgiri Mahanayaka Thera has demanded executive presidency should be included in addition to foremost position to Buddhism. Latter is already in the present constitution and apparently no body has demanded to remove it. Similarly unitary nature is there while devolution has given power to periphery. So, discussion can go on. But I have the right to continue my struggle for a better constitution based on the three principles I believe in. Already I was attacked by people who are against a new constitution and Lakshan Dias helped me to take the matter to courts. Then comes the threat to Lakshan and we had to fight to protect him. So the struggle for democracy is many sided.
Democratic Tamil leaders
Then we hear that Lankan police shot dead a Tamil man in Jaffna. Though suspected of been involved in illegal sand mining, what is known for certain is that Yogarasa Thines was completely unarmed. The police decision to gun him down is already accepted as disproportionate, but sadly appears as a part of Lankan state violence against Tamil civilians, amidst a culture of impunity. The frustration at the killing of yet another Tamil boiled over, some locals burnt tyres, blocked roads and damaged a police post in demonstrations. How can this happen in this time of intense debate and action for reconciliation Is it a sabotage action In any case firm action necessary to give confidence to the democratic Tamil leaders.
Whilst the South too has suffered from the excesses of Lankas militarization, there is an inescapable difference. The sheer extent of the violence, with tens of thousands of Tamils killed or unaccounted for, alongside an interest to seek accountability for those crimes, reveals a disparity in both scale and context. All whilst the very same Sinhala soldiers that Tamils have witnessed commit acts of violence, continue to occupy their homeland in massive numbers.
The lack of sorrow from the Sinhala press, Southern civil society and the general public towards Tamil deaths  including the killing of Thines, shows inequality that prevails in the Lankan society. It has now been well over two years since this government came in to power. Despite repeated reassurances to the international community of a profound transformation towards good governance, a lack of tangible action in this case will only add further evidence that impunity still reigns.
Constitutional proposals
President Maithripala Sirisenas visit to meet with the Mahanayake of the Buddhist Sangha in Kandy, to discuss constitutional proposals was somewhat premature, because both the President and the PM denied that parties in the government have agreed on a framework for the constitution. This was really the accusation of the opposition and it may be the pivotal move in the anti-constitutional sabotage process.
A week earlier a section of Sangha had publicly announced in a joint statement that there was no need to bring in new Constitution and that a new Constitution will create more conflicts in the country. Though the Buddhist clergy is very influential with the 70 percent who are Sinhalese Buddhist, especially on issues pertaining to identity, the division within the Sangha is very clear and educated and knowledgeable Theras have already come out strongly to support the governments constitutional reform process.
Whether it is in tackling the issues connected with providing a facilitative environment for economic development, taking action against corruption or dealing with fascistic war criminals, the government has been faltering. So far Yahapalanaya was unable to deliver on what it has promised. This has enabled the opposition to shout and scream and dominate the political debate.
At the last presidential and general elections held in 2015 all parties of the yahapalana promised some form of democratic change including a constitutional reform. At those elections Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP were consistent and specific about the constitutional reform that they proposed. They specified a new constitution without the executive presidential system. On other hand the devolution of power and the electoral system would be more democratic.
In this background with the change of government in 2015 democratic masses expected that the new government would take swift action to both draft and implement the new constitution. It was able to pass a resolution in parliament that converted parliament into a constitutional assembly. A 20 member steering committee on constitutional reform was formed and which was headed by the Prime Minister. The government also embarked upon a hitherto unprecedented process of public consultations in order to obtain the views of the people on the proposed reforms of the constitution.
The committee then came out with a balanced and fair report that gave the main themes or headlines of public opinion on constitutional reform along with the different recommendations from democratic social organisations. However, the Yahapalanaya failed to launch a major educational and counter racist fascist campaign on behalf of the new constitution.
Parliamentary sub committees
Technical committee reports were drafted by experts; but with participation of the parliamentarians in the six parliamentary sub committees. But most of parliamentary members of those sub committees have not participated. Many of them publicly complained that the process was outside their control and they did not know what was being drafted and how they were being drafted. As a result opposition was enabled to take the lead in going to the people and engaging in scaremongering without being challenged by government members. However once the opinions are taken from the public, drafting should be given to the experts. Then again the civil society and others including parliamentarians should finalized the draft proposal. Instead of shouting outside opposition should participate in the finalizing process.
The Presidents meeting with the Mahanayake revealed that the absence of ownership of the constitution making process extends beyond the parliamentarians who have failed to champion the constitution reform process. It includes many religious and other leaders in civil society. In their meeting with the President the Maha Nayaka Thera had complained that the constitution being drafted by the government was in collaboration with NGOs while it excluded them. Clearly this is a product of opposition campaign. However, most NGOs and civil society groups also complain that they feel excluded from the constitution making process. On the other hand the JVP, although in the opposition, has been taking a non racist approach to constitutional reform. It is clear that the Buddhist prelates were influenced by facts and figures presented by racist Mahinda group.
The opposition has been claiming that the government intends to divide the country in accordance with the wishes of the Tamil Diaspora and the Western powers. Recently both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe with the blessings of Tamil leaders and the approval of Christian Muslim priests have been giving public assurances that the constitutional reforms will not lead to the removal of Buddhism from its foremost place in the constitution and that the unitary state would remain intact. However it is understood that devolution of power will be completed as promised.
Foremost place for Buddhism
During a nearly two-hour long discussion held between him and the Mahanayake Theras, in which a company of 22 Bhikkus were present with the Mahanayake, President Sirisena had reassured them that the draft constitution would be shown to them prior to its presentation to parliament and their views would be incorporated. He pledged that the government will not bring any constitutional reforms that will undo the countrys unitary state or the foremost place for Buddhism that is provided in the constitution.
The President also informed the Mahanayake that there has been no new constitution drafted yet and that if there will be a draft constitution it will be presented to the Mahanayake and the leaders of the clergy of other religions for review before it will go to parliament. It is assumed that the role of President Sirisena is in coping with the Buddhist religious opposition to the constitutional reform process. That is an indication of his importance to the government. In general the constitutional reform process is being driven by the UNP component of the government; that is headed by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who has announced his resolve to go ahead with a new constitution. Liberals believe that the Prime Minister has the wide learning and cosmopolitan outlook to appreciate the constitutional mechanisms and compromises needed to govern a multi-national, multi-religious and plural society. May be, but the time is running fast!

Strategies to fight a misleading Opposition
The near gridlock in the Constitutional dilemma that has emerged shows little signs of being easily resolved. The issue of a change in the Constitution has clearly gone beyond an intelligent debate on matters of constitution making or the content of a new constitution. Instead, it is befuddled at what is clearly a cheap political argument, that leaves very little room for matters of public interest that are of importance to constitution making, to have any influence on the dispute.
President Sirisena has told the Mahanayakes and other prelates of the three Nikayas, who he met in Kandy last week, there was no reason whatever to have any fears about the status of Buddhism in the new Constitution, and assured them that the draft of the new Constitution would be presented to them for consideration and advise. The Prime Minister gave a similar assurance in his recent speech at Anuradhapura, and even suggested having new constitutional provisions to ensure the State does not interfere in the functioning of the Nikayas. But these are of little interest to those engaged in the political campaign that is using constitution making as the thrust in a yellow robed debate, with little interest in facts.
The issue that has to be taken up in earnest is how any section of the Sangha could give any ultimatum or issue warnings about a new Constitution that is not even in its draft stage so far. There is a clear show of a political campaign that has very little, if any, to do with the protection of Buddhism and its status in this country. Article 9 of the present Constitution makes this very clear. It states: The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).
The inclusion of this clause in a new constitution has been accepted and endorsed by the leaders of all other religions in the country. This may not be the position of those who believe that what is needed in Sri Lanka is a secular constitution; and they do have a right to think so and state so. But, this is not the subject of debate today. Article 9 is accepted by all other religious leaders, and will be in the new Constitution, as it has been in the Constitution since 1972  when the first Republican Constitution was adopted. Clause 9 was not a JR Jayewardene introduction in the 1978 Constitution, which brought in the Executive Presidency. The call for the removal of the Executive Presidency is certainly what the majority of the people of Sri Lanka voted for and gave a mandate to both in the Presidential poll on January 8 and General Election in August 2015.
New alignments
What is most surprising today is that many who are now against the need for a new Constitution, not only the related sections of the Sangha, are of the view that there no need to remove the Executive Presidency. This is stated by those who are associated with the government, such as the Jathika Hela Urumaya, too, and is currently a strong position of the Sinhala nationalists who also oppose any efforts to bring a new Constitution. The thinking of these forces is that the Executive Presidency has been trimmed down sufficiently, by President Sirisena, with the adoption of the 19th Amendment, and there is no practical purpose in having it abolished. They are carrying on with a political chant that there is no mandate from the people for a change in the Constitution, or the abolition of the Executive Presidency. They conveniently use the pledges made by Maithripala Sirisena on the constitutional changes that would be introduced in the first 100 days after January 8, 2015, as being proof that there was no offer by the Common Candidate to abolish the Executive Presidency or bring in a new Constitution. What they have forgotten or ignore is what Maithripala Sirisena said in his manifesto for the Presidential Poll in January 2015 - Maithri Palanayak  Sthavara Ratak - which states in Chapter1 - We have been unable to constitutionally change the Executive Presidential system that has prevailed since 1978, which our party continuously promised the people and the country do since 1994. Our failure to realize this goal through 20 years is a major defeat we have faced. This cannot be delayed any more.
He also states in the manifesto that: What I have taken as the background to change the Executive Presidential system, is the agreement with the Reasonable Society Movement (Saadarana Samajayak Sandaha Vu Vyparaya) led by Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, for the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
It is the campaign on this key issue, coupled with the related need to fight and eliminate corruption that gave the mandate to the Common Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena with the Swan symbol, in the polls in January 2015. This mandate was repeated in the General Election of August that year, too. So, it is a complete distortion of political reality to state there was no mandate for the abolition of the Executive Presidency or to bring in a new Constitution. These are the core issues that saw the election of the Common Candidate as President in January 2015, and brought in the coalition of National Unity after the general election of August 2015. The claim that there is no mandate or any public call for these changes is therefore wholly wrong, and completely against the political trends in the country, whether stated by any section of the Sangha or by any ethno-religious extremists or nationalists; and needs the strongest opposition by both the government and the forces of civil society that brought this government to power.
Disappearances
The other issue being canvassed by the Joint Opposition and the Sangha is the new law against enforced disappearances. The Government made a gesture of goodwill to the Sangha by not proceeding with the related Bill that was tabled in Parliament. But, such a gesture will certainly not have much of an impact on those who are using this too, as a weapon against the government; giving the twist that it is proof of how the government is giving in or being managed by the countries of the West, or the Tamil Diaspora.
The statement by the government that this law will not have retrospective effect, and is only meant for the future, has no impact on the opponents, who see it is a good tool to use against the government, based on their opposition to the policies of reconciliation and peace building. The fact that the intent of this law is to prevent enforced disappearances, not only as a peace dividend, but also as an aspect of safety for all sections of the people, has to be the stuff of debate and publicity by the government.
It is necessary to show that such enforced disappearances were what led to the white vans in the past, to the absence of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, and many others among the Sinhalese who went missing in the years of the last government; and the prevention of such criminal activity is necessary and good for all Sri Lankans. The attempt to show that this is a means of bringing harm to the Armed Forces, who won the war against the LTTE, should be completely debunked with all the evidence available to the government.
However, there is also the necessity of working out how the government, with its message of reconciliation and understanding, could come to terms with that large number of Tamils, especially from the North, who are making every effort to have some information about those who have been missing from their families for a very long time.
In the context of the Joint Opposition being strongly opposed to this new law, it is necessary to recall that was this very issue of disappearances and the elimination of persons who had disappeared that led Mahinda Rajapaksa to make his important move to Geneva and place the facts before the UN body interested in this matter. Mahinda Rajapaksa certainly earned considerable respect and support from the people for taking up the issue of those who went missing or were eliminated during the second JVP uprising, and saw the establishment of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights under his leadership in 1988. There is no doubt that he did undergo much difficulty and hardship in making his journey to the UN in Geneva for this purpose, and it was a most salutary cause.
But, the JO under his leadership and the SLPP led by GL Peiris, also under his political guidance, are strongly opposed to this legislation, and is clearly raking up false information about it, with special focus on the supposed impact on the Armed Forces, to carry on the campaign against the government through this.
It is necessary for the government to work out a campaign of good strategy both on the issue of the new Constitution and that of the law against enforced disappearances, if it is to succeed in maintaining a strong unity of purpose as the completion of the second year of the government of National Unity approaches very fast.

Turkeys 2016 coup, a warning to all democracies - Ambassador
What happened in Turkey should be a warning to all democracies in the world Turkeys Ambassador Tunca zuhadar said referring to the coup attempt that Turkey witnessed on July 15 2016.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Turkish Embassy in Colombo, the Ambassador said it was a modern example of the Trojan Horse scenario.
He noted that the only difference between what happened in Ancient Troy and modern turkey was that the attackers were not foreign; they were brainwashed citizens of Turkey.
Even though they managed to sneak into the Turkish system, the brave people of Turkey fought back and thwarted the attempt. It was the citizens who defended the democracy with their bare hands against the guns and canons. It showed how important is the secularism for a democratic country. Turkey has definitely maintained its secular system, he said.
When asked whether any other country was involved in the coup attempt, the Ambassador said the leader of the terrorist organization lives in USA since 1999 and despite several requests from the Turkish government to the US government to expedite that person, up to now there is no development.
Several bureaucrats and military personnel who were part of the coup attempt escaped abroad, mainly to the European countries and most of them had received refugee status. And that create all sorts of questions in our minds, he said.

Venus rolls back the years
Venus Williams' appearance in January's Australian Open final wasn't, as it turned out, a temporary return to the head table of grand slam tennis for the 37-year-old.
Rather it turned out to be a sign of things to come, with Wimbledon providing more success.
The US star reached a second grand slam final this year and simultaneously ended the chances of a first British women's winner at Wimbledon since 1977 when she dispatched Johanna Konta -- who grew up idolizing the tennis playing Williams sisters -- 6-4 6-2 in a fine display of powerful, athletic tennis at The All England Club.
Indeed it hasn't been a great last two days for the locals, who saw hobbled, defending men's champion Andy Murray bundled out by Williams' fellow American Sam Querrey in the quarterfinals.
If Williams defeats Garbine Muguruza today (Saturday), the world No. 11 would become the oldest women's grand slam winner in the Open Era, surpassing younger sister Serena who got the better of Venus in Melbourne.
Muguruza certainly shouldn't be discounted, even if Williams might be relieved not to be confronting her sibling, who is pregnant and off the tour. Williams leads Muguruza 3-1 head-to-head but lost their last tussle, this year in Rome.
But that tournament is played on clay, not grass, as Muguruza knows.
"She knows how to play, especially Wimbledon finals," Muguruza said of Williams. "It's going to be, you know, like a historic final again."
The Spaniard has looked a different player since exiting the French Open -- when she admitted to struggling with the pressure of defending the title -- and crushed the unseeded Magdalena Rybarikova 6-1 6-1 in the first semifinal on Centre Court.
It was Serena who beat Muguruza in the 2015 finale at SW19.
SUSTAINED EXCELLENCE
But Thursday belonged to Williams, whose sustained excellence and longevity at Wimbledon are spelled out by these numbers: A ninth final, 87 match wins -- one more than Serena -- 101 total matches and 20 visits.
Capping this fortnight for her in perfect fashion -- a fortnight that began with questions about a car accident she was involved in that led to the death of a 78-year-old man in Florida -- would be a sixth crown and first grand slam since her 2008 triumph here.
Williams caressed a forehand winner down the line on a third match point to seal victory over Konta and celebrated in understated fashion. You couldn't take the smile off her face, though there was no pirouette like when she downed CoCo Vandeweghe in the Melbourne semifinals.
Williams and seventh-ranked Konta possess similar styles. They are both tall, power players with big serves who also cover the court with aplomb. Konta actually led their head-to-heads 3-2, including a victory over Williams at the tournament closest to her home, the Miami Open, in March.
But on Thursday, Konta was put under relentless pressure by Williams as the British player made 35 forced errors, with Venus also powering home 19 winners and hitting only nine unforced errors.
PIVOTAL
There was little to separate them on the grass -- a controversial issue this tournament -- in the first set. A pivotal two games, however, decided the set and probably the entire outcome.
Down two break points at 4-4, Williams produced a serve out wide, backhand winner combination. On the second, an excellent second serve into the body gave Konta no chance. It wouldn't be the last time Williams came up with that serve, Konta turning away when a similar serve followed in the second set. Konta then felt the pressure serving at 4-5 in the opener, falling behind quickly 0-40, and couldn't save the game.
Williams had the important advantage and pressed it home for 3-1 in the second. Konta went from 0-40 to 30-40 on serve but was broken on the third break point.
Konta, who courageously produced gripping three-set wins over Donna Vekic, Caroline Garcia and Simona Halep, just couldn't mount a comeback, though she left the court to a standing ovation, rightfully so.
But it was Williams who left as the winner on the day.  CNN

Whats it like coaching Serena
Patrick Mouratoglou likes stress. He craves it. The man Serena Williams credits for taking her from great to history is not one to rest. He cant. Boredom would quickly smother the Frenchman were he to ever take it easy.
The 47-year-olds pulse used to quicken when he would watch Williams, one of historys greatest champions, compete. That was pressure. That was adrenaline. He loved it. But with his pupil on maternity leave, deep into her third trimester, the coach has to now find the buzz, the rush, from elsewhere, though nothing can truly compare to helping Williams rewrite the record books. Even live television interviews do not make the heart race, for the Parisian is as comfortable on screen as the rest of us would be sunbathing on a beach.
You can check my pulse before and after, I am the same, he says, fresh from a live appearance on a British breakfast television programme.
I find a way to have stress because I need it. I did TV during the French Open and I told the guy make me do things Ive never done before.
This summer marks his fifth as Williams coach and so, naturally, he has become accustomed to the attention that comes with working alongside the worlds most recognizable female athlete, a player who has danced in a Beyonce music video and been a tennis superstar for almost two decades.
Once describing being afraid as a disaster, Mouratoglou also has no fear, which was a useful trait when confronted by Williams father, Richard, shortly after the 23-time grand slam champion had appointed the Frenchman as her coach.
Never before had the American worked with someone not sanctioned by her family. The father, the engineer behind Serena and sister Venus success, needed to be swayed. He was quickly converted and Williams decision to broaden her horizons proved to be a masterstroke.
Mouratoglou can list Williams achievements since their partnership began as easily as someone ordering takeaway from a favorite restaurant: 10 grand slam titles, two Olympic golds and a three-and-a-half year stint at the top of the world rankings.
But both he and Williams, he says, are the same characters they were before their alliance. I dont think shes changed me or Ive changed her, Mouratoglou, who describes himself as a person of extremes, tells CNN. I have more exposure clearly than before, but its also deserved because we did so well.
When youre with Serena you have a lot of exposure, people look at you different, probably. Im not saying that they should, but its a normal process.
SERENA WITH A BABY IS STILL SERENA
It is just before midday on a glorious London summers day and Mouratoglou has already been interviewed 15 times in the last 24 hours, a number that will only increase in the hours ahead as he promotes his autobiography The Coach, which is now available in English.
He has had little sleep. His lack of shut-eye, he says, is a combination of boundless media commitments and late-night socializing with friends in Englands capital.
He gladly accepts a cup of so-so office-made coffee, although outwardly he doesnt appear to need an injection of caffeine. Wearing a jacket, white shirt and a pocket square, he is the personification of exemplary Gallic tailoring.
And though 30 minutes early for the interview, he doesnt use the spare time to pause. Instead, the loquacious Frenchman is happy to talk at length about Williams -- her pregnancy, her return -- and his rise from an anxious, unhappy child to one of tennis best coaches.
This is a strange time for the father-of-four. He is at Wimbledon with no student to teach, but this summer, he says, is just the interval before one of the sports most successful partnerships resumes next year.
Mouratoglou did not know Williams was pregnant during the Australian Open in January, a tournament she won without dropping a set, but the news did not come as a surprise because the player had, he says, been looking forward to becoming a mother for quite a long time.
Ever since Williams announced in May that she was pregnant, the 35-year-old -- the oldest player to ever be a world No.1, the most relentless accumulator of grand slam titles in nearly 50 years -- has maintained she will play tennis competitively again.
She is a woman who thinks everything is possible, says Mouratoglou.
Serena with a baby is still Serena, he continues. I know she will need time because I know its a trauma for the body, but well take the time.
Its a new situation but when I see how determined she is at the moment to come back, Id be really surprised if she changed her mind.
By posting videos on social media of practice sessions at her Miami home, the mum-to-be has been showing the world her steadfast desire to make a comeback and last month flew to Paris to make plans with Mouratoglou for her return.
She wanted to ask me a lot of things -- what would be the team and when we would start, Mouratoglou explains.
My job is called adaptation. Its always about adapting to new situations, but the core team is going to be the same. Its just extra people, like a nanny, but even if they come to the court, its fine, well adapt.
Shes incredibly happy and shes frustrated at the same time because she wants to compete.
Shes playing every day. She doesnt move around the court, she just wants to keep contact with the ball and thats it.
SERENA IS IN A PERMANENT STATE OF NON-SATISFACTION
It was Williams who, in 2012, picked up the phone and called Mouratoglou to ask if she could use the facilities at his academy on the outskirts of Frances capital.
He has recently opened another academy in Nice.
Williams had just suffered a surprise first-round defeat at the French Open and two years had passed since she had won a grand slam title. Confidence was low.
Mouratoglous strategy was to shift this once-in-a-generation talents focus onto records, onto building a legacy.
He introduced top spin to her forehand, made her play longer rallies and made sure his charge was mentally prepared for games, formulating tactics for each opponent, using his words carefully to inspire.
Its the little differences, he says. When players think right it makes a huge difference and, with champions, its even bigger. She can completely switch from one second to another. The girl from Compton kept going, even though she was already at an age where many retire, and is now one short of equaling Margaret Courts all-time singles record of 24 grand slams. She is a sporting icon. But what makes Williams a great champion, Mouratoglou explains, is her state of permanent non-satisfaction.
Victories are forgotten, new goals are quickly set. She works as hard to maintain her greatness as she did to achieve it and, crucially, refuses to accept defeat.
This is a player who has won three of her grand slam singles titles after being match point down.Mouratolgou remembers Williams victory at the French Open final in 2013, a tournament she had not won for 11 years.
After the trophy ceremony she looks at me and says I want to win Wimbledon, he recalls, still impressed by her grit.
There was zero celebration and, believe me, we tried. We were in the car and she just said drive me home.
THE COACH WHO COULDNT CONNECT WITH PEOPLE
Mouratoglou is the son of a Greek-born businessman, but despite his familys wealth he remembers his childhood as one of being paralyzed by the shame of not being able to do better.
An anxious, shy, puny kid, his early years were a disaster, which makes his evolution into an exceptional communicator all the more remarkable. I couldnt connect with people so I developed other senses. I had no other option, says Mouratolgou, who grew from an academic under-achiever into a talented singer and jazz guitarist, though tennis was his passion.
I had to make those changes in order to live the life I wanted to live. Now, from my point of view, I have the ideal life.
How long will that life involve coaching Williams not even he knows.
One day she will wake up and she will tell me I dont feel like going to practice tomorrow. Shell say the same the day after, the week after, and then shell tell me its game over, but when that is going to be I have no idea, he says. What Mouratoglu is sure of, however, is that Williams will be aiming to win grand slams when she returns to the sport. The goal is not to beat this record, or that record, the real goal is to set up Serenas record. Is it 23 24 25 30 I dont know, but lets go, lets find out.
Why would there be a limit If, as a coach, I set limits for Serena Im really a terrible coach because Serena doesnt have limits.
MCENROE DIDNT MEAN TO HURT SERENA
She might not have played since the Australian Open final, but Williams is still making headlines.
First her pregnancy caused waves, then she appeared naked on the front cover of Vanity Fair, and recently shes been involved in a spat with compatriot John McEnroe.
The three-time Wimbledon champion said Williams would be about 700 in the world were she on the mens tour. While others debated the matter, Williams responded on social media, asking the former world No.1 to respect her privacy.
There has not been an interview where Mouratoglou has not been asked about the outspoken New Yorkers comments.
He didnt mean to hurt her, of course, but its hurtful and I understand her reaction, he says. Its basically saying womens tennis is not good. But one comment does not make a sport sexist.
At pain to emphasize he is not specifically referring to McEnroe, Mouratoglou, who has also coached on the mens tour, criticizes those who habitually compare mens and womens tennis.
Its true women dont run as fast, they dont jump as high but because of that does it make their tour not interesting I dont think so, its just another tour, he says.
Visit cnn.com for more news and videos
You have to see womens and mens tennis as different sports because women have different qualities. I dont understand why people compare, it doesnt make sense to me. The message is -- its not as good as men. OK, if you dont like it, dont watch it. You dont have to make a comment.
Let the people who like it, like it.  CNN
Williams won her 23rd grand slam in January, at the Australian Open. It later transpired she was about eight weeks pregnant.

W.H.O. accepts Lankas dengue statistics
The Health Ministry follows the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines in collecting statistics on the number of dengue patients and dengue deaths.
The WHO accepts Sri Lankas official data on dengue situation and it uses the same statistics for their bulletins, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department last afternoon, he said that Sri Lanka allows the WHO to verify the accuracy of statistics.
Countries like North Korea do not allow the WHO to check the accuracy of their statistics.
Therefore the statistics of such countries are not reliable, he said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the WHO team which is now in Sri Lanka to study and recommend an intensive dengue control programme will present their action plan today (July 15, Saturday).
The team has already handed over the first report.
There are only two communicable diseases left for Sri Lanka to control. They are dengue and HIV. Sri Lanka will control both soon. The Health Ministry has already provided all required resources to treat dengue patients and control the breeding of dengue mosquitoes, the Minister added. Minister Senaratne pointed out that the massive dengue control programme will be launched today (June 15, Saturday) with the assistance of all media institutions.
During the past four days, there has been a visible decrease in the number of patients seeking admission to hospitals. The public should organise groups to control dengue. The method used in Cuba and Pakistan to control dengue cannot be applied in Sri Lanka because there are many political parties in Sri Lanka and the Armed Forces cannot be given the same powers given in those two countries. Uneducated politicians who do not know the history behind the dengue epidemic make foolish statements about dengue statistics, the Minister added.

Wicket flattened out after lunch  Gurusinha
Asanka Gurusinha, cricket manager of the Sri Lanka team said that the R Premadasa Stadium pitch flattened out after the initial session and that made it easy for the Zimbabwe batsmen to stage a recovery on the opening day of the one-off Test yesterday.
The feedback I got from the players was that there was moisture in the morning, so the track did turn a bit, and the ball did a little bit. After lunch it settled down so much, and even now, when I spoke to them, they said the ball comes slow off the wicket, and doesnt do anything. Its more like an old Premadasa wicket, said Gurusinha at the end of the day.
Thats the reason they were 96 for 4 and then went on to get 344-8. That said, we did bowl some loose stuff. We were lucky to have Rangana (Herath) there, but even to him they had time to get on the back foot and pull him, because the ball wasnt coming on at the pace we were expecting.
It is a bit disappointing to end up at 344 for 8 after taking the top four wickets cheaply. But this is Test cricket, and Ive got to give credit to Craig Ervine. It was a really good knock and he batted well, he said.
Gurusinha said the teams first priority is to get the two remaining Zimbabwe wickets early today.
If you look at overall we need to get those two last two wickets very early because we can bat the whole day then. Its not just about hanging around. The batsmen will have to play their shots and play normal cricket. We have a really good batting lineup. I expect our guys to be there and bat session by session. The first thing is the half an hour to one hour to get those wickets, said Gurusinha.
The way the track is playing, Im expecting our batsmen also to put their heads down and bat long. They got runs at the end. Especially the last session you saw there were no demons on the wicket. It was easy to play shots and even their no. 10 was batting well. That showed there was enough time to play the shots. Im expecting our guys to do well. Only time will tell.
Once again Sri Lanka had to bank on the experience and spin of Rangana Herath who finished as their top bowler with four wickets.
He is close to 40 years, and you take him out, we are a bit thin. Were hoping that with some of the A team cricket and everything thats coming up, we can bring someone. There are good spinners, but they dont have the experience of playing at the highest level, said Gurusinha. You come across good players, and its not easy. Test cricket is a different game. Patience is what you need, and thats what Ranganas got. Hes got patience backed with experience. Dilruwan (Perera) I dont think he was his normal self, and that might be because he hasnt played matches. Im hoping by the second innings he will get that loop were used to seeing, and build that partnership.
IT WAS QUITE HARD OUT THERE  ERVINE
Zimbabwes centurion Craig Ervine expressed his satisfaction to score his maiden international century away from home when he remained unbeaten on 151.
It was definitely satisfying especially Ive scored a few hundreds but theyve all been at home. To get one away from home against Sri Lanka in a Test match means a lot to me, said Ervine who showed resoluteness in overcoming not only the Lankan bowling but also the hot conditions.
It was quite humid and you tend to lose quite a bit of weight if you bat a fair amount of time out there, said Ervine Its quite hard to try and keep gloves and stuff dry because you do sweat quite a lot. It does take quite a bit out of the body. It was quite exhausting.
Commenting on the surface Ervine said, At the start the wicket was a little bit damp but once it dried out if was a nice wicket to bat on. We have gone at a good rate throughout the day but we may have given away a couple of wickets. But we have fought back quite nicely towards the end of the day. Hopefully tomorrow we can put on another 50-60 runs.
Ervine who comes from a cricketing family said that he was extremely happy to have his younger brother Ryan Ervine watching the Test match.
The whole family has had an huge influence on my career. My younger brother is over here to watch the Test from Australia and it means a lot to see that he is here to see it as well.
