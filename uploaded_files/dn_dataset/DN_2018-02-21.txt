War-hit Shakhtar brush off upheaval as they face Roma
Kiev: War refugees Shakhtar Donetsk head into Wednesday's Champions League clash with Italian side AS Roma in high spirits despite a lack of signings and sparse match practice.
The war in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists has forced Shakhtar to play their home games far from their state-of-the-art Donbass Arena stadium for the past four years.
In 2014, the club moved to Lviv, close to Ukraine's western border with Poland, but the local crowd -- that favours their own top-flight side, Karpaty -- was often openly hostile to the Donetsk team or ignored their games all together.Last year Shakhtar's owners decided to switch their "home" venue to the eastern city of Kharkiv, 250 kilometres (155 miles) northwest of their native Donetsk.Shakhtar, the only club from the eastern Europe in the Champions League knockout stage, will host Roma at the 40,000-seat Metalist Kharkiv stadium. The Ukraine conflict has caused Shakhtar's billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov to lose control of dozens of his coal mining and metallurgical enterprises located in the eastern rebel-held territories.

Wigan end Man City quadruple bid with Cup shock
Wigan, Monday: Pep Guardiola's quest to win an unprecedented quadruple with Manchester City came to a stunning and controversial end when they fell to a 1-0 defeat at third-tier Wigan in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Monday.
In an uncanny repeat of the 2013 FA Cup final, in which City had a player sent off before losing to a late Wigan winner, Guardiola's side had Fabian Delph dismissed amid stormy scenes before Will Grigg's 79th-minute goal decided the game.
A famous night was marred, however, by a post-match pitch invasion by Wigan supporters which saw a number of them confront City players, with striker Sergio Aguero required to defend himself.
Earlier the drama had been provided by Northern Ireland international Grigg who capitalised on an error by Kyle Walker -- who allowed a pass to run through to the Wigan man -- and kept ahead of John Stones before finishing clinically from just inside the area.
It was only City's second defeat to English opposition since losing an FA Cup semi-final to Arsenal last April while their opponents can now look forward to a quarter-final home tie with Southampton.The pivotal sending-off arrived in first half injury-time when Fabian Delph made a rash challenge on Wigan's Max Power, prompting referee Anthony Taylor to pull a yellow card out of his pocket before changing his mind and producing red.
Wasteful Aguero

City might have enjoyed a far more comfortable evening had their record goalscorer Aguero not missed a golden opportunity after just two minutes, heading over Bernardo Silva's pinpoint cross from just six yards.
And home keeper Christian Walton needed to be alert a few moments later, diving smartly to parry away a fierce strike from Ilkay Gundogan.
Guardiola had made six changes for the tie, while still fielding a strong line-up, but two of his fringe players -- full-back Danilo and back-up goalkeeper Claudio Bravo -- were guilty of errors which offered the hosts a glimmer of hope.
First Bravo and Danilo dithered in dealing with the ball, almost presenting Gareth Roberts with a chance on the six-yard line.
And then Danilo was robbed of the ball by Roberts, the ball breaking for Grigg who raced half the length of the field before shooting into the side-netting.
City were enjoying the bulk of possession but, without the rested Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, were struggling to create clear chances.
They came close, from Leroy Sane's 26th-minute corner which Gundogan flicked across the six-yard area, but defender Aymeric Laporte failed to connect with the ball at his feet.
When City next threatened, after Stones headed down Delph's cross, Fernandinho's shot rose over by some distance when he looked certain to score.
Gundogan and Danilo, twice, also threatened the Wigan goal and Walton saved superbly from an Aguero drive, moments before the explosive dismissal of Delph.Guardiola brought on England right-back Walker as a half-time substitute, moving Danilo over to Delph's vacant left-back spot.
Despite their disadvantage, City still enjoyed the majority of possession although, apart from Chey Dunkley blocking a Danilo shot, there was little to concern Walton as the tie approached the 65-minute mark and Guardiola opted to bring De Bruyne into the fray.
The Belgian's introduction brought a far greater threat from City, particularly from set-pieces. AFP

MONEY LAUNDERING CASE AGAINST NAMAL RAJAPAKSA
Witness says Karunajeewa gave Rs. 30 MN cheque to be encashed
Rohan Abey Iriyagolla yesterday told Colombo High Court that Indika Karunajeewa, a companion of Namal Rajapaksa gave him a cheque worth Rs. 30 million to be encashed and deposited in a bank account of Iriyagollas company.
Witness Iriyagolla was testifying in a case filed against Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others under the Money Laundering Act.
Rohan Abey Iriyagolla, the chairman of Boston Capital Pvt Ltd made this revelation when the case against Namal Rajapaksa and five others for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services was taken up for trial yesterday.
The witness said a cheque (worth Rs.30 million) issued by Hovael Construction (Pvt) Ltd was given to him through Indika Karunajeewa of Gowers Corporate Services for encashment. In reply to a query made by Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige, the witness said he did not refuse to encash the cheque since Indika Karunajeewa had close relations with high-ranking persons during the previous regime.I got to know Namal Rajapaksa through businessman Nimal Perera. I have met him and spoke to him over business activities, the witness said.
The witness said a sum of Rs.24 million out of Rs.30 million was deposited in a Bank account belonging to Boston Capital following the encashment. The remaining Rs.6 million was given to Boston Capital to recover its office expenses. Iriyagolla said Gowers Corporate Services had sent five invoices on several occasions requesting to make payments for handling the construction works regarding a 100 GW of wind power milestone in Mannar.
However, the witness said neither his company nor the Gowers Corporate Services really engaged in any business activity regarding wind power milestone.
Further trial was fixed for May 30 by Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon.
Four accused Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sujani Bogollagama and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd director were present in court when the case was taken up before Colombo High Court.
However, the second accused Indika Karunajeewa was not present in Court but represented by attorneys. At a previous occasion, the High Court permitted the prosecution to proceed the trial in the absentia of second and sixth accused in the case in terms of section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The Colombo High Court had served indictments earlier, on three accused regarding this money laundering case.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to Sri Lankan Airlines. The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services while being an MP from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means. Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for Namal Rajapaksa. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appeared for the third accused.
Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing for the second and fourth accused.

Worlds first woman Prime Minister
History is full of examples of the disastrous consequences that came upon such nations that changed their constitutions by giving one man too much power - Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike
In July 1960, we really surprised the world, as makers of the first woman Head of State, by voting Sirimavo Bandaranaike to power. The world wondered how it happened in Ceylon; a record that will remain unending in mankinds history.
The Londons Evening News, reporting in bold letters in front page, on July 21, 1960, wrote, There will be a need for a new term, shall we call her Stateswoman It was after six years since this extraordinary happening for another nation to elect a woman as Prime Minister; the second, Indira Gandhi followed by Israels Golda Mere, Britons Margret Thatcher and so on. At a time, there was a cold war between two super powers who were engaged in a contest for winning the third world nations, Sri Lanka under Sirimavo hosted the Non-aligned Movements Summit in 1976 attended by 86 Heads of State.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, coming from an aristocratic background, was not one to show off her position, and neither was she interested in the formal side which has now become a characteristic of Heads of States. When she became Prime Minister and head of government in 1970 for her second term, she had attained political maturity following a hard first term from1960 to 64. She was in authority of her government and had put on wide experience both in opposition and in government. In April 1971 she had to confront the JVP rebellion, the oil crises which had distressing consequences on the country, land reform and nationalization of plantations. She successfully managed a coalition with vociferous left political parties. There was much anxiety in the politics especially within the government. She managed the country in these grave times with bravery.
Relations with officials
Prime Minister Sirimavo had an admirable relationship with her officials. She was prepared to listen to opposing points of view, and was rarely annoyed, and would make a pronouncement after considering the pros and cons of any problem. She did not make conclusions before meetings with officials, and she was open to expert advice from officials. She had a clear separation of what is official and what is political. She did never encouraged senior public officers to support the demands of politicians. She never intervened in making appointments at ministries, a job she entrusted to the ministry secretaries. Mrs Bandaranaike was not troubled by the political connections of officials and never contemplated in politicising the public service.
A sense of public duty
As a practising Buddhist, Sirimavo was mindful of the truth that all things were transient and temporary. She was not an orator or a good speaker in the House, but was a great parliamentarian. She understood her accountability to Parliament and always travelled economy class on many of her trips abroad.
Former Senior Asst. Secretary, Ministry of Planning & Economic Affairs Leelananda De Silva, writing a tribute once said, She had a great sense of what was right and proper and could rise above partisan politics. I remember one instance in Tokyo, when we prepared her speech to be delivered at the reception hosted by the Japanese Prime Minister. The officials, except for one or two felt that there should be a reference to the role of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), at the San Francisco Conference in 1950, where the Japanese Peace Treaty was signed. At this conference, Mr. J. R. Jayewardene, who was the Minister of Finance and the Leader of the Ceylon delegation, had waived any claim by Ceylon for war reparations from Japan. Japan has never forgotten this friendly gesture. At the time of Mrs. Bandaranaikes visit to Tokyo in 1977, Mr. Jayewardene was Leader of the Opposition in Sri Lanka, and the general elections were expected soon. The question therefore was whether to highlight Mr. Jayewardenes achievement. Mrs. Bandaranaike had no qualms at all and was perfectly happy to mention Ceylons role in San Francisco.
She was particularly concerned about maintaining good rapport with China, India, and Pakistan. In early 1970s we offered refueling facilities to Pakistani aircraft during the Bangladesh crisis; there was severe resentment in India. However, her close relations with Indira Gandhi, the Indian PM helped to triumph over this setback in our relations with the giant neighbour.
She attended kindergarten travelling in a buggy cart under the care of an ayah and faithful carter. Five year-old Sirimavo baffled the carter when she insisted that a particular bull be bound to the buggy, whenever the man brought a new one. This extraordinary longing or passion for things she amply demonstrated in her political life as Bradman Weerakoon, the official Secretary to the Prime Minister, says, She insisted fresh Mangoosteens from Horagolla, Rambutan and mangoes from Attanagalle, be air lifted to London to be served for the guests at a dinner, she hosted for several distinguished VVIPs; her hand-written personal note to me, specifying, where to collect the fruits, types and details of varieties. -Rendering unto Caesar: Pp-91/92
Sirimavos 19-year association with S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike as Minister, Opposition Leader and Head of State, gave her sufficient opportunity to understand the intricacies in the political field, which she used generously in later years as Head of State.
After the assassination of her husband in 1959, and at party hierarchys invitation she reluctantly joined the fray; assumed the high position in July 1960, and addressed the nation;
By their verdict, the people have clearly affirmed their faith in the democratic socialist policies initiated by my late husband. It was far from my mind to achieve any personal glory for myself, when I assumed the leadership of the party at the request of its leaders. I knew that if I did not take this step the forces of reaction would once again begin to oppress the masses for whose salvation my husband sacrificed his very life.
P. E. P. Deraniyagala, S.W.R.Ds cousin and his best-man, commenting on her entry said:
What does she know of politics  Shell end up by spoiling her reputation and ruining the family name.
All her critics were soon to find themselves in grave inaccuracy.
Language issues
Sirimavos handling of the Tamil national issues left much to be desired. She attempt to push Sinhala into administration leading to a mass satyagraha by Tamil politicians. She declared a state of emergency and sent in the Army to break up non-violent campaign. Tamil leaders were confined to house arrest. In 1966, she led a movement against limited rights being awarded by Dudleys government to Tamils through District Councils. In the 1970s, she introduced medium-wise standardisation for university entrance depriving many Tamil students of higher education. Also there was discrimination against employment in government.
Sirimavos civic rights were deprived by JR and she was expelled from Parliament. She was all alone as her party boycotted proceedings. Wishing good-bye to parliamentarians she said, Remember the Sword of Damocles hanging over my head, will soon be yours. The people will see to it.
The unruly MPs of the UNP were harsh and boisterous as she walked out. It was the Opposition Leader Amirthalingam and Sivasithamparam who flanked her on both sides and graciously escorted her out.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike was a morally upright figure. Her financial integrity has been without accusation. Her personal behaviour too has been devoid of blemish.

World's tallest wooden skyscraper in Japan
A Japanese company is planning to build the world's tallest wooden skyscraper, to mark its 350th anniversary in 2041.
Sumitomo Forestry said 10% of the 70-storey W350 tower would be steel, combined with about 180,000 cubic metres of indigenous wood.
There will be about 8,000 homes, with trees and foliage on balconies at every level, it said.
A braced tube structure, diagonal steel vibration-control braces at the centre of a 350m (1,150ft) wood and steel column, would protect against Tokyo's regular earthquakes, it said.
The projected cost of the building is about 600bn yen (4.02bn; $5.6bn), about twice the cost of a conventional skyscraper of the same size.
However, Sumitomo says it expects costs to fall before the building's 2041 scheduled completion date due to technological advances.
No. Japan actually passed a law in 2010 requiring construction companies to use wood for public buildings that are below three storeys high.
It's not a new concept worldwide either.
Wooden skyscrapers can be found across the globe, from an 18-storey office building in Minneapolis made from timber to a 53m-high block of student flats in Vancouver that currently holds the title of world's tallest wooden skyscraper.
Concrete and steel buildings leave behind a carbon footprint, and are thought to be responsible for about 8% and 5% of global emissions respectively.
Wood, on the other hand, stores carbon instead of emitting it back into the atmosphere.
Japan also has large forests, covering approximately two thirds of land area.
Fire-resistance is obviously one key factor.
However, cross-laminated timber (CLT), a building material that is becoming more common, is designed to be fire resistant and unlike steel, remains more structurally stable when subjected to high temperatures.
It's a lot more expensive to build a wooden skyscraper, so chances are you're not going to see them pop up across your neighbourhood anytime soon. (BBC)

Auditors can contribute  to financial stability
Constructive and effective relationships between the prudent supervisors and audit regulators can enhance financial sector supervision, says the Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
The Dr. Coomaraswamy was speaking at the 12th International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR),in Colombo. The three-day forum is hosted by the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board (SLAASMB). We also believe that such a regulation process helps audit professionals to achieve full potential of its role in the financial market.
Noting that maintaining financial system stability, market confidence and consumer protection are core objectives of the regulator, the governor stressed that it is important to look at financial stability as a necessary condition for achieving prosperity and sustainable growth.
In order to achieve these objectives, we believe the regulators should have a robust monitoring and supervision system. There should be a firm expectation in the market place, that the regulatory requirements will be enforced. The regulators should also have deep insights into the market it is supposed to regulate. For this, it is essential to have in-depth dialogue with the stakeholders.
The governor also stressed that regulators should also posses the required knowledge about the financial markets as well as the ability to address unforeseen risks resulting impossible market failures.
Auditors can contribute to financial stability by delivering quality bank audits, thereby increasing the market confidence in banks and the financial statements. As a prudential regulator of the financial services of market ,the Central Bank intends to get a clear understanding from the activities of the independent audit regulators on many aspects including the reliability, relevance of financial statements of banks, finance companies and other financial service providers.
The governor further noted it is important to be aware of audit risks and challenges faced by audit committees and the Central bank looks forward for feedbacks from audit regulators on such matters.

Abans launches beats headphones in Sri Lanka
Abans the authorized reseller and service provider for Apple in Sri Lanka is all set to welcome Apples subsidiary; Beats Electronics. World famous Dr. Dre and music mogul Jimmy Iovine joined hands in 2008 bringing new life to the headphone industry by introducing Beats Electronics and have since fulfilled their aim of providing an enjoyable music experience while simultaneously capturing the hearts of many with its stylish appearance and striking design.
Beats has been a popular choice amongst many notable celebrities such as LeBron James, Serena Williams, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, Nicki Minaj, Pharrell Williams, Justin Bieber, Ryan Reynolds, and Robin Thicketo name a few. Known for their trend setting and Ornament like headphones Beats have successfully established themselves as one of the leading brands in the market today. The now Apple-owned brand has since broadened its technological spectrum making some of the best sounding headphones in the market today.

Aping other cricket nations
In the past week or so there has been news making the rounds that Sri Lanka Cricket is planning to hold a Lanka Premier League (LPL) on the same lines as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and similar to tournaments that are hosted by other Test playing nations across the world.
Before pitching headlong into holding one, SLC must first sit back and think what benefits this type of tournament would bring to the game, to the country and its cricket. By holding a tournament as the LPL what is the SLC looking to gain financially or otherwise, or both
Just because other Test nations are having their own tournaments on the lines of the highly successful IPL, we should not also try to follow them. Sri Lanka is the only ICC full member without a T20 league of their own, so what
Cant our cricket progress without a T20 tournament as it has done over the years
The only country that has benefitted from holding a T20 tournament is India that has produced cricketers hitherto unheard of if not for their performances in the IPL that has served them as a passport to the national team.
Seven years ago SLC tried to hold its own T20 tournament modelled on the IPL but it never saw the light of day as India refused to release the 12 players selected to participate and furthermore allegations of corruption and incompetence by SLC and its handing over the organisation to a previously unheard of Singapore-based Somerset Entertainment Ventures put the tournament in serious jeopardy.
It was postponed by a year to 2012 and with a renewed deal with Somerset Entertainment Ventures the tournament took place with seven franchises owned by private backers from August 11-31 and Uva Next beat Nagenahira Nagas in the final to emerge champions. The second season was set to begin in 2013 but was cancelled after the franchises breached payment deadlines and that was the end of SLCs attempt to imitate the IPL.
Where they failed miserably was that unlike the IPL where all the franchise owners are from the host country India, the SL Premier League reached out for owners from outside and those who brought up the franchises were crooked companies some of which were non-existent and existed only by name.
The SLC were caught in a situation where the local companies could not match upto the requirements of the players brought by the franchises and thereby in its desperation to attract overseas players they allowed the franchises to be brought by Indian companies that had dubious records without strictly checking into their credentials.
Now after six years the SLC under a different administration is trying its hand at having another go to hold an IPL style tournament and once again they are going to run into troubled waters as the dates they have decided to hold it  August 18 to September 16, 2018 clashes with the English county season and the already established Caribbean Premier League.
In the circumstances the chances of attracting some of the top T20 cricketers for the tournament does not look all that rosy at the moment. A tournament without the big names in T20 cricket is not bound to draw much attraction around the world however globally it is broadcast let alone bring in local crowds to the venues.
Which brings us to the question of why have a Lanka Premier League at all Why must we try to ape other nations Sri Lanka is good at doing that in the local film and music industry where they copy virtually every Bollywood movies and songs. Does cricket also have to follow that line Are we not innovative enough to stand on our own feet and think
T20 cricket in its shortest format also brings with it the danger of betting at matches. Sri Lanka is already under the microscope of the ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit that has made several visits to the country in the past year or so to investigate allegations made by the Sports Minister, past cricketers and some of them appearing in the print, electronic and social media.
The only thing that Sri Lanka originated was the power hitting in the first 15 overs of the 1996 World Cup that saw them go and win the coveted trophy. Sri Lanka caught all the participating nations by surprise by giving the licence to score at will to their openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana in the first 15 overs when the fielding side could have only two fielders outside the 30-meter circle. The pair made mincemeat of all the bowling attacks and before the other teams had come to terms with what was happening to their bowlers, Sri Lanka had by then pocketed the most prized possession in cricket.SLC should seriously give a thought of holding an LPL and weigh the pros and cons whether it is worthwhile especially with the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit breathing down its neck and also having a president who has been accused of having connections with the gambling industry.

Appoint honest politicians as Mayors: March 12 Movement
The March 12 Movement yesterday urged all political parties and independent groups to appoint clean, honest and people-oriented politicians as Mayors and Chairmen of Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas. They should be devoid of fraud and corruption charges, the March 12 Movement asserted.
Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said the March 12 Movement has been informed that certain political parties were trying to appoint corrupt candidates who are facing legal action. This is completely wrong, he said.
We have urged all political parties to submit the parameters for selecting candidates for local government bodies before the election. However, political parties have not followed such parameters.
This election has not selected candidates according to the requirements of voters. The voters have cast their votes as it was a General Election.
They had not been aware of qualifications and the real situation of candidates, he said.

In the case of Holmes
Before The Study in Scarlet and The Hound of the Baskervilles, we are sent on a wild ride discovering the origins of Sherlock Holmes in a comedy which leads him to match his wits with an American president, the axe murderer and a blood-sucking vampire! All through a journey through time and space itself, portraying a different side of the detective seldom seen.
The Trinity College Literary Association led by Shalitha Senevirathne as Sherlock Holmes, Thishan Kularathne as Dr Watson, Kavan Ranaraja as Inspector Lestrade, Ayeshan Abeywardana, Manula Dissanayake, Ashok Mohan and others in supporting roles with Sachith Keragala as Stage Manager will perform The Curious Case of Sherlock Holmes.
Aslam Marikar, producer of 21st century Monk and Anarchy, will provide guidance and direction to the production.
The Secret Case of Sherlock Holmes will be staged at the Trinity College Main Hall on February 24 at 6 pm. The production is co-produced with Pioneer Drama Service Inc, Englewood, Colorado.
Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.
First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.
Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known, with Guinness World Records listing him as the "most portrayed movie character" in history. Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded that pretend to operate on this principle. Widely considered a British cultural icon, the character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.

Governments priority list
Now that the UNP government has received a considerable mandate amalgamated with smoke signals, they should maintain a list of priorities.
Priority number 1 is to catch the thieves and fraudsters. For that, they need to hear the cases as quickly as possible without dragging on for years. Best is if they could finalise everything within a period of one month. The fraudsters, if found guilty, should be sent to prison and not the hospital. Let them serve the sentence like any other criminal.
Priority number 2 is to inform the people of the details of crime done. For instance, spell out how much they had robbed from us, the general public, and recover that money immediately and produce proof.
Priority number 3 is to begin with the Rajapaksa clan and conclude each case within the period of one month without dragging it. Doing otherwise will only show that the UNP government has struck secret deals with the Rajapaksas. We know that it is not so, though.
Priority number 4 is to inform the public immediately. Who are the thieves, murderers Who gave orders for the murders As far as we know, take over all that Basil Rajapaksa, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa robbed through commissions and expressways. Fill us with the necessary information in simple language.
Priority number 5 is to retrieve revenue details of very important people such as Rohitha Abeygunawardana, Mahinda Aluthgamage, Johnston Fernando, Kumar Welgama and Keheliya Rambukwella. They were simpletons prior to the political entrance, and now they belong to the affluent party of this country. How have they managed to acquire such colossal amounts with a peanut salary that an MP is entitled to
Priority number 6 is to initiate a new legal process and see how the tide will turn.
The people have sent a red warning to the government. We the people are not fools. We have killed time for three years. Although development drives of major scale have been initiated, nothing satisfactory has happened with regard to catching thieves.
What were you up to when you held that esteemed position of Justice Minister, Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe You are a lawyer but did not take a simple step in favour of justice. It took some time for the government to see Dr. Rajapakshes true nature It only shows how old-fashioned our legal system is.
Priority number 7 is to modernise the legal system, finish off all these 84 cases pronto within the period of one month and ensure that corrupt prison doctors too are sent home for issuing bogus medical reports.
Priority number 8 is to recover what former First Lady, Shiranthi Rajapaksa, spent on that hotel in Paris. If Bangladesh and Egypt can expose the political scandals, why cannot our government do it

Classy saga of a  classless woman
Bennet Rathnayake is, in my opinion, an elegant filmmaker. His latest film Nela (actually the female character happens to be a hill country Tamil woman, uneducated, is being called by others as Nela instead of Nila (the Moon).
It is a neat elegant presentation of a study of human relationship and the emotional outpouring in a restrained manner. The director, cinematographer, the editor and the music director had meticulously brought out, as in a good cinema from anywhere in the world, the nuances in a subtle manner. The dialogue is poetic and the visual scores high. The speech is minimal as in good cinema. As is believed, this film is a Moving Image.
Audience spellbound
The story is simple and one could expect how the story would end. But cinema too is an industry. So the director has to take the role of a Middle Cinema filmmaker, not being too arty and yet succeeding holding the grip of the audience spellbound. This I witnessed when the producers and collaborative artistes invited me too for a special show. I made it there despite my uneasiness in health condition.
That audience educated me that the Sinhala cinemagoers are indeed matured and able to appreciate an appealing story silently and gradually getting an insight into the hearts and minds of the characters in the film.
The story is told in the backdrop of our beautiful land on the hilltop of the central region. The timeframe is about 100 years old. It is a colonial setting happening in the bungalow of the first Sinhalese planter and also around the conducive and pleasing natural environment.
The early scenes take much time to establish the relationship between a handsome aristocratic young blind man and an orphaned, dark, and ugly Tami but Sinhala speaking young woman living as a parasite around a tea factory. The workers speak the hill country colloquial Tamil.
Monotony of loneliness
How can a bourgeoisie and a proletariat speak with their hearts It is possible if the man who is blind is helped by the slave-like nave woman that helps him to drive away the monotony of loneliness in keeping company with him and taking around the surroundings and teaching the reality of the scene around and making him feel the flowers and fruits.
They try to understand each other slowly and eventually fall in love and remain affectionate. They realise that beauty is not in the face but in the sacrificial hearts. Their poignant love is pure as the greenery around.
But as a norm, such love ends as a classical tragedy.
A successful eye surgery helps the young man regain sight. And yet he sees her dying with ugly scars on her chest and face and remembers her true loving nature.
The story does not end there.
Classless woman
His first cousin, good-natured and very pretty girl that understands the deep love her intended husband and the classless woman had had and sympathetic towards them waits patiently for her husband to take her ceremoniously.
While the first part of the film shows the present, the past of their lives is told by a tourist guide who explains what had happened to young people. Flashbacks of life of Nilas parents and the like are shown.
The class distinction between the servants and the tea plucking women is clearly shown in visuals. I do not want to elaborate further. See the film yourself and you will appreciate it better.
The third quarter of the film could have been edited because every shot, frame and sequence up to the point showed a remarkable understanding of the film medium.
I liked the beautiful performances of all the actors (sorry, I couldnt get their names) and the contribution by the technical artistes and the smooth music, limited though, that accentuated the mood of the film. Congratulations to all, particularly Ben Rathnayake, for this aesthetic film.

Climate change adaptation  - disaster risk reduction and Catchment Conservation
Source area protection was a key element in ensuing the availability of adequate and sustainable water resources for livelihood needs in ancient times and an integral component in Sri Lankas ancient hydraulic civilization dating over 2500 years.
Gradual encroachment into the hill country catchments due to plantation agriculture and increasing population pressures in catchments of other river basins leading to encroachments and land degradation due to deforestation. This compounded by political compulsions and lack of integrated planning, management and regulation of the natural resources/water sector has exacerbated the consequences resulting in many closed basins due to lack of perennial water flow.
Floods, droughts and now landslides are of increasing concern with the impacts of climate change resulting in heavy social and economic costs with the increasing frequency of water related disasters. A single intense rainfall event and rivers are in spate with the heavy runoff carrying loads of silt as reflected in the muddy waters an indicator of increasingly eroded and degraded catchments.
Though integrated catchment management is part of integrated water resources management or IWRM now increasingly accepted to overcome the quantity/quality divide as well as issues of increasing competing uses and population and livelihood shifts,our colonial inherited administrative and at most sub sector/sector based initiatives as responses have not been successful.
Even in the water sector with a Comprehensive Water Resources Policy in place more than a decade old (albeit yet in limbo) there has been no forward movement on a Comprehensive Water Law and with 51 acts regulating water are in an enforcement log jam overwhelmed by the political dimension leaving the sector to be driven by a set of ideological assumptions and red herrings that merely help sustain the status quo by arousing the public.
Unfortunately to date we have still not articulated at least the principles on which water will be governed so that periodic policies for use and management could follow. Poor or lack of enforcement of complementary acts such as the Soil Conservation Act and regular ad hoc land regularization has further compounded the issues. A new Soil Conservation Act is in the offing and likely take some time to say the leastbut events could far overrun the processes. Water and land governance that had semblance of at least a sector approach till the new millennium is now handled piecemeal both in relation to the political and administrative dimensions making regulation and enforcement take back seat.
Technical agencies pre-occupied with development have little interest in strengthening the regulatory frameworks or enforcement capacity with the little efforts often preempted by political compulsions. Some event driven issues have however resulted in environmental issues receiving the much needed attention and attempts to control and mitigate pollution are receiving political attention at the highest level. It is also significant to highlight the increasingly important and active role that institutions such as NBRO play with respect to vulnerably mapping and forecasts of landslides far above requirements of their dedicated mandate.
Models of River Basin Organizations (RBO) and especially River Basin Management (RBM) have been touted as panacea for basin level integrated water management notwithstanding the fact that rivers bisect basins and form the basis of administrative and political delimitation and in many cases, social divides that to overcome would seem extremely costly and disruptive especially in a country like Sri Lanka. On the other hand Integrated River Basin Planning (RBP) and related share agreements on allocations/ uses have potential for reducing demand based conflicts of competing uses and users allowing for ecosystem conservation including adequate base flows as well.
An excellent initiative a few years back by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) on basin level water resources inventory and planning was restricted to some efforts in Uva and did not follow through.
Nevertheless, certain selective RBM principles of management have certain advantages and need consideration for application in any RBP initiative undertaken. Some comprehensive basin studies have been undertaken in a few basins and a more integrated effort to assess and map basin water resources is currently being undertaken under the Climate Improvement Resilience Project (CRIP)of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources where ten major basins are under study. Hopefully, climate change will help drive much needed policy and institutional changes.
There have been several other initiatives after the integrated water sector efforts of the 1990s failed. Another sector based comprehensive initiative by the land sector in 2014 on the National Policy on Protection and Conservation of Water Sources with participation of other sectors has been formulated and can have major impact if rigorously implemented with the required resources, backstopping and political commitment. Some positive movement is seen in the water sector such as amendments to the Irrigation Ordinance and Flood Protection Act which could reinforce efforts in adaptation and mitigation.
Also the drinking water sector have on selected basis (example Kelani, Gin Ganga) initiated developing water safety plans with donor support, an outcome WHO recommendations. This can provide positive input into overall basin water use but synergies will likely come only if coupled with an integrated catchment and basin allocation and management mechanisms.
Climate Change is here to stay and ever reducing short cycles of floods droughts and landslides of increasing intensity have made Sri Lanka a continuing disaster prone country.
The human, social and economic costs are unacceptable and are having severe negative impact all round. Frequent disaster events have now overtaken the pace of the planning processes and a war footing mode seems essential in coping and developing community resilience above and beyond the mostly infrastructure based resilience efforts being undertaken in most sectors. Donors too seem to prefer to support the latter rather than the former as progress evaluation is much easier and resources flow into agencies.
Effective management of water resources requires assessment of use and user pressures at an appropriate scale-large enough to take and operationalize all relevant information ,but small enough to ensure that people who live in the area can easily relate to the catchment that may be part of the basin or sub basin. Integrated Catchment Management of at least selective catchments in the first instance seems critical if loss of life, property and livelihoods are to be reduced and safeguarded with communities not having to be constantly moving to and fro from relief camps.With most vulnerable sites identified (NBRO), concerted efforts and resources need to be applied along with communities as partners.
Increasingly Corporates are realizing their responsibilities to society and many are now are actively involved in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) activities under their CSR commitments many with medium term interventions. Opportunities for public/private initiatives at these local levels seem increasingly possible. While such initiatives go ahead negative environmental behavior in parallel is still taking place.For example in recurring landslide areas such as Aranayake regular heavy logging is still taking place without any concomitant replanting or reforestation in place due to loopholes in administrative rules and regulations that enable such logging to be legitimate.
With Commitment to SDG especially considering 6, 13 and 15 it is time to give teeth to the promises made in our National Adaptation Plans (NAP) and more recently on the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) required in the Paris Agreement that we signed sooner than later.
It may be opportune to focus more on the upstream rather than only the downstream and disaster relief responses as at present. With increasingly frequent recurring cycles of floods, droughts and landslides not only in Sri Lanka but also in South Asia and elsewhere, the humanitarian aspect of disaster response by developed countries and donors are taxed to the limit and signs of relief fatigue are apparent.
Its for the policymakers and politicians to realize that humanitarian aid for disasters are drying up and there is need to treat floods, droughts and landslides as a development issue in Sri Lanka and quickly move away from the politically attractive relief disbursements to development initiatives aimed at adaptation and mitigation.

CR to test Kandys  strength in the hills
CR & FC who are trying their best to live up to their past reputation in the rugby arena will travel up to the hills to meet the defending Clifford Cup champions Kandy Sports Club at Pallekelle today match commencing at 4.00 pm.
Kandy is the number-one ranked team in the country and the reigning league and knockout champions. They outscored CR & FC in both the league games.
In todays game Kandy will be a bit more direct and physical, and theyve got some really dangerous players to do that. Kandy has got a set of threes who are really good carriers of the ball.
CR & FC have a formidable set of players, and have a lot to give. Their defense will be tested to the hilt. They have strong runners in the forwards and backs and are a very sophisticated kicking side. They will have to be smart about the ball in contact, and keep that fast-up defence in the face of the Kandy attack. CR & FC it is reliably learnt is working incredibly hard to prepare for a tough matchup against Kandy having upset CH & FC in the quarters.
An overseas referee Sam Jones (Australia) will handle the whistle.

ACMC requests Government
Dont introduce new mixed electoral system to PC, Parliamentary polls
The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) has asked the government not to introduce the new mixed electoral system to the Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections.
Today we have a situation where many councils cannot be established because of the new system, said Leader of the ACMC, Rishard Bathuideen addressing a media briefing yesterday at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
He added that the new system was introduced amidst intense objections put forward by his and other smaller parties.
This was introduced to benefit the two main parties and destroy the smaller parties so that they wont have to depend on them, said Bathuideen.
The inability to form councils in many areas had risen due to certain councils not being able to meet the 25 percent quota on women, They wanted a quota for women and now we cant form a council, observed an irate minister.
An analysis of the recent election results, however, revealed that the ACMC has in fact managed to significantly increase the number of seats won in the local government bodies they contested under the new system.
The party had increased their number of seats from 42 in 2011 to 166 members this year. Further, the party which contested under the United National Front in many of the areas, with Hassan Alis United Peace Front in Ampara and independently in Trincomalee, had also expanded their base to new areas such as Kandy, Kurunegala and Negombo.
Bathuideen however insisted that their opposition to the new system was not based on their partys achievements but for the overall betterment of the country,
It is true that we have done much better under the new system but electoral systems are supposed to be designed to help the country. The decisions taken by our leaders to support either themselves or their respective party has destroyed the country for the last 40 years, he explained.
When asked about his views on the current political crisis, Bathuideen said they would support a stable unity government which would stick by the January 8 2015 mandate.

EBONY LUSTER IN HIS PAINTINGS
African art has always inspired Swansea-based Sri Lankan artist, Britisher, Ricky Weerarackoon ever since he grabbed his brush to paint which he took up to after early retirement as a hobby and presently a thriving artist who is self-taught. A wide traveler, it was African art that caught his imagination. The gloss refulgence, shining surface of brilliance and the radiant beauty of the black skin of men and women was there to stay at his art.
Weerarackoon went to UK a teenager for studies and met up with his future wife at college, the beautiful Welsh Lynn Williams. After the completion of studies in London, he decided to settle down in Wales where Lynn's parents lived, Swansea.
South Wales has always remained beautiful with all her wide roads and pavements dotted with giant sprawling trees always in bloom during the seasons rural and fresh blowing in fragrances and an artist's paradise, removed from traffic and rush hours, speeding across busy towns, schools, high-rising buildings that the artist was used during his study time in London.
Gleams where he lives is so fresh and clean with their main Anglican Church, St. Peter's Cathedral a stone throw away with her regular worshippers who gather to venerate and pray to Jesus Christ and fellowship where the artist play a main role in raising sponsorship management for the distress. Infect, during the Tsunami is Sri Lanka, he collected and sent a container load of dry food, canned items and blankets along with generous funding cheque to SL Red Cross for the victims of Tsunami. The parishioners gladly responded. This was the human side of the artist who still loves his country. He is also a volunteer in the Cancer Hospital in Swansea; feed the hungry and homeless who are huddled in the open or around buildings at night, with soups and bread atleast three times a week. God-fearing, the church is his second how. The almost-beggars around his vicinity are his concern.
Apart from his fascination for the black skinned tall, slim figures, he adores the ocean. The sea in shades of aquamarine, frothy rising waves thrashing the helpless boats that are sent tossing in every direction. The flaming horizon, dark nights at times with intensity, achieved with what crashes in his mind to put on board. Despite his wonderful technique, he never appears to be a nature artist with so much greener, lush burgeon and blooming flowers over which butterflies sail from one to another or the droning bees, collecting honey to suck. It is an unusual approach to an artist who is a keen observer of nature around his home garden which he maintains.
His painting reveal the inner depth of an artist in search of a subject outside African art but still find at difficult to turn to nature painting when it is so abundantly around him. May be it is so when like in many post-Impressionists who could not step outside their chosen subjects. Ricky Weerachoon is true to form and his exhibits/collection prove where his art is focused.

EC to finalise female members to LG Councils this week
The Election Commission will finalize the number of female members elected to Local Government bodies from each party within this week, Additional Election Commissioner M. H. M. Mohammad said yesterday.
Accordingly, the numbers will be then forwarded to all the General Secretaries of respective political parties by the end of this week, he said.
The General Secretaries will then have to provide a list of their nominated members to the Election Commission on dates notified, he added.
When inquired on the issue relating to maintaining the female representation at 25 percent, Mohammad said it is a matter which should be resolved by the respective political parties.
We are here to inform them as to how many female members they should nominate. We will let them know how many members they will need to nominate to maintain the 25 percent female representation according to law. It is up to them to nominate the correct number of members, he said.
Meanwhile, a special party leaders' meeting was held on Monday which carried out an extensive discussion over the issues arisen in setting up the LG bodies, 25 percent female representation and appointing members to the Councils.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena said that there was no final decision arrived at the meeting with regard to the 25 percent female representation. However, several options were weighed down to form and function the LG Councils and abide by the law at the same time.
He said that Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya who took part in the meeting, explained the present issues related to maintaining the 25 percent female representation and finalizing the appointment of Council members.
Several possibilities and options to overcome these issues were discussed at the meeting, he said.
For example, there are instances where a political party is not bound to nominate any females whereas another party has to nominate a considerable number, Gunawardena said. Thus, several possibilities were discussed to overcome this issue to make sure it would be fair to everybody, he pointed out.

A comprehensive study has been accomplished in the publication of A critical study of the works of Fr. Jacome Gonsalves which is the Doctoral Thesis of Rev. Dr Anthony Fernandopulle presented to the University of London. Fr. Jacome Gonsalves is hailed as the Father of Sri Lankan Christian Literature. His contribution to religious literature is commendable.
Fr. Anthony Fernandopulle has highlighted the aspect of indigenization of Christianity in Sri Lanka through the remarkable literary works of Fr. Gonsalves.
He has presented his view in comparison to the missionary methods of the Portuguese missionaries. They have presented Christianity within the frame of European culture and they imposed it on the people living in their colonies.
Contrasting methods were employed by Fr. Gonsalves in his missionary activities. He has been and indigenized person in Sri Lanka. He, as a linguist and a scholar, grasped the native culture in its totality.
He studied vernacular languages with reference to their practical usage. He got the help of Buddhist monks in the Malwatta chapter in Kandy. Under them who had the authority in learning, Fr. Gonsalves has mastered the Sinhala Language, music and the dialect in all its aspects.
This Book contains a comprehensive view of the contribution of Fr. Gonsalves towards the indigenization of Christianity in Sri Lanka and the culture and languages in the island. It has six chapters such as The roots of Christianity in Sri Lanka; The Process of Indigenization; His contribution to the evolution of the Dramatic Tradition; Hymns and songs composed by Fr. Gonsalves; The Evolution of the Sinhala Language in the hands of Fr. Gonsalves; His Literary style and Polemical works.

How to stay solid amid irritation
Its a common thing to be frequently annoyed by other people  added to our regular interactions with family, friends and coworkers are the online habits of people on various social media, and they can all irritate the hell out of us.
What can we do when other people are being annoying, frustrating, inconsiderate, irritating, even aggravating
Well, assuming were not in real danger and we dont need to take action to protect ourselves  often the best practice is an internal shift rather than trying to change the other persons behavior.
That suggestion in itself can be frustrating for some  why should we have to change our own behavior when its the other person who is being aggravating
Thats because with one simple shift, you can be happy with any person. But if you try to change every other person, youre just going to be miserable.
This is illustrated by a metaphor from legendary Buddhist teacher Shantideva:
Where would there be leather enough to cover the entire world With just the leather of my sandals, it is as if the whole world were covered. Likewise, I am unable to restrain external phenomena, but I shall restrain my own mind. What need is there to restrain anything else
In this metaphor, imagine that the surface of the Earth were covered in shards of glass or some other sharp surface  you could try to find a covering for the whole world, so that you could walk in comfort  but youd never be able to do it. Instead, just cover your own feet, and you can walk around just fine.
This is the idea of shifting your own mindset, so that you can deal with irritating people.
Lets look at a practice to work on that shift.
A Simple Practice
Whenever you find yourself irritated by how someone else is behaving  first notice that your mind starts to create a story of resentment about them. Its about how they always act in this irritating way, or why do they have to be that way, or why are they so inconsiderate, etc.
This story isnt helpful. It makes you unhappy, it worsens your relationship with others, it makes you a person you probably dont want to be.
So the practice is to drop that story, and instead try this:
Recognize that you dont like the way the person is behaving. You are not happy with your current experience. In this way, you are rejecting this part of reality, rejecting a part of life. Consider opening up to all of life, without rejecting.
Reflect on a river that flows downstream  imagine wishing it would flow upstream. It would just bring you unhappiness to wish that the river were different than it were. Now imagine that this other person is the river. Wishing they were different just brings unhappiness.
See them as they are and open your heart to them, just as they are. See them as a suffering human being, with flaws and habitual ways of acting that can be irritating, but are actually very human. How can you love humanity just as it is
Open up to all of life, without rejecting. Accept the river as it is. See the suffering human being in front of you, and love them fiercely, as they are.
See how it shifts you. And see how it opens you up to connecting to your fellow human beings, and the vast experience of life, just as it is.

How we help machines  learn
By age 1, most babies do something that astonishes their parents: They say their first word. It means the child is developing language based on experience. Shes learning.
And while that first word is usually Mama or Dada, thats not because the baby wants to say thanks for changing all those diapers (sorry, Mom and Dad). The most frequent first words, which also include hi, baba (bottle) and dog, are those things babies hear most often in their first months of life. Parents label these items and then repeat those labels over and over until the child develops the muscle strength and knowledge to say the words themselves.
In many ways, repetition is how machines learn, too. Engineers train computers to recognize common patterns in mountains of data by exposing them to numerous variations of the same thing. After being shown thousands of photos of bank checks, for example, computers learn to recognize both printed and handwritten numbers, which allows us to deposit a check by taking a picture of it using a smartphone. In the same way that babies learn to say Mama and reach for their mothers when they want to be held, a computer learns to recognize images of printed numbers so it can identify bank accounts and handwritten numbers to determine a checks amount.
This process is called machine learning, and it is fundamental to artificial intelligence, or A.I. While A.I. is often seen as mysterious and complicated, in fact the way we teach computers to learn has a lot in common with the way human beings learn. Many A.I. principles are modeled on sciences understanding of how the human brain processes and categorizes information.
Today, A.I. is quietly embedded in our daily lives  many of us dont even realize its there. In addition to simplifying banking, A.I. enables our email to detect spam, our cars to brake automatically and our phones to respond to voice commands. When we interact with digital assistants like Alexa, were tapping A.I. Skin cancer can even be diagnosed earlier thanks to A.I.s learned memory of thousands of images of melanoma variations.
Still, weve only just begun to scratch the surface of A.I.s potential. Lets take a look at how A.I. is being used across industries today and where it may take us in the future.
Trevor Darrell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, explains that while there are core principles that human and machine learning share, there are also key differences.
The way biology learns is to have situations where thousands or millions of trials are just there for free in the environment, he says. If shown only a few examples of, say, scissors, youll have no problem telling me what other objects in your environment are that thing. Machines need thousands of labeled examples, both positive and negative.
One well-developed area of A.I. where this principle has been applied is computer vision, where machines recognize images in a photo (such as the aforementioned check) or a video. Image recognition is what enables Facebook to deliver content its users are interested in: If youve liked photos of your friends new puppy, Facebook will make sure you dont miss pics of that puppy in the future.
For visually impaired people, image recognition  plus computer-generated speech  can deliver much more. We launched a feature based on a computer vision algorithm that allows people who are visually impaired to go through their news feed and understand what photos consist of, says Joaquin Quionero Candela, the head of Facebooks Applied Machine Learning team, noting that the descriptions are read aloud automatically. They not only hear that somebody posted a photo, theyre told the photo shows three people in the park riding a bike. That greatly improves the Facebook experience for those users.
The breakthrough is the result of decades of work. Yann LeCun, chief scientist at Facebooks Artificial Intelligence Research lab (FAIR) and a founding director of New York Universitys Center for Data Science, was among those in the 1980s who recognized that programming a computer to make calculations based on quantifiable outcomes is much different than getting one to make a judgment call that isnt so straightforward.
We didnt know how to write a program that would interpret if an image had a cat, a dog, an airplane or a sailboat in it, LeCun says. To understand how to solve the problem, you have to think of an image the way a computer does, with each pixel defined by three numbers that correspond to its color and intensity.
To a computer, an image is just a table of numbers, LeCun explains. To teach the machine how to interpret that data, LeCun looked to humans. The brain learns based on how strong the links are between neurons  clusters of nerve cells that, when connected, become increasingly associated with a specific idea or physical entity. These are called neural networks. - New York Times

HSBC profits jump to $17.2 bn on Asia growth
HSBC has posted a pre-tax profit of $17.2bn (12.3bn) in 2017, saying its focus on Asia was driving growth.
The results represent a 141% jump on the $7.1bn profit of the previous year.
But that comparison is flattering, given 2016 saw the bank incur a string of one-off costs including the sale of its Brazil business.
Though well known on the British High Street, HSBC makes most of its money outside the UK, with Asia accounting for the bulk of global profits. And the bank said the prospect of regional Asian trade deals and lending linked to China's Belt and Road projects provided cause for optimism. A large increase in reported profit before tax reflected both a healthy business and the non-recurrence of significant items from 2016, said group chairman Mark Tucker. While an stark improvement on 2016's results, the profit is still lower than the $18.9bn reported in 2015.
HSBC, Europe's largest bank, has been focussing on a drive to streamline its business and slash costs.
Later this week, chief executive Stuart Gulliver will hand over the reins to current retail banking and wealth management head John Flint, after seven years at the helm.

IFFSA recognises LB Finance Educational CSR
Bridging the Gap the educational CSR project of Al-Salamah Islamic Finance Unit of LB Finance PLC which is one of the early pioneers of Islamic Financing in the Sri Lankan Non- Banking Financial sector, was recognized as one of the top three CSR projects in the entire South Asia at the recently concluded second Islamic Finance Forum for South Asia (IFFSA) Awards 2017 in Colombo.
The competitive IFFSA Awards, evaluated and assessed by a panel of independent judges of repute recognizes the contributions made by individuals and institutions to the Islamic Business and Finance (IBF) industry in the South Asian region was held at the conclusion of the IFFSA conference with the participation of delegates from five countries.
Considered to be as one of the flagship educational CSR initiatives of LB Finance PLC, Bridging the Gap is an ambitious programme funded from the charity fund of the Islamic Financing Unit of the company, focusing on uplifting the standard of educational knowledge amongst rural GCE Ordinary Level students in remote underprivileged schools plagued by sheer lack of basic educational facilities.
The programme which won the Bronze award in the Best CSR Project category, annually conducts a series of seminars for the Grade 11 students since 2013 to better equip and prepare themselves to successfully face the GCE Ordinary Level Examination.
These seminars which has benefited over 3,000 students so far are conducted in carefully selected remote rural areas which lack even the basic required number of school teachers to disseminate knowledge, a prerequisite in acquiring and gaining knowledge.
We are extremely pleased with this international Islamic Finance award received in recognition of our steadfast commitment to alleviate the inequality of educational facilities that exist between rural, remote schools and urban, semi urban schools. Lack of teachers deprive the right to equal opportunity to learn and create a significant knowledge gap between students of same age in different parts of the country, which becomes critical at the GCE OL examination, the stepping stone to pursue a students higher educational goals in life, said Managing Director of LB Finance PLC, Sumith Adihetty.
LB Finance became one of the pioneers in the Islamic financing in the Non-Banking Financial sector when they established Al-Salamah Islamic Finance Unit in 2010 offering financial services conforming to all the guidelines and requirements stipulated by the Islamic law.
LB Al-Salamah went on to be awarded as the best emerging Islamic Finance Window of the year in 2012 at the first SLIBFI Awards, and offers a wide range of personalized products and services including Mudarabah fixed and savings deposits, Wakala term investments, Ijarah leasing facilities and Murabaha trade financing.
Today LB Al-Salamah is considered to be one of the leading Islamic Finance Windows in the Sri Lankan Non-Banking Financial sector.

Iranian plane wreckage found in Zagros mountains
IRAN: Iranian search teams found the wreckage on Tuesday of a plane that went missing in the Zagros mountains two days earlier with 66 people on board, a spokesman said.
Aseman Airlines flight EP3704 disappeared in the Zagros range on Sunday morning, around 45 minutes after taking off from Tehran.
After two days of heavy snow and fog, the weather finally cleared on Tuesday morning, giving helicopter teams much better visibility.
The Revolutionary Guards helicopters this morning found the wreckage of the plane on Dena mountain, spokesman Ramezan Sharif told state broadcaster IRIB.
An IRIB reporter who spoke to one of the pilots said he had seen scattered bodies around the plane and that it was located in Noghol village, around 4,000 metres (13,000 feet) up Dena mountain.
Since yesterday the Guards drones started carefully identifying the geographical area where the plane had probably crashed and this morning two helicopters of the air forces were dispatched to the location, Sharif said. Snowmobiles were deployed earlier on the 4,409-metre (14,465-foot) peak, where more than 100 mountaineers have also been aiding the search.
Last night, a number of people stayed on the mountain and through coordination with local guides managed to search all crevices, Mansour Shishefuroosh, head of a regional crisis centre, told the ISNA news agency.
Some 500 images taken by drones were being analysed overnight, he added.
The ATR-72 twin-engine plane, in service since 1993, flew early Sunday from Mehrabad airport towards the city of Yasuj, some 500 kilometres (300 miles) to the south.
Poor visibility meant some 60 helicopter sorties on Monday could find no trace of the plane. A team of crash investigators from French air safety agency BEA were also due to arrive in Iran on Monday, but their arrival had not yet been confirmed. The incident has reawakened concerns over aviation safety in Iran, which has been exacerbated by international sanctions over the years. - AFP

The Government of Japan granted 449 TV programs, worth 52.6 million Japanese Yen (approximately Rs.73.6 million) to the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation to enhance awareness of Japanese culture, value and lifestyle among Sri Lankan viewers.
The Government of Japan also granted Rs. 42.7 million to cover part of the cost for dubbing Japanese programs into Sinhalese and Tamil, producing of trailers and crawlers as well as allocating airtime for them. The Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka hopes that the programs would promote understanding of Japan among Sri Lankan people and thereby contribute to deepening ties between Japan and Sri Lanka further.

A set of proposals jointly signed by the Government Medical Officers' Association, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association and the Parents' Union of State Medical Students was handed over to the President yesterday at 10.30 am at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the document handed over to the President stresses the importance of not violating the basic rules, regulations and fundamentals of medical education in Sri Lanka. The solution proposed through the document enables all SAITM students to obtain the registration of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and practice as legal doctors in Sri Lanka without problems.
According to the proposals, all SAITM students should be given an MBBS that would enable them to get themselves registered with the SLMC. The MBBS should be an already existing, recognized one and not a newly created one after the passing out of the SAITM students, he said.
The document states that a majority had proposed the MBBS offered by Kotelawala Defence University for all qualified and willing SAITM students while all other SAITM students can obtain the MBBS from the Nizhni Novgorod University in Russia or any other foreign University recognized by the SLMC.
The Russian university was mentioned by the SAITM owner in order to mislead SAITM students when he recruited them to the SAITM, he added.

Making peace with  problems
The world is full frailties and Head Boy of Gateway Yeran Karunanayake knows that compassion can make the difference. Yet he also understands that compassion itself will not create positive change unless proper leadership is given. Perfect Prefects features Karunanayake who feels the need to get organized and get a team together.
The first step towards getting organized is diplomacy. You cant show attitude to people and get things done. You need to get them on to your side. You need to have a winning personality and for that, you need to work on your personality.
Simple accomplishments
One thing I have learnt in my tenure as Head Boy of Gateway is the importance of being diplomatic. In other words, you need to be a people person. Because different people behave in different ways and something you might say or do to some person, might rub another person in the wrong direction. Understanding how people tick and how to get someone on to your side is part of being a leader. As a head prefect, you dont need to be haughty or arrogant. Youll be amazed at what can be accomplished simply by being nice to people.
If you see something wrong you should be able to tackle it in a diplomatic way by being tactful, so your relationship with the person will not be tarnished. Bossing them around can actually work against you. That and leading by example are two of the most important characteristics when becoming a leader, said Karunanayake.
When encountering a problem you need the proper mentality. You need to think the right way. You need the correct attitude.
When you have a problem you shouldnt get stressed out. You need to understand that there is always a solution to every problem. If you tackle a problem with that mentality you are sure to come up with a solution. If you worry, fret and think too much about the issue then it will work against you. So you should have a positive and optimistic attitude. Then you should also be determined. If there is a problem you need to tackle it head-on. You cannot shy away from it, you need to meet it head-on, stated Karunanayake.
Ideology of hope
Karunanayake has with him the team  his Prefect Guild. They are a group of young people who believe in action.
When dealing with issues in life you need to be positive and optimistic, and one thing about our Prefects Guild is, we believe we can bring about positive change. This is not only in our school but outside. We do a lot of projects like a flood donation campaign. We try and install solar panels in houses that do not have electricity. So we try and come up with a collective solution. That itself promotes the ideology of there being hope. So definitely I feel hope is greater and stronger than fear, pointed out Karunanayake.
Karunanayake believes in speaking his mind. He is straightforward and does not fear the consequences. He is spontaneous and bold.
Being courageous also involves having an optimistic attitude. You need to tackle every problem head-on. You dont shy away from anything and you do not shy away from anyone. If there is someone you have to talk against, you have to do it, and you have to speak your mind at that moment without thinking about it. Because I feel that one mistake we make, is we do not speak our minds at that moment, so we shy away from facing the consequences. Being courageous is calling stuff as we see it, explained Karunanayake.
Working with people
Being intelligent is also being diplomatic says Karunanayake. He knows that each situation varies in its own context. Knowing how to handle each situation is being intelligent. Being intelligent is not only being good in your studies, it is understanding how life works, how the world works and how people work.
I am studying Math, Physics and Economics. But I am more towards the field of physics so I will probably take up environmental engineering. These goals are there because again I want to bring a positive change in this world. I am very serious about trying to bring a positive change in this world. I feel that this is my calling. I want to be a humanitarian and the projects I mentioned before done by myself and my Prefects Guild are also humanitarian projects, shared Karunanayake.
Thinking about others is a value that Karunanayake prizes. This is vital for positive change.
I speak very genuinely when I say that I want to help other people. Some time ago, I thought that one person cannot change this world, purely because the attitudes of people today are very self-centred. But over the years my ideas changed and I became more positive and optimistic and more defiant. Now I believe that one person can make a change, you just need to surround yourself with the right people. No one can bring change on their own, there will always be people who will want to support you. You are not alone in this world at all when trying to make a positive change. We tend to look away from those who are suffering. Some people actually need help even though there are some fakes, emphasizes Karunanayake
Global Warming, Sexual Abuse, Domestic Abuse and Animal Abuse affect him. An animal lover he feels for animals as well. It is no secret that there has been a flood of emails from animal organizations highlighting the terrible abuses and cruelties of animals.
There is so much of animal abuse in this world. I have seen graphic images of pets being abused. I have seen dogs beaten up and it goes on and on. Why would they have pets if they are doing this There is definitely a lack of compassion in this world when it comes to animals, said Karunanayake.
Plight and despair
One only needs to travel by bus in Colombo to hear the sad tales recounted by people who get into the buses. They speak of their plight and despair, tales about their nightmarish lives.
Some parents try to shield their kids from the harsh realities of life outside. So they live in their little bubble, and they dont know what is actually happening. International school children rarely go on the bus. Some of them do not understand what goes around. They do not open their eyes. Unless it happens to you, you will not understand. When it happens to you then you will have that compassion, said Karunanayake
Karunanayake pointed out that the education system at Gateway is incredible. They follow the British Curriculum which he sees as a plus point. The education and the understanding is great. And their teachers make a big difference. Karunanayakes hero is his father and he feels that one reason the youth go wrong is because they surround themselves with the wrong people.
He has been part of the Model United Nations and was the Finance Director for the Interact Club, as well as being the President of the History Society. He has done a little bit of Athletics and is the Vice Captain of the Basket Ball team.
My family and my school have been very supportive of me. They have encouraged me to become a more balanced person excelling academically and also in extra-curricular activities. The values and ideologies I possess have been inculcated in me by my family. When I thanked them at the speech I made as Head Prefect, that was a very emotional moment for me. They mean the whole world to me because of everything that they have done for me, summed up Karunanayake.

Mathodam marvel of yore
There are so many legends about Mathodam. Some interpret it as a big port. It is said that there were ancient settlements in Mathota. Some say that the word Mathota is derived from a Sinhala word. According to them, the ancient king Mahathuvoda worshipped at that place, therefore, it came to be known as Mathodam. Most people refer to this place as Manthai. In ancient Tamil Sanga literature, Kurunthokai mentions Manthai as Mathodam. Whatever it is, Mathodam was considered as a big seaport. During the South Indian kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandya periods, Lanka was under the rule of King Vijaya.
During that time India and Sri Lanka had very close trade ties. Historical evidence proves that aborigines of Sri Lanka had trade links worldwide through the ancient Mathodam harbour. In the 6th century AD, the first Lankan king married a Pandya princess and she first landed at this port Mathodam. Even so much historical evidence clearly reveals that numerous trade activities took place between the countries such as Greece, China, Rome and Arabia.
Hence it is understood that Greeks, Chinese, Romans and were involved in the active trade activities at Mathodam port. In other words, it was said that once this place flourished as an international trade centre. Mathota was also called Mantotam, or by the name Maha Thota. The great Saiva Saints Thirugnasampanther and Sunderamoorthy Nayanar also sang beautiful Saiva hymns (Thevarams) on Mathodam. There is evidence to the effect that famed Arunakiri Nathar worshipped this temple in the 15th century AD and composed beautiful songs on Thiruketheeswaram.
Even Mahavamsa and Rajavali, also mentioned about Mathodam. Another historical fact propagates that the second wife of Lankan king Vijaya, the Pandya princess along with her associates landed at Mathoda. According to historical evidence, the Pandya soldiers landed at Mhathertham.
Historical evidence reveals that during the rule of Ellalan of Tamil land he was involved in a confrontation with King Thudakaimunu of Lanka and the Ellalans battalion landed at Mathodam with 3, 000 troops from India. According to W S Poku, a historian, Arabians landed at Mathodam with a view to do trade, in the North West of Thiruketheeswaram. There is a particular variety of tree named Perku seen at this site. These trees could not be seen anywhere else in the country. According to W.S. Poku, this particular tree was cultivated by Arabian traders to feed camels.
Even so, many alien coins especially Romanian coins, Dutch coins and some of the ancient Jaffna coins were also found at Mathodam. All these clearly indicate that Thiruketheeswaram was once was flourishing as one of the most important commercial centres of the world.
Further, it was said that during the Great Chola King Rajaraja Cholan named this temple as Rajaraja-Iswaram because it was a magnificent temple which stood majestically and decorated with beautiful Dravidian architecture and sculptures. According to historical evidence, Rajaraja Cholans son Rajendra Cholan in A.D.1028 captured Lanka and named the temple as Rajaraja-Iswaram. It further states that during that period the extent of the area was nearly ten miles. But today the original Thiruketheeswaram temple area could be found near the present Thiruketheeswaram in ruins.
It is interesting to mention that near the Thiruchenthur temple in India a seaport area called Kulasekara Padanam existed. At that port Kulasekara Padanam import and export business took place. It was said that the location of Mathodam seaport was just opposite this ancient port. Saint Sundar at one place in his famed Thiruketheeswaram Thirupathikam said Vangammalikenra Kadal Mathodam and again in another hymn, he says Vaiyammalikenrakadal Mahthoda Nannakar.
Even during the 3rd century B.C, commodity exchange trade took place at Mathoda port. In the 5th century BC, evidence reveals that Mahthodam became one of the world famous seaports. So many nationalities were involved in the trading businesses at Mathodam. Romans, Egyptians, Greeks, Chinese, Arabians and Tamils were involved in the commodity exchange trade business. Precious stones, conch, ivory, tortoise shells, elephants, monkeys and peacocks were exported from Mathoda port. Expensive utensils such as clay pots, sandalwood, silk, wool, black pepper and horses were imported from other countries.
The marine trade activities started declining in the 6thcentury A.D, due to the introduction of currency. The barter system declined gradually. However, marine trade took place until the 12th century AD. At the end of the 13th century AD, the sea trade activities declined slowly. However, the decline of marine trade activities did not affect the influx of pilgrims to the Thiruketheeswaram temple. Due to the fall in sea trade, the overall economy was affected. Even the ancient seaport Mathodam lost all its glory and the century-old prosperity and popularity.
In 1545 A.D. the sea engulfed certain portions of the Mathodam city. Despite such problems poojas at Thiruketheeswaram temple took place daily till 1585. Then the Portuguese invaded the temple and looted all the valuables including the idols, golden ornaments and sculptures.
When the local people came to know that the Portuguese were planning to loot the temple, they removed the valuables including the Sri Sounthari Aman statute and smuggled them to Anuradhapura. On their way to Anuradhapura, while crossing the Madu Matha temple they installed the Sri Sounthari Amman idol and built a small temple there. Till today daily poojas are performed to the Sri Sounthari Aman idol. It is believed that Amman Vikeramam (idol) is the Amman idol of Thiruketheeswaram.
The Portuguese not only looted the valuables but also destroyed the temple including the parapet wall and the majestic Rajakopuram. They took away the granite and built the Mannarharbour. With the passage of time, the whole temple was covered with sand. Later the entire area was gradually covered with thick jungle.
Mathodam and Thiruketheeswaram faced a vast destruction in the 16th century A.D. Till the 19th century A.D. Sri Lankan Saiva devotees and the entire Saiva world didnt hear anything much about the Thiruketheeswaram and its glories.

MIT Cargo extends reassurance  to inhabitants of Giribawa
Touching the lives of people through care and concern towards the wellbeing of the society at large is the pledge that has been made by MIT Cargo as the companys foremost vision as a socially responsible corporate entity.
Giribawa, a little village situated in the outskirts of Kurunegala district was selected by MIT Cargo for their CSR Projects in 2009.
Since then the town of Giribawa has felt the kindness, acts of generosity and friendship of MIT. CSR initiatives are annually projected towards meeting the needs of facilities in schools and families that require extra support. A few completed past projects includeda special unit to improve the English language, a laboratory facility, a training center for differently-abled children, computer units, stationery items and shoes for students.
This year the team has accumulated funds to complete two houses which had come to a construction standstill due to financial limitations.
The team is not only being socially responsible towards these people but also aspire to give back to the surrounding area  Mother Nature. The Go Green Team that drives this projectbelieves in saving every little green entity around us.
This project too is driven with passion to preserve and replenish theenvironment that is sadly being polluted due to industrial activities. A tree distribution at nursery schools is conducted annually in Giribawa. This year too, the team distributed 525 fruit plants. The number of plants to be distributed is derived by considering the number of containers, volume (kgs) movement and thereby determining the level of pollution that is caused to the environment. A total of 1650 fruit plants have been distributed over the years.
MIT is proud of the longstanding friendship that was built with the people of Giribawa and the young generation of MIT is encouraged to become more involved and in turn, blend with nature and humanity alike.

Most Americans say Trump, Congress not doing enough to stop mass shootings, Post-ABC poll finds
More than 6 in 10 Americans fault Congress and President Trump for not doing enough to prevent mass shootings, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, with most Americans continuing to say these incidents are more reflective of problems identifying and addressing mental health issues than inadequate gun laws.
In the poll conducted after a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high school last week, more than three-quarters, 77 percent, said they think more effective mental health screening and treatment could have prevented the shooting.
The Post-ABC poll also finds that 58 percent of adults say stricter gun control laws could have prevented the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, but there is no rise in support for banning assault weapons compared with two years ago and the partisan divide on this policy is as stark as ever. On the issue of whether allowing teachers to carry guns could have deterred the rampage, a proposal Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said is an option for schools, 42 percent said they agreed.
While the poll illustrates the differences in the country over how to respond to gun violence, it also highlights the intense frustration with the lack of any policy response coming out of Washington despite a series of horrific shootings in recent years.
In a sign that this pressure may be weighing on President Trump, the White House announced Monday that he is supportive of efforts in Congress to improve background checks for gun purchases.
A 77 percent majority says Congress is not doing enough to prevent mass shootings and 62 percent say the same of Trump, according to the poll. At least half feel strongly that Congress and the president have not taken adequate action. Majorities across party lines express frustration with Congress, while views of Trump are more divided. More than 8 in 10 Democrats and two-thirds of independents say the president is not doing enough. More than 6 in 10 Republicans say Trump is taking sufficient action to prevent mass shootings, although more than one-quarter of fellow partisans, 28 percent, say he is not.
Any legislative or policy response to the Florida school shooting is expected to be limited  neither Trump nor Republican leaders in Congress have, for instance, shown support for proposals to restrict sales of military-style assault rifles. A similar proposal was pushed by President Barack Obama and Democratic congressional leaders in 2013 but failed to advance through Congress following the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.
The debate over what Congress and the president should do in response to mass shootings is once again confronting Washington after Nikolas Cruz, 19, allegedly killed 17 people at his former high school Wednesday, with authorities charging that he aimed his AR-15 assault-style rifle and fired round after round into classroom after classroom in one of the nations worst school shootings.
The use of high-powered semiautomatic rifles in recent mass shootings, including by Cruz, police say, and in last years killing of 58 concertgoers in Las Vegas, has sparked calls to reinstate the 10-year ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004. But Americans are roughly split on this proposal, with 50 percent in support and 46 percent opposed, a stark contrast from the 80 percent support for the ban in 1994, the year it was enacted. The current level of support is little different from 51 percent in 2016. The falloff in support for restricting assault weapons has come from all partisan groups, but has been starkest among Republicans and independents. While more than 7 in 10 Republicans and independents supported banning assault weapons in 1999, the new Post-ABC poll finds 45 percent of independents supporting it now, dropping to 29 percent among Republicans. A 71 percent majority of Democrats support such a ban. There is also a strong partisan divide on whether stricter gun control laws could have prevented last weeks Florida shooting, closely mirroring support for such restrictions. Fully 86 percent of Democrats say stricter laws could have prevented the killings, compared with 29 percent of Republicans. Independents are squarely in between, with 57 percent saying stricter gun laws could have prevented the attack.
The killings in Florida have also revived the debate over whether teachers should be allowed to carry guns in schools  an idea DeVos, while careful not to outright endorse it, said in an interview last week with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt should be part of the broader, more robust conversation about how can we avoid these things in the future.
Partisans disagree on whether allowing teachers to be armed could have stopped the attack, with 59 percent of Republicans saying it could, compared with 46 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats.
Parents of school-age children differ somewhat on this question. A slight 51 percent majority of parents with children under 18 who live at home say the Florida shooting could have been prevented if teachers were able to carry firearms, compared with 38 percent of Americans without young children. There is a smaller parental divide in support for banning assault weapons, a policy backed by 46 percent of parents and 51 percent of non-parents.
Americans are more unified in saying improved mental health screening and treatment could have prevented Floridas attack, with more than three-quarters of Democrats, Republicans and independents in agreement on this question.
Asked about mass shootings more broadly, the public says by a roughly 2 to 1 margin that they reflect problems identifying and treating people with mental health problems rather than inadequate gun control laws. Fully 8 in 10 Republicans say mass shootings are mainly reflective of problems dealing with mental health issues, as do more than 6 in 10 independents. A slight majority of Democrats, 52 percent, say they mainly reflect inadequate gun laws.
The Post-ABC poll was conducted February, 15-18 among a random sample of 808 adults reached on cell and landline phones with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

## Title: MULTILINGUALISM AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, February 21, 2018 - 01:00
MULTILINGUALISM AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
As a Sri Lankan, I feel happy to be in Bangladesh on the UNESCO Mother Language Day for two simple reasons. Firstly, I belong to the ethnic group known as the Sinhalese who trace their origins to your land which was then called Vanga. Vanga is the name used in Pali chronicles written in the fifth century ACE.
The Sinhalese call themselves Sinhala because they believe that they descend from a prince named Vijaya who was the grandson of a lion, sinha, who roamed the jungles of Vanga. Hence the symbol of the lion in our national flag.
Vanga has been identified as the land that covers the modern state of West Bengal and modern Bangladesh. In the distant past, Vanga was not a part of Bharat (India). It was an independent kingdom which was not included among the sixteen maha-janapadas (great states) mentioned in Buddhist literature. I have a feeling that Bengal was made a part and parcel of India by the East India Company of England in the mid-18th century.
Pre-Christian era
East Bengal region, present-day Bangladesh writes Prof. Afia Dil, is an ancient land historically known as Bang (Vang) as part of the vast delta of the river Padma open to tidal waves from the bay and people used to build al (a ridge for protecting against floods) and thus the area came to be known as Bang-al. In the pre-Christian era Rig Veda, the name appears as Vanga. It was during the British period in the mid-18th century that it came to be spelled as Bengal. It was known along with Babylon, Egypt and China as an area rich in cross-cultural heritage and inter-cultural contacts by land and sea routes. It is an historical fact that in ancient times the region was not looked upon as part of the so-called Bharat (India) but more a part of Eastern Asia. (Bengali Nursery Rhymes, p. 12)
So today, I am happy to be back in my ancestral land, Vanga, to see my distant relatives.
Secondly, as a child I used to sing a Sinhala folk song that has a reference to a country called Bangalade:se: which I think is our name for your country even before you began to call your country, Bangladesh. The folk song is a dialogue composed of two questions and two answers. The first question and answer run thus in Sinhala:
Olinda tibenne: koykoyde:se
Olinda tibenne: bangalide:se.
(Where do you find liquorice
"Liquorice is found in bangalide:se:
The second question and answer run thus:
Genathhadanne: koykoyde:se
Genathhadanne: Sinhala de:se:
(Where do you plant liquorice
"It is planted in sinhalade:se:)
This folk song refers to a kind of seed known as liquorice, olinda. One wants to find out where olinda grows. He is told that olinda grows in Bangla-desh.
Then he is asked where it will be planted He is told that it will be planted in Sinhala-de:se, the land of the Sinhalese.
I am at a loss to understand the precise meaning of this dialogue. It implies that liquorice grows in abundance in Bangali-de:se, and that it will be brought from there and planted in Sinhala-de:se. What matters is that it refers to a land (de:se) called Bangli,Bangla-de:sh. It also refers to a land called Sinhala-de:se, the land of the Sinhala. Sri Lanka has been called Sinhala dvipa (Island of the Sinhalese) in the past. So this is a folk poem that links our two lands.
Liquorice, sometimes called Indian liquorice, (Abrusprecatorius) is a creeper that bears a red coloured seed that is used in a folk game known as olindakeliya, which was once very popular among women of the royalty. Fifty-six seeds are used in this game which is played on a wooden board that has 14 holes in two rows (seven in each row). These seeds were also used as the smallest of jewellers weights. Was there any kind of game in Bangladesh using liquorice
Today we are here on a mission: to share our experience as two multilingual nation-states in achieving a common goal: national development. We meet here on a day of special significance, the UNESCO Mother Language Day, a day that gave birth to a new nation, Bangladesh.
In this paper, I will focus my attention on four main themes: language as the most distinctive feature of the human race, language as a symbol of ethnic identity, multilingualism, and finally, national development.
Language as the most distinctive feature of mankind
Language is the most distinctive feature of the human race. Language is not a thing but a competence that every average human being possesses. It is a unique competence that gives the speaker a competence to create a novel sentence when he needs one to express his thoughts.
Man discovered this linguistic competence many millennia ago. The discovery of language is one of the three most important revolutions in the history of mankind. The first was the discovery of symbols, that is, the use of something for something else. It paved the way for the discovery of language because language is nothing but a set of arbitrary symbols. Thirdly, man discovered another set of symbols to stand for the sounds used in language, so that he could take language beyond time and space.
Language gave man a tool that no other living being possesses, making him unique in the animal world. It is the most crucial line that divides man and animal. Language made man the founder of human civilization and culture.
However, we are born without a language. We all cry, scream and yell but we cannot speak. Though we cannot speak, we have the physical and mental capacity to learn to speak. As the infant is fed by its mother, day in and day out, the infant begins to imitate the sounds produced by its mother. The mother and the infant begin to communicate with each other in language. This language is thus called the mother tongue in English. In Sinhala, the mother tongue is called mavubasa or ma:trubha:sha:.
The mother tongue that every human being learns first is also called his first language. All other languages that a man acquires later are collectively called second languages. The mother language becomes ones most powerful and efficient medium of communication. Sometimes ones mother tongue is referred to as the language of his or her heart (hadabasa).
Language as a symbol of ethnic identity
Secondly, the mother language becomes an important symbol of ethnic identity. Neither blood nor physiological features help in the identification of ethnicity. I call myself a Sinhalese, not because of my blood or my facial features, but because Sinhala happened to be my mother tongue. If my mother was Tamil by ethnicity, I would have learnt Tamil as my mother tongue and I would think of myself as a Tamil.
The mother language, being the most crucial symbol of ethnic identity, gives members of that community a sense of pride and self-respect. As a result, any attempt to harm, belittle or disparage the mother language is considered an act of treachery and disrespect. The mother language thus becomes not only the most powerful medium of communication but also a symbol of ethnic identity.
Modern history tells us of multilingual nations that ran into conflict, disharmony and war because of their language policy. Sri Lanka and Pakistan are two classic examples of this unfortunate episode.
Multilingualism
Multilingualism is an English word that has origins in Latin: multi meaning many, lingua meaning tongue or language, and ism meaning the state. Thus, multilingualism denotes the state of having more than one language in use. On the basis of the number of languages in use, English has created the following set of words: monolingual meaning of one language, bilingual meaning of two languages, trilingual meaning of three languages and multilingual meaning of many languages.
Prof. David Crystal, in his book How Language Works (Penguin Books, 2008) has devoted an entire chapter on How Multilingualism Works (Chapter 63) where he says that multilingualism is the normal human condition. It is a principle which often takes people by surprise. If you have lived your whole life in a monolingual environment, you could easily come to believe that this is the regular way of life around the world, and that people who speak more than one language are the exceptions. Exactly the reverse is the case (p. 409)
He continues, Speaking two or more languages is the natural way of life for three-quarters of the human race. There are no official statistics, but with over 6,000 languages co-existing in fewer than 200 countries, it is obvious that an enormous amount of language contact must be taking place; and the inevitable result of languages in contact is multilingualism, which is most commonly found in an individual speaker as bilingualism (p.409)
Multilingual societies, in general, use three kinds of language: first languages, second languages and foreign languages. First languages are the mother languages that one learns first. Second languages are those languages that are learnt after acquiring the first language. In most countries in Asia, English is the most common second language. Thirdly, there are foreign languages, that is, languages that are learnt along with second languages.
A foreign language observes Crystal, in this more restricted sense, is a non-native language taught in school that has no status as a routine medium of communication in that country. A second language is a non-native language that is widely used for purposes of communication, usually as a medium of education, government, or business. (p.431).
In Sri Lanka, Sinhala and Tamil are first languages: Sinhala used by the Sinhalese, and Tamil used by the Tamils and the Muslims. English is taught as a second language while French, German and Japanese are taught as foreign languages.

Munchee Super Cream Crackers  ranked among top
Statistical data from market research shows that Munchee Super Cream Cracker has become the countrys most popular biscuit surpassing other biscuit varieties. About 23% of the local biscuit market is taken up by the cracker category, out of which Munchee Super Cream Cracker claims to a significant 70% share of the cracker market. Studies have further revealed that at any given minute, around 4000 Munchee Super Cream Crackers are consumed across the country.
As a market leader in Sri Lanka, Munchee played a major role in popularizing and repositioning the image of cream crackers in the market. This was achieved through the companys pioneering campaign Podi Badaginnata Super, which redefined the crackers image from being a nutritional supplement for the sick to an all time snack enjoyed by all age groups. Moreover, Munchee incorporated cutting edge technology and machinery to introduce a cracker with seven layers, preserving air pockets on both sides. The extra layers and air pockets give the Super Cream Cracker its extra crunchiness, making every bite a truly delightful experience.
The Super in the Munchees Super Cream Cracker portrays the crackers healthy aspects as it does not contain sugar, colours or preservatives. The cracker is also enriched with essential vitamins and minerals, including Vitamins A, B1, B4, B5, B6, B12, D, E, and K1 in addition to folic acid.
Munchee uses best industry practices and strict quality guidelines when it comes to manufacturing & sourcing the best ingredients. This has made Munchee Super Cream Cracker to earn the Super Fine quality, elevating the brand to the top international standards and extend its global footprint across 55 countries. Munchee Super Cream Cracker is also served as a special in-flight snack in some of the prestigious global airlines including the American Airlines.
Being the first cracker brand in the country to win SLS certification (SLS 251 standard), Munchee Super Cream Cracker has been awarded several certifications such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 22000 in addition to FDA international certification. Munchee is also the only South Asian biscuit manufacturer to win the globally acclaimed BRC certification twice, including the recently won BRCs AA certification which was awarded by Mr. Joachim Schulz, Global Product Manager of International Featured Standards (IFS). The British Retail Consortium (BRC), a globally acclaimed leading brand and consumer protection organization, offers certifications to 130 countries assuring that a product is safe, legal and of high quality, and only Munchee biscuits have been awarded this prestigious recognition.
A recent survey conducted by the Survey Research Lanka revealed that consumers are drawn to Munchee Super Cream Cracker because of its freshness, crispiness, good taste and nutritional values.

Navy-Havies game evenly poised
It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when Navy SC lock horns with their arch rivals Havelocks Sports Club in the semi final of the Dialog A Division inter club knock out rugby tournament at Race Course grounds in Colombo today. kick off will be at 4.00 pm.
Going by how the two teams faired this season, both teams have a definite chance of pulling this game through and this makes the event a thrilling tussle.
In this years just concluded league rugby tournament Navy won the first leg
by beating the Havies at Welisara. But it was the Park Club which won the second leg by 16 points to 11 played at Havelock Park. The lads from Welisara were really fortunate and just managed to beat the gallant Shamly Nawazs fighting Police SC by 43-36 in their quarter final clash played at Race Course grounds last week after a close game.
Adding to the woes for Navy would be the absence of their two key players in captain cum flanker Danushka Gerthe Perera and winger Supun Dilshan from todays semi final due to reasons best known to them.
However the Sailors will have a huge advantage when it comes to the two hookers, where in form Dulanjana Wijesinghe will strike it very much faster
and will be the man to watch in the lose play than the Havies hooker Shameer Fajudeen.
Mean while the Park Club boys who won their semi finals with Army Sports Club last week, have the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in todays game as well along with their speedy three quarter line spearheaded by their play maker former Peterite vice captain and the present national centre Nishone Perera manage to deliver the goods, then it will be a daunting task for the Navy team to counter attack to make a much needed victory to get in to the all important finals.
Navy won this tournament last under the captainsy of Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksa way back in 2014.

NEC to accelerate economic reforms
The National Economic Council (NEC) will introduce an accelerated programme to strengthen the national economy by introducing the necessary reforms in economic management in the country next week.
This decision was reached when the National Economic Council met at the Presidential Secretariat under President Maithripala Sirisenas patronage yesterday.
The NEC members had discussed at length the immediate reforms needed in the economic management in the country and steps that should be taken on a short, medium and long term basis, according to a statement issued by the Presidents media unit.
President Sirisena established the National Economic Council (NEC) last year with the aim of strengthening the national economy.
The main responsibility of the NEC is to take decisions on the national economy with prominence given to local agriculture and industries.
Advising and issuing guidelines on strategically important policies, agreements, and projects that are directly relevant to the countrys economic development also come under the Councils purview.

Needed, a fresh start
Finally it appears sanity has prevailed and the political uncertainty that griped the country for an entire week has been resolved though the aftershocks are bound to remain for sometime to come. The political tug of war left the country in suspense for one whole week and almost paralyzed the state apparatus. It should be the responsibility of all actors therefore to prevent this lingering uncertainty that is still hanging like a pall over the countrys political firmament and help usher in normalcy that will enable the administration to focus its undivided attention to the affairs of state.
Already, things are in a state of drift, the political gridlock taking a heavy toll on the day-to-day administration, with reports that even the salaries of government servants and pension payments have been delayed, paving the way for another crisis of major proportions.
It is in this backdrop that the Mahanayakes and the Catholic and Christian leaders have come out with fervent appeals to all concerned to help the President steer the ship of state without placing obstacles in his path.
Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, the Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera, in a letter, has cautioned the President and Prime Minister that the deadlock the country has fallen into following the local government elections may lead to the collapse of the economy and the public administration system. Addressing a media conference at Bishops House Colombo, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said; Every citizen in the country is of the view that political groups should stop bickering for power. His Eminence stressed that leaders of all political parties should put the people and country before all other things. Bishop of the Methodist Church Sri Lanka Rev. Asiri Perera, issuing a statement says; It is our understanding that our beloved motherland has been plunged into a grave situation due to political uncertainty.
This was a situation that could have been easily averted had the SLFP members of the Unity Government did not act precipitately, following the LG elections. After all, it was only a mini-election confined to the grassroots administration, and, as Minister Navin Dissanayake pointed out, in most democracies mid-term elections are unfavourable to the governments in power. In the United States, mid-term polls are almost always won by the other side. The result has never had any impact on the US administration and it is business as usual. Hence, it is unclear as to why the SLFP segment of the Unity Government threatened to quit and called for the resignation of the Prime Minister. This, after faring infinitely worse than the UNP at the LG poll. Was it to deflect from this humiliation, or, was it to make the PM the scapegoat
Now, with the reversion to the status quo, it is incumbent on both parties in the alliance to work in unison to dispel all vestiges of uncertainty. The government can function unhindered for another two and half years (till August 2020) and there should not be any bickering, or, further attempts to undermine the authority of the PM, as was the norm before. Both sides have called for radical changes in the direction of the government and this could be worked out amicably without resorting to criticism and name calling.
True, there is a huge gulf between the policies of the UNP and the SLFP, the former favouring a market oriented economy, private enterprise and connectivity with the outside world, while the latter more oriented towards an indigenous outlook and reliance on a state guided economy. There is therefore bound to be continual clashes over policy. The President should intervene at such times and decide on the best course for the country by consulting experts. Above all the open displays of disunity should be avoided at all cost.
It is these open clashes on economic policy that sent a wrong message to the voters at the LG elections, where a sense of drift was observed in government.
Be that as it may, the Joint Opposition is attempting to substitute the outcome of the LG election results to parliament. Its spokesmen are once again calling for the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition on the basis that the Unity Government is no more. However, with the re-establishment of the status quo, this demand can no longer be valid. The President has clearly given his blessings for the Unity Government to continue. A Cabinet re-shuffle too is being planned.
The question surrounding the Opposition Leaders post has already been thrashed out and settled at the very inception. That is how the post went to R. Sampanthan. Speaking in parliament on Monday the TNA leader stressed that parliament is not constituted on the basis of local government election results. It is wrong to demand power in parliament on the basis of LG polls results. He said; the Constitution and laws of this country cannot be subverted by claiming benefits of the Local Government elections to his advantage, in the way Mahinda Rajapaksa pleases.
As a former President, twice over, it behoves MR to act with responsibility.

New Zealand Cricket backs Eden Park for T20 final
Wellington, Tuesday: New Zealand Cricket (NZC) defended Eden Park Tuesday amid criticism the Auckland venue is too small to host international fixtures such as the T20 tri-series final.The decider on Wednesday features New Zealand and Australia, who produced a run-fest at the same ground on Friday that left some purists fuming.
A total of 488 runs were scored at 12.7 an over as the sides smashed 32 sixes before Australia completed a world-record run chase of 245 to claim a five-wicket win.
The sight of mis-hits sailing over the boundary for six prompted veteran Australian commentator Jim Maxwell to call the venue "a joke" that should not host international cricket.Eden Park is best known as a rugby ground and its boundaries fall well short of the International Cricket Council's 59.5-metre (65-yard) minimum.
The situation is allowed to stand because the Auckland stadium hosted international cricket before the ICC regulations were introduced in 2007.NZC chief operating officer Anthony Crummy said the governing body "absolutely" backed Eden Park as a venue.
"It's unique, you can't deny that, a lot of cricket grounds are," he told Radio Sport.
"We think it adds to the colour of the international schedule when players have to adapt (to a smaller ground)."
Crummy also pointed out that Eden Park did not always produce high-scoring slog-a-thons, saying a number of matches there in recent years had been low-scoring, tight affairs.
"It hasn't failed to deliver great contest after great contest," he said."When you look back, they're not always high scoring either. AFP

No decision to scrap 25% female representation
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya affirmed that there was no decision taken at the Party Leaders meeting on Monday to scrap or amend the law making 25% female representation mandatory. He said in situations where there is an issue with the numbers of females, then that issue would be taken up in Parliament later.
The Speaker was responding to a point of order raised by MP Dullas Alahapperuma in Parliament yesterday.
Joint Opposition MP Dallas Alahapperuma referring to newspaper reports said these reports indicated that the government had decided to do away with the decision taken earlier with regard to making 25% female representation compulsory.
This situation has been discussed at various platforms, he said noting that three nominations of the Podu Jana Peramuna had been rejected including Maharagama and Mahiyanganaya for not having the required number of females names despite females being nominated. This was such an important issue and as such, this decision being taken now to change that stand is not at all justifiable.
In response, the Speaker said a discussion was held yesterday attended by the Elections Commission officials, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister and the Ministry Secretary, MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Keheliya Rambukwella and this matter was discussed at length. We were able to resolve it to a great degree, he noted.
Alahapperuma said at the LG elections, the previous 30% youth representation was scrapped in order to bring in the 25% female representation. The youth representation made mandatory during President Premadasas tenure was completely discarded and female representation was made mandatory.
He also noted that even previous provincial councillors and secretaries were added onto the supplementary list in order to allow more females to be elected.Moreover, the government carried on their entire election campaign depicting the female representation issue as a major victory they had gained in local politics. Thats how they got the votes. Once a match has been played and completed, one cannot count the number of no balls bowled, he quipped.
Meanwhile, responding to Alahapperumas allegations, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said at Mondays meeting they had decided to continue with the 25% female representation. However, in some councils the 25% cannot be obtained and in such situations we decided to bring in required amendments later on. It is a wrong notion that we had decided to reduce female representation, he added.
TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran agreeing with Kiriella said it was decided that the law will be implemented as it is, but after that is done, if there is a situation where it is a case of impossibility, then parliament will address that issue. There was no decision taken to act outside the law or to amend the law to deal with the situation that has already arisen, said Sumanthiran.
The Speaker also invited MP Keheliya Rambukwella to clarify the situation as he had also participated in the meeting on Monday. The decision taken at Mondays meeting was to continue with the same 25% female representation as the main law and deal with any situation where that is deemed absolutely impossible, later on.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena said it was discussed before the Commission that if a certain number of female members is less but the party has over 50% of members, such institutions can be established legitimately. In such instances, there is no obstacle of which list these members came from. Other than that we never discussed about changing any other law.
Thereafter the Speaker agreed to notify the relevant newspapers that had published news articles stating that the 25% female representation clause was to be discarded, to correct their error.

No decision has been taken over a possible gas price increase, Industry and Commerce Minster Rishard Bathuideen said yesterday.
He explained that though gas companies, Litro and Laugh had requested for a Rs.300 increase in price, Cabinet had decided to go ahead with a gas price formula before instituting any change.
"They have every right to ask for an increase,but, there are various processes that must be followed before a price increase can be approved. We have a committee at the Consumer Affairs Authority and the Cost of Living Committee which has to approve all this"," the Minister said at a media briefing held at the Ministry.
"Further, the gas pricing formula is yet to be finalised," the minister added.
The companies had pointed out that the price of gas had increased in the international market and thus they would prefer a subsequent increase in local prices.

Over 350, 000 construction employment opportunities not filled - Wijeratne
There are over 350, 000 construction based employment opportunities that are not being filled and the industry has obtained permission to import employees from Myanmar and Nepal to bridge this gap, said Secretary General / CEO, Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI), Eng. Nissanka N. Wijeratne.
He also disclosed that the value of the construction industry in 2017 was around Rs. 6,500 billion and there is year and year growth of around 12%. This should move up to 15% by then end of 2018. He was speaking at a conference held with regard to Build Sri Lanka - 2018, the premier Housing & Construction Exhibition organized by CCI to be held from May 18 to 20, 2018 at the BMICH for the 14th consecutive year.
He said that the shortage of labor is a major issue for the construction industry and this has added to the cost of the industry. School leavers dont like to get involved in the industry and we have no option other than to look at foreign workers. Asked why Indians are not being recruited he said that they have some issues with them.
Wijeratne also said that they have to admit that foreign workers (though paid the same salary as Sri Lankans) are more productive. For example a two local workers are needed to carry a steel bar while a Chines worker would carry a steel bar alone.
He also highlighted that the local companies should be given preference when awarding building contracts that are funded locally, but this is not happening and foreign companies are given preference. We cannot compete with them as their production cost is less. He warned that if this trend continues local construction industry would collapse.
He also said that more studies should be done before signing FTA agreements as they also have negative impacts for the industry.
Asked if there is an oversupply of housing in Sri Lanka, he answered in the negative and said that the demand would continue. Build Sri Lanka Exhibition is regarded as the most dynamic Building & Construction Trade exhibition in Sri Lanka.
The event will host over 300 exhibitors from various sectors of the construction industry island-wide. An impressive country specific pavilion will be a novel feature of Build Sri Lanka 2018, with over 30 Chinese companies registered as part of the China Pavilion. The China Pavilion will comprise delegations of these companies looking to expand the countrys ever growing presence in the building and construction sector of the country with innovative, cost effective materials, products and services.

Parliament postpones debate on Bond and PRECIFAC reports
Parliament sittings were confined to about 40 minutes yesterday as the House decided to postpone the debate on the Bond Commission and PRECIFAC reports due to the non-availability of English or Tamil translations of the PRECIFAC report.
The decision was after TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran brought to the notice of the House that the TNA MPs would not be able to participate in the debate as the PRECIFAC report was available only in Sinhala even as at yesterday.
The adjournment debate on the two reports was a continuation from February 6. As MP Sumanthiran was explaining the House on the language issue faced by them, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara suggested that he speak on the Bond report which was available in English. This remark developed into a heated exchange of words between the two MPs.
Why are you insisting us to speak only on one report Why are you worried about the PRECIFAC report I wish to speak on that as well. You are worried about us making references to the PRECIFAC report. You were the Minister of National Languages in the previous Government. You should have been protesting in agreement with me that before a debate begins reports must be available in both the national languages, Sumanthiran told Nanayakkara.
You are speaking unnecessarily. My point is that we have come ready to speak and the debate must go on, Nanayakkara retorted to Sumanthiran.
I am not speaking unnecessarily. I cannot even understand if somebody refers to something in the PRECIFAC report. I cannot follow it. Is that the way you want me to participate in a debate Having being the Minister of National Languages, and having gone around the world saying all kinds of things, you are suggesting that I should continue to sit here in a debate where things are referred to in a language that I cannot read. Shameful, Sumanthiran blasted Nanayakkara.
Intervening at this point, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya apologized for not having the Tamil and English translations ready. There are about 8,000 pages in that report. We have asked the authorities to get this translation and the Official Languages Department is working on it. There is a point in what Sumanthiran MP says, but I leave it to the House to decide, said the Speaker asking the opinion of Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella on the matter. Kiriella proposed to postpone the debate observing that legally and technically it was wrong to proceed on the debate without providing the translations.
At this point MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena noted the original agreement was to go ahead with the debate even in the absence of Sinhala and Tamil translations if the English copy was is available. The Speaker clarified that not even the English copy of the PRECIFAC report was ready yet. Thereafter, the Speaker with the consent of the House postponed the debate and adjourned the sittings till 1pm today. The attendance of MPs was also very poor yesterday and many members whose questions were included in the Order Paper were not present to raise their oral questions.

All political parties which ruled the country over the past seven decades should be responsible for the present situation in the country. The present political and economic crisis is the result of those narrow-sighted, power-centred and power-craving politicians, Bodu Bala Sena Organisation Leader Ven. Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera said.
Ven Gnanasara Thera, addressing the media yesterday, said both the country and people are stagnating without witnessing any progress as a result of the political crisis. But at this juncture, power-craving politicians and their parties are trying to get the lions share, he said.
As a result, the country is falling back day by day. Whatever the ruling party is, it should be given necessary opportunities and facilities by other parties to rule the country without pulling its legs. Today, the country marks the 200 years of the historic Uva Wellassa riot. It is significant that that the situation which prevailed 200 years ago can be seen even today, the Thera said.
The Thera urged President Maithripala Sirisena to exercise the powers of the Executive Presidency aiming to gain political and economic stability.
There should be one leader in the country. The country might fall back when there are many rulers or when there isnt a ruler. It can be seen that there are many rulers today.
The Thera added that there should be national policies for the county. In line with implementing national policies, it is necessary to implement people-friendly policies, he added.

## Title: Rubaiyat  misunderstood

Rubaiyat  misunderstood
The name of the Persian poet Omar Khayyam (1050  1132), his celebrated work Rubaiyat and the English translator of the work Edward Fitzgerald (1809  1883) have become catchwords in literary world both in the Occident as well as the Orient. There is quite a number of reasons for the fame of Omar and his work Rubaiyat via the English translation. In Sri Lanka, three Sinhala translations have appeared over the years.
The Sinhala translators happened to be Madawala Ratnayake, G B Senanayake and Mahagama Sekara. Though the first two translators brought out published works, the translation on the part of Sekara, appeared in several editions in the Sinhala periodical titled Rasavahini during the late sixties. During a visit to Hyderabad in India, I came across an Indian publication of Fitzgeralds translation of Rubaiyat.
Religious sensibility
I was inclined to reread Rubaiyat due to two reasons. The first reason is that there was a belief among some of the English scholars, that Omars work Rubaiyat possesses a deep sense of the oriental religious sensibility of hte metaphysical nature of the existence. This underlines the transience or aniccha quality as taught in Buddhism as well. It is true that some of the quatrains in Rubaiyat as they are denoted by Fitzgerald tend to express the essence of the phenomenon. Take for instance the following lines.
Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough
A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou,
Beside me, singing in the wilderness
And wilderness is paradise now. (Verse 11)
The worldly hope men set their hearts upon,
Like snow upon the deserts dusty face,
Lighting a little hour or two  is gone. (Verse 14)
As is widely known Edward Fitzgerald was not a mere poet who scribbled for the sake of doing it. But he was a scholar of some magnitude. At Oxford University, Fitzgerald was tutored by an oriental scholar named Edward Byles Cowell, who later became Professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge. He was the scholar who induced Fitzgerald to study Spanish and Persian. It is recorded that in 1856, Cowell discovered the Rubaiyat or quatrains of Omar Khayyam in a Persian manuscript in the Bodleian library at Oxford.
First edition
He made a transcript of it to be given to Fitzgerald. Further it is recorded that in 1857, lie latter began the translation completing it in six months time. One fascinating factor is that a periodical titled as Frazers Magazine, has refused to publish a few selections of the stanzas.
On April 9, 1859, the fir book edition of Rubaiyat in 250 copies came to be printed and produced at Fitzgeralds expense.
The work in English hardly caught the sight of scholars though it was price marked at Shilling a copy in London bookshops. The first edition had been lying in the bookstalls nearly for two years, and was finally dumped at a penny a copy. Then suddenly the merit of the work was discovered by several scholars whose names go as the Poets Rosetti , Swinburne, Burne-Jones, William Morris, Ruskin and others.
The work was introduced to American scholars by Charles Eliot Norton. This blissful trend of events became a mania which swept the world.
This I feel is sufficient background to feel the necessity of Rubaiyat in the world of letters. But, what really was the success of Rubaiyata as translated into English On rereading I felt that the stream of visions that envelope the brief poetic quality or the underlying sensitivity that expresses the inner feelings of a man in varying forms. The poetic persona or the narrator in the poems tends to transcend the barriers mere material world full of lust, anger and hatred. He tends to take a move towards a better blissful moment. See the following lines.
Ah make the most of what we yet may spend,
Before we too into dust descend
And under dust to lie
Sans wine, sans song, sans singer and sans end. (Verse 23)
Meaning of life
Omar Khayyam seems to be expressing the deep sense of happiness as the essence of life. He feels that his poetic persona, whom he identifies as a philosopher feels the great sense of tranquillity while meaning of life.
As such, the work as a whole transcends the conventional barriers of love and romance. Omar, as a poet, takes the reader of his verses to a flame of metaphysical belief akin to some of the stanzas found in Bhagavadgita and Dhammapada. The world is seen as a mirage and or a bubble of water.
Earth could not answer.
Nor the seas that mourn.
Oh threats of hell and hopes
One thing is certain and the rest are lies.
The flower that once, blown forever dies.
(Verse 63).
Though seemingly expressed in a lighter symbolic vein some poems in Rubaiyat embrace a deeper sense. One good example is Verse 51.
The moving finger writes and having writ,
Moves on, not all thy piety nor wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a line
Not all they tears wash out a word of it.
The idea conveyed is more spiritual than it shows on the outer layer. It is the deep sense of engraving that is irreversible as in the paths of the enlightened ones. The lines denote the paths and those who follow the lines or the path achieve the goal of perfection discernible either as the highest spiritual achievement. In this sense, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khyyam ought to be rediscovered sensibly.
It is observed that there have been several versions of the translation of Fitzgerald, which he may have improved over the years. As such I had the chance of reading three versions where the first had come to light in 1859 the second in 1868, and the fifth in 1889. One finds quite a number of allusions to myth, legends, religious allegories passed down the centuries especially in the ancient world of Persians. Poetry commences in delight and ends in wisdom comes as truism as you scan the pages of Rubaiyat. On rereading Rubaiyat I felt that it is more spiritual poetic vision than an ephemeral expression of sensory pleasures with an emphasis on drinking. As such, the widely believed attribution to Rubaiyat needs to be dispelled.

IOC to decide fate of Athletes Commission
Seats for NOCSL hots up
The three-day sprint for the National Olympic Committee election heated up with the two main parties headed by the respective presidential candidates Anthony Rohan Harsha Fernando and Suresh Subramaniam seeking a majority power from the affiliated members at the February 23 election to govern the NOCSL for the next four years.
The number of member votes (33) included two votes by the Athletes Commission which was challenged by objections. The Athletes Commission was established as a NOCSL constitutional requirement and has two votes at the AGM.
The NOCSL constitution also allows Athletes Commission to include two of its members in NOCSL Executive Committee. But according to the three-member NOCSL election committee head Dr. R. M. K. Ratnayaka the Sri Lankan Sports Law does not allow such a voting right to the Athletes Commission. The Daily News tried to contact Dr. R. M. K. Ratnayaka but his phone was out of reach on all attempts.
NOCSL sources revealed that the Athletes Commissions voting eligibility matter has been referred to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the decision is expected to be received on the morning of Election Day.
NOC sources further said that if IOC decides that the two votes of the Athletes Commission are not eligible, the number of votes that will be considered for the election will be 31. The election will be held on Friday evening at the NOCSL headquarters at 6 pm.
Presidential candidate Rohan Fernando, a former champion rower and a top entrepreneur who is the president of the Amateur Rowing Association of Sri Lanka is the Finance Committee chairman of the existing NOCSL administration.
Rohan launched his election campaign with a strong voice against corruption and promised to establish good governance and accountability at NOCSL if he is elected president. Roshans alliance comprised some experienced sports administrators including secretary candidate Rohan Preethiviraj Perera who is the founding president of the National Association for Canoeing and Kayaking in SL. National Shooting Sport Federation of SL president Shirantha Peiris is the contestant for the treasurers post from Rohans camp.
We have to change the whole setup of the NOCSL to serve sport. I have a well qualified, experienced bunch of sports administrators with me who are not subject to corruption allegations. We have to start a new chapter in Sri Lankan sports, said Rohan Fernando.
My rivals will not be an alternative but they are just an extension of the present regime. I am sure that we can take Lankan sports on the right track and we are confident of doing so very soon when we come to power in the NOCSL, he stated.
The other presidential candidate Suresh Subramaniam, a former Davis Cup tennis player and a business tycoon is also a former president and a present vice president of the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA).
Suresh was recently appointed as the vice president of the Asian Tennis Federation.
He is a reputed sports administrator and vows to bring more professionalism and transparency into the NOCSL if he is elected to run the top sports body for the next four years.
Sureshs camp too is armed with individuals of high repute including the immediate past secretary Maxwell de Silva, who is the most experienced NOCSL official in the fray, competing to secure the secretary office for another term.
Maxwell was first elected to the secretary post in 2009. Cycling Federation treasurer Senaka Clement Ranasinghe is contesting for the treasurers post from Sureshs camp.
There are a lot of shortcomings in the Sri Lankan Sports Law, NOCSL constitution and IOC rules which created counter progressive impact on Sri Lankan sports in recent times.
I will take necessary steps to create harmony among them and work towards the development of Sri Lankan sports, said Suresh.
I have been in sports administration at international level for quite a long time and I am very confident of uplifting Sri Lankan sports with a proper mechanism, he said.

SLIM represents Sri Lanka at a conference in Asia
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) is constantly exploring new options and breaking boundaries to continue its quest to take the Sri Lankan Marketing sphere to the next level, not just locally, but internationally as well.
With nearly 50 years of experience in being the renowned national body for Marketing, which has lead the nation towards economic prosperity by fostering the development of the nation, advising and assisting in formation, implementation and appraisal of national policies on any matter connected with marketing.
As one of the Board of Management members of the AMF (Asia Marketing Federation), SLIM recently attended a conference known as the Game of Marketing in Manila organised by the Philippine Marketing Association.
Over 300 representatives from all across Asia participated in the event, which featured the best Asian speakers and facilitators.

Some trying to destroy government from within
People who crept into the Yahapalana government when their bid to bring back corrupt politicians to power had failed, are trying to destroy the government from within, Viharadhipathi Kadugannawa Kurunduwatta Sri Sudarshanaramaya Ven. Yatiwaldeniye Medhankara Thera said.
The President and the Prime Minister should try to identity these people playing a double game for their personal gain, he said. Ven Medhankara Thera said a large majority of the people gave a mandate to the Yahapalane government to governs till 2020 and no one had the right to distort the result of the two national elections by highlighting the results of the local government elections.
He said the sinister objective of the Joint Opposition was to drive a wedge between the President and the Prime Minister for its own gain, aided and abetted by its agents within the government. As pointed out by the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, what the President and the Prime Minister ought to do was to buckle down to work to fulfil the pledges given to the people.Unless they did so, people who supported them would finally lose confidence in them, he said.

Speaker to announce validity of National Govt. today
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that his decision on the validity of continuation of the National Government will be made known today.
He made this comment in response to Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who raised questions on the validity of the National Government and its Cabinet of Ministers in the absence of any official communication to Parliament of the extension of MoU signed between the SLFP and UNP.
He pointed out the initial MoU signed between the two parties was for two years and any extension of the agreement must be informed to the Speaker in writing. The Speaker confirmed that he had so far not received any official communication over the continuation of the National Government. The Speaker however said he would inquire it from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the House would be informed of the response. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that neither of the parties in the Unity Government has withdrawn and therefore the National Government continues as before.
However, it was argued by the Opposition that such a decision to continue the Unity Government must be duly informed to the Speaker as previously done by late Wiswa Warnapala, the former General Secretary of the UPFA.
MP Dissanayake pointed out the number of Cabinet Ministers was increased from 30 to 48 and the number of Deputy and State Ministers was increased from 40 to 45 due to the formation of National Government. Unless Parliament approval is renewed for the National Government, the Cabinet of Ministers would cease to be valid.
The validity of the decisions taken by this Cabinet of Ministers could be problematic if anybody challenges that before the Supreme Court, MP Dissanayake said.
MPs Dulles Allahapperuma and Dinesh Gunawardena bolstered this argument. We too raised this issue yesterday. There are 24 invalid ministers. Only thing is that we do not know who they are. This political situation has crippled the entire nation. Parliament should resolve this problem as soon as possible, Allahapperuma said.
The Speaker should make a decision. The Government cannot go further without the approval of the House. Otherwise the number of ministers must come down to 30 and the number of state and deputy ministers to 40, MP Gunawardena said.

Summons not served on Lankaenews editor
The Supreme Court was yesterday informed that summons had not been served on Lankaenews website editor Sandaruwan Senadheera in connection with several contempt of court cases filed against him.
Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya appearing on behalf of the petitioner who filed 14 contempt of court cases informed the Supreme Court that summons has not been served on Sandaruwan Senadheera who is residing in the United Kingdom.
He said the petitioner had taken measures to serve summons on Lankaenews editor through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
He made these remarks when the contempt of court applications for allegedly publishing defamatory articles which appeared in Lankaenews defaming the judges from the Apex Court to the Magistrates Court castigating their characters were taken up in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.
On January 19, 2016, two persons including Sandaruwan Senadheera were noticed to appear before the Supreme Court on March 3 last year. However, the second accused, an Attorney-at-law was present in Court.
These petitions are to be taken up for mention on September 10.
These 14 complaints had been filed by former Deputy Mayor of Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council, Attorney-at-Law Madura Vithanage complaining that there had been a series of articles published in the social media web site/face book named Lankaenews in which the judges and the Judicial Institutions had been critically ridiculed and intimidated and at certain instances there had been scathing attacks on judges commencing from Magistrates to the Chief Justice.
The complainant stated that through the contents of the said articles, the web site/Facebook owner/operator has insulted, defamed, and ridiculed the judges whose names are referred to therein and there is direct and indirect intimidation on judges as well as the judiciary as a whole.
In his petitions, the petitioners cited lankaenews editor Sandaruwan Senadheera as the accused and the Attorney General and the President of Bar Association of Sri Lanka as respondents.
The petitioner is requesting the Court to charge the accused on the offence of contempt of the Supreme Court under Article 105(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka and grant an order restraining the accused preventing him from publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the judges or any judicial institution including the Supreme Court and the Judicial Services Commission until the conclusion of this case.
These articles have attacked on both the judicial conduct as well as the private lives of the judges and caused embarrassment not only to the judges but also to the entire judiciary, the complainant said.
The complainant stated that Lankaenews is a web site owned and maintained by Sandaruwan Senadheera from London, United Kingdom.
He further stated that the contents in the said articles are derogatory of the judiciary and the judges and tantamount to contempt of court punishable under law.
Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya appeared for the petitioner. Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna with counsel Upul Kumarapperuma appeared for the second accused.

The group consisting of Thai engineers visited the Castelereagh and Maussakele Reservoirs in the catchment areas of the Central Highlands to seek the possibilities of creating artificial rain as water levels in these reservoirs had seen a drastic drop. Officials from the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said that the team also planned to visit the main Victoria, Randenigala and Kotmale reservoirs. Local media reports said the Thai engineers represent the only company in the world that has the patent to create artificial rain. The company had created artificial rain when the island country was severely affected by a drought in 1981. Hundreds of families remain affected by months of severe drought due to the lack of rains and delayed monsoonal rains in the central parts of Sri Lanka.

Third doping scandal hits Games, overshadows magic on ice
Pyeongchang, Tuesday: The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was hit by a third doping scandal on Tuesday, casting a dark shadow over the magic on ice served up by peerless Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir.
Slovenian ice hockey player Ziga Jeglic failed a drugs test and has been banned from the Olympics, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said.
A day earlier a Russian bronze medallist in curling was suspended over suspected doping and a Japanese short-track speed skater was kicked out of the Games in South Korea last week.
Jeglic, 29, who plays professional ice hockey in Russia, tested positive for fenoterol, a banned substance used to treat breathing difficulties, and was given 24 hours to quit the Olympic Village.
The latest drugs scandal hit just after one of the high points of the Games -- the gold medal-winning performance of Virtue and Moir to clinch victory in the ice dance.
They skated last after watching French rivals Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron break their own free dance record and top the standings with the best combined total of their careers.
The pressure was unbearable but Virtue and Moir showed no signs of buckling, skating out a flawless routine to Roxanne from Moulin Rouge in what may well be their last hurrah on the world stage.
"Amazing. It was a special moment to come out last," said Virtue.
"It was a strong last group, there was a lot of pressure, but I'm so happy with how we performed." The 2010 Olympic gold medallists scored a record combined total of 206.07 points, narrowly bettering the French duo's 205.28.
Papadakis suffered embarrassment during Monday's routine when her dress slipped open but she and Cizeron were still on course for gold -- until the Canadians delivered something special to become the most decorated Olympic skaters of all time.Away from the grace and elegance of the skating rink, another Canadian, Cassie Sharpe, produced some jaw-dropping aerobatics to storm to freestyle skiing's halfpipe gold.French rival Marie Martinod wiped out on her final run and finished second after Sharpe produced a top score of 95.80 on her second effort, celebrated by raising her hands behind her head in a bunny-ear sign as she crossed the line backwards."It hasn't really sunk in yet, but it's just an incredible feeling," said the gold medallist, 25.Yet more Canadian glory looks on the cards after they and old rivals the United States booked their places in the final of the women's ice hockey tournament, scheduled for Thursday.

TOWARDS IRRADIATION OF EXTREMISM
Culture has always been the most appropriate media and most effective strategy for interaction and dialogue among the nations and for exploring proper grounds and solutions for the proximity of viewpoints and mutual understanding among the world nations. The emergence and development of sciences and civilizations are chiefly a result of cultural relations and interactions among the human communities. Cultural dialogues prepare the grounds for the free and respectful exchange of views among individuals as well as reference groups and institutions, thus prove to be highly influential in the path toward peaceful coexistence and sustainable security among nations.
Today, under various tensions and challenges that dominate the international relations, cultural dialogues can prove to be an inevitable necessity and an effective strategy  more than ever  in establishing relations with and creating sustainable cooperation among the elite for collaboration in exploring appropriate cultural solutions for changing the status quo.
Cultural cooperation among different nations of Asia will pave the way for peace, stability and progress in the years to come as well as promoting the culture of peace and friendship among the nations of the great continent. The continuous efforts for cultural dialogue among elites and intellectuals are undoubtedly instrumental in achieving common understanding and in finding an appropriate mechanism to address the current challenges in regional relations.
Tradition of intercultural relations
It is in this backdrop, that I appreciate the opportunity that I received to participate in the Asian Cultural Dialogues Conference held in the Islamic Republic of Iran from January 13-15, 2018.
The main theme of the conference was confined to Cultural Dialogues between Iran and the Sub-continent nations. The Islamic Republic of Iran is a country with a great tradition of intercultural relations has been able to take the initiative in this great event.
Following the Conference on Dialogue among Religions and Cultures in Asia which has taken place in September 2011 in Tehran, a number of meetings have been held in various parts of Asia, including the preparatory meetings on cultural dialogues that were held in Malaysia, India, Kazakhstan, China and Turkey.
To finalize and materialize the decisions of the above meetings, the Conference on Asia Cultural Dialogue: Cultural Diversity and Converging Aspirations in Asia was held from January 13 to 15, 2018 in Iran.
The event was organised by the Permanent Secretariat of International Cultural Dialogues in collaboration with the host universities in Iran.
Cultural dialogue
The Commission on Cultural Dialogue between Iran and the Sub-continent on Common Cultural and Historical Heritage: Potentials and Opportunities was held at Ferdowsi University of Mashad from January 14 to 15, 2018. A large number of scholars and researchers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iran took part in the meeting and discussed the important aspects of the theme of the conference. The participants confirmed the following pivotal points:
 Establishing the forum of cultural dialogues among Iran and countries of the sub-continent as sub-entity of Permanent Secretariat of International Cultural Dialogues,
 Development and approval of executive regulation of the forum at the next meeting,
 Developing the plan of joint short-term and long-term scientific and cultural cooperation and delivering the plan to Permanent Secretariat of Cultural Dialogue for further approval,
 Holding periodical meetings of the forum in member universities,
 Use of potentials of non-governmental organisations and scientific-cultural centres for increasing the number of forum members,
 Developing a website for the forum for reinforcing persistent relationship and information exchange among members,
 Publication of special journal on cultural dialogues among Iran and the subcontinent to produce scientific literature and to provide the conditions for persistent interaction between elites.
Representing Sri Lanka, I participated in the above mentioned first commission where potentials of intercultural relations were extensively discussed as to how the present day world could be liberated from various kinds of extremism.
The venue of this commission was the beautiful Ferdowsi University, named after the greatest of Persian national poets, Ferdowsi. Incidentally, after the conclusion of the conference, we were able to visit the massive mausoleum of the great poet situated a few kilometres away from the city of Mashad.
Without going into minute details of the valuable contribution made by many of intellectuals who participated at this conference with a common goal of cultural understanding among the subcontinent nations of Asia, with special reference to irradiation of religious animosity and extremism, I wish to quote a few lines at random, of the speech delivered by Dr. Hojjatollah Javani, Associate professor of Religions and Mysticism at Al-Zahra University.
Intellectual conflicts
The modern era has been the battlefield of intellectual conflicts and encounters between the followers of different creeds and religions. In our time, there are many groups that in the name of religion or out of the so-called religious devoutness clash with followers of other schools of thoughts and religions. Extreme groups have been formed all across the world, each of which undertaking the most heinous acts and violent behaviours towards followers of other religions and sects in an attempt to defend and celebrate their own faith. They mask violence with a holy disguise and cover their narrow-mindedness and fundamentalism under the pretext of preserving religion, trying to pass it off as a gift to the land of thoughts and hearts of simple-minded people.
They have packed their tricky shop with the goods of dogma, aggression, ambition animosity and obduracy and all sorts of vile acts, while drawing a curtain of religion and the service of God along with the concern about the prosperity and glory of the people to make it difficult to perceive the truth and therefore deceive their ignorant customers.
The simple-minded and nave clients of the religion market fall prey to these hunters and they purchase the fake commodity of religious violence instead of the beautiful product of spirituality. When these people open the bundle of these purchased tricks, they see that their sufferings have been futile and their achievements are chimerical.
Sometimes, there are gullible people who sit at the table of these spoiled and corrupt intellectual foods, and their hearts and souls are poisoned, followed by more catastrophic consequences.
What is the solution and how people of all religions can be steered away from this sham market towards the true destination and purpose of religion
To all of the above-said, one can add the brilliant records of mysticism in Iran and India, which have historically demonstrated their ability to curb violence, with the emphasis on mysticism succeeding in changing the fate of aggressive tribes, creating a civilization that favours peace and philanthropy and eschews violence.
