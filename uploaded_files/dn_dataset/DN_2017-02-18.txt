New Colombo must cater for all: Dr. Amunugama
One must not look only at the requirements of the business community and the affluent classes in designing 'new Colombo' that is emerging, but also into the interests of the needy, many of whom had migrated from villages decades ago, seeking greener pastures, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
Participating in the inauguration of the annual sessions of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects as chief guest on behalf of the President recently, Dr. Amunugama said the poor have catered to various needs of city life over the years and they must share the benefits of upgrading the city.
The minister referred to the emerging Port City and observed that one third of the newly reclaimed land will be earmarked for parkland and public spaces.
Dr. Amunugama referred to the industrial city that will soon develop in the environs of the Hambantota harbour and the Mattala Airport.
The minister said negotiations have been held with 450 companies and that many more are due to follow.
He said the development of Kandy, Trincomalee and several industrial corridors is on the cards. Architects will benefit from all this, he said.
The minister said in the advance towards increasing urbanisation with about 40 percent of the world population coming to live in cities within the next three or four decades, the environmental sustainability and the upgrading of the quality of life in the cities must be a prime concern of every one.

80th man to lead England in Tests: Is Joe Root the right man for England
In the least surprising move since England last needed a new Test captain, England have appointed Joe Root as the successor to Alastair Cook.
Like Cook before him, Root has been promoted from vice-captain, an elevation such a formality that the anointing of another leader would have come as a seismic shock.
But an expected coronation does not guarantee that the crown will sit right, especially when Root is such an inexperienced skipper.
Why is he the man for the job What type of leader might he be And how will it affect his batting
No ordinary Joe - why he is the right man...
Root has long been tipped for the top job. As a 13-year-old playing club cricket for Sheffield Collegiate he was nicknamed FEC, for future England captain, a title once bestowed on Michael Atherton with similar accuracy.
Since he made his debut at the age of 21 in December 2012, no batsman on the planet has made more than Root's 4,594 Test runs and only India's Virat Kohli has a better tally in all international cricket. He is perhaps the most complete three-format player that England have ever produced.
The English way is to push the batting totem towards leadership - it was the same with Atherton, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Cook, with varying degrees of success.
Now it is Root's turn. Although his leadership experience amounts to only four first-class matches, the tiny glimpses offered when he has briefly deputised for Cook hint towards an enthusiasm and dynamism for the job.
At 26, he is a year older than Atherton when he took charge, but a year younger than Cook was. With 53 Tests to his name, he has 22 more than Vaughan when he was named skipper in 2003.
He's the obvious candidate, said England pace bowler James Anderson. The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.
He is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man.
Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man.
...or is he
Root hasn't quite been named captain by default, but it's not far off. Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jos Butler were all consulted after Cook's resignation but it always seemed incredibly unlikely that any would beat Root to the job.
Still, there is the suggestion that Root's carefree, jovial approach might not be best suited to leadership.
Root is the outstanding candidate, but you wouldn't want it to be a case of making your best player captain, only for it to backfire on you later, said former England off-spinner Graeme Swann.
I'm still not convinced Root is the right man for the job. I want him to concentrate on being the best player we have ever had, rather than having his talent curbed by the pressures of captaincy.
He has tried to be more sensible later, but part of his cheeky chappy persona makes him the player he is, and I don't want to see that taken away.
And although Cook proclaimed Root to be ready for the captaincy during the tour of India it was Root himself who said that he needs to start growing up a bit after an angry reaction to a dismissal in the fifth Test in Chennai.
Fatherhood should help, a first-born son having arrived on 7 January, but if it is a different Root who leads England out against South Africa at Lord's on 6 July, will he have the same success that brought him to the captaincy
It's hard to say how ready I am, said Root in January.
I've got quite a lot experience in Test cricket now, but it's one of these things where you have to learn on the job.
Being a dad you don't know what to do, you just have to go with it and see how it goes. I imagine being captain would be very similar.
What type of captain will he be
It is a downside of central contracts that England players have little or no opportunity to learn captaincy in the county game.
Arguably, another related negative is that a player can only ever be schooled by the limited number of captains he has played under.
Root, for example, has never played a Test under anyone other than Cook, while Cook's style of leadership was heavily influenced by predecessor Andrew Strauss.
With just those four first-class matches under his belt, Root is one of the most inexperienced captains ever appointed by England - at least Cook had benefited from 18 months in charge of the one-day side.
Root's style of leadership is therefore something of a mystery. The perception is that he will be more adventurous than Cook - but so is popping to the corner shop in your slippers instead of your shoes.
Joe will know what he would like to improve or what he would like to do differently, said former England captain Vaughan. When all the speculation over Cook's future began, he will have gone home at night and thought what if I do get the job
But you're never too sure how you're going to be as a person until you get it. You can think you're going to be X or Y, but you can't be 100% sure.
Of the four times Root has led in the first-class game, one match was in charge of England Lions, with the other three as Yorkshire skipper.
In each of Root's matches as Tykes captain, fast bowler Ryan Sidebottom was part of the Yorkshire team.
I get changed next to him and he can be a scruffy little git, but when it comes to cricket knowledge he's very clued up and knows everything about the game, said Sidebottom.
If you look at the way he bats, he's got all the shots. He works hard on innovation, so I think he will be a creative captain.
When he plays, he takes the game to the opposition. The English way can be quite conservative; I'm sure he'll change that for the better.
How will it affect his batting
It is incredibly English to fret over how taking on the responsibility of captaincy might affect the new leader's batting (they are almost always batsmen, after all).However, of the seven men with the most Tests as England captain, only one - Vaughan - has an average significantly worse as captain than when in the ranks.
The batting records of Cook, Strauss and Nasser Hussain are similar whether captain or not, while Atherton, Peter May and Graham Gooch saw their runs increase with responsibility, the latter two dramatically so. It is not just English leaders with lengthy tenures who have seen a spike in their scoring.
Of Root, India's Kohli, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson - widely regarded as the four finest batsmen on the planet right now - the Englishman is the last of the quartet to take over as his nation's Test captain.
Each has seen an improvement in his batting average, Williamson by a small amount, Kohli and Smith by more than 20 runs each.
Realistically, though, England would probably settle for Root's record to hold steady.
His batting average of 52.80 is the highest by any England player to have played at least 20 innings since 1968. Any improvement on that would be pretty remarkable.
What about the one-day captaincy
The status quo of Cook leading the Test side and Eoin Morgan taking charge of the one-day and Twenty20 outfits worked well for England because neither was a threat to the other. Both were miles away from getting into the teams they did not lead.
Three-format man Root's elevation to lead the Test side poses a problem for the England and Wales Cricket Board.
Do they leave Morgan, who has presided over an incredible improvement in England's one-day cricket and guided them to the World Twenty20 final, in charge, or give Root three sets of reins
Those in favour of change will say there are very few examples of a Test captain playing for too long under a different limited-overs skipper, while any dip in results or form could increase pressure on Morgan.
However, director of cricket Strauss crusade to bring limited-overs success to the England side has seen greater and greater separation between the red-ball and the white-ball teams. One skipper for all could be seen as a return to a uniform approach that had largely been abandoned. And the relentless scheduling of international cricket more than justifies two skippers, particularly if resting Root from the shorter formats helps him cope with the mental and physical demands of Test leadership.
Consider the winter schedule of 2017-18. The five Ashes Tests that begin at the end of November are followed by an ODI series against Australia, which rolls into a T20 tri-series also involving New Zealand. After that, England play five more ODIs and two Tests against the Kiwis, which might not conclude until the end of March.
A player involved in all parts of that tour could be on the other side of the world for five months or more. Even two captains might not be enough.
How long might Root be captain for
England captains have a natural shelf-life. Of the seven skippers with the most Tests, discounting any time as a stand-in, only May's reign spanned more than five years - and that ended in 1961.
Of the longest-serving skippers since the late 1980s, Gooch managed five years, Atherton four, Hussain four, Vaughan five (with an enforced 18-month break because of a knee injury), Strauss four and Cook just over four. - BBC

Austalia and SL committed to countering people smuggling
Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka and Australia on Wednesday stressed the importance of continuing to counter the illegal people smuggling trade which puts vulnerable peoples lives at risk and enriches criminal networks.
The two prime ministers in a joint statement after the conclusion f Sri Lankan Prime Ministers official visit to Australia from February 13 to 17 at the invitation of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the two countries are committed to detect and deter people smuggling ventures and to strengthen the close working relationship between agencies.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, paid an official visit to Australia from 13 to17 February at the invitation of Australian PM, Malcolm Turnbull, accompanied by Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister, Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, Ports and Shipping Minister, Arjuna Ranatunga and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva.
Prime Minister Turnbull welcomed Wickremesinghe on his first official visit to Australia to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Both Prime Ministers underlined the strong historical ties, common values and shared interests, including a commitment to democracy, the rule-of-law, and support for a stable, liberal rules-based international order. They commended the sustained efforts of both nations to build on these foundations to realise the benefits of closer cooperation. Turnbull and Wickremesinghe welcomed strong achievements, particularly in countering people smuggling and strengthening people- to-people links. They underlined new opportunities to expand the economic relationship presented by Sri Lankas ambitious economic reform agenda, deeper integration with the global economy and progress toward becoming an important Indian Ocean economic hub.
Turnbull commended Sri Lanka on its strong economic growth and considerable progress toward national reconciliation since the end of the conflict in 2009. As a close friend and Indian Ocean neighbour, Australia will continue to stand with Sri Lanka on this journey, including through lending practical support for reconciliation measures, he said.
The Prime Ministers underlined the importance of continuing to counter the illegal people smuggling trade, which puts vulnerable peoples lives at risk and enriches criminal networks. They emphasised their commitment to detect and deter people smuggling ventures and to strengthen the close working relationship between agencies.
Both Prime Ministers reiterated their shared interest in regional stability. As Indo-Pacific
neighbours, Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) members and trading nations, both
countries benefited from a peaceful and secure maritime domain. they committed to closer cooperation and engagement in the Indo-Pacific to help create a more prosperous and secure region.
The Prime Ministers emphasised the significant opportunities of greater trade and economic integration in the Indo-Pacific region to both countries and their continued commitment to work together in building regional trade. Both leaders noted the Kotte Statement on International Trade and Investment adopted by CHOGM 2013 in Colombo and welcomed opportunities to deepen trade and investment links.

They noted Sri Lankas changing energy requirements and that Australia was a major global energy supplier, where Australian companies could play a role in securing energy supply to fuel the next stage of Sri Lankas economic development. Investment in energy infrastructure could be a major driver of economic growth in Sri Lanka in the future, they noted.
Strong and growing education ties, which boost the human capital of both countries was another topic discussed. Many Australian education providers are active in Sri Lanka, including delivering high quality education and conducting research with local partners. Around 7,600 Sri Lankans are currently studying in Australia. Australia has sent around 300 New Colombo Plan participants to study in Sri Lanka since 2015 including in health, science, architecture, information technology, commerce and law.

Speaking at the Southern Provincial Council meeting on Tuesday (14), he said, Cannabis is known as Thailoka Pathram in Sanskrit. It is a medicine. This is used in Indian states. Cannabis is also used as a means to develop tourism in India.
Tennakoon Nilame also said the Police and Excise Department who do not conduct raids to nab drugs and heroin, only conduct raids to nab cannabis to satisfy their interests. Therefore, they engage in raids in the Southern Province where the tourism sector is highly developed, he added.
He also requested that Excise licenses be issued to small scale hotels in order to develop tourism in the Southern Province.

Certain sections of the media, including some journalists are biased and only see the negative side of things, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
They never report the positive measures taken by the Government. They never double check to see the accuracy of their facts, the Minister said.
Some health officials think that the Health Service is their private property and that they can remain in the service for ever.But,all these people including the Health Minister will have to leave the service one day, the minister said.
I ordered all relevant health professionals only to use medical devices of the highest quality for patients.
This is because I believe that only the best the people deserve the best medical attention and the high quality medical equipment, Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Ministry Auditorium yesterday, the Minister said althought the current Acting Director General of Health Services, Dr.Jayasundara Bandara was selected as the most eligible person in 2013 for the Health Services Director General post, the post went to the third most qualified person on the list. The persons who accuse SPC Managing Director Dr.Rumie Mohamed are connected to a private company which lost a Tender recently due to its corruption and malpractices.
The company changed the name and re-registered as a new company under a new address after being involved in various misconducts in the past under the previous (different) name. The company was about to import 600 vials of the cancer drug from India. But, when inquired, there was no drug company in the said address in India and there was a flower shop at that location. All those were part of the drug mafia and now lost their huge profits made during the past, he added.

Champs Kandy steamroll CH 121-3
Defending champions Kandy Sports Club scored 19 tries at the Nittawela grounds yesterday to beat CH & FC by a cricket score of 121 points (19 tries, 13 conversions) to 3 (1 penalty) in a one-sided Clifford Cup quarterfinal match. This could be the highest score in a Clifford Cup game. At half time Kandy led 57-0.
It is the third time this season Kandy has over run CH & FC the first two occasions being in the league where they piled up a half a century of points on each occasion. The visitors tried their best to put up a strong fight but failed to do so with the home team handling the ball well. Whatever said done Kandy turned the screw in the 80 minute game and began to rack up the points as CH & FC faded into oblivion.
CH & FC at one time dominated the game, but they didnt have the strength of past teams to give a good fight to Kandy.
Kandy started the game strongly and dominated the proceedings in the scrums and line outs successfully by controlling most of the possession and obtaining territorial advantage. Kandy was better than CH & FC in many areas, and the strength of this side was in their fitness, co-ordination and ability to play under pressure. Kandy gave it their best shot from the kick off with some intelligent rugby. They completed their job by scoring good tries and were outstanding; looking every bit the best team in the competition.
The scorers for Kandy SC were Richard Dharmapala and Vishvamithra Jayasinghe (4 tries each), Arshad Jamaldeen and Danushka Ranjan (2 each) and one each from Yakoob Ali, Tharindu Chathuranga, Roshan Weeraratne, Thilina Wijesinghe, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Lavanga Perera and Buwaneka Udangamuwa. Wijesinghe put over 10 conversions. Jamaldeen 2 and Yakoob Ali 1. CH & FCs penalty was put over by Shamli Buhra.

The minister further said that they have not forgotten the marginalised group,the low and middle income earners of urban society.
While allowing development for those who look for luxury,we have already commenced housing programmes for the needy. More than 5,000 housing units for middle income earners and another 15 000 housing units for low income earners have been planned. We have done everything in a very democratic and transparent manner although there is criticism,he said.
Minister Ranawaka also pointed out that unless the relevant authorities attend to a few burning issues in the urban areas none of these development projects will be fruitful.
The urban areas have many issues related to drainage, sewerage disposal and solid waste; those should have been addressed long time back. We have already implemented a project for flood control and a national water management center also will be established, he said.
The minister added that the transportation and mobility issues that we have in this region needs to be sorted out immediately.
In order to uplift the quality of life of the people in Colombo and its surroundings, it is not merely a matter of providing a few more houses and employment opportunities, but providing opportunities and exposure to improve the peoples social, cultural and spiritual well-being,he said.

Cook had toughest ride as skipper
Alastair Cook never had it easy. He's had the toughest ride of all recent England captains.
As England's highest Test run-scorer he has always been admired for his batting, but there have always been questions, particularly over his tactics, during his 59-match reign as skipper.
In a funny way, the constant criticism forced him to improve, to reflect on the things he had not done well and to try new things. I put this to him once and he laughed it off, but I still disagree.
He has been stubborn - an excellent quality for an opening batsman, not always ideal in a captain - and largely cautious, which is hardly surprising considering his mentor was predecessor Andrew Strauss, another skipper that favoured the attritional approach.
The most difficult time for Cook was in 2014, which began with the Ashes whitewash down under, moved on to the Kevin Pietersen saga and was followed by a home series defeat by Sri Lanka.
He found a measure of redemption in the subsequent victory over the touring India side, but the year still ended with him being sacked as one-day captain.
To this day, he thinks that was the wrong decision, but he is in a minority. He was no longer worth his place in the side and he had to go. It also may have aided England's bid to regain the Ashes in 2015, which few at the time gave them much hope of doing. That success, to go with Cook's 2013 Ashes win as skipper is a highlight of his reign. So too, the triumph in South Africa in 2015-16 and the historic win in India in 2012, England's first there in 27 years. Time will prove what a good result that was - England are miles away from doing it again.
But there were also the disappointments. As well as the thumping in Australia and the loss to Sri Lanka, there was a defeat by India at Lord's on a made-to-order green seamer and a 1-1 draw away to a poor West Indies team.
Cook's winning percentage of 40.67 is only the fourth best of the six captains to have led England in more than 40 Tests. The two skippers with a worse record, Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain, did not have the world-class talents of Pietersen, Graeme Swann, James Anderson and Stuart Broad, or the emerging Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow at their disposal. It has been an up-and-down ride.
Will Cook be defined by the way in which Pietersen's international career was ended The two men will inevitably always be linked, but that would be to ignore the fact that Cook welcomed Pietersen back into the England side when many captains in his position could have quite easily taken the opposite stance.
When Cook took over in 2012, Pietersen was in exile for his part in text messages sent to the South Africa team about former skipper Strauss. Cook oversaw Pietersen's reintegration and the star batsman responded, playing a pivotal role in that triumph in India. But, as we now know, the relationship deteriorated on the fateful tour of Australia a year later, with Cook eventually having a hand in Pietersen's international career being ended. Some will say that there was nothing that Cook could have done, others will think that the captain should have seen those problems approaching and done more to manage them. What is unarguable is that the vitriol that Cook faced on social media from certain individuals in the aftermath of the Pietersen affair was nasty, personal and uncalled for. Views were expressed, most of them by people who do not know Cook. Lots of them were depressing. - BBC

CPMC against politicos move to legalise SAITM
The Centre Against Private Medical Colleges (CPMC) said yesterday that they are against the attempts by certain government politicians to make the SAITM a legitimate institution which is illegal and corrupt in operation.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, CPMC's Co-Convener Dr. Jayantha Bandara said Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella is trying to use his powers to get Deans of Medical faculties on his side.
The Minister has no powers to summon Medical Faculty Deans to get their consent for the SAITM. Deans in eight Medical Faculties have been appointed not to look after the SAITM, but to work for the progress of their faculties. It is revealed that only four of the eight Deans have attended the discussions.
"Although the minister said that deans have agreed to submit proposals on the SAITM, it is wrong. Deans and lecturers have called for the closure of the SAITM," Bandara said.
"Those who supported the SAITM say it has a qualified teaching staff. This is wrong. According to law, state university lecturers and government doctors cannot teach in private medical colleges. However, we learn that there are several such people in the SAITM, including some who have been banished from foreign countries. We will take legal action against them, he said.

Dambulla rock temple left to decay
The Dambulla rock temple which is a world heritage, is in a deplorable state due to the lack of maintenance and conservation.
The history of the rock temple dates back to 2000 years. King Walagambahu is considered to be the founder of the cave temple. The caves were used by the king as his hide out.
A stupa was later constructed enshrining the gold ornaments of Somadevi. It is known as Samadevi cheitya.
Sinhalese kings and provincial leaders developed this historic place.
The inscription of King Nissankamalla is visible at the entrance to the temple. The murals and hood pictures of shrine rooms spread over 22,000 square feet.
It is the largest cave consisting of murals in South Asia, archaeologists said.
The murals of the caves are fading.
The paintings have cracks and peeled off owing to the lack of maintenance.

Deliberate disrupting of Constitutional Reform procedures:Hakeem
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said the Joint Oppositions (JO) decision to resign from the Constitutional Reforms Steering Committee(CRSC), had clearly emphasized that JO was deliberately engaged in disrupting the Constitutional Reforms procedure.
Hakeem also said that United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dinesh Gunawardenas statement of disregarding JOs views and opinions in the Constitutional Reforms procedure was no more than a falsification.
He was speaking at the launching ceremony of the book in relation to the Kandy and Suburban water supply project to be implemented with financial aid from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) at Tourmaline Hotel in Kandy yesterday. Minister Hakeem said that decisions on the contents of the Constitution had not been finalised yet, while several parliamentarians had been allowed to present their suggestions to the Constitutional reforms Sub-committees to the steering committee are being dissolved already, he added.
Hakeem further said that amendments of Local Government elections would result in an increase of councillors by three fold from the present number and attention should be given in relation to whether the Treasury could bear the increase in councillors.
Minister Hakeem also said that there were over 50 amendments to the Local Government elections and that there were significant errors in the Delimitation Committee report. It would also be inequitable for small political parties under the amended Local Government electoral system, he added.
He said that amended Local Government electoral system is a combination of proportional electoral system and first past the post electoral system. Though it was said that there is capability to conduct this hybrid electoral system by 30% , the actual chance would be 23%, he added.

England Lions dominate first day of unofficial test
Toby Roland-Jones struck 82 from No. 9 and then claimed two wickets in his first over as Sri Lanka A slipped to 29 for 4 in reply to England Lions first-innings 316 on the first day of the first four-day unofficial test at Pallekele Stadium yesterday.
The Lions had recovered from 61 for 3 and 210 for 8 to post a substantial score before ripping into the hosts top order.
Having chosen to bat, the Lions lost Haseeb Hameed and Nick Gubbins in the opening four overs, Asitha Fernando striking twice. Keaton Jennings, captaining the tourists, then fell to Sri Lanka Test offspinner Dilruwan Perera for 23 before lunch, bowled attempting to reverse-sweep. Tom Westley, who made 95 in a warm-up game earlier in the week, helped fashion a recovery in partnership with Liam Livingstone, as the fourth-wicket pair put on 126 in 27 overs. Westley struck 14 fours and a six but fell short of a century when hooking Kasun Rajitha to a deep leg slip; Livingstone also departed three overs later, the first of four wickets for Malinda Pushpakumara.
Pushpakumara struck either side of tea, removing Sam Curran, Tom Curran and Ben Foakes cheaply, as the Lions lost 5 for 21 to squander some of their advantage.
Sri Lanka A were unable to wrap up the innings quickly, though, as Ollie Rayner  selected ahead of Jack Leach - helped add 38 for the ninth wicket and then No. 11 Tom Helm held up an end in a stand of 68 as Roland-Jones thumped eight fours and three sixes before being last out.
Sri Lanka A fielded several players with Test match experience, including the openers, Udara Jayasundera and Dimuth Karunaratne. Both had been dismissed inside eight deliveries, however, and Roland-Jones quickly picked up his second wicket - both dismissals lbw - to leave Sri Lanka A 12 for 3.
Sandun Weerakkody, who made his international debut on the recent tour of South Africa, briefly steadied the innings but, with the close looming, saw Roshen Silva edge Helm behind - another first-over wicket - to leave the Lions well on top.
Scores:
England Lions 316 in 80.2 overs (K Jennings 23, T Westley 97, L Livingstone 59, T Roland-Jones 82, A Fernando 2/31, M Pushpakumara 4/97)

Foundation of Goodness Empowerment Centre opens in Mathagal, Jaffna
Here is a reconciliation story that makes a difference. When Rajiv and Kiran Radhakrishnan in the UK offered their ancestral property inheritance to be gifted for the community to benefit, after having followed closely the Foundation for Goodness humanitarian endeavors it resulted in the opening of the Foundation of Goodness 7th Village Heartbeat Project Empowerment Centre in Mathagal, Jaffna. This is the kind of example that we need to showcase and bear testimony to the South - North reconciliation initiative, as we believe that both parties together can make that major difference towards rebuilding a shattered community.
Imagine in today's world, when people are reluctant to let go, care & share this couple Rajiv and Kiran were willing to part with their property near the ocean for the benefit of rural disadvantaged to prosper in life. What an amazing blessing that only a few are capable of doing.
Then came our co-trustee AshanMalalasekera, Chairman of Arinma Holdings, who made sure this project creates the flight path that it needs to ascend, understanding the vision of all our other Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centres towards empowering rural students, bridging the gap and helping to make better progress. His unconditional gifting of the total building cost to make this dream of the 7th VHP empowerment initiative materialize is again very unique, generous, considerate and rare.
The Mathagal VHP Centre offers Computer/ IT, English Language, Sinhala Language, Science, Mathematics, Women's Enterprise & Empowerment and Volleyball programmes to the 280 children, youth and women currently enrolled from among eight surrounding villages who find it difficult to access educational and vocational resources to develop their skills.
The Centre also has a library to help the beneficiaries broaden their knowledge base and is home to a Children's Goodness Club to ensure that the children and youth attending programmes understand the importance of doing good deeds that can help and benefit their community, for a brighter future.
The architectural drawing to resurrect the building where the VHP Centre is located were done by renowned architect, Mr. Anjalendran, free of cost.
The longevity and success of this Centre is secured through the kind sustainability sponsorship of a group of donors who are eager to give rural but talented beneficiaries a chance to prosper. Dr. SangarapillaiNagendran from USA has been a strong donor and supporter of the Foundation of Goodness for many years, with special care for promoting the educational success as a building block for a secure and prosperous future, such as through FoG Essential School Supplies Programme, and presenting bikes to students in the North and East who walk incredibly long distances just to get to school.
Together with his brother Dr. SangarapillaiAsokan also from USA and friends Dr. Anton Sebastiampillai and Mr. Emil Kumar, both from UK, as well Ms. RashanthaDevanesan from Singapore they make up the exceptional group of people who stepped up to cover the sustainability cost of running the centre and all its programmes so that more and more villagers will have the opportunity to realize their dreams.
The Foundation of Goodness first introduced its Village Heartbeat Project concept to bring Empowerment Centres offering a selection of its key courses and programmes to distant rural villages where opportunities and access to resources is scarce.
Many of the courses offered at the VHP Centres are crucial for the development of women, children and youth, giving them the opportunity to build their talents and gain more skills.
The aim here is to give these groups an opportunity to take control of their future, rather than to remain victims of circumstance, by providing them with the necessary tools for success.
FoG's very first Village Heartbeat Centre opened in Udumulla - Galle District (2007) followed by five more in Rathgama - Galle District (2010), Hingurukaduwa - Moneragala District (2014), Gandara - Matara District (2016), Eravur -Batticaloa District (2016) and Thirukkovil - Ampara District (2016).
Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to the extraordinary people who made this milestone achievement a reality, out of love and compassion for others in need to attain a better life.
The Foundation of Goodness was established in 1999 and has worked extensively following the 2004 tsunami that devastated the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans to develop a one of a kind holistic rural community development model which today delivers a wide range of programmes to over 35,000 beneficiaries from 200+ villagers in the South, North and East of Sri Lanka annually, free of charge, via our 30 empowerment activity sectors.
When the years of conflict came to an end, the Foundation of Goodness extended its development activities to the post-war North and East of Sri Lanka and have been working in the North since January 2011, reaching over 34,000 beneficiaries to date, with uninterrupted monthly visits to introduce, maintain and expand a variety of welfare and development programmes.

FR filed against PMs remarks over Sinharasa case dismissed
The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with the Fundamental Rights petition filed by a lawyer seeking Interim Relief with a direction to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to suspend any further action on the request made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, urging a ruling from the Speaker on the constitutionality of a Supreme Court Judgement popularly known as the Sinharasa case.While refusing to grant leave to proceed with the case,a three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Priyasath Dep,Justice Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne upheld the preliminary objections raised by Attorney General that the Court should not interfere with the affairs of Parliament in accordance with the section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.
The petitioner Nagananda Kodituwakku, an Attorney-at-Law by profession filed this petition naming Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, President Maithripala Sirisena through the Attorney General and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as respondents.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court, Presidents Counsel K.Kanageswaran appearing for the Prime Minister raised preliminary objections regarding the petition citing that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to intervene into the affairs of Parliament.
The Petitioner stated that on the July 7,2016, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, requested a Ruling from the Speaker on the constitutionality of the Supreme Court Judgment (SC/SPL/LA/182/99) - popularly known as the Singrasa case on the basis that the jurisdiction for constitutional competence of the President to acceded to the optional protocol of the ICCPR is with Parliament and not with the Supreme Court.
The Petitioner stated in this backdrop the statement of the Prime Minister and the action proposed by him, becomes a direct violation of the inalienable sovereign rights of the people, enshrined in Article 3 of the Constitution. The petitioner further said failing to prevent the course of action demanded by the Prime Minister, it shall be a breach of petitioners Fundamental Rights and rights of the other citizenry of the Republic guaranteed by the said Article 12(1).
The Supreme Court in the Singarasa case agreed that the government of Sri Lanka had set out the correct legal position which stated its responsibility to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) as follow.
The constitution of Sri Lanka and the prevailing legal regime do not provide for release or retrial of a convicted person after his conviction is confirmed by the higher appellate Court. Therefore the state does not have the legal authority to execute the decisions of the HRC to release the convict or grant a retrial. The government of Sri Lanka cannot be expected to act in any manner which is contrary to the constitution.

His longest drought.... : Cristiano Ronaldo goes 523 minutes without scoring
Cristiano Ronaldo has endured his longest Champions League goal drought at Real Madrid having failed to score in the competition for 523 minutes.
The talisman has scored just two goals in this seasons Champions League, in Reals first two group games against Sporting Lisbon and Borussia Dortmund and his barren run was extended on Wednesday night.
Ronaldo failed to score in Madrids 3-1 victory over Napoli in the last 16 and has now gone over 500 minutes without finding the net in Europes elite competition.
The Portuguese will be desperate to score when Real travel to Italy for the second leg on March 7.
However, while Ronaldo failed to get his name on the scoresheet, he has provided five assists in the Champions League already this season - the most hes registered in a single campaign for Los Blancos.
The No 7 did excellently to beat his man and work his way into the area before expertly dragging the ball to Toni Kroos on the edge of the area who passed the ball into the bottom corner.
While Ronaldo has struggled for goals this season, he remains the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with 95 and has been joined by team-mate Karim Benzema in the top five.
The Frenchman scored a powerful header against Napoli to score his 51st Champions League goal and in doing so, leapfrogged compatriot Thierry Henry in the all-time table.
Lionel Messi is second in the list on 93 goals with former Real striker Raul third with 71 strikes. Ex-Manchester United frontman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fourth with 56. - Daily Mail

Homophobia in sport:: English Rugby Union praised for tackling abuse
English rugby has been praised for clamping down on homophobia in the sport, though a leading gay referee warns there is still work to be done in eradicating the problem.
A British government select committee released a report Sunday investigating the prevalence of homophobia in UK sport and how the ruling bodies were dealing with it.
It said soccer clubs in particular are not doing enough and should take a tougher approach and compared them unfavorably to the stance of the English Rugby Union (RFU).
In November 2014, two rugby fans were banned for two years and each ordered to pay 1,000 ($1,250) to a charity of gay referee Nigel Owens choice after the Welshman was verbally abused while officiating an international match between England and Wales at Twickenham.
I dont think rugby can take the moral high ground ... but it does better address those issues than a lot of other sports do, Owens told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in his testimony.
When that instance in Twickenham was brought to the attention of the RFU, it was dealt with.
As far as homophobia goes, there are some issues in rugby that need to be addressed and need to be eradicated, but I think rugby is aware of those problems and it does all it can to eradicate them.
No place in our sport
The committee also praised rugby unions rival code rugby league for its response when openly gay player Keegan Hirst received homophobic abuse on Twitter after a game in September 2016.
His club at the time, Batley Bulldogs, banned the supporter from its stadium.
There is no place in our sport for homophobic abuse or indeed any abuse and we wish to send out a clear message, the club said.
Significant progress
The committee said rugby union, along with sports such as swimming and diving, had made significant progress in increasing the visibility of gay participants.
The RFU said it supported nine gay rugby clubs across England, and planned to bid for the right to again stage the biennial international Bingham Cup tournament -- an amateur gay rugby union tournament -- which was held in Manchester in 2012.
It said its We Call It Rugby campaign featured an advert aimed at breaking down barriers for LGBT people, profiling the gay and inclusive Manchester Spartans club, and overall the series of videos had reached almost 35 million people through outdoor advertising, social media and television.
The campaign was aimed at 16- to 24-year-olds, an age group the committee said was notable for gay athletes dropping out of their sports.
It appears that young players and athletes sometimes feel that they have to make the active choice between either coming out or continuing to participate in their chosen sport, it said.
As a result, players and athletes either drop out of sport together or, as has been the case with some professional sportspeople, they wait until after retirement to come out.
A personal and private decision
While the rugby codes have had openly gay professionals such as Hirst and former Wales captain Gareth Thomas, the committee noted that elite UK football has no active out players.
Englands Football Association said homophobia is an issue that we take very seriously and was one of chairman Greg Clarkes top priorities.
Robbie Rogers did come out after leaving English club Leeds, but only returned to the game in his native US with the Los Angeles Galaxy. In 2014, former Premier League star Thomas Hitzlsperger announced he was gay months after retiring.
Justin Fashanu was the first black English footballer to command a 1 million transfer fee, in 1981, but he never played for another top-level team after publicly coming out nine years later.
From the evidence we have received in this inquiry, we believe there are many gay athletes who have not come out, because they are frightened of the impact this decision will have on their careers, and the lives of the people they love, chair of the committee, MP Damian Collins, said in a statement.
That is not acceptable and should not be tolerated.
Collins added: Coming out is a personal and private decision and no sportsperson should feel under pressure or feel forced to come out, but sports authorities must create an environment, in the stadium and the locker room, where players and athletes at all levels feel it is a choice they can make, and that they will be supported and accepted if they do. The Premier League and the Football League -- the organization that regulates the 72 clubs outside the top flight -- said they were committed to creating a welcoming environment. Both cited the support they had given to an app thats designed to ensure a zero-tolerance approach to abuse.
The League and our clubs do a range of work to promote equality and diversity in our competition and across the sport, said the Premier League in a statement, adding that the LGBT community is a vital and integral part of our community. More needs to be done by the authorities to address both the overt and latent homophobia that exists within sport. - CNN

India, South Africa book places in ICC Womens WC 2017
India and South Africa completed comprehensive victories in the ICC Womens World Cup Qualifier 2017 yesterday to become the first two teams from the tournament to qualify for the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 to be held in England and Wales from 24 June to 23 July.
India scored a nine-wicket win over Bangladesh to maintain an unbeaten record in the tournament and take its Super Six points tally to eight, including for two wins against other qualifiers from its preliminary league group, points of which are carried over.
South Africa beat host Sri Lanka by nine wickets to go up to six points, which will take it through since the chances of a five-way tie are eliminated after yesterdays result.
In another match, Pakistan scored an 86-run win over Ireland and kept in contention for the remaining two qualifying spots with four points, the same as Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka who scored a creditable win over Pakistan two days ago, were outplayed yesterday at the P Sara Oval by South Africa and their chances of qualifying for the World Cup will depend heavily on their final game against Bangladesh on Sunday.
Winning the toss and batting first Sri Lanka could muster only a poor 142-9 in 50 overs the batting falling to the leg-spin of Sune Luus and captain Dane van Niekerk who between them shared five scalps.
Top scorer for Sri Lanka was opener Nipuni Hansika with a composed 48 off 96 balls.
South African made short work of the target of 143 getting theier in 36.1 overs with Luus producing a fine all-round performance following her figures of 3 for 40 with an unbeaten half century to take the Player of the Match award.
OTHER MATCHES
At the NCC grounds India made short work of its challenge as it restricted Bangladesh to 155 for eight with pace bowler Mansi Joshi and leg-spinner Devika Vaidya keeping control through the innings, sharing five scalps. Fargana Hoque top-scored for Bangladesh with 50.
India got to 158 for one in 33.3 overs with opener Mona Meshram striking a career-best 78 not out with 12 fours to take the Player of the Match award and captain Mithali Raj compiling 73 not out with 10 fours for a 43rd ODI half-century.
In another match at the CCC grounds, Pakistan put up a determined effort to post an intimidating 271 for five after electing to bat against Ireland.
In-form batters Javeria Khan (90 not out) and opener Nahida Khan (72) played positively for their second consecutive half-centuries after scoring 64 and 63, respectively, in a loss against Sri Lanka.
Javeria struck 14 fours and Nahida hit 10 fours in her career-best knock as the pair figured in a 138-run second-wicket partnership.
Nain Abidi also chipped in with a brisk 44 to help push Ireland out of contention for a top-four berth since it has no points in the Super Six with only one match to go.
Ireland was bowled out for 185 with a 74-run second-wicket stand between Cecelia Joyce (41) and Kim Garth (33) being the high point of the innings. For Pakistan, leg-spinner Nashra Sandhu, left-arm spinner Sadia Yousuf and captain and off-spinner Sana Mir all grabbed two wickets each.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP: Discipline - key to Kandys success
Dedication of the players, the discipline they followed and the support they got from the superiors and the vociferous fans was what really made our team a formidable force in rugby, said chairman of Kandy Sports Club rugby Lasantha Wijesuriya, a former St. Anthonys College, Outstation Schools, Combined Schools, CH & FC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka back division player and the first to lead the Nittawela club to become unbeaten triple champions. Considering the immense success Kandy ruggerites have achieved, Wijesuriya described by many as a top gentleman in rugby further said. With my experience I was able to get things done, because being dedicated I had excellent players to guide. Wijesuriya didnt want to single out any particular player but had some encouraging words for the entire squad. Lasantha took over the mantle of chairmanship over 15 years ago. He gave a prompt answer when asked how and why Kandy SC has been able to reign for so long. When I took over as chairman things were not new to me, because I was player, captain and coach. I know about every players rugby and most of the players have played for many years for my club. Briefly it is a continuation, when some player moves out I get a similar replacement. Commanding a rugby force around 40 players has been a pleasure for Lasantha who hails some of the other players in clubs as being dedicated to their task, but regretted they dont get enough team support. But he was quick to reason out as to why no side has been able to beat his men in the second round. He said that Kandy has got that physical strength needed for a game of this sort and it wouldnt be fair to single out rival players who make a vain attempt to match them. My men are physically strong; they can last the pace, resist any onslaught and have got the stamina. As for the future of Kandy S.C. rugby he was optimistic of his men keeping the flame burning bright for many more years. He also thanked the Kandy Sports Club members, fans and the media for all the support they have given them.

School cricket
Schools in Kandy are experiencing difficulties trying to find venues. Except for three schools, eight schools are finding it difficult to play matches - one is no grounds the other the ground fees is five star rate. Kandy has a number of talented players than required, but lacks playing facilities. The Antonians-Josephian game played at Katugastota ended in a draw. The Peterite game played in Colombo was a draw. The P.W.Perera trophy game between Rajans and Anandians was also drawn. The trophy was retained by Ananda as the match was drawn. At Asgiriya the Tinitity-Isipatana game too was drawn.

One time he was the president of the famous 80 club. He was a frequent visitor to Kandy, mostly for sports. He was a sportsman, sports lover and promoter. He was a famous figure in the scouting circle and was a long standing commissioner of scouting. He was involved in many jamborees.

The Asian Rugby will cover ground costs of accommodation and food. The Referees controlling body in Sri Lanka has come forward to pay the passage for Jayasinghe, but sad to say Gunaratne is still without a sponsor for his ticket nd his visit is in the balance. A few days back a lady official from the Japan Rugby Union Aiya Nakumar came to Kandy to evaluate their Rugby Volunteer Coach Yuri Itaco who is stationed in Kandy. She met some of the officials of the CPRFU and had a long discussion. She said that Japan offers several rugby development workshops and would invite young and good prospects from Sri Lanka, they should be of good standard, currently involved in rugby coaching in the schools sector with the knowledge of English to gather what is conducted at the work-shop. Sending someone with past records will not be sufficient as all rugby coaching trends have changed and good material should be sent so that they come back and share their experience they had at the workshop.

KIA scrums down with Royal Rugby for 6th consecutive year
The rugby development programme of Royal College will continue to be supported in 2017 by top Korean automobile brand Kia under a sponsorship deal ratified in Colombo recently.
This is the sixth consecutive year that Kia is backing the Reid Avenue boys as sole team sponsor and the third year of its Rs 27 million sponsorship that encompasses the colleges first XV as well as the Under 14, Under 16 and Under 18 rugby teams.
KIAs sponsorship agreement was signed at the Royal Sports Complex by the directors of KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited and the Chairman and members of the Royal College Rugby Advisory Committee.
Our support to Royal Rugby has given us a great deal of satisfaction, Kia Motors (Lanka) Managing Director Mahen Thambiah said.
The teams are playing well and the development of younger players is making good progress. These are not the best of times for the automobile sector in Sri Lanka, but Kia not a fair weather friend. We are committed to the success of Royal Rugby and look forward to witness some inspiring performances from the boys this year.
Sports have long been an unwavering passion for Kia Motors, which believes in the power of sports to move the world, Thambiah added. In support of the passion, performance, and touching moments that sports competitions offer, Kia is wholeheartedly involved in sponsorship activities for athletes and major and minor sporting events worldwide.

The sponsorship will cover almost all aspects including nourishment and other facilities for players and we have launched a long term programme to uplift the sport at Royal College.
Royal has produced some ruggerites who went on to shine in national and international rugby arena and above all we want to inculcate values and qualities of rugby in Royalists, so they will mould into good citizens, Rohantha explained.
Royal Colleges first XV retained the Bradby Shield in 2016 after the double header against arch rivals Trinity College was tied 35 each, and retained the B. C. Anghie Trophy defeating St. Peters College 33 - 24.
The team relinquished the Michael Gunaratne Trophy and the Milroy Fernando Trophy, but gave fans much to cheer about with many memorable games, including a nail biting draw against St. Josephs College in the Singer League, in which it took third place.
Royal College was also the runner-up in the 2016 all island Milo Presidents Trophy knockout tournament.
The Royal College First XV team will be captained by fly half Ovin Seniya Askey in 2017 and have eight coloursmen. Having taken part in promoting some of the most highly anticipated events such as the Australian Open tennis championship, the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship, Kia is committed to furthering the development of sports around the world. Rafael Nadal, one of the greatest tennis players of the modern era, is KIAs Global Brand Ambassador. In Sri Lanka, KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited, has represented the KIA brand as sole agent since 1996.

Lankan fishing boat found abandoned in Indian waters
The Indian Marine Police of the Coastal Security Group seized a Sri Lankan fibreglass boat found abandoned about six nautical miles south of Mukuntharayar, Chathiram coast near Dhanushkodi on Thursday.
On being alerted by local fishermen, a Marine Police team reached the spot in a boat in the afternoon and towed the fishing boat back to Mukuntharayar Chathiram. The boat measured 18 feet in length and six feet in width, he said. Kumar said the boat had the registration number OFRP-A-4044-NBO, indicating that it could belong to fishermen at Negombo. A fishing net and a plastic cane, containing about 10 litres of kerosene, were found in the engine-fitted boat, he said. As the boat had a hole in the rear side, apparently caused after it met with an accident, the fishermen might have drifted into Indian waters.
As seawater seeped into the boat and they could not take it back, they could have abandoned it and returned in some other boat, he said.
The police were also investigating whether the boat was used for any smuggling activity or drop Sri Lankan Tamils, he said. The Hindu

Manic Russian thugs target England fans at World Cup 2018
Across the river from the Rostov Arena, which will stage five matches at next years World Cup, a Russian football hooligan offers a chilling warning to Englands travelling fans.
For some it will be a festival of football, for others it will be a festival of violence.
It is the concluding line in a horrifying hour-long BBCdocumentary to be aired on Thursday night. The film tracks down the perpetrators of violence inflicted on England supporters in Marseille last summer and looks at what these highly organised, expertly trained gangs have planned for a tournament on their own turf.
Wearing a mask, the man who claims to be the leader of the 200 professionals against 2,000 amateurs on Marseilles streets - a martial arts specialist, a member of the Orel Butchers and a fluent English speaker - suggests any England supporters travelling among other male fans should calculate on getting their a**** kicked.
In the same interview he boasts with pride that he kicked an England fan squarely in the head in the Battle of Marseille, surmising that his victim might have been one of the two left in comas.
Film-maker Alex Stockley von Statzer gains extraordinary access to these Russian ultras, filming their boxing gym-style training sessions and organised, illegal forest fights against gangs from other football clubs.
A hooligan is captured stamping repeatedly on the head of a rival, only to then help his opponent to his feet and shake his hand when the senior members of the gangs call time on the barbaric encounter. One of the leaders says it is not their intention to leave the young men crippled in these fights but to nurture them for the World Cup.
The Russians revere the thuggish element of Englands supporters. They are the forefathers of hooliganism, declares one gang member and this, the film explains, is why they will be targeted next summer. The English represent the ultimate scalp.
There are links, claims Stockley von Statzer, between the hooligans and President Vladimir Putins government. A man called Vasily The Killer, the head of the Nazi-saluting Mad Butchers of Spartak Moscow, claims the 150 Spartans who terrorised Marseille were special military forces of football hooligans sent by Vladimir Putin to conquer Europe.
The current state of todays English hooligans is the same as your western culture and civilisation, adds Vasily. I mean deep in the garbage bin.
An unnamed Russian hooligan says: I am going to give some free advice to the guys that might come here. Learn the history of our country. We are at war every hundred years. We are natural born warriors, its in our blood, but come to this country with a sword and you will die by that sword.
Putin has promised that the 2018 World Cup will be up to the highest standards and the man who claims to have led the gangs in Marseille believes the Russian authorities will move to lock them down ahead of the World Cup.
But previous attempts to address hooliganism have not proved successful. A response to widespread violence in the 1990s was the formation of the All Russian Fans Association.
According to the film, an official ARFA charter flight from Moscow to Marseille carried many of the thugs involved in the running battles with England fans and three board members were jailed in France, one for two years.
ARFA has been shut down and its leader, Alexander Shprygin, was arrested on his return from France. But it is with more than a hint of pride that he reflects on the sickening events at Euro 2016.
For 20 years since the Soviet Union has collapsed a new generation of Russian citizen has grown and among those who were on the plane to Marseille were champions in combat fights. The English were fighting a trained machine that swept them away. - Daily Mail

NARA to investigate complaints
The National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) has been asked to investigate whether the hot water pumped out of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant and into the sea is affecting marine life in the area. Environmental groups and the fisher community have complained to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry about the damage caused by the hot water from Norochcholai and asked that NARA investigate into it.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera chaired a special meeting on the subject with ministry officials, NARA, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the North Western Provincial Council Fisheries Ministry to discuss the issue.As a result, NARA has started investigations into whether the hot water from Norochcholai was affecting the fisheries, aquatic plants and sea bed around Norochcholai coal power plant.
The minister has asked that the investigation be continued and for the North Western Provincial Ministry, North Western Environment Unit and the CEB to assist the study.
NARA has also been asked to study whether the dust from the coal power plant was affecting the fisher community in the area and to come up with recommendations on how the impact could be minimized and alternatives found to help the people.
The minister has asked that they come up with ways in which they could also cool the water and then release it to the ocean instead of directly releasing hot water.

New emphasis on private sector in Higher Education
Moving away from other issues grabbing political attention in recent weeks, the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine  SAITM  continued to grab the headlines this week, showing importance of the private sectors role in the wider field of education, and the possibility of the SAITM issue bringing about new understanding on both private and public education.
University students and teachers, and Government Medical Officers, maintained their opposition to SAITM, and the decision of the Court of Appeal on the provisional registration of SAITM students by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) became a new focus of debate. Despite the Minister of Higher Education calling on the SLMC to implement the Appeal Court Order without delay, there are signs that the SAITM issue could be moving towards a reasonable solution. President Sirisenas statement that he would not allow any unfair action on any students with regard to this issue, was a welcome healing balm, which has helped take the issue towards resolution by negotiation.
The Ministry of Higher Educations call on SAITM to suspend admission for six months while a periodic review of its medical programme is conducted, coming after a meeting with the Deans of eight Medical Faculties in the country, is seen as an approach that could bring about better understanding on an issue that is politically heated.
Of much significance are the suggestions by these Deans of Medical Faculties  of the Colombo, Ragama, Karapitiya, Rajarata, Batticaloa, Peradeniya, Jaffna and Sri Jayawardenepura universities  that go beyond the immediate SAITM issue, and cover the wider standards of medical institutions in the country. Of much importance is their pointing out that the SLMC must remain the authorized institution that decides on the standards of medical doctors, and that its independence should be safeguarded. They also noted the necessity for Parliament to legalize the minimum standards for training in medical colleges in the island, and in this context saw it imperative for the Health Minister to present to Parliament the related standards recommended by the SLMC.
The wider issue
The SAITM issue in its current dispute has brought forward the wider issue of the role of the private sector in higher education, especially medical education, as well as the role of Private-Public Partnership in such education. It calls on those who plan the progress of education to consider the actual needs of the people, in an area of service where Sri Lanka had held a leading position in South Asia and beyond too for many decades, but where we are rapidly losing that status. It is the view of many academics, who have seen the steady decline in the standards of our universities, that the current situation raises questions about the university entrance system, the District Quotas, and importantly, the opportunities available to those who are not able to enter the state universities.
In the context of the new trends on handling the SAITM issue, the government will have to pay attention to how it will have a control of the anti-SAITM campaigning of the GMOA, the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). This will not be easy in the context of their commitments against SAITM, and is not helped by the continuing attacks on state universities by SAITM teachers, as well as, the harsh allegations being made by leading members of SAITM against the SLMC. The Ministries of Higher Education and Health will be required to take special initiatives to bring about a proper negotiated solution on the SAITM and private higher education issues through a better understanding of these matters by the public.
The necessity for this is highlighted by the news of the Minister of Higher Education Kiriella presenting a Cabinet Paper for the establishing of a foreign university in the Kalutara District. What is said to be US $ 75 million investment, this is expected to be built on 100 acres of land, and will be a non-state degree awarding institution, as a branch of Indias Manipal University. This is certainly an indication of a new area of private investment in the country, and will lay emphasis on the necessity for the SAITM issue to be resolved with the least delay, and the best understanding among all parties.
The MR twist
The politics of SAITM has given an ignominious and disgraceful twist to the politics of Mahinda Rajapaksa, in what seems to be a desperate hunt for popularity. In his recent statement outside the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court, MR, who had come to that court where his brother Gotabhaya was summoned for the Avant Garde Armoury Case, said his government had given approval for the functioning of SAITM based on certain conditions.
There is no record of any such conditions being imposed by the Rajapaksa Regime. Instead, there is every sign of outright support for SAITM, with several scholarships for SAITM students named after him, and the approvals of the various examinations at SAITM in those years, by the University Grants Commission, when it had little signs of being an independent body. There is also the record of how MRs son, Namal Rajapaksa, was received with such grandeur at SAITM, by both staff and students, when he came there for what was supposed to be an observation visit.
Mahinda Rajapaksa is today the subject of many cartoons in newspapers that even support his policies on other issues, over this complete twist on the SAITM issue. There are also many editorial comments, even from media outlets that support MR and the Joint Opposition on other issues, on his wholly unexpected change of policy, with a clear search for popularity at any cost.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did make an important and historic visit to Australia this week, in an outing that sought to widen and strengthen Sri Lankas current efforts to be an economic and financial hub in the Indian Ocean. A strong policy initiative of the PM, this seeks to strengthen bi-lateral, economic, political and social ties with countries of the Indian Ocean region, and Australia certainly has an important role in this.
The historical significance of this visit is that it is the first visit by a Sri Lankan Prime Minister to Australia since the visit there by Sir John Kotelawala in 1954. The two countries have maintained good relations, with much of this to do with Cricket. But PM Wickremesinghes current visit did make a difference with the assurances from Aussie Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that his country will assist the new economic reconstruction programme launched by Sri Lanka. This is of much significance for this country as it seeks to bring new investment and mark a rise in its importance from its strategic location in the Indian Ocean.
Prime Minster Turnbull was strong in his praise for Sri Lanka for the constant support extended to Australia to combat human smuggling and illegal immigration. There was attention drawn towards improving and widening regional trade and investment opportunities in keeping with the declaration of the Commonwealth, when it met in Sri Lanka.
Both parties agreed that current bilateral cooperation in the Education and Security sectors should be widened, with special attention to the sphere of maritime security, which is of much significance to Sri Lanka. The discussion between the two Prime Ministers and their delegations paid much attention to improving investment opportunities in Sri Lankas agricultural sector, the mining, energy and technology sectors, which are of much importance to the country in its strategies for progress.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also made an important statement that asylum seekers from Sri Lanka now held in special centres in the Pacific Islands are free to return to Sri Lanka. They are welcome to return to Sri Lanka and we wont prosecute themCome Back, was his message. This was especially significant for the asylum seekers, some of whom may be hoping to get refugee status in the USA, under an agreement between President Barack Obama and the Australian Government, which related to 1,250 refugees.
It is important to recall that President Donald Trump has described this agreement as a very bad deal, and even complained that Australia was trying to send the next Boston bomber to the US. There is no indication whether Sri Lankan refugees will find favour for admission to the US. But they now have the assurance given by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that they are free to return to Sri Lanka, with no threat of prosecution.
This is certainly a major move by the Prime Minister in the context of Sri Lankas policy of reconciliation and peace building. It is a highlight of the Mr. Wickremesinghes visit to Australia, which stands out as one of the most impactful visits abroad by a Prime Minister and key government representative from Sri Lanka in recent years.

New rice MRPs re-gazetted with local rates
As more imported rice began entering the market, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) swiftly re-issued a new Maximum Retail Price (MRP) order yesterday for three varieties of rice-this time, with the inclusion of locally milled rice clearly spelt.
The locally milled rice has not been included in our February 8 MRP order. We have now included local rice as well so that our millers can now get fair price. I also warn errant sellers who violate the MRPs, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said yesterday.
The order issued yesterday has now been sent to be gazetted, and became effective from yesterday.
It invalidates the Gazette 2015/24 of February 8. The order No 42 dated February 17 was issued by the CAA Chairman under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No 9 of 2003s section 20(5).
MRPs of imported three varieties of rice remains the same as the previous Gazette-the only new MRP addition being the prices of locally milled rice of same three varieties.
According to the February 17 order sent to be gazetted, new MRPs for Nadu, Raw Rice and Samba is as follows: MRP of a kilo of imported Nadu rice is Rs 72 (unchanged), locally milled Nadu Rs 80, a kilo of imported Raw (Kekulu) rice is Rs 70 (unchanged) locally milled Raw Rs 78, and a kilo of imported Samba (excluding Keeri Samba and Suduru Samba) is Rs 80 (unchanged) and locally milled Samba (excluding Keeri Samba and Suduru Samba) is Rs 90 per kilo.

Over 4,000 given state sector employment in Uva
A total of 4,212 diplomates and graduates were given employment in the state sector within the Uva province during the last two years. This included a batch of 1,559 in 2015 and a batch of 2,653 in 2016, said Uva province Governor, M. P. Jayasinghe.
He was addressing a press conference held to mark the completion of two years in office as Governor. He said whenever he came accross any problem or issue in the province highlighted in the media, he had taken instant action by directing relevent officials to attend to them without delay. The objective of appointing graduate teachers was to uplift education in rural schools in the province.
He had always received the unstinted support of the Chief Mnister and staff in carrying out his duties. He also said steps would be taken to implement a welfare programme for members of the Uva Media Forum including the issuing of free travel passes to them in public transport.

PM MULLS CODE OF CONDUCT FOR SHIPS
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is willing to take a lead role in organising a conference to bring together all parties concerned to ensure freedom of navigation and peace in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).
The Prime Minister who delivered his keynote address at the University of Deakin, Law Faculty on Thursday, said the best way to solve the issues in the IOR would be to formulate a code of conduct for naval ships operating in the region.
The lecture held at the Federal Square in Melbourne, was under the theme Freedom of Navigation in the Indian Ocean with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe speaking at the invitation of the Chancellor of the University, Prof John Stanhope.
The Premier also noted that they would have to pay special attention to terrorism and piracy issues in the IOR where the former has increased in recent times to endanger commercial freight and shipping in the region.Taking all these factors into account, the Prime Minister pointed out that there was an increasing need to create special mechanisms to turn the IOR into a peaceful region.
To achieve such a goal, the best suggestion would be to bring together countries in the IOR, UN Security Council countries and main naval organisations together at a conference. Through such a measure, all parties can resolve their differences and build on their relationships, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

President hails RTI
President Maithripala Sirisena while hailing the implementation of the Right to Information Act (RTI)as a positive step to ensure peoples freedom, yesterday said that the Act should not be misused to hamper the day-today activities of state institutions. The President said that there should be a cordial relationship between politicians and public servants.
There is an apparent gap between these two segments which needs to be bridged,he said.The President said that he is the only President in the country who furnishes the declaration of assets to the Elections authorities annually.
President Sirisena added that he had been sending his declarations of assets duly since he was a minister.
As a Common Candidate at the last Presidential election, I duly furnished my asset declarations to the relevant authority, he said.
The President was addressing over 1,800 Information Officers assigned under the Right To Information (RTI) Act at Temple Trees yesterday.
The Act was presented by this Good Governance government aiming to strengthen the peoples right to access information.
The President opined that the adoption of 18th Amendment to the Constitution in Parliament is undoubtedly the worst anti-democratic people hatred political involvement in the country,
The country was in need of a new political culture and the government was elected by the people to achieve that objective, the President said
Many measures have been taken to strengthen the peoples freedom and the transparency of activities in the governments activities. It is important to do away with fraud and corruption from the country since it has been observed that most sectors have been badly affected by these evil elements and drawbacks, the President said.
The President added that when the Right To Information Bill was gazetted on February, a NGO sent letters to the Prime Minister and him on that day itself requesting them to declare their assets.
The President said that he declares his assets to the Chairman of the Elections Commission annually.
However the President noted that NGOs should act within their limits and work in accordance with the subject field.
The President added that mainly the politicians are responsible for ruining this country and dragging the country towards corruption.

Prices of 38 varieties of lenses reduced: Dr Senaratne
The prices of 38 varieties of eye lenses (involving 38 private companies) have been regulated and as a result the prices have been reduced in large scales, offering a huge relief to the people. The price of the entire package of eye lens has been reduced. Accordingly, it is expected that the prices of eye surgeries too will go down, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Ministry Auditorium yesterday, Minister Dr. Senaratne said that prices have been reduced from Rs. 26,900 to Rs. 17,000, from Rs. 25,900 to Rs. 16,400, from Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 16,200, from 25,900 to Rs. 15,500, from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 15,500, from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 12,100, etc. The full price reduction list is available in a Gazette Notification and would be published through media for the benefit of the public. The prices were regulated with the participation of all stake holders.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, arrangements would be made to regulate the prices of the rest of the drugs, medical devices, private hospitals, all laboratory tests in the private sector, etc for the benefit of the people. Health is not only a profit making business, it is a service. Various problems had occurred when the decades long procedure changed. It is unavoidable. But the people were benefited.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that various internal and external pressures were put on him when he reduced the prices of 48 drugs and it was same when the prices of eye lenses was reduced. Ambassadors came and discussed. But the prices were reduced according to the policy of the good governance offering relief to the people.
The policy of the Government belongs to the youths of the country who formulated it. President Sirisena and myself did not have supporters before January 08, 2015. President Sirisena was very straight forward when it comes to handling issues of increasing the tax on tobacco and stated that the Tobacco Company can close its operations in Sri Lanka and leave if they wish to do so, he added.

Rafter quits amid Tomic, Kyrgios stand-off
SYDNEY: Pat Rafter stepped down as Tennis Australias head of performance Friday, ending his rocky relationship with the countrys two polarising stars Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic.
After two years in the role, Rafter has been replaced by his deputy and former Davis Cup captain and coach Wally Masur.
Masur will have the task of bringing the Tomic family back into the fold after relations soured under Rafter.
Tomic made himself unavailable for a Davis Cup tie this month against the Czech Republic, citing scheduling issues.
Reports said Tomics father John had a bitter ongoing feud over his son and daughter Sara involving funding from Tennis Australia.
Last month at the Australian Open Rafter, a former world number one and two-time US Open champion, admitted he had little input into the direction of the countrys top two players.
Rafter stepped down as Davis Cup captain in early 2015 following a turbulent time dealing with Tomic, while Kyrgios once tweeted: Another negative comment out of Rafters mouth. Does this guy ever stop #everyoneisaworkinprogress. Rafter said recently that he preferred to leave Tomic and Kyrgios alone.
I havent really been speaking to them very much and I dont really know where theyre at, Rafter said.
I just sit back and watch from a distance. I dont really have a lot to offer them.
If they ever want to talk to me, Im happy to talk. Kyrgios and Tomic have frequently fallen foul of tennis authorities and have a love-hate relationship with the public.
Kyrgios, 21, was fined for swearing and throwing his racquet in a spectacular meltdown at last months Australian Open, when he threw away a two-set lead to bow out in the second round against Andreas Seppi.
Tomic, 24, has also been plagued by controversy, making headlines last year when he turned his racquet the wrong way to face a match point against Fabio Fognini in Madrid.
Masur said he was already in regular contact with John Tomic and confirmed that Sara Tomic had been offered funding under a restructuring by TA late last year.
Theyve got to hit certain benchmarks to get X amount of funding but I feel like thats a positive because were not saying, its our way or the highway, Masur said.
Rafter said his time as the Davis Cup captain and TA performance director had been an eye-opener.
The time is right for me, I came in to Davis Cup and then in this role because I wanted to make a difference and I feel we have taken some major strides, he said Friday.
This journey for me -- through the Davis Cup years and now as performance director -- has been an eye-opener to say the least.
The restructuring process that we went through in September last year was intense for everyone.

Restructuring UDA powers supports urban development: Champika
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the UDA, restructuring its powers, delegated to the local authorities in 1985, is a positive move and it supports urban development in the country.
The minister said this while participating as chief guest in Lanka Property Show 2017 yesterday at the JAIC Hilton, Colombo. "Over the past few years, the real estate development sector directly contributed to more than 30 percent of Sri Lankas economy and indirectly much more," he said.
Minister Ranawaka said his ministry and its institutions have already started restructuring the urban development in Sri Lanka.
We expect to gift Sri Lanka with a national physical planning policy and more competitive plan for the entire island with a strong policy on housing and urban development along with safeguarding environment. The plan will be ready within this year, he said.
He said the ministry expects to complete a strategic development plan for all urban areas in Sri Lanka within next few years.
They will be prepared with adequate understandings of the demand for land, space, potentials and constraints for investment. They will be prepared with wider participation of developers, business community and the public and will be collectively decided and have no secret documents, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the plans will be pro-development and not restrictive.
He said the details will be made available to all through internet and the public have access to information. All projects will be reviewed and planning clearances, building permits and certificates of conformity will be issued soon, he said.

A solution to parking hassles
Parking has become a serious problem in Colombo, but it is not the only metropolis to suffer this fate. Parking is a hit and miss affair in main cities such as Kandy, Galle, Nuwara Eliya (especially during the April season) and suburbs such as Nugegoda, Maharagama, Wattala and Kadawatha.
Parking is a crucial aspect of city planning. If properly implemented, it is also a money spinner for local bodies. Most motorists do not mind paying even Rs.50 per hour if they can find a convenient parking spot. Having realised the importance of allocating adequate parking slots in the City, the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) wisely included parking bays in the Galle Road Uniflow expansion project and also carved out many parking slots from byroads and lanes.
While some of the parking slots can be manned by CMC or private parking company personnel, there is not enough manpower to supervise all parking bays in Colombo. Most countries implement an ideal solution for this  parking meters. The advantage of coming late to the parking meter party is that the CMC could leapfrog several generations of manual parking meters and select an all-electronic solution powered by a smartphone app.
Basically, if you have a smartphone and a mobile phone account, you can pay your parking fees without any hassle. Obviously, since these parking bays are unmanned the onus is on the customer to pay the fee honestly. (Installing CCTV cameras to monitor the parking bays is a very expensive solution). Some will see this in terms of a loss of manual jobs, but that is a given  many jobs are going to computers, robots and chatbots.
This project is also an example of a beneficial public-private partnership (PPP). The CMC has the parking slots, the parking company has a vast experience in operating electronically-controlled car parks and the mobile service providers can empower this solution through their software. The advantages are clear  there is no need to fumble around for cash, the system is paperless and environmentally friendly and there is no need to enter into arguments with parking attendants. Everyone wins, including the customers.
We hope that depending on the success of this project, other local bodies will follow suit. Obviously, they will have to analyse the cost effectiveness of the project, since not every local body generates high revenues like the CMC does. But the convenience factor certainly has to be considered.
For many years, the CMC has stipulated that no commercial building should be constructed without parking facilities. The CMC and other local bodies should encourage developers to go for multi-storey car parks which can make the maximum use of limited space. Several new buildings already incorporate this feature.
Drivers often encounter problems from the Police when they park at places which do not have either a P sign or No Parking sign. There are many perfectly safe unmarked parking areas in Colombo, but overzealous police officers sometimes impose fines or request motorists to leave such places. In places where parking is not expressly forbidden by the local bodies (actually, the Police have no power to decide on parking issues), motorists should be given the benefit of the doubt. In the alternative, Police should discuss with the local bodies whether putting up Parking or No Parking signs is more suitable.
However, there is another approach  avoiding the parking hassle altogether. This can only be done if more people keep their cars at home at least on weekdays and come to work (or other business) by public transport. In fact, the lack of a comfortable, clean, punctual and efficient public transport system is one of the reasons why people opt to use their cars to get to work, enduring even a two-hour traffic jam. The Governments new Light Rail Transit and railway electrification plans are a perfect fit that should be able to lure many motorists. In the meantime, we need to have more highly comfortable air-conditioned buses on prime routes to take people away from their cars. This has been tried a few times, but the authorities should push it more aggressively through a major marketing campaign. This will reduce both traffic and parking problems. The next step is to have a completely integrated (bus, rail, taxi) system that also takes care of the last mile (i.e. from the roadside to the home) traffic.
Looking to the future, parking may be an obsolete concept much sooner than you think. Most people already rely on ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft which eliminates parking worries altogether. You just pay for your ride and go on your way since there is no need to worry about parking.
It will become completely obsolete when autonomous and driverless cars and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communications become commonplace. All you have to do is to call up a robot car and it will take you to your destination. With companies from Google to Ford involved in every aspect of driverless cars, a parking-free future could be here in under a decade.

Sri Lanka beat Australia off last ball to win first T20
MELBOURNE Friday: Chamara Kapugedera smashed a four off the last ball to give Sri Lanka a thrilling five-wicket victory over Australia in their first Twenty20 international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday.
The win kept Sri Lanka unbeaten in four T20 internationals in Australia and followed their 2-1 series win over South Africa last month.
The pulsating win was made possible by a dashing 52 off 37 balls by Asela Gunaratne, who was named man-of-the-match for his match-turning innings.
Gunaratne slammed seven fours to share in a decisive 60-run stand with Milinda Siriwardana to put the Sri Lankans just 18 runs short of victory with 17 balls remaining. It was a tense finish with skipper Aaron Finch making fielding changes before every ball to prevent Sri Lanka from getting home.
But it was Kapugedera who stood up to the pressure and slammed fast bowler Andrew Tye's final delivery through the covers to the boundary rope for the winning hit.
The win put Sri Lanka one up in the series with two matches to play in Geelong on Sunday and Adelaide on Wednesday.
For a time it looked as though the Australians, playing without their leading stars, Steve Smith, David Warner, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood all on tour in India, would hold off the fast-finishing Sri Lankans.
The home side posted a competitive total of 168 for six off their 20 overs with skipper Finch smashing two sixes and two fours in his topscoring 43 off 34 balls.
Finch shared in an opening stand of 76 with T20I debutant Michael Klinger.
Klinger, making his debut at the age of 36 after starring with the Perth Scorchers in the domestic Big Bash League, hammered 38 off 32 balls with four boundaries.
Lasith Malinga, who has played virtually no cricket for nearly a year due to injuries, was an influential figure taking two wickets in two balls and taking two catches.
Malinga claimed the wickets of Travis Head for 31 off 24 balls and debutant Ashton Turner for 18 off 13 balls, both caught by Seekkugge Prasanna at deep mid-wicket.
Malinga finished with two wickets for 29 off his four overs.
Paceman Pat Cummins struck with the last ball of his opening over getting skipper Upul Tharanga to edge to wicketkeeper Tim Paine for a duck in the first over of the Sri Lanka innings. Leg-spinner Adam Zampa claimed the big wicket of free-scoring opener Niroshan Dickwella for 30 off 25 balls.
Dickwella, who slammed four fours and a six, looked to flick Zampa over mid-wicket only to lob a leading edge to Klinger at short third man in the ninth over.
Dilshan Munaweera smashed a breezy 44 off 29 balls with six fours before he hit a short ball from Zampa to mid-wicket where Finch took a head-high catch. But Gunaratne took charge and his half-century turned the tide to set up the thrilling victory for the Sri Lankans.

Sri Lanka must have foreign judges in war crime investigation: HRW
Sri Lanka must employ international judges and prosecutors to ensure accountability during trials of those responsible for alleged war crimes against mostly Tamils, Human Rights Watch Australias director Elaine Pearson told SBS News.
Pearsons call, which echoes a recommendation in a 2015 UN Human Rights Council report of the OHCHR investigation of Sri Lanka, comes as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited Canberra.
On Wednesday he beckoned asylum seekers who fled to Australia to return, assuring they would be quite safe. They can come back to Sri Lanka and we will help them... but remember, they broke the law by attempting to come to Australia, he said.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein said in 2015: Our investigation has laid bare the horrific level of violations and abuses that occurred in Sri Lanka, including indiscriminate shelling, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, harrowing accounts of torture and sexual violence, recruitment of children and other grave crimes. Both the Sri Lankan government and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were likely to have committed the abuses, the investigation found. The investigation recommended Sri Lanka bring to trial those responsible for alleged war crimes in a court that was both domestic and international - where the international element would help ensure accountability. It urged the country integrate international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, that will be essential to give confidence to all Sri Lankans, in particular the victims, in the independence and impartiality of the process, particularly given the politicisation and highly polarised environment in Sri Lanka.

Super Stars who contributed towards a worthy cause
Super Star Veterans won the Football for Peace and Charity International Veterans Football Tournament 2017 organized by Football for Peace Sri Lanka in collaboration with Muthuwella Veterans Club which was held at the City Football Complex grounds over two days.
But the real STARS were the players of all nine teams who took part in this tournament for a worthy cause of contributing towards the needy children of this tiny island.
It really touched the hearts of the small crowd gathered at the City League Grounds when a group of needy children from Wellampitiya Ash Shifa (Children with Special Needs) and Prithipura Children Home displayed their skills of dance and extending their appreciation to the untiring efforts of the Football for Peace Sri Lanka headed by Muheed Jeeran for organizing such an event to help the needy children alike them.
And nearly 200 players from nine clubs namely FC London Red and White from England, United Veterans Kolkata from India, Super Stars Veterans, Maligawatte Veterans, Java Lane Veterans, Aluthkade Veterans, Old Peterson Veterans and Muthuwella Veterans were the real STARS as they generously donated their share through entry fee.
London FC fielding two teams paid an entry fee of Rs. 50.000/- and the other seven teams entered the fray with Rs. 25,000/- as entry fees.
All in all Rupees 220,000/- was collected as entry fees with few donations from well wishers who wants to remain anonymous and the Champions Super Star Veterans, 1st runner-up Kolkata United Veterans, 2nd runner-up Java Lane Veterans and the 3rd runner-up Maligawatte Veterans all fulfilled their promises by donating their prize money to the needy children. It not only showed their sportsmanship but also their humanity.

Coming back to the game of final of the Peace and Charity International Tournament Super Star Veterans beat fully tired United Veterans Kolkota FC from India by 5 goals to 1. But both the winner and loser expressed that they had played for a worthy cause and the result does not matter at all. What a great gesture it was.
Of course the Super Star Veterans in their ranks had ten former Nationals players including three players who still play for reputed clubs taking part in the Champions League and FA Cup tournaments and they were too strong for the Indian team who had to play five matches in a single day.
High Commissioner for Pakistan in Sri Lanka Rt. Major General Shakeel Hussain graced the occasion and gave away the main trophy. Zakir Khan, Special Ambassador of West Ham United FC from England give away the runners up trophy, Thilak Peiris, President of Soccer Masters Association, Anthony Balendra, Secretary of FFSL and Proprietor of Top Printers Sameer Yunous were the guest of honours.

Muheed stated Though we lacked on getting big sponsorship for this project, we managed to prove that we are capabable of running any uphill task. I promise to make the next International Veteran's Tournament much bigger by inviting more countries specially from Europe to support worthy causes like this
Runner-up team United Veterans from Kolkota visited the Ceylon Deaf and Blind School and personally handed over their donation to those needy children before heading off to India on Tuesday.

Unparalleled visionary
Don Richard Wijewardene was historically an inspired visionary. With his far-sight, he was unshakably certain that only the people blessed with knowledge, will be the truest inheritors of independence.
In the days of his higher education in the UK, with an admirable restraint, he curbed his restless patriotism. He turned to more pragmatic moves, which in the long run would ensure the true and stark achievement of independence. He had the first question asked in the Mother of Parliament about the need to look into Ceylons independence. He achieved his pioneering parliamentary victory in the UK through an MP who was sympathetic to the Ceylonese Independence Cause.
His austere policies yielded spectacular successes at times. In association with yet another fearless warrior in the unarmed battle for Sri Lankas Independence, Wijewardene made a startling discovery. He came upon Sri Lankas original Lion Flag, which was taken down to hoist the British Union Jack.
Newspaper publishing domain
Wijewardene and his companion, ultra-patriot E. W. Perera, found this historical Lion Flag in a closet in the Royal Hospital at Chelsea - of all places.
It is this historical Lion Flag that incidentally became the first national flag of the newly independent nation.
Though even his spirit would resent such due recognition, the life story of D R Wijewardene is very much a saga.
Returning home from overseas, he established a newspaper publishing domain. He was fully convinced, that information and proper knowledge should constitute the twin staple assets of a truly independent nation. A well-informed nation equipped with pragmatic wisdom will be the enlightened citizens, who will be able to make the right choices for the land and the people.
Wijewardenes Lake House was a highly impressive establishment of discipline, orderliness and unscrupulous dedication to service. It had such allure that, even some new graduates preferred employment in the executive and editorial grades of Lake House, to civil/administrative services.
Wijewardene himself personalised a rare quality of austerity.
Lake House publications
His sense of austere administration was so keen that he never allowed either his photograph or any written reference to him to appear in Lake House publications. When he imposed such strict conditions on his own official conduct, restraining others would be a matter of course.
Some of his biographers have observed that Wijewardene preferred Green Gruel as his sun-up repast, rather than non-local exotic breakfasts.
He introduced an administrative system that was so methodically conceived, even the state bureaucracy would have at times felt at least a tinge of jealousy.
All the extensive departments of the Lake House establishment, had a complex organisation, directed towards one particular goal - the printing, publishing and the circulation of the printed products. The multiplicity of activities were all meticulously made to converge upon this unified organisational target.
One cannot help but wonder that a Sri Lankan entrepreneurial genius would possess this form of unimaginable managerial dexterity.
His eye for detail, was a marvel by itself.
He had a responsible officer whose sole duty was to seek shortcomings, and if there were any, to put them right as quickly as possible. Throughout his service days at Lake House this was his professional focus.
The transport system organised under his supervision, turned out at one point to be a trusted passenger service as well - the primary purpose of which was the delivering of the published material.
I was recruited to the editorial staff personally by Esmond Wickremasinghe. The illustrious genius D R W was his father-in-law.
One day Wickremasinghe told me that D R Wijewardene was keen to see me at his residence. One must be a very young journalist at Lake House at that time, to appreciate what a prestigious occasion this was for me, still at the threshold of my profession.
Illustrious fathers sacred memory
With due deference, I visited Wijewardenes residence. He waved me into a large comfortable chair. But seeing my senior colleague (very, very senior colleague to be exact) Mr. Hulugalla, Editor Daily News, seated on a bench, I preferred to sit with him. The reason why he requested me to see him filled me with a pleasant surprise. He wanted me to instruct his son - Ranjith Wijewardene - in Sinhala.
Even at present, whenever I meet Ranjith Wijewardene at some gathering, he greets me with a smile, and reminds me that I taught him Sinhala. I find this a very gracious and touching gesture.
The great, austere and ultra-cultured administrative tradition of D. R. Wijewardene is being perpetuated by Ranjith Wijewardene, paying an exalted tribute to his Illustrious fathers sacred memory.
When I was walking out, after that historical meeting (for me, of course) Mr. Wijewardene stopped me for a moment. He told me: You will be with us for a long while. I just cannot fathom, even now what was exactly meant by that saying of the media sage. Lake House, has become the Establishment for media publications in our land today too. The solid personality of late D.R Wijewardene still towers over our media filed, as an unshaken colossal.
What this single-minded, exceptionally austere super-entrepreneur achieved in his lifetime is a blazing torch held aloft to guide the path of generations to come. People may not quite know that in most of the book and newspaper publishing areas they still unknowingly employ techniques of organisation and discipline that were once endowed upon this land by this Immortal Entrepreneurial Thinker.
May the memory of great D.R. Wijewardene remain fresh as some material printed just a second ago.

A VILLAGE IN THE WAKE OF A TSUNAMI WAVE
I had the good fortune of visiting the foundation of goodness (FOG) through the kind courtesy of its founder Kushil Gunasekera .The Director- Sports Management Anura De Silva was gracious enough to take me around to various FOG sectors including the two cricket grounds, despite his busy schedule.
Isn't there a yawning gap between the rural and the urban sectors It is prevalent even now let alone then.
To bridge this gap The Foundation of Goodness was set up by Kushil Gunasekera whose family came from Seenigama. The aim was to give holistic support to the poor rural community.
PRE TSUNAMI DAYS
In the early days, it provided the basics such as English & Computer Classes.
Sports Training to village children, upgrades to villagers dwellings (including water, sanitation and electricity supply) and a provided educational scholarships to poor but talented students.
Rebuilding lives: 2005-2007
When the dreaded Tsunami struck in 2004, Kushil gifted his ancestral home and garden to the village, setting up firstly an emergency response centre and then, with sponsorship from the Marylebone Cricket Club - UK developing the MCC Centre of Excellence, which is now the hub of the Foundation of Goodness work.
Woth the help of tsunami international funding the foundation of Goodness provided facilities and opportunities which have been open to all for free of charge
Holistic Community Development: 2007 onwards
With most tsunami disaster response work drawing to a close, the focus shifted to ensuring long term sustainability of the model that was originally envisaged when the Foundation was set up in 1999. The work continues to target improving the lives of rural communities across 20+ villages. Special emphasis is placed on developing children through the provision of Pre-School, education, English and Computer Classes and a significant Sports Programme in Seenigama.
Vocational training is provided for youth and adults through training courses in IT, business skills and English classes and special woman's wnterprise classes in industrial and domestic sewing cookery and beauty culture to enable them to support their families and in some cases to go into business. Medical, dental and psycho social care is also offered free of charge.
Expanding North
Since 2011, the Foundation of Goodness has expanded its development activities to the post-war North. The FOG plans to emulate the Seenigama MCC Centre of holistic development model in the North through establishing the North Learning and empowerment Institute in the future.
The FOG currently carries out development and humanitarian activities in the North via monthly consecutive visits to the North and East to carry out development and humanitarian activities including the Neethipuram Water and Sanitation Project, The Murali Harmony Cup Cricket Tournament for unity & reconciliation, sports camps, development of school grounds and libraries, micro-finance, developing a pre-school, distribution of solar power bulbs and livelihood projects.
The Foundation of Goodness has touched over 310,000 lives, via 30 sectors in over 200 villages across the island free of cost.
Figure 1 Ishari
Out of the countless number of beneficiaries, I would like to quote one example taken from the souvenir  Rebuilding Better after disaster published by the FOG to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Tsunami, My case in point is Ishari; she was born in Seenigama, and was the youngest of four siblings.
She completed her GCE Ordinary Level Examination in the village school and then she moved to a school in town to complete her Advanced Level Examination.
Her fondness to work with computers attracted Ishari to join the FOG.
She followed all the IT courses the Foundation had to offer and is currently following a course on soft ware engineering. She also followed an English course offered by the Foundation and eagerly looks forward to improving her language skills..Ishara recalls how elated she was when her teacher coordinated with the Foundation to get her a new laptop for her use.
She applied for a job in data entry which handles accounts of a leading conglomerate in Sri Lanka.
She is employed in this project and her team is stationed at an office space within the foundation. Enthusiastic and ambitious, Ishara hopes to gain experience in her current field and establish herself as a software engineer.
It is interesting to note that over the course of 2011 to 2017 The Foundation of Goodness has worked relentlessly to make a difference to the lives of people in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka; helping rebuild lives and communities following years of conflict.
The Foundation of Goodness now impacts over 35, 000 beneficiaries from 200+ villages via their 30 empowerment activity sectors free of charge, every year.

The walk to democracy
How do people counter anti democratic tendencies of a government is a problem faced even by the American people. Already many admit that there is a dangerously anti-democratic, even authoritarian impulse at the centre of the Trump administration. Of course this kind of attacks on democracy has happened before. In other times and other places, authoritarian leaders have come to power through the manipulation of democratic institutions, often by exploiting major divisions within the general electorate.
Nationality and communal divisions are always exploited by fascistic politicians even in modern societies. Even though they come to power in quasi-democratic manner, as both Mahinda and Trump already have done, such figures cleverly recognize that they will not be able to maintain the broad-based support needed to remain in power, or accomplish anything while there. As such they work to undermine the basic institutions of democracy, such as independent commissions, for the judiciary, the administration, police and other sections of state power. In addition they always make it a point to attack the free press.
Radical political groups
The breakdown of such societies has been the subject of study for social scientists in the recent past. They have concentrated on societies run by dictators and fascistic leaders. In Lanka mass mobilization which included trade unions, left parties and radical political groups, non government social organisations and radical Buddhist and Christian monks became the instrument of change.
Strong authoritarian regimes
There were strikes and demonstrations by workers but the political leadership came from the radical inelegancia. In that sense it was a middle class revolution. Some say different circumstances led to this variation in outcome when compared to Arab Spring. A variety of causal factors have been highlighted, most of which hinge on the relationship between the strength of the state and the strength of civil society. Countries with stronger civil society networks in various forms underwent more successful reforms during the Arab Spring; these findings are also consistent with more general social science theories introduced in the recent history.
Also crucial was the degree of state censorship over print, broadcast, and social media in different countries. Television coverage by channels like Al Jazeera and BBC News provided worldwide exposure and prevented mass violence by the Egyptian government in Tahrir Square, contributing to the change made by the Egyptian Revolution.
In other countries, such as Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, such international press coverage was not present to the same degree, and the governments of these countries were able to act more freely in suppressing the protests.
This restriction combined with mistakes of leaders of the revolt led to strong authoritarian regimes with high degrees of censorship. Thus their national broadcast media were able to block communication and prevent the domestic spread of information necessary for successful protests. Morocco is a case in point, as its broadcast media at the time of the revolts was owned and operated almost exclusively by political elites with ties to the monarchy.
State control over media
Countries with greater access to social media, such as Tunisia and Egypt, proved more effective in mobilizing large groups of people, and appear to have been more successful overall than those with greater state control over media. Even though a revolution did take place and the prior government has been replaced, Tunisia's change is not yet over. There are still many grievances taking place; even today. Lankan democratic uprising was very closely connected to oppositional media and free social media.
Even today media play a strong role to mobilize protest against corruption, political intimidation and injustice. The presence of a strong, educated middle class has been noted as a correlate to the success of the Arab Spring in different countries.
This shows the bourgeoisie nature of the uprising and in countries where workers movement is technically absent revolution stopped half way. Countries with strong welfare programmes and a weak middle class, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as countries with great economic disparity and an impoverished working classincluding Yemen, Libya, and Moroccodid not experience successful revolutions. Hence they say to begin a political revolution presence of an educated middle class with free media is almost vital.
The strength of the middle class is, in turn, directly connected to the existing political, economic, and educational institutions in a country. Hence it can be argued that the middle class itself may be considered an informal political institution.
The history of Lanka proved again that slide from democracy to authoritarianism is downhill, and it is easier to stop a slide than to reverse one. Whether anti-democratic tendencies become full-fledged authoritarianism depends in no small part on what the general population does, and when and how they do it.
The authority generally watches the active middle class. If militant petty bourgeoisie act quickly enough, affirming their willingness to stand up and resist, the downward slide can be halted. Authority will be reversed. Mass protests may break out throughout the country with workers joining the struggle of democracy. In Lanka workers joined the struggle for democracy; but they have yet to say the final word.
