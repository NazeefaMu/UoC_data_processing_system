Ken gets a makeover... finally!
The all-American-man, Barbies blue-eyes chiselled boyfriend Ken is finally set to get a makeover. From cornrows to man bun, the new Ken will have it all!
After being overshadowed by Barbie for decades, now Ken is finally getting some attention with this new makeover. The new crew of latest Barbie and Ken Fashionistas feature even more skin tones, eye colors, hairstyles, and fashions and now Ken comes in three body types: broad, slim and original.
The New Crew extension introduces a whopping 40 Barbie and Ken dolls, each more dynamic than what it used to be.
There will be 15 new dolls added to his name with six new molded hairstyles, including cornrows and an on-trend man bun and seven skin tones. Barbie announced the New Crew in a tweet, with the hashtag #TheDollEvolves. The Fashionistas collection was first launched in 2016 with three new body types as well as varied skin types, etc.
In February, Barbie Fashionistas earned the coveted Toy of the Year award from the Toy Industry Association in February. Ken hasnt changed much since he was first introduced. 56 years ago as Barbies blue-eyed, chiselled boyfriend.
Since Kens release, the company has launched more than 100 different looks for the doll.
Mattel is trying to fight falling sales of its iconic doll line at a time when many kids would rather play with an iPad.
Barbie sales were down 13 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period a year ago.
A live-action Barbie movie is in the works for next year, with hopes that the big-screen flick will spur doll sales as well.
Ken was in need of a makeover, said Jim Silver, the editor-in-chief of toy review website TTPM. He said kids who play with the revamped Barbie dolls don't want an outdated Ken.
"He's part of the storyline and he has to fit in with the picture," Silver said, "or you would lose sales."
The man doll, it seems will alos sport mordernised fashion ranging from casual business attires to athletic wear.
The El Segundo, California-based company also announced new Barbie looks Tuesday, including one with a nearly shaved head and another with an Afro.
Mattel has been tinkering with other lines to be more inclusive, such as adding its first boy doll for the American Girl brand. Mirror

LIMITS OF EXCLUSIVISM: RECENT CRISIS IN NORTH
The recent crisis in Sri Lankas Northern Provincial Council has more to it than a fight against corruption
The recent no-confidence motion in Sri Lankas Northern Provincial Council (NPC) in Jaffna, moved by a section of the Council members against Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, has brought the deep divide in Tamil nationalist politics to the fore.
The turbulence lasted a week, after he called on two ministers to resign on corruption charges and two others to go on compulsory leave, until Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan engineered a compromise that let Mr. Wigneswaran continue in power.
The controversy was essentially a manifestation of a simmering political conflict within the Tamil polity. Tension had been brewing within the NPC since the regime change in January 2015. The Tamil nationalists preferred discourse of victimhood and the need for international intervention during the authoritarian Rajapaksa regime suddenly confronted the geopolitical agenda of the West and India, which moved close to the new government in Colombo. The TNA leadership in Parliament shifted its approach towards engaging Colombo. However, Mr. Wigneswaran, along with politicians within and outside the NPC, firmly held his exclusivist, if not separatist, line.
In the parliamentary election of August 2015, these fissures became pronounced with Wigneswaran supporting the hard-line Tamil National Peoples Front (TNPF) which suffered a thumping defeat. The TNAs landslide victory seemed a timely moment for the Chief Ministers removal, but Mr. Sampanthans indecisiveness let the status quo be.
Political culture
The recent developments in the NPC also reflect worrying trends in Tamil political culture. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and later the Rajapaksa regime had curtailed peoples struggles for decades. However, with democratic space opening after 2015, protests around land, fishing rights, wartime disappearances and militarisation mounted. Through these agitations, the war-affected people voiced their growing frustration as their livelihoods remained precarious. But the government in Colombo was comfortably indifferent.
The lack of solutions through meaningful leadership in the TNA and the Colombo government has left the field open for the crass politics of nationalists aligned with Wigneswaran. Their campaigns are essentially repackaging the LTTEs politics of ethnic exclusion, often with anti-Muslim sentiments. They glorify martyrdom and victimhood, blame all ills on the south, and claim to be devoted nationalists who can lobby the West for deliverance.
It is true that substantive devolution is yet to be realised in the country, but Wigneswaran actively blocks development projects allocated from Colombo.
The pro-Wigneswaran mobilisations culminated in attacks on the dominant sections of the TNA, with the labelling of politicians as traitors, reminiscent of the LTTEs politics of character assassination. Meanwhile, sections of the local Tamil media project Mr. Wigneswarans populist appeal through religious and cultural imagery betraying an emergent Hindu nationalism in Jaffna.
The Tamil chauvinist forces do not pose any threat to the state for the Tamil community cannot stomach another insurrection. However, they can further undermine the Tamil community by preventing moves to rebuild its social, economic and political institutions. While the LTTE mowed down committed social and political Tamil leaders for its military project seeking a separate state, its opportunistic and talking-head avatars pose a political threat to what remains of progressive Tamil society and its institutions.
Downward spiral
The next year, ahead of NPC elections, is likely to be wasted with a lame duck Council, with possibly more extreme nationalist theatrics to keep the Tamil population at boiling point. In this context, early elections following its dissolution is one possibility. Alternatively, the electorate may demand changes in provincial governance through local struggles. The Centre also aggravates the dire state of the Tamil community with a terribly flawed reconstruction programme, with no meaningful investment in the local economy or job creation. The promised constitutional reforms to expand devolution of power have been virtually put on hold as the coalition government wobbles, with unchecked Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinist forces surging. Having wasted two and a half years in power, the President and the Prime Minister offer little confidence to the war-torn population by way of a solution. As for Tamil nationalist politics, whether it is the TNA leadership or its rivals, little is likely to change. There isnt even reflection and introspection about how the LTTE and, for that matter, the current leadership have brought about this abject situation.
Wigneswarans politics have been a disaster. He has severed relations with the south and is the subject of ridicule by international actors whom he claims to lobby. However, the faith placed by many in Sampanthan as a senior leader who can finally deliver a solution is also waning, thanks to his political indecisiveness and failure to engage and mobilise the Tamil population.
In this context, Tamil nationalist politics that has centred on exclusivism culminating in separatism, or demands towards constitutional change without political rapprochement requires a rethink. It has never sought to genuinely engage the other minorities and progressive Sinhalese, or consider ways of achieving devolution of power in tandem with broader democratisation and economic justice. Worse, it has failed to address the contradictions within its fold of caste, gender, class and region, and instead depended on an elite consensus within its narrow, Jaffna-centred base. The downward spiral of Tamil nationalist political competition in recent years signals a destructive path for an already debilitated, war-torn society. It is only a generational political shift breaking away from Tamil nationalism that can redeem Tamil society from its tragic predicament.

Messi's gritty hometown braces for a glam wedding
ROSARIO, Argentina, Sunday  Security is at the top of everyone's minds in Rosario, Argentina these days.
On Friday, soccer superstar Lionel Messi will be married there to Antonella Roccuzzo at a lavish celebration bringing together some of the world's best-paid soccer players, just up the street from one of the city's poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods.
Some 21 members of the hugely popular FC Barcelona team, including Luis Suarez and Neymar, as well as stars like Gerard Pique -- accompanied by partner Shakira, perhaps more popular than the Catalan defender himself -- will be flying into this port city 180 miles (300 kilometers) north of Buenos Aires.
The luxurious City Center casino-hotel complex, where guests will stay and the ceremony is expected to take place, borders a poor neighborhood known as the birthplace of the bloody drug gang Los Monos.
Messi's marriage -- like the casino's presence in the neighborhood -- is a metaphor for inequality, provincial official Carlos Del Frade, author of several books on Rosario's exploding drug trade, told AFP.
A mere 400 yards (meters) from the bright lights and neon of City Center, two people on a motorcycle opened fire June 17 on four women belonging to Los Monos.
The attack claimed the life of Petrona Cantero, 56, the sister of Ariel Cantero, the historic leader of Los Monos, who is now serving a prison sentence. Drug gang-linked violence has claimed more than 1,000 lives in the past five years in this gritty port city, Del Frade said.
Last year, the homicide rate in Rosario was double the national average of seven per 100,000 inhabitants, according to a report from the Ministry of Security of Santa Fe province, which includes Rosario.
In the Las Flores neighborhood, just behind the City Center complex, Los Monos holds virtually total power, according to Del Frade, who said the gang amounts to the de facto government there.
Historically, Rosario has long had a strong working class, and today's violence stems largely from widespread unemployment, political scientists and economists say. Messi's father, a metalworker here in the 1990s, emigrated with his family to Barcelona in 2000, amid the grave economic crisis then facing Argentina.
Today, the government in Rosario says it feels confident the safety of the illustrious visitor and his guests can be assured, regardless of the high crime rate.
Rosario is prepared for the wedding, city administrator Monica Fein told AFP.
Lionel chose to come get married here because it is his hometown and he feels comfortable here and we will do everything in our power to make it so. For now, the details of the planned security operation remain closely guarded.

NDBIB becomes Lankas first investment bank to manage offshore IPO
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) successfully raised USD 28 mn (Rs 4.2 bn) via the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Ooredoo Maldives PLC, a subsidiary of Qatar based international telecommunications giant Ooredoo Group.
The Group is present in over 10 countries with a total subscriber base of over 138 million. NDBIB was awarded the mandate to act as the Lead Financial Advisor and Manager to the IPO via an international bidding process which involved the participation of many regional investment banks. This is the first time an investment bank in Sri Lanka acted as the financial advisor and manager to an IPO on foreign soil.
The IPO attracted over 10,000 applications and was structured as an Offer for Sale raising funds amounting to an approximate 10% stake in Ooredoo Maldives with NDBIB valuing the company at USD 287 mn. The IPO has resulted in Ooredoo Maldives being one of the largest listed companies in the Maldives, and the entity with the largest free float adjusted market capitalisation on the MSE.
The transaction assumed greater significance for being the first IPO with a fully online and integrated electronic application process. Prospective shareholders were allowed to apply for shares in Ooredoo Maldives via a special online portal where depository account opening and shareholder applications were submitted online together with soft copies of all supporting documentation.
The online portal also offered multiple payment options such as credit and debit card payments and mobile money payments.
NDBIB along with the company worked in close collaboration with the Capital Market Development Authority of Maldives and the MSE to secure expeditious approval for the IPO whilst maximising the retail investor participation via awareness campaigns.
NDBIB together with Ooredoo Maldives devised an all-encompassing distribution strategy aimed at managing the logistical challenges in the Maldives given the fact that the archipelagos population of over 400,000 is scattered across 1,200 islands. The distribution strategy included one-on-one meetings with key high net worth individuals and institutional investors, local roadshows in main population centers accessed through domestic planes and speed boats and town hall meetings addressing professionals, students and other potential retail investors, staff storming the streets once a week across islands and a wide network of collection points including post offices, bank branches and Ooredoo distribution partners. This strategy reaped successful results by attracting one of the largest ever shareholder bases in listed Maldivian entities exceeding 8,000 applicants where c. 5000 applicants were first time investors.
Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB, said, The exemplary competence and the diverse experience portrayed by our team over the years enabled NDBIB to secure the transaction and successfully execute the same within the stipulated timelines.
We deployed a relatively large transaction team to work on different aspects of the IPO and I am delightful to have completed this landmark transaction successfully exceeding the expectations of the client.
The presence of sound companies in the Maldives and NDBIBs involvement in landmark transactions of this nature, enhances the visibility and enables Sri Lanka to emerge as a regional hub for capital market fund raisings facilitating the proposed dual listing framework of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) promoted jointly by the CSE and MSE.

New Zealand model  for  Lankas primary  industries development
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage plans to emulate New Zealands Ministry of Primary Industries which contributes the most towards economic development of that country.
Addressing the Inco exhibition on Friday at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Conference Hall in Colombo the minister said he would aim to adopt that particular model applied in New Zealand.
Gamage said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe created the primary industries ministry with a view towards increasing Sri Lankas value added products. The number of international exhibitions is rapidly increasing and this is a wonderful opportunity for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to learn and understand the international arena, he said.
I also encourage them to use government-supported trade delegations to provide dollars earnings to our country.My ministry invites all local as well as foreign businesses interested in setting up manufacturing facilities and I am confident that in the years to come, with the extensive trade agreements Sri Lanka aims to have with India, China, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam as well as with the return of GSP+ giving us the access to a 700 million European market, the market for your products will be extensive globally.
Gamage said he believed inco to become one of the best customer focused exhibitions in South Asia in the near future.

Notebooks
Elizabeth Bishop was born in 1911. Her mother was institutionalized in 1916, and after a brief, miserable stay in her paternal grandparents home in Worcester, Massachusetts, Bishop went to live with her mothers oldest sister, Maud, and her husband, George Shepherdson, in Revere, a town north of Boston. The Shepherdsons, who had no children of their own, raised Bishop from 1918 to 1927. Im sure what saved me from being a complete wreck was my one aunt who loved me so much, Bishop later wrote. Bishops notebooks abound with intimate references to her guardianfor example, I had a letter from Aunt Maud mostly about cutting her toenails. It is very hard to do it while wearing bifocal glasses, but she managed to finish seven before Uncle arrived home for lunch.
Lifelong friend
The earliest of the uncompleted and unpublished poems that follow was written when Bishop was about seventeen, and the latest was written in her sixties. She wrote the first, I introduce Penelope Gwin, while attending the Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts. It appears to be one of two comic poems she rediscovered forty-five years later along with copies of the high-school literary magazine, The Blue Pencil. Bishop refers to them in a 1975 letter to Frani Blough Muser, her lifelong friend who also had written for The Blue Pencil: Ye gods! what awful poetry I wrote then. (I hope to god Im not deceiving myself if I think Ive improved.) . . . I dont think you were nearly as corny as I was. We were very strong on sonnets. My comic poems are a lot bettercoupletsbut I havent the faintest recollection of having written them. Good-Bye was dated 19311934 by the archival staff at Vassar College, where Bishops papers are housed. Villanelle alludes to a central trauma in Bishops twenties. On July 17th, 1937, while traveling by car in Burgundy, Bishop and two of her closest college friends, Margaret Miller and Louise Crane, who was driving, were in an accident in which Margarets right forearm was severed. Bishops notebook entries about the accident are harrowing. In one she writes: The arm lay outstretched in the soft brown grass at the side of the road and spoke quietly to itself.
At first all it could think of was the possibility of being quickly reunited to its body, without any more time elapsing than was absolutely necessary. Oh my poor body! Oh my poor body! I cannot bear to give you up. -Lit Hub
"I Introduce Penelope Gwin ... "
I introduce Penelope Gwin,
A friend of mine through thick and thin,
Whos travelled much in foreign parts
Pursuing culture and the arts.
And also, says Penelope
This family life is not for me.
I find it leads to deep depression
And I was born for self expression.
And so you see, it must be owned
Miss Gwin belongs to le beau monde.
She always travels very light
And keeps her jewelry out of sight.
I will not let myself be pampered
And this free soul must not be hampered.
And so besides my diamond rings
I carry with me but two things:
A blue balloon to lift my eyes
Above all pettiness and lies.
A neat and compact potted plant
To hide from a pursuing Aunt.
(Just as they took my photograph
I saw one coming up the path.
Thats why my eyes are turned away.
I mostly look the other way.)
My aunts I loathe with all my heart
Especially when they take up Art.
And anything in the shape of one
Can make me tremble, turn, and run.
Miss Gwin will give a little talk
And tell of her amusing walk
Through country lanes and sixty states
At really quite astounding rates
With running water, nice hot tea,
And chats with Europes royalty.
Once in the gardens of Tuileries
I met this dear friend in the trees.
With flowers and little birds galore
She quenched her thirst for nature lore.
She fed grilled almonds to the birds
And spoke to them with honeyed words.
Notice her frank and honest eyes.
(It is Miss Ellisin in disguise.)
Once on the Tiber catching fish
I chanced on Madame Dienis.
You recollect her, I suppose
(Notice the parasol of rose
To keep the sunlight from her nose.)
But Russia was, I bring to mind,
The place I made the biggest find.
A Russian Aunt-Eater it was
Large appetiteand lovely jaws.
An Aunt will look at him and faint,
Even the kinds that sketch or paint.
Of course, while in Romantic France
I met with Cupid and Romance.
One glimpse at my rejected suitor
He was a handsome German tutor.
But no! I would be no mans wife,
The stark reality of life
For me, and he was past his prime.
His mouth hung open half the time.
It gave my senses quite a jolt
To find he had begun to molt.
I leave you with this little thought:
What is not is and what is not
(Spoken by General Richelieu
In case you didnt know) Adieu.
Im sure we all admire Miss Gwin.
How very sweet and kind shes been. . . .

NPC asks for report from IGP
The National Police Commission (NPC) yesterday called for a special report from Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara over the manner the police dealt with the anti-SAITM protestors, who invaded the Health ministry last week.
NPC Secretary Ariyadasa Coorey said the Commission expects a detailed report from the IGP over the matter as soon as possible. The InterUniversity Student Federation (IUSF), protesting against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), forcefully entered the Ministry and kept it under their control until a Special Task Force team removed the students.
Around 90 students were injured and hospitalised during the attempt to remove the students.

Old is gold!
Rohini Jayawardena has done Sri Lanka proud by winning a Gold Medal in the Over 70 category in the Singles at the World Masters Games in Badminton and also a bronze in the over 70 Doubles at Badminton. The Daily News sat down with Rohini and discussed her fantastic achievement.
"This is a World Masters Games and it is held once in four years, and the next one will be in Japan. The tournament was held April 22 - 30. I won the gold medal for the over 70 category in Singles in Badminton and the bronze for the over 70 category in Doubles in Badminton. I will be turning seventy in July. At the tournament they calculate it according to what you age would be at the end of 2017. My mentor and the man who made this possible is McLarens Group Managing Director Rohan De Silva. For the last few years he has been encouraging me to take part in different International events. So this is the first time I decided I would," said Jayawardena.
It all happened in the strangest of ways! "It all started because I had to find some way to spend my time while my daughter was in school at the St. Bridget's Montessori. I played at Otter's with a wooden racket and I fell in love with the game. At that time I played at 7.30am in the morning and I played till about 10.00am and then I was so fond of it, I went in the evening at 4.00pm and play till 6.00pm. I started playing of course with a friend of mine. Then some more ladies who were expatriates joined our little group and then they left, and then we locals used to play.
Then I was taking part in tournaments at Otter's. I also used to play in the Otter's club tournaments. Then there was an event for veterans over 40. When I showed some reluctance to play, they prompted me and then I asked them to enter me into all the events over 40. I won the ladies doubles and the singles. At Otters I continued right along. And when there were open events I took part it those," explained Jayawardena
Achievement
Jayawardena was sponsored by McLarens Group setting the incredible events that happened in motion.
"I played during the mornings and evenings and improved my game by playing against very strong men and they used to correct me. I have never played at school level. I have played Badminton in Sri Lanka for the last 40 years and I have never been trained. I was sponsored by the McLarens Group. Rohan de Silva played with me. We all played together at Otter's. He has been playing for many years. He told me that I would do very well internationally! I did not pay much notice to it at that stage.
This time around he wanted me to play in the World Masters but I was reluctant because I was going to London. I go once a year to London to see my brother. I was to return on the 19th but the World Masters was on the 22nd in Auckland, so Rohan De Silva entered me. Of course I could not go for the opening ceremony. So I came back from London, and just changed the suitcases and then I went to Auckland," pointed out Jayawardena.
Challenging
The experience was very challenging for Jayawardena.
"I had just one day's practice and I was initially a little nervous about the cold because the courts are not heated. I was entered for three events - Singles, Doubles and Mixed Doubles.
I had a partner who was going with me for the mixed doubles, but he had a heart condition and could not come. But I wanted to play Mixed Doubles after going all that distance, and asked for a partner. So they gave me a partner, but then again there is no practice, you get onto the court with them and play. I did not go far in the Mixed Doubles so I had to concentrate on the singles.
So in the Semi-finals it was a three setter and I played against a New Zealander and the finals was also against a New Zealander and it was very easy - it was two sets. When I won the final I was so shocked. I just stood in the middle of the court in shock, I didn't move out of the court until I saw people running to congratulate me!," explained Jayawardena
This dramatic moment was made even more special when Jayawardena was told she had won a bronze medal.
"In the Ladies Doubles I had a partner from America who they had paired off with me. When I went to get my gold medal, they told me to accept my gold medal and receive a bronze medal! They told me that I was to receive a bronze as well. Apparently I had won the bronze for the ladies doubles as well! So I ended up with two medals," added Jayawardena
Magnificent experience
It was a magnificent experience for Jayawardena.
"I don't know if I will take part in four years' time! It was a very good experience. Only now do I realize how important it is when everyone tells me how great it was! The people in New Zealand are very friendly and my opponents were very gracious. After it was over they came up to me and praised me and wished me the best. The Indians were full of support! They wanted to take photographs with me! When this came in the papers, my brothers' son wanted me to come to Australia, so I could show the medals to his children as an inspiration to all. When Sri Lankans in Melbourne found out that I had got a gold medal for Sri Lanka, they all wanted to take pics with me!," described Jayawardena
28 countries took part in it, and this is not only for Badminton, but for Netball, Football, Soccer, Swimming at 46 venues. There were all kinds of sports. 28,000 participants were there. Everything was done under tight security with Jayawardena having to get her accreditation badge to enter the courts.
"In the individual events you represent your own country. In the mixed doubles my partner was an Australian. But you just get on to the court with no practicing. You just get up there and play. Having seen me playing in the mixed doubles I had a cheering squad when I played singles! My Doubles partner, an American called Linda and I played four games- Quarter -finals, semi-finals and finals. In the mixed doubles I also played four but the scores were not enough to win a medal," said Jayawardena.
Jayawardena also mentioned how much her daughter, her only child adores her and believes in her (Rohini's) prowess.
"She has been my most ardent supporter. She wished me at 3.00am in the morning and told me - 'mama you are going to win!' it was like a premonition. She was very sure I would win. I would attribute my success to all the years of hard work. Also the confidence I have built up also helped. When I took part in this tournament I was not at all nervous and I am amazed how cool I was. I wanted to do something for the country and myself!," said Jayawardena.
Jayawardena believes to succeed you need to focus your mind.
"You must be really determined. Determination is why I have succeeded. I was determined. You need to set your mind on doing something to achieve something," summed up Jayawardena.

One Nation, Many Gods
The Cabinet of Ministers issued an unusual statement recently. I am highlighting several passages including ensure that our nation never again returns to a conflict-ridden past, communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build, deeply concerned by the recent incidents of violence targeting places of religious worship, shops and business enterprises, and houses, denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities, direct the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country, deep appreciation to civil society and religious leaders who have stepped up to counter the attempts of a few to spread hate in our country, and who have called for calm and peaceful co-existence, nation is blessed by the teachings of the four great religious traditions in the world  Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam  which provide us the guidance required for peaceful co-existence, upholding human values, and honest and hard work required to rebuild our nation as one of the most progressive in the region.
Religious tension
The Prime Minister said separately, reminding the country about the violence and destruction that was caused by religious tension in 2014, the country would not face such a situation again. We do not want to stoop to such low levels. We will not permit such action again..
The Anglican Bishop added, the government also ignores such provocative acts at its own peril. If it does not send a clear message to the country that it will not tolerate hate crimes against any group, it is paving the way for its own demise as well as leaving the door open to another prolonged period of religious and ethnic strife, economic stagnation and international opprobrium. It is also the duty of all religious groups to actively promote the peaceful resolution of differences and misunderstandings. This is the minimum that we owe our country and its people for the common good of all.
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka, went onto say. We reiterate the fact that Christian churches have been subject to violence, intimidation and threats over the past few years. We are of the opinion that the current crisis, which has been precipitated through TV debates and pronouncements of politicians, is only trying to deal with the visible wounds and symptoms of a problem without trying to address the root causes.
The President has followed with a Cabinet paper that establishes District Level Reconciliation Committees to address incidence of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tensions and to promote national integration and reconciliation in all 25 districts with a broad remit of functions.
Advancing a vision for religious freedom
If we are serious about freedom of religion we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths. And when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up. We have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion. We have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone.
How can intolerance be countered globally
1. Fighting intolerance requires law:
Each Government is responsible for enforcing human rights laws, for banning and punishing hate crimes and discrimination against minorities, whether these are committed by State officials, private organisations or individuals so that people do not take justice into their own hands and resort to violence to settle their disputes.
2. Fighting intolerance requires education:
Intolerance is very often rooted in ignorance and fear: fear of the unknown, of the other, other cultures, nations, religions. Intolerance is also closely linked to an exaggerated sense of self-worth and pride, whether personal, national or religious. These notions are taught and learned at an early age. Education is a life-long experience and does not begin or end in school. Endeavours to build tolerance through education will not succeed unless they reach all age groups, and take place everywhere: at home, in schools, in the workplace, in law-enforcement and legal training, and not least in entertainment and on the information highways.
3. Fighting intolerance requires access to information:
Intolerance is most dangerous when it is exploited to fulfil the political and territorial ambitions of an individual or groups of individuals. Hatemongers often begin by identifying the public's tolerance threshold. They then develop fallacious arguments, lie with statistics and manipulate public opinion with misinformation and prejudice.
4. Fighting intolerance requires individual awareness:
Intolerance in a society is the sum-total of the intolerance of its individual members. In order to fight intolerance individuals should become aware of the link between their behaviour and the vicious cycle of mistrust and violence in society.
5. Fighting intolerance requires local solutions:
Many people know that tomorrow's problems will be increasingly global but few realize that solutions to global problems are mainly local, even individual. When confronted with an escalation of intolerance around us, we must not wait for governments and institutions to act alone. We are all part of the solution.
Specific provisions in the Penal Code in Sri Lanka relating to hate speech
Section 290:
Injuring or defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class.
Section 290A:
Acts in relation to places of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class.
Section 291:
Disturbing a religious assembly.

Overweight pregnancy increases risk of birth defects
Risks of major birth defects increased in step with the severity of a mothers obesity or overweight, a study published recently has found.
Based on these results, women should be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle and be at a normal body weight before conception, said researchers led by Martina Persson, a researcher in the clinical epidemiology unit at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.
The studys findings are not entirely new, but expand on previous knowledge, Persson said in an email. Past studies have shown an increased risk of congenital malformations among obese mothers.
What was not known is whether the same risk increased when mothers were simply overweight and whether risks escalated as the severity of overweight/obesity increased.
More than a million women studied
Persson and her colleagues analyzed data on more than 1.2 million live births, excluding twins and other multiples, in Sweden between 2001 and 2014.
For the mothers in the study, being underweight was defined as having a body mass index of less than 18.5. Normal weight ranged from BMI 18.5 to 24, while overweight ranged from BMI 25 to 29. Obesity among the mothers was categorized as either class I, a BMI of 30 to 34, class II, a BMI of 35 to 39, or class III, a BMI of 40 or higher. Body mass index is the ratio between a persons weight and height.
A total of 43,550 of the infants -- 3.5% -- had a major congenital malformation, the researchers found when looking at the medical records. Heart defects were the most common birth defect, followed by flaws in the genital organs, limbs, urinary system, digestive system and nervous system.
Babies of normal-weight mothers had a 3.4% risk of a major congenital malformation, the researchers calculated. By comparison, the proportion of major birth defects among the children of overweight mothers was 3.5%. Among the babies of mothers in obesity class I, the rate was 3.8%; in obesity class II, 4.2%; and obesity class III, 4.7%.
We demonstrate increased risks of major malformations also in offspring of mothers with overweight and risks progressively increase with a mothers overweight and obesity severity, Persson said. She noted that these results show a connection -- but cannot prove a direct cause -- between maternal weight and birth defects.
Risk of congenital heart defects, malformations of the nervous system, and limb defects also progressively increased as BMI rose from overweight to obesity class III, while genital and digestive system defects increased in babies of obese mothers only. Overall, the study showed, the risk of a major malformation was higher in boys, 4.1%, than in girls, 2.8%.
Overweight and obesity in pregnancy increases risks of several severe complications in the mother and her child, said Persson, who added that high rates of obesity are a problem in many parts of the world.
A study released this week in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than 2 billion adults and children globally are overweight or obese; that equates to one-third of the worlds population.
The benefits of a healthy weight
Dr. Siobhan M. Dolan, a medical adviser to March of Dimes who was not involved in the study, said the findings are consistent with prior research, which shows an association between increasing weight and adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth and birth defects.
Dolan, who is a professor of obstetrics/gynecology and womens health at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, said the research demonstrates a dose-response relationship between increasing weight and increasing risk for congenital anomalies. In other words, the more overweight a mother, the higher the odds for a baby born with a defect.
Getting to a healthy weight has so many benefits, for both mothers and babies, including decreasing risks of diabetes and hypertension for moms, as well as decreasing risks for preterm birth, said Dolan.
Dr. Raul Artal, professor and chairman emeritus of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and womens health at Saint Louis University, said the new study is important in that it emphasizes a medical problem around the world. He was not involved in the new study.
Obese women, overweight women and sedentary women have a very high incidence of diabetes and high blood pressure in pregnancy. As a result, their offspring are at very high risk for certain congenital malformations that come along with obesity, said Artal, who is a maternal fetal medicine specialist.
Congenital heart disease is by far the most common birth defect among mothers that have obesity and diabetes, Artal said. Other birth defects include neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and hydrocephalus, where cerebrospinal fluid causes pressure on the brain, cleft palate, anorectal aphasia, where a child lacks an anus and the lower bowels, and limb reductions or absence, for example, a missing foot.
The vast majority of babies born to obese mothers are large for their gestational age with organ maturity delay, said Artal. So they could have problems with breathing ... and they have delayed neurodevelopment and the vast majority of them end up having childhood obesity, he said.
Obesity then becomes an inter-generational problem, one that is grossly neglected, said Artal.
Getting started before pregnancy
Artal noted that until the mid-1980s, textbooks told women they should rest as much as possible and indulge during pregnancy. Among certain physicians, this advice continues. Women have heard this for generations, said Artal. Since 1985, he has been the main author of the guidelines for exercise in pregnancy published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and updated most recently two years ago.
If women followed these exercise guidelines during pregnancy, they will be in good shape, figuratively and literally, said Artal.
Current guidelines for weight gain for pregnancy are 28 to 40 pounds for women who are underweight, 25 to 35 pounds for women who are normal weight, 15 to 25 pounds for women who are overweight and 11 to 20 pounds for women who are obese.
Generally, pregnant woman should watch their weight and use judicious weight gain in coordination with their physician -- but taking into account that the current guidelines for gestational weight gain for overweight and obese women are excessive, said Artal. And you can put excessive in bold letters and put my name behind that.
Join the conversation
The March of Dimes Dolan emphasized that pregnant women should eat a healthy, well-balanced diet and take a daily prenatal vitamin containing 400 micrograms of folic acid, beginning before conception and continuing with a daily prenatal vitamin that has 600 micrograms of folic acid throughout pregnancy. Thirty minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week is also recommended for most pregnant women.
But getting to a healthy weight is a big part of what women can do before they become pregnant, along with quitting smoking and discussing any medications they take with their doctor, said Dolan. If we can help women get to a healthy weight and to quit smoking, we can help prevent some birth defects.
Persson also suggests women do what they can to avoid birth defects. Her research, she said, should encourage women in reproductive age to strive towards a normal BMI before conception.

Pakistan oil tanker fire: 148 dead, over 80 wounded
PAKISTAN: At least 148 people have died and scores more were injured in a fire that broke out after an oil tanker flipped over in central Pakistan early Sunday, an official said.
At least 148 people have been killed and more than 80 wounded in a fire which erupted after an oil tanker turned over and victims rushed to collect spilt fuel, senior local government official Rana Mohammad Saleem Afzal told state television.
There was no immediate confirmation from officials on the cause of the accident or the fire after the tragic incident occurred early Sunday near the town of Ahmedpur East, some 670 kilometres (416 miles) south of the capital Islamabad. The Pakistani military said it was sending army helicopters to evacuate the wounded, with hospitals placed on high alert.
Pakistan has an appalling record of fatal traffic accidents due to poor roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.
At least 62 people including women and children were killed in southern Pakistan in 2015 when their bus collided with an oil tanker, starting a fierce blaze that left victims burnt beyond recognition.

Pakistan oil tanker fire death toll 148
An overturned oil tanker burst into flames in Pakistan after a person tried to light a cigarette nearby, killing at least 148 people who had rushed to the scene of the highway accident to gather leaking fuel, an official says.
About 80 people were injured, with many suffering serious burns. The tanker overturned after trying to make a sharp turn on the national highway on the outskirts of the city of Bahawalpur, about 100 kilometres southwest of Multan.
The tanker was driving from the southern port city of Karachi to Lahore, the Punjab provincial capital, when the driver lost control and crashed.
People of the area and passers by had started gathering fuel when the tanker exploded, burning everybody on and around the spot, provincial government spokesman Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan said.
Imran Shah, a spokesman for the highway police, told a local TV channel police moved quickly to redirect traffic but could not stop the scores of villagers who raced to collect the fuel.
Residents were told of the leaking fuel over a loudspeaker atop the local mosque, deputy commissioner of Bahawalpur, Rana Mohammad Salim, said.
Eyewitnesses said about 30 motorcycles that had carried villagers to the accident site lay in charred ruins nearby.
Eight other vehicles were destroyed, they said.
Firefighters fought the flames for over two hours before extinguishing the fire.
Serious burn victims, several in critical condition, were airlifted by helicopter to hospitals in Bahawalpur and nearby cities for treatment. The dead included men, women and children, Mr Salim said.
Rizwan Naseer, the head of the Punjab provinces rescue services, said many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition. The Prime Ministers office said the Punjab provincial government had been directed to provide full medical assistance. - ABC NEWS

Plans to reduce indirect taxes to 60 percent:Mangala
Indirect taxes account for 80 percent of the governments tax income. This will be brought down to 60 percent within the next two years bringing tangible relief and benefits to the innocent and poor people, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He said when indirect taxes levied on peoples daily essentials are reduced, the prices of goods will come down sharply.
The increased income earned from direct taxes will be invested in mass scale projects to promote economic development, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister expressed these sentiments when he called on the Malwatte Prelate at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings on June 24.
He was accompanied by development strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme and Finance State Minister Eran Wickremaratne.
Minister Samaraweera said there was a large number of tax evaders among those liable to pay income tax. Even high income bracket doctors, lawyers and architects were among the tax evaders.
He said the country was in deep crisis when the government took over power after the last Presidential Election. On the other hand, there was a severe setback to democracy. Sri Lanka was isolated by the international community because democracy was in danger and media freedom was crushed with killing, abduction and torture of journalists.
As a result of the action taken by the President and the Prime Minister to form a new consensus government by bringing together the two main parties, the future course of the country had been rebuilt on three strong edifies of democracy, harmony and development, Minister Samaraweera said.
He said no country could march forward in isolation. The government had succeeded in winning over the maximum international confidence for the country within a short period. One of the striking benefits was the restoration of the GSP Plus facility and the removal of the prohibition on fish exports imposed by Europe.
The good governance government had been able to re-establish and strengthen diplomatic ties with several counties and enter into free trade agreements with China, Singapore and India.
There was high international recognition of the programme of work enunciated by the President and the Prime Minister and countries such as Russia and Australia had established enhanced high level diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka, the Minister said.
He said Minister Ravi Karunanayake had rendered a great service by accepting the Finance Ministry portfolio at a most difficult time in the countrys history.
The country was engulfed in a severe debt trap when the government assumed power and the debt burden was being systematically decreased today, the Minister said. He said 17 essential items were brought under price control as soon as the government assumed power. He said attracting foreign investment was compulsory in order to develop the country.
Minister Samaraweera who also called on Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma and Ven. Niyangoda Sri Vijithasiri Anunayake Theras of the Malwatte Chapter, said the government was keeping a close tab on forces trying to take the country backwards.
The SAITM Private University was established during the time of former President Mahinda Rajapakse.
SAITM had a peaceful existence for five years but all opposition and demonstrations against it started after this government came to power. He said the GMOA staged a strike even without concern for the patients suffering from dengue.
Minister Samaraweera also called on the Asgiriya Prelate at his temple and resumed his blessings.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Malik Samarawickreme and State Minister Eran Wickremaratne also called on the Malwatte Prelate and received his blessings in June 24.

Qatar Airways eyes investment in American Airlines
American Airlines has received an unsolicited approach from Qatar Airways which wants to acquire 10% of the US carrier.
In a regulatory filing, American Airlines said Qatar intended to buy at least US $808 m of its shares.
American Airlines said it would respond in due course.
Shares in American Airlines, which is the biggest airline in the world, initially rose 5%, but fell back to a 1.1% rise by the end of trading. Qatar Airways said it sees American as a good investment opportunity and would not involve itself in management, operations or governance.
Qatar Airways believes in American Airlines fundamentals, the firm said.
In 2015, Qatar Airways took a 10% stake in International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia.
Then in July 2015 it increased its stake to 20%, becoming IAGs biggest shareholder. But the airline has encountered turbulence.
Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Yemen and the Maldives cut diplomatic ties with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt all said they would stop flights in and out of Qatar, and close their airspace to the countrys flag carrier, Qatar Airways. (BBC)

RAMADAN MESSAGES
Ramazan message is universal
The contemporary human being suffering from limitless greed, is engaged in a journey of unending desire for material wealth. This devastating behaviour has influenced to create disunity and mistrust among people and spread unease among them, states President Maithripala Sirisena in a Ramazan message.
Mutual respect, equality, sacrifice and helping the poor which are practiced in society during the month of Ramalan, which is practiced by the entire Muslim community with utmost devotion, shows that the emancipation of humans depends not on self-interest, but on the feeling of the others welfare.
Accordingly, the message conveyed to humanity through Ramalan or Eid-ul-fitr celebration is universal in its manifest. It expects everybody to be fair to all, based on religious, spiritual and social ideals. The rituals of Ramalan remind us that humanity can be improved by being sensitive to the others sentiments, while being honest to ourselves. I extend my best wishes to all Islam devotees who celebrate the Eid-ul-fitr, which has such meaningful vision that addresses the common humanity by exceeding religious limitations.
Ramazan celebrated with sense of fellowship, co-existence: PM
The Ramazan Festival is celebrated by Muslims with a deep sense of fellowship and co-existence in countries throughout the world, states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a Ramazan message. The message adds. Ramazan ends a time of fasting undertaken as a period of reflection and religious observances, marked with alms giving and sharing with others.
The fasting associated with Ramazan encourages mental and physical commitment to the faith and also enables families and communities to connect with one another and renew values sacred to Islam.

Eid Mubarak to all Muslims in Sri Lanka and throughout the world.
Heartiest greetings to all Muslims in Sri Lanka

A month that you abstain from having food and water from dawn to dusk and also keep away from innate desires. The Holy month of Ramazan has spiritual significance and physical effects. All Muslims fast in the month of Ramazan and it is declared obligatory in the Holy Quran as the third fundamental pillar of the faith Islam, he added.
The Holy month had many other values to consider, as to demonstrate our social and moral aspects in recalling unity without division, strengthening reconciliation of relationships among all communities. It is also the month where Muslims contribute to charity work, and donations for the less fortunate, the minister said.
According to the source of Islamic guidance, the month of Ramazan is the most virtuous in the Islamic Hijri calendar and indeed it is the month of patients and tolerance, the minister added.
Pray for peaceful co-existence, unity, progress

Report presented to Cabinet soon
A report on increasing the retirement age for the private sector workers up to 60 will be presented to the Cabinet soon, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J.Seneviratne said.
According to the Minister,the report will be presented to the cabinet after discussing the issue with the National Labour Advisory Council.
Several proposals had been made by various trade unions requesting the Government to increase the retirement age up to 60 years.
The retirement age of public sector employees is 60 years (with the five years they serve on service extensions).
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that although the private sector employees retire at the age of 55, they serve for the same company or another company after retirement. But,they face discrimination when the employer has the power to decide whether or not to give contracts of few months or one year. When a worker retires and joins the same company or another on contract basis, no other benefits will be given to the employee except their monthly salary. Their contracts can be cancelled at any, he added.

Shariah law : A call for reforms
As we celebrate Eid-Ul-Fitr this year, we look into one of the most contemporary issues affecting the Muslim Communitythe need to reform the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act of 1951.
The article below tackles one of the most important issues of Muslim divorce; maintenance and the need to have equitable maintenance in the aftermath of separation.
The MMDA is the enactment which governs and regulate the marriage and divorce among the Muslims of Sri Lanka. Sec. 47 (1) of the MMDA empowers the Quazis to inquire and adjudicate the following matters related to pecuniary claims;
a) Any claim by a wife for a recovery of Mahar
b) Any claim for maintenance by or on behalf of a wife.
c) Any claim by divorced wife for maintenance until the registration of the divorce or during her period of Iddat.
d) Any claim for to increase or reduction of the amount of any maintenance.
e) Any claim for Kaikuli
f) Any claim by a wife for her lying in expenses. These provisions abundantly show that a Quazi has unlimited jurisdiction to hear claims of a wife in respect of compensations and related matters. The MMDA is silent regarding compensations (Mata) to divorced women who are deprived of any alimony, in the event of being divorced arbitrarily by their husbands.
In the light of the practical problems and the plight faced by the poor divorced Muslim women, it is appropriate to find some remedy compatible with the tenets of Shariah.
Quranic reasoning
It is befitting to see the holy Quran for guidance in this respect. The holy Quran in the following instances reiterates as follows:-
Chapter - 2, Verse 229:
.. The parties should either hold together on equitable terms or separate with kindness. It is not lawful for you (men) to take back any of your gifts (from your wives).
Chapter - 2, Verse 236:
There is no blame on you if ye divorced woman before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (a suitable gift) the wealthy man according to his means. A gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right thing.
Chapter - 2, Verse 237:
And if you divorce them then the half of the dower is due to them, unless they remit it or the mans half is remitted.. And the remission of the mans half is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget liberality between yourselves, for Allah sees well all that you do.
Chapter - 2, Verse 241:
For the divorced women is a suitable gift. This is a duty on the righteous.
Chapter - 4, Verse 20:
But if you decide to take one wife in place of another, even if you had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back, would you mean it a slander and a manifest sin. The above Quranic verses amply show that the Shariah expects benevolence and righteousness from a Muslim husband when he divorces his wife and promotes and approve payment of gifts in the form of compensation to the divorced wife.
Islamic Schools of thought
This concept is further illustrated by the Imaams, Scholars and theologians, who interpret the same in favour of Mata in the following manner;
Among the Shafies, a present is incumbent on the husband in every case of separation, when the right to the dower has once vested in the woman, it is not defeated or lost by any conduct on her part, says Mohammedan Law Vol. 2, page 404, Ameer Ali.
On divorce and apart, altogether from the payment of Mahar, the husband shall make a gift to the divorced wife; this payment is to compensate her for her lost consortium and is based on the text of the holy Quran 2:236, says Muhammadan Law -Fyzee.
Quran chapter -2 229 says The Arab husbands frequently despoiled their wives, and turned them adrift on the world, absolutely helpless and without means. These acts of injustice were expressly forbidden by the Quranic teachings. It was declared to the Arabs: If you separate yourself from your wives, send them away with generosity; it is not permitted to you to appropriate the goods you have once given to them.
Under the Islamic system, there is no community of goods between husband and wife, she is absolute owner of her own property and of whatever the husband settles on her as dower, states Mohammedan Law vol. 2, page 423, Ameer Ali.
In Syria, Tunisia and Morocco legislation had been enacted to check the power of unilateral divorce and imposed on the husband the liability to pay to the divorced wife an additional indemnity by way of compensation, states Tunisia Code of personal status -1956 - Syrian law of personal status - 1953 - Moroccan Code of personal status 1958. Shariah the Islamic law-Abdur Rahman I Doi.
In India, Muslim Women (protection of right of Divorce) Act 1986 has been enacted to provide compensation to the divorced wife.
Decided cases; Bai Thahira vs Ali Hussain AIR 1979 S/C 362 and in Tamil Nadu, Wakf Board vs Seyed Fathima Nachchi AIR 1995 Mds 88, was held by the Madras Supreme Court; the Wakf Board had to pay maintenance to the claimant wife.
In Sahihul Buhary, it is reported in vol. 3, page 229-230, by Umar Bin Abdul Azees(Rah), If the husband and wife exchanged gifts between them, it is not permitted to take back any of the gift.
The wife is entitled to maintenance from her husband although she may have the means to maintain herself and although her husband may be without means, states Tyabji 289(1)(C). In Sri Lanka, MMDA does not make any provision for the award of Mata though the holy Quran permits, encourages and provides the payment of a gift to the divorced wife. But instead it is very unfortunate that Kaikuli has entered into the system of Muslim marriages in Sri Lanka with legal recognition.
Kaikuli is a form of dowry from the bride to the bride-groom which is anathema to Shariah law. Shariah enjoins husband provide Mahar to wife, when marriage is contracted and not vice-versa. The concept of Kaikuli would have entered in to our law books due to the influence of South Indian culture prevailed at the time of the enactment of the said Act.
There are also practical difficulties of enforcing an order of Mata payment, by a Quazi who uses his discretion, due to non-availability of provisions in MMDA in this regard. This would be a salutary piece of provision if Mata is introduced to the MMDA in keeping with equity and in fairness to an estranged, victimized divorced wife. At the same time the legitimate fair interest of the husband also have to be considered, as he may be taken into ransom and victimized by the divorced wife, who may differ her second marriage to receive the monthly maintenance, while leading an immoral life against Shariah.
In conclusion, it is stressed that it may be pertinent that the committee appointed to make recommendations of reforms to the existing Muslim Laws, shall take steps to remedy this lacuna in the law and in this regard consult the learned ulamas, scholars and legal practitioners to introduce necessary amendments to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, within the tenets and acceptance to the Shariah Law.

Shorter, Faster, Better: On the Beauty of Literary Compression
One of my mentors used to say this about the short story: the timer starts as soon as you read the first sentence. This was a scary thoughtI didnt (and dont) like to feel rushed when drafting or reading. But it was only later when I realized what he meant: he was talking about momentum. A pace, a gait, particular to the short story.
Each writer finds her own idea of momentum. My own sense of it comes from a desire for density. The urge to pack a great deal into a small space. Compression. To pack, to squeeze, to fill to the brim. Some of my favorite practitioners of compression Amy Hempel, Grace Paley, Eudora Welty. Compression not only means packing a lot in; it also means knowing what (and where) to cut. In a 2003 interview with The Paris Review, Amy Hempel writes about her transition from journalism to fiction.
But journalism taught me how to write a sentence that would make someone want to read the next one. You are trained to get rid of anything nonessential. You go in, you start writing your article, assuming a persons going to stop reading the minute you give them a reason. So the trick is: dont give them one. Frontload and cut out everything extraneous. Thats why I like short stories.
Getting rid of anything nonessential means the sentences that are there are left to carry more weight. I like to imagine each sentence carrying its own five-pound dumbbell.
Article continues after advertisement
This past spring, I taught my first graduate-level fiction workshop. Id had the whole class planned out, but the night before the class would meet for the first time, I couldnt sleep. I was suddenly nostalgic for the two pieces that Id be teaching the next day, pieces that I might even be introducing to some of my students for the first time: 1) one of the first poems Id ever read and 2) one of the first short stories Id read: Robert Haydens Those Winter Sundays, and John Cheevers Reunion. Both gave a jolt to my heart.
That night lying awake, I wasnt thinking about their respective formpoem and short story. I was thinking about the fact that both pieces are about fathers, and I was thinking about the emotional forcethose five-pound dumbbells everywhereof compression. Here are the first five lines of Haydens Those Winter Sundays.
Sundays too my father got up early And put his clothes on in the blueblack cold, then with cracked hands that ached from labor in the weekday weather made banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.
And here are those first sentences of Cheevers Reunion.
The last time I saw my father was in Grand Central Station. I was going from my grandmothers in the Adirondacks to a cottage on the Cape that my mother had rented, and I wrote my father that I would be in New York for an hour and a half, and asked if we could have lunch together.
Of course, these are very different fathers. That lunch in Reunion becomes a terrible spiral, a series of aborted meals. My heart, as it leapt the first time, and as it leaps every time it reads that sentence, the first twelve words, was reacting/is reacting to compression. My reader-brain is overwhelmed by the ability of that first sentence to take a bulky emotional state with unbearably jagged edges and to squeeze it into so few words. In his poem An Ordinary Evening in New Haven, Wallace Stevens tells us that the poem is the cry of its occasion, and Cheevers first sentence announces its occasion with such compression that the emotional pull feels effortless there.
Haydens poem tells its own short story, and the poems first line contains just as much emotional power as Cheevers first sentence. My favorite word in Haydens first line is toofrom this word alone, we know the speakers father gets up early every morning. This is the beauty of compressionits the difference between My father got up early every morning, and he also did this on Sundays and Sundays too my father got up early.
One of the things I love about the short story form is that we can take in a full story, with all it has to offer its readerplot, characterization, dialogue, settingin one sitting. This isnt something that the novel allows (unless, of course, youre a rare reader who reads a novel in one sitting). How stunning to our reader-brainsonce you reach that last sentence, you may, if you like, immediately return to the first. We adore this particular pleasure the way we relish in eating an overwhelmingly dense meal in twenty minutes. For me, its the very same pleasure I have when reading a favorite poem.
Compression does not imply a certain length. Id argue that Amy Hempels San Franciscoa short short story, only about a page longis just as compressed as her longer short story, In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson Is Buried. No word is wasted. Each sentence has at least two reasons for existing on the page. The impatient readerimpatient for backstory, for full explanation and character motivationwill not be satisfied. Hempel is for the reader who is willing to embrace unknowns. When was the speakers friend in In the Cemetery diagnosed How old was she How did she feel when diagnosed Does she have more friends A love life These are questions some fiction workshops would urge the storys writer to answer and unpack. A poems power may rest in what is left unsaid; the fiction writers ability to embrace unknowns can be central to compression and its power. Hempel famously wrote In the Cemetery as an assignment in a class taught by Gordon Lish. From Hempels interview with The Paris Review:
INTERVIEWER
Do you remember the first class
HEMPEL
Vividly. The assignment was to write our worst secret, the thing we would never live down, the thing that, as Gordon put it, dismantles your own sense of yourself. And everybody knew instantly what that thing, for them, was. We found out immediately that the stakes were very high, that we were expected to say something no one else had said, and to divulge much harder truths than we had ever told or ever thought to tell. No half-measures. He thought any of us could do it if we wanted it badly enough. And that, when I was starting out, was a great thing to hear from someone who would know.
INTERVIEWER
What was, if you can say, your worst secret
HEMPEL
I failed my best friend when she was dying. It became the subject of the first story I wrote, In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson Is Buried.
But Hempel is selective in her telling of this secret in the story; what she keeps at bay is just as important as what she allows in. (Ah! Even her response to the Paris Review interviewer is compressed and careful: I failed my best friend when she was dying. Something so complex and ragged with emotion in a simple sentence.)

Significance of Id-ul-Fitr
Islam as a natural and perfect religion caters to everything good in society. It not only directs man on how to worship his creator and sustainer and obey him but also changes his behaviour and attitudes as regards his celebrations.
Before the advent of Islam, Arabs used to celebrate certain days and occasions in an uncivilized way indulging in drinking, gambling, adultery etc. But after Prophet Muhammad, Islam changed that barbaric pattern of society and introduced a civilized, refined and cultured way of celebrating. The aim of Id-ul-Fitr is to introduce a cultured form of celebration that offers the following benefits to mankind.
Social and spiritual bliss
Id-ul-Fitr gives the true picture of social equality when all the Muslims irrespective of caste, creed and colour, wealth and position gather together and bow down before Allah the Almighty.
At this point we must comprehend that social and spiritual bliss cannot be achieved without a strong inner conviction. Honesty cannot be advocated for other if we cannot paractise it ourselves.
Love and affection cannot be strengthen if we ourselves cannot practise it. The Muslims are those who believe in the commands of Allah and do good.
The fasting teaches us to solve our daily problems and to learn to adjust our system to reduce hunger, poverty, and discomfort so prevalent in our community.
Islam wants us to fast so that we may train ourselves to render a service to mankind.
Let us therefore, on this important and significant occasion return to this natural and purified state in which God created us.
Let us from this day, maintain this state freed from sins, so that we can truly withstand evil and destructive temptations that are running mankind. The difficulties of man cannot be solved by erecting external structures but by transforming himself from within.
Virtues of tolerance and discipline
It is only when man has found peace within himself and when he has built up the virtues of tolerance and discipline that he can radically approach and eliminate his problems, and fasting helps us to this end. Thus Id-ul-Fitr conveys the message of social equality, charity to the poor and self-equality; charity to the poor and self-discipline to all the mankind irrespective of their social status and ethnic origins. At this juncture it is our profound duty as true Muslims to transmit those values to other nations.
May Allah guide us to achieve these noble aims and grant us the good of this world and the good in the hereafter.

SL scientist invents portable biogas  plant for waste management
Sri Lankan Scientist Srimal Tissera has invented a compact portable biogas plant,which will be distributed to the local market from July 1.
The pollution-free and environment-friendly biogas plant has been manufactured by using local raw materials and natural technology.
Speaking to Daily News Business Scientist Tissera said the plantis manufactured for the benefit of households, hotels, hospitals, schools, factories and similar institutions to dump their daily waste and thereafter to generate gas for cooking purposes.
He said even the places such as Sri Lanka Army, Navy, Air Force and Police quarters where huge amount of organic waste collect every day could use this environment-friendly biogas plant.
According to Tissera about two kilograms (domestic -0.5 CBM) kitchen waste, fruit waste, coconut refuse, vegetables, and garden waste and hotel oil waste, paper pulp, water hyacinth (Japan Jabara) or salvenia takes six hours to complete reduction into waste.
He said during his research he also developed a high-calorie digestible anaerobic bacterial inoculums accelerator with local raw materials using native medicine to enhance the anaerobic bacteria production and the efficiencies of digestion process.
Before manufacturing this biogas plant I gained the knowledge through trial and error methods by visiting biogas plants in many countries, he said.
A biogas plant
Tissera also highlighted the difference between his biogas plant and other biogas systems, commonly used in Sri Lanka and said hedeveloped it with high-calorie digestible microbes inoculum accelerator which can even convert low-calorie digestible microbes to high-calorie digestible microbes using various native medicine to maintain the pH values.
As an experimental project, I first introduced few domestic and industrial green gas plants and installed them at several places, he said
He said this biogas plant operates efficiently for a long period with minimum operational and maintenance work.
In addition, I have also developed a high-calorie digestible inocu-accelerator to produce more biogas and active organic liquid fertilizer with less organic waste and it also became very successful, he said.
According to Tissera, a 5000 Lt (5 CBM) plant (industrial) requires only 10 to 15 kg of organic waste a day to produce 2 -3kg Bio gas and 100 liters of liquid organic Fertilizer.
The plants should be placed strategically to fall sunlight on them and allow the temperature of about 25 C to over 40 C. The higher temperature coupled with the microbes make the Active household or any orgaLiquid Organic Fertilizer and the Bio Gas generation process is extremely efficient.
He said the Bio Gas Plant is Environmental Friendly and Long lasting and therefore it will be an asset to any organization or household and the Bio gas also produces Liquid compost fertilizer.
The plant consist a very simple technology which produces Bio Gas and liquid compost fertilizer with mere organic waste which has been a menace to the Environment.
He further said he needs to see this concept being beneficial to the nation as biogas is an invaluable and long lasting technology which produce a clean fuel and high quality organic fertilizer with mere organic waste which is freely available.
He said he also provided some plants to few schools with the approval of the Ministry of Education for students who study Bio Technology Education.
He also mentioned that many seminars were organized in schools to educate students on this Bio Gas plant and an exhibition was also held at Peradeniya Central College, Kandy.
-The plant can produce about six to seven hours of gas a day, .

It can be observed that certain persons are slandering the Maha Sangha levelling baseless allegations through the social media. Levelling fabricated allegations and slinging mud on the Maha Sangha through social media mainly through facebook, cannot be accepted, the President said at the Amarapura Nikayas Upasampada ceremony held at the Kaluthara Bodhi yesterday.
Politicians are used to facing fabricated allegations of this nature.But it is strange for the Maha Sangha since they have not faced such situations, he said.
The President pointed out that Maha Sangha should lead the country through national issues. The country needs the leadership of Maha Sangha especially when national issues come up. Therefore,the Maha Sanga should guide and provide advice when needed mainly when the country is facing a national issue the President added.

South Africa's Morris has no qualms over bizarre Roy exit
TAUNTON, Saturday  Chris Morris said South Africa were prepared to take it and run after the extraordinary dismissal of England's Jason Roy helped set up a morale-boosting win in the second Twenty20 international at Taunton.
A tour that had already seen the Proteas lose a one-day international series to England 2-1, and cement their reputation as serial under-achievers at major events with a first-round exit at the Champions Trophy ODI tournament before Wednesday's nine-wicket thrashing in the first Twenty20, was heading for yet another defeat while Surrey opener Roy was making a stylish 67 at Taunton on Friday. But the match swung South Africa's way when Durban-born Roy became the first player in a Twenty20 international to be given out obstructing the field.
The incident happened when Roy veered off a straight course and was hit by a throw from Andile Phehlukwayo when short of his ground. South Africa appealed and, after the decision was referred to third umpire Tim Robinson, the former England opening batsman decided, as required under cricket's Law 37, that the obstruction had been wilful and Roy, to his visible dismay, was given out. The Proteas still had work to do, with England now 133 for three in the 16th over chasing a victory target of 175.
But with seam-bowling all-rounder Morris taking two for 18 -- a haul that gave the 30-year-old the man-of-the-match award -- South Africa held England to 171 for six for a three-run win that saw them level the three-match series ahead of Sunday's finale in Cardiff. An unapologetic Morris said of Roy's exit: It's part of the rules.
It looks a lot worse than it actually is with us appealing like that, but you've got to appeal to get a decision from the umpires.
We'll take it and run, but the on-field umpire told me at the time that the right decision was made. South Africa's victory was achieved despite the absence of coach Russell Domingo, who made an emergency return home after his mother was involved in a car crash. It's been a tough tour, admitted Pretoria-born Morris in answer to a question from AFP at a press conference. I still maintain in the Champions Trophy we lost the game at the wrong time, added Morris, with top-ranked South Africa suffering a pool defeat by bottom-ranked Pakistan, the eventual winners, before another group loss to beaten finalists India sealed their fate. We've been so good over the last 18 months and we just lost the game at the wrong time.
It's been blown up in our faces that we never perform well in those tournaments. Southampton wasn't good for us obviously. England outplayed us there (in the first Twenty20).
We weren't good enough on the day, they absolutely destroyed us, Morris added.
We knew we needed to put up a good fight. It's one hell of a honour to play for South Africa and I think the boys showed it.
We proved out there we'll scrap to win a game of cricket. Meanwhile England captain Eoin Morgan was confident there would be no lingering bitterness between the teams at Cardiff as a result of Roy's unusual dismissal. Absolutely not, not at all, Morgan told reporters. We'll take it for what it is. Everyone in the changing room thought it could go either way so it's not massively controversial.
England's cause was not helped by new batsmen walking out in real gloom on a ground with no floodlights.
It wasn't easy in that light, said Morgan, who added he would have changed his decision to field first had he known how bad it would get.
Asked by AFP if those were the darkest conditions he had played in, Morgan replied: By a country mile.
But Morgan insisted England had only themselves to blame, saying: We didn't deserve to win because we didn't capitalise on the start we had.

Sunshine Healthcare selects Microsoft Azure-enabled IFS apps for ERP
Sunshine Healthcare replaced its legacy systems with IFS Applications, an integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution by IFS, after an annual audit.
The IFS Applications ERP solution, which runs on the cloud computing platform Microsoft Azure integrated the companys Sales Force Automation System (SFA) and CRM with the central warehousing unit.
As a result, the healthcare provider has been able to eliminate capital expenses, improve business continuity and increase reliability.
The cloud-based offer from Microsoft for IFS Applications has enabled Sunshine Healthcare to increase the breadth of their deployment as well as scale the number of employees and customers in line with business growth.
Microsoft Azure is a proven cloud environment that delivers encrypted data protection as well as business continuity features that a typical on-premise installation would not include.
With a rise in companies migrating to the cloud, Microsoft Azure offered both Sunshine Healthcare and IFS Applications a level of reliability that would be very expensive to achieve and eliminates the requirement to maintain physical servers on-premises.
Equally, the ability to utilize Azures global network of data centres in order to integrate existing IT assets, reduce complexity and risk, enticed IFS and the healthcare provider to embrace the cloud platform while providing them the capability to scale.
As a result of our rapid expansion in operations, we needed a resource planning system that could simplify our processes, Managing Director Sunshine Healthcare, Shyam Sathasivam said. When combined, Microsoft Azure and IFS Applications proved its worth as a robust solution compared to the rest of the ERP solutions in the market. In fact, it outperformed all of them due to Azures cloud-based scalability and agility.
Jayantha De Silva, President/ CEO for IFS Sri Lanka, said, In collaborating with Microsoft to run IFS Applications on Azure, we realized just how well the cloud-based platform was aligned to the needs of our customers. We at IFS influenced Sunshine Healthcare to proceed with Azure as its so instinctive and easy to use, it helped us to do more for user experience.
The entire IFS Applications suiteincluding all enterprise resource planning (ERP), enterprise asset management (EAM) and enterprise service management (ESM) moduleswork on Azure. A growing number of businesses are choosing IFS Managed Cloud on Microsoft Azure, which is a full-service, managed single-tenant offering where IFS manages the cloud infrastructure, operating system, database, middleware and IFS products.
Brian Kealey, Country Manager for Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives, said, From Office 365 to Azure IaaS, were happy to partner with Sunshine Healthcare again. Azure IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting up and managing an on-site data centre. This makes it an economical option for both Sunshine Healthcare and IFS. It even allows for normal application and data access in the event of a server disaster or outage.

The minister was replying to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday. However, the minister declined to disclose their names.
We want to take best out of our diplomatic missions. We cannot allow incompetent persons to hold those positions and enjoy their time at the expense of public money, he said.
He said the Government aims to promote commercial diplomacy and attract more Foreign Direct Investment to the country. Together with the President and Prime Minister, I will formulate a proper system to ensure optimal service from our diplomatic missions, he said.
He said all Ambassadors in Sri Lanka including honorary consuls have been invited for a meeting chaired by the President and Prime Minister on September 4 to discuss how to carry forward the Governments agenda.
Observing that Sri Lanka has 63 diplomatic offices abroad, the minister said those would be upgraded where necessary and some would be closed down.
Responding to a question by a journalist on gazetting the Development Lotteries Board and National Lotteries Board under the Foreign Ministry, Karunanayake questioned back why similar concerns were not raised when the Higher Education Ministry was amalgamated with the Highway, Transport Ministry was amalgamated with the aviation and when the President took over the TRC.

Tweets outside Twitter
Good morning on this great Monday. Strap on some binoculars and slip on a pair of walking shoes. (And bring an umbrella, just in case.)Come, let's go watch some Unidentified Flying Organisms.
If you are lucky you would not need to walk far. Stand still in a corner of your garden, watch, listen, and observe. Chances are you will detect at least five or six feathered visitors moving gracefully among the shrubs, trees, and flowers, breaking into magical songs every now and then, staying still in silent meditation or coming together for an early morning board meeting on a telephone wire.
Apart from the occasional crow who might have wanted to share your lunch with you, if you had not had much exposure to these dinosaur descendants, high time you looked out the window and spotted one right this minute.
Here's why: according to a research paper in the Bioscience journal, lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress are associated with the number of birds people could see on any given day, especially during the afternoons, (regardless of what species of birds they were looking at). Previous studies have also put the change in well-being down to the fact that people feel relaxed and connected to nature when looking at birds and trees.
In other words, what better way to relax and unwind than watching beautiful, peaceful birds  and, of course, the squirrels and other wildlife that frequent your garden. You don't need to be a sage to realize its nearly impossible to worry about deadlines, rude drivers, family concerns, or even the ISIS crisis when you lose yourself in a world of colorful feathers and beautiful sounds.
Sight and sound
So, among the multitude of reasons you might like to see birds in your garden, the principleand most rewarding oneis that you enjoy the sight and sound of them. All other reasons largely pale in comparison to the amount of enjoyment you will get from simply having interesting bird species visiting your yard.
Then again, birds are voracious pest eaters too. While some are happy to alight on a feeder you have placed out for them and have a feast, others are just as happy to hop about your yard picking off slugs, bugs, and other crawlies while they are waiting in line. Even better, species of birds that may not be attracted to the type of food you have laid out for them, will nevertheless stop by because the presence of other birds gives them a sense of safety.
On top of enjoying their song and the fruits of their bug-snatching labors, you also get a chance to participate in the ecosystem of the birds. Most of the birds you will feed and see will be fairly common to your locale, but every so often you get the reward of seeing something unusuallike an Indian Pitta stop in your yard to fuel up on its incredible journey away from the cold Himalayan forests in winter.
So where should you get started If you'd like to see more wildlife of the feathered kind in your backyard but had written off attracting birds as too time-consuming, expensive, or complicated, think again. Birds have really basic needs, and providing for them is not costly at all.
Needs of birds
As Jason Fitzpatrick writes in his article 'How to Turn your Backyard into a Bird Refuge', birds need food, water, shelter, and nesting materials. These things can be provided in as simple a fashion as a banana on a parapet wall, a pan of water, a bush to hop into, and an old clay pot with a hole in the middle hung on the wall. Of course, if your tastes or your budget are so inclined, you can go wild buying all manner of fancy feeders, nesting boxes, baths, too, but this is not strictly necessary.
Mainly because a bird can hardly tell the difference between a costly bird's house and a discarded clay pot. Experts suggest you should get started quickly and inexpensively, and that you can decide later if you want to open a five-star bird hotel with fountain-baths and a rotating buffet of handmade treats.
Birds love water, says Fitzpatrik. Once they figure out you have got some sort of water source in your yard, they will be there every day drinking, splashing, and preening in it. You don't need a backyard pond or a massive water fountain to attract birds to your yard. Even a modest source of water will do just fine as long as you do the right things to grab their attention. Nearly anything can serve as a birdbath as long as you keep a few design elements in mind. Your bird bath should be shallow. It can have a "deep end" but most of the bath should be shallow enough for small birds like sparrows to stand comfortably. The bath should be located with plenty of escape routes nearby. Bathing makes it harder for a bird to make a speedy escape and increase the chance a predator will snatch them. Make sure to put the birdbath in a location that is either safe from most predatorsas it would be high up on an apartment balconyor provides plenty of low hanging branches or other easy to reach roosts in case the birds need to bolt.
Compared to providing food and water, providing any sort of elaborate shelter is significantly less important. You can attract plenty of birds to your yard with some inexpensive feed, and a source of water. That said there are two kinds of shelter you should keep in mind when planning on drawing birds into your yard.
If you are looking to help birds become not just diners but permanent residents of your budding bird sanctuary, some sort of shelter beyond just bushes and accessible overhangs is in order. You can buy bird houses or make them yourself. The key thing to keep in mind regarding bird houses is that birds really don't care what the bird house looks like. All a bird needs is a hole just the right size for it to wiggle in and a decent sized inner cavity once it gets inside. Whether that cavity is inside an old tree or a gaudy birdhouse shaped like a pink Cadillac isn't of any interest to the bird, advises Fitzpatrick.
Benefits
Finally, when everything is in order, you will realize making lifew easier for birds is a win-win. As said before, bird-watching can boost your mental outlook, decrease stress, improve work performance, and even help improve kids' attention spans.
On the flip side, turning your yard into a five-star dining experience for our feathered friends helps alleviate some of the hardships they are enduringthings largely caused by people in the first placesuch as habitat loss and climate change. As bird-watcher Sher Jay says, The thing about birding is that nothing can prepare you for it, but it profoundly changes the way you look at the world.
You will never realize how much beauty, diversity and wonder you have been missing right before your eyes, daily, until you begin birding. It makes you pay attention and focus swiftly on minutiae, it anchors you in the present tense, amplifies all your senses, and it helps you perceive everything as important, particularly because every encounter is so fleeting. You grow tolerant of changing externalities that you have no control over, and if you are anything like me, you finally learn to tweet outside the realm of Twitter. The best part of being a new birder is that every bird is an unidentified flying organism to you; its a brave new world, inhabited by curious, alien, aerodynamic works of art that are well worth exploring!
So what are you waiting for Get birding!

Vettel, Hamilton clash as Ricciardo wins in Baku
Baku: Sebastian Vettel was penalised for dangerous driving after deliberately crashing into title rival Lewis Hamilton in a wild and chaotic Azerbaijan Grand Prix won by Red Bulls Daniel Ricciardo on Sunday.
Hamiltons Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas snatched second place from 18-year-old Williams driver Lance Stroll in the final straight, as Vettel finished fourth ahead of Hamilton to extend his championship lead to 14 points. Despite Ricciardos win, the race will be remembered for the angry confrontation between former world champions Vettel and Hamilton.
Ferrari star Vettel was handed a 10-seconds stop-go penalty during the race for dangerous driving after he deliberately drove into Hamiltons Mercedes while both were following the safety car.
Vettel claimed Hamilton had braked in front of him and he responded by driving into the back of his rival before then bumping the Briton from the side.
I think its just not driver conduct. Its dangerous driving and to get a 10-second penalty for that... I dont need to say anything else, Hamilton told Sky Sports.
Vettel pleaded innocent.
Nothing happened, did it He brake checked me as well, so what do you expect, the German told Sky.
Im sure he didnt do it on purpose but for sure it was not the right move. If Im struggling, people at the back struggling even more, so I dont think it was necessary.
I got damage, he risked damage. Hes done something similar in China at the restart a couple of years ago so its not the way to do it, I think.
I passed him because he pitted. After the incident, we were side by side, I raised my hand and told him, well I didnt say anything, but showed him that I wasnt happy with that.
Making the most of a series of extraordinary incidents and interventions in an action-packed race, which included three safety car interventions and a red-flagged stoppage, Ricciardo, who started 10th, roared home 3.904 seconds ahead of the rest to deliver his first win of the season. Esteban Ocon of Force India was sixth ahead of Kevin Magnussen of Haas, Carlos Sainz of Toro Rosso, who also survived a first-lap collision, two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who scored McLarens first points of the year in ninth, and Pascal Wehrlein of Sauber.
Hamilton, who had dominated after a strong start from his 66th pole position, was also undone by a loose headrest that caused him to be ordered to pit for repairs, for safety reasons.
Bottas meanwhile produced a brilliant drive to take his fifth podium finish of the season, having dropped to the back of the field after a first-lap bump with fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen. AFP

Widows emerge from the shadows of shame
International Widows Day was observed on Friday June 23, this year. The United Nations ratified the day of action to address the poverty and injustice faced by millions of widows and their dependents in many countries.
For millions of women across the globe, becoming a widow marks the beginning of a life of unspeakable suffering and tragedy. For these women and their children, widowhood is not simply a change in marital status, but the end to economic, social, political, physical and emotional security.
Absent in statistics, unnoticed by researchers, neglected by national and local authorities and mostly overlooked by civil society organisations  the situation of widows is, in effect, invisible.
Yet abuse of widows and their children constitutes one of the most serious violations of human rights and obstacles to development today. Millions of the worlds widows endure extreme poverty, ostracism, violence, homelessness, ill health and discrimination in law and custom.
The first trauma
To give special recognition to the situation of widows of all ages and across regions and cultures, the UN General Assembly declared 23 June 2011 as the first-ever International Widows Day, to be celebrated annually. The theme for the 2017 observances is: Never Alone - a reassuring mark of solidarity for this hapless segment of society and to share the spirit of hope and healing with as many widows as possible. It is a comforting thought that there are hosts of dedicated persons ready to assist this overlooked portion of the population by providing support, education, healing, caring, sharing and strength.
Once widowed, women in many countries often confront a denial of inheritance and land rights, degrading and life-threatening mourning and burial rites and other forms of widow abuse. Widows are often evicted from their homes and physically abused  some even killed  even by members of their own family. In many countries, a womans social status is inextricably linked to her husbands, so that when her husband dies, a woman no longer has a place in society. To regain social status, widows are expected to marry one of their husbands male relatives, sometimes unwillingly. For many, the loss of a husband is only the first trauma in a long-term ordeal.
In many countries, widowhood is stigmatized and seen as a source of shame. Widows are thought to be cursed in some cultures and are even associated with witchcraft. Such misconceptions can lead to widows being ostracized, abused and worse. Research by HelpAge International, for instance, has found that in Tanzania hundreds of older women  mostly widows  have been killed because of accusations of being witches.
The children of widows are often affected, both emotionally and economically. Widowed mothers, now supporting their families alone, are forced to withdraw children from school and to rely on their labour. Moreover, the daughters of widows may suffer multiple deprivations, increasing their vulnerability to abuse. Such cruelties are often seen as justified in terms of cultural or religious practice. Impunity for abuses of the rights of widows is rife, with few perpetrators ever successfully brought to justice. Even in countries where legal protection is more inclusive, widows can suffer social marginalization.
A severe impact
Across a wide spectrum of countries, religions and ethnic groups, a woman is left destitute when her husband dies. Poverty is often made worse by little or no access to credit or other economic resources, and by illiteracy or lack of education. Without education and training, widows cannot support themselves or their families.
Poor nutrition, inadequate shelter and vulnerability to violence, combined with a lack of access to health care, can have a severe impact on the physical and mental well-being of widows. The sexual and reproductive health needs of widows may go unaddressed, including the fact that widows are often the victims of rape.
They are particularly vulnerable in the context of HIV and AIDS. Women may be kept unaware of the cause of their husbands AIDS-related death and made to undergo ritual cleansing through sex with male relatives regardless of HIV status. The economic insecurity stemming from widowhood also drives some women and girls to sex work.
They struggle to care for themselves and their children in their own countries, refugee camps or countries of asylum. In several post-conflict situations, high numbers of children depend on widowed mothers  often young women, sometimes children themselves  as their sole support. Widowed grandmothers are also left caring for orphaned and sick grandchildren. In countries coming out of conflict, such as Sri Lanka, they are vulnerable to ongoing exploitation and often experience further violence and discrimination in the post-conflict period. Mistreatment of widows can have a negative impact on investments in peace and security, feeding the cycle of poverty, breeding unrest and insecurity, and ultimately challenging democracy and sustainable security.
A self-employment programme
With reconciliation being high on its agenda, the Sri Lankan government launched an empowerment scheme for widows in the country and has extended the implementation of a self-employment programme to former members of militant groups. Of roughly about 900,000 widows in Sri Lanka, approximately more than 600,000 belong to the age group of 40 years and above. Even though exact details are not immediately available with regard to those who became widows in the wake of the 26-year-long armed conflict (1983-2009), a considerable number of widows is said to be belonging to this category.
The scheme now covers the widows in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullativu and Ampara, Trincomalee and Batticaloa , Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
According to the 2012 Census, women are heading 23 per cent of 5.2 million households in the country. Their share in the overall population of about 20 million is around 51 per cent. A senior official in the Ministry of Womens Affairs says that field officials of her department have identified the beneficiaries including those who are heading households.
The scheme has been inaugurated simultaneously in all the districts. Economically weaker sections will be targeted under the scheme. The focus will be more on awareness generation, improvement of skills and provision of technical assistance. Another decision taken by the government is to extend the self-employment programme, which has been in vogue since 2012.
The programme also covers those who were once involved in terrorist activities and who subsequently underwent rehabilitation. Soft loans are being provided to beneficiaries so that they can lead their lives in a dignified manner. Approximately, 2,500 persons have benefitted. The number of applications received is around 7,000 says an official source.
Healthcare, decent work, full participation in decision-making and public life, and lives free of violence and abuse, would give them a chance to build a secure life after bereavement.
Importantly, creating opportunities for widows can also help to protect their children and avoid the cycle of inter-generational poverty and deprivation.
International Widows Day is an opportunity for action towards achieving full rights and recognition for widows  too long invisible, uncounted and ignored.

Down and dirty All Blacks have tip for Lions
AUCKLAND, Sunday  All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has fired up the verbal war with the British and Irish Lions again, suggesting they play New Zealand style to be competitive in the second Test in Wellington next week. The world champion All Blacks put away their razzle dazzle to get down and dirty when they beat the Lions 30-15 in the first Test in Auckland on Saturday.
With the Lions outsmarted at their own game, and losing the crucial forward battle, Hansen recommended they run the ball more often because that was when they were at their most dangerous.
They were a whisker away from scoring in the opening minute when they took the All Blacks by surprise and went wide only for Elliott Daly to be rolled on his back and forced into touch as he dived for the line. The Lions then stunned Hansen with an 85-metre sweep featuring Liam Williams, Jonathan Davies and Daly before flanker Sean O'Brien finished the move with a try. When they can score tries like that first one you're sitting there thinking they should be doing that more often, Hansen said.
That was probably one of the best Test tries I've every seen. It was an observation taken on board by Gatland who regretted his Lions suffered from a lack of finishing skills.
You could argue that Ben Te'o's an option to shift the ball and create an opportunity for an overlap chance, he said.
You finish those chances and it changes the whole mindset and momentum of the game and unfortunately we created those and didn't quite finish them off.
Instead the Lions persisted with trying to prove their declared aim of being the best forward pack in the world and Hansen said they lost that battle too.
Our tight five were very, very good. If your tight five do the job everyone else can play.
The Test was always going to be won in the tight five and I think we won that battle ... we've got to be extremely proud of what they did, he said. - AFP

## Title: An Uncommon Man
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

An Uncommon Man
She is not your typical Sri Lankan wife and he is not the common man you would expect a local film director to be. When two strong and unusual personalities meet, it is inevitable that sparks would fly. During the 36 years they were together Nihara Rutam, nee Jayatilleke has seen her award winning filmmaker husband, Chandran Rutnam, grow with each film and put the Sri Lankan emblem in the global cinema arena.
The film maker
Chandran is different from most of the local film directors because his initial background started from The Bridge On The River Kwai during the 1950s. His foundation was set by the Academy Award winning director David Lean. Therefore his outlook was based on that experience. He looks at things differently and his direction too is different from typical local directors. That is why his work can easily be adapted by foreign cinema goers.
The husband
Chandran makes a fantastic husband. Here too he is not like a typical Sri Lankan husband. He is broadminded and flexible. He does not have the hang ups that most Sri Lankan husbands have. He gives me a lot of freedom to pursue my own dreams and expand my horizons. He encourages me a lot in whatever I take up.
He is also a very easy husband. He is not particular about food or other household matters. We do not keep maids. Though he does not know how to do household chores he would definitely give them a try if you tell him how to do them. The only thing he might be particular about is how his wardrobe should be. I am lucky to have him as a husband.
First meeting
I was working as the first marketing manager for Oriflame in Sri Lanka and I was on my way to a training session in India. Chandran too was on his way to India to take part in a film festival. We met at the airport in Chennai. I didnt see him though we had briefly bumped into each other there. I happen to gatecrash the after party he was hosting. He actually remembered me because as soon as I walked in with my friends he said, Oh, you were at the airport with me. I generally do not take much notice of anybody when I am travelling so I dont remember him much. I was surprised to see him because he was not what I had expected him to be.
Chandran had to head off to Malaysia the next day because he was a juror at the Malaysian Film Festival. However we kept in touch.
Route to matrimony
Our relationship was filled with loads of controversy. Chandran was going through a divorce then. I am a Sinhalese Buddhist while he is a Tamil Christian. He is also almost double my age. My mother knew that I would always do something different with my life. She knew that I would not just settle for a typical Sri Lankan man! She was shocked about my choice and she did not exactly like it but she did not oppose of it either.
The proposal
Chandran proposed quite a number of times to me. I love shoes and once he bought around 10 pairs of shoes for me, a diamond ring and 3000 red roses. I didnt say yes that time. Later he put up a 12 foot banner across Havelock Road saying Nihara, I love you. Will you marry me  Chandran. Thats what probably did it.
Lots of people say I am very unusual for a Sri Lankan. So a normal Sri Lankan man wouldnt have matched me. Chandran was different. He is very broadminded. That was something that really attracted me. He was extremely romantic too. We have been going out with each other for 20 years before we tied the knot in April 13, 2001. We have been married for 16 years.
Greatest production
I cant pinpoint one film and say that it is Chandrans greatest creation. He does some simple and light movies as well but I think that each one of those other serious movies have been unique in scope. Alimankada was done facing a lot of hardships because it was shot during the terrorist era. I was very difficult for us to get permission to engage in certain things then.
Every movie has a story behind it and every creation has its own unique style. Chandran is still making movies and his latest is a kids movie. It is a huge project which will have some international actors starring in the project. He is currently discussing it with some people in the states.
If he is done with making movies I could say that I think this particular movie is his greatest. However I do have a particularly soft corner for Alimankada. I was very involved in that project because I was an associate producer and the hardships we faced made the movie close to my heart.
Careerwise
Whenever he comes up with a new project Chandran gives me the script to read. He changes the script about a 100 times and I get a reading each time. I am not a movie buff at all. Therefore I am very critical. Chandran likes that very much. He even involves me when we select the cast because sometimes he cannot say no to some people while I put down my foot and say no to certain things that dont seem right.
I have told him from day one, no acting in movies for me. However while shooting for A Common Man the actress who was stepping in as an extra was getting late to come to the sets. So he got me to do the part which was on screen for only a few seconds. I also appeared in a scene in According to Mathew.
I run the Asian Aviation Center. Chandran is the chairman of the company. We train pilots, aircraft engineers and technicians. Overall anything I do he backs me up 100 percent. He has a lot of confidence in my abilities.
The joy of their life
We have a seven year old daughter, Danara. She is schooling at Musaeus College. I fly and she has seen me in my piloting uniform. Probably because of that she says that she wants to be a pilot when she grows up.
Memorable moments on the sets
Chandran is the head of Asian Film Location Services and had assisted a lot of foreign projects that were shot in Sri Lanka. Being on the sets can be fun but stressful as well. The director could be very demanding or the actors could be difficult. Once there was an Indian movie shooting here and the actress was the nose up in the air type. This particular scene was being shot at my office in Rathmalana. I allowed her to rest in my room. She did not know who I am but she was acting very snobbish. I had to cut her down to size.
While shooting Water John Abraham was such a humble and down to earth guy. We thought that Sir Ben Kingsley is very snooty but he was actually living his role throughout the shooting sessions. Since I am not a movie fan I do not get starstruck when I meet internationally known actors.
There were good moments and bad moments on the sets. However at the end of the day once the movie is done you part as friends.
Chilling out
We hardly have time to relax. Being with Danara is relaxing. We go out for dinner or just spend some time with her going somewhere like down south. Time is very limited. We would love to vacation abroad but we just cannot find the time to do so. France is one of our favourite places to visit. We like to walk for hours over there.
Chandran relaxes by watching movies. I love horse riding. He is interested in horses too because his parents had kept horses. I am in the committee of the Royal Turf Club so we head off to Nuwara Eliya for the races.
Foodwise
I cook breakfast and dinner. My mother makes lunch for us. We both love Japanese and Thai food. Chandran is a spaghetti bolognese fan. We try to stick to very basic things on a normal day to day basis. We only have a pizza every two months. No burgers or French fries.
Three lesser known facts
Chandran is a very private person.
Everyone thinks he is tough but he is a very big softie  in a nice way.
Everybody things that he is this high flying, sophisticated man but he is very simple in his tastes and down to earth. We do not lead the usual lifestyle of a film director. He likes simple things in life which only a few have realized.
Life together in a few words
Our life together is very exciting, never a dull moment and unpredictable.

Amaranth Bay a popular choice for MICE events
Amaranth Bay Resort and Spa, the new small luxury resort located in the idyllic fishing village of Uppuveli, north of Trincomalee, is fast becoming a popular venue for residential conferences, workshops and seminars. The resort is being sought after for such events due to its secluded location and natural setting amid coconut and palmyrah groves.
The UN agency, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), brokered the adoption by its member countries of the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, which came in to force in June 2016.
The latest event at the Amaranth Bay was two training courses held for officers from the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard, as a follow up to coming in to force of the agreement to deter illegal and unregulated fishing.
The two training courses held during the first half of June was attended by 36 officers. One group took part in the implementation of the PSMA and the other on Basic Nautical Knowledge.
The fisheries officers came from Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kalmunai, Mannar, Mulalaitivu, Negombo and Trincomalee, while the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard officers came from the Northern and Eastern Command Operations.
The purpose of the training was to strengthen Sri Lankas capacity to implement its international obligations in carrying out inspections of fishing and fish transport vessels. The training course was a full residential course and the Amaranth Bay provided conference and secretarial facilities, and full board and lodging for the participants in addition to 6 trainers.
With the coming in to force of PSMA, all coastal states are now obliged to carry out inspections of foreign fishing and fish transport vessels that wish to load, offload or receive port services.
Amaranth Bay, which won two Trip Advisor commendations within a short space of two years of its operation, has once again been awarded 2017 Certificate of Excellence this month by tripadvisor.

Bitter but better!
Bitter Gourd also known as 'Karawila' (Momordica charantia) belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family, is a popular vegetable in Sri Lanka especially because of its medicinal value. It is good for those who have diabetes. It is also good for your overall health. Garden Talk features Development officer, Provincial Deputy Director's office of Agriculture Ratmalana P.A.G.C. Siriwardhana who spoke about this nutritious vegetable.
"It is a little bitter when consuming, but the bitterness can be reduced, by the way it is cooked. In that sense it can be a tasty meal. It can be grown in regions up to 1200m above sea level. The soil must be rich in organic manure with a good drainage system. PH of the soil must be 5.5 - 7.5," said Siriwardhana.
There are varieties of Bitter Gourd -
* MC 43
* Thinnaveli White
"Karawila is a vine. After around three weeks the vine needs to be trained. For this a 2m Mesh is used. The Karawila vine is attached to this mesh. So it grows vertically along the Mesh. After that, the vine spreads over the roof of the mesh horizontally, after reaching a height of 2m. Of course the secondary branches must be removed (they are unproductive). Since the vine needs to be maintained at a certain height the mesh is 2m. (The Mesh acts as a support to the Vine)
When growing in a home garden we use a 2m branch to support the vine. The vine is attached to the branch. And it grows along the branch vertically. However even in a home garden a mesh can be used. After reaching a height of 2m, the vine hangs down, without further support," stated Siriwardhana
There has to be a good drainage system and it has to be irrigated according to soil moisture content. If there is too much heat or too much rainfall, when growing commercially, then it is best to opt for the nursery before planting in the field (direct seedlings). Because of too much heat or rainfall the seedlings get damaged.
Protection
"Also the plant has to be protected against insect attacks. The melon fly (Bactrocera cucurbitae)
The pod must be covered by a polythene wrapping. The fly, at the larvae stage is in the soil. Then when it becomes an adult it lays eggs in the pod. The larvae in the pod starts to eat from within. Then the pod falls to the ground/ to the soil. Then the life cycle begins again. So when the pod is covered, the fly cannot lay its eggs. However when covering with a polythene the polythene needs to be opened from below - So the air can come in. So the polythene wrapping must be longer than the pod. The covering must be applied at the early stage of the pod.
If there are pods that have fallen to the ground, they need to be removed immediately and destroyed. This is because the larvae in those pods can cause problems. The life cycle needs to be broken.
There are more methods that can be used to fight the fly. We can use a protein bait. The scent draws the fly to its destruction. The bait has a poison and it is sprayed to the leaves. There is yet another way and that is the hormone trap," explained Siriwardhana.
Then there is the fungi and virus threat. When it comes to fungus problems the leaves become diseased and should be removed and burnt. There is the mosaic virus - the plant weakens and yellow patches emerge and growth is retarded. Then automatically there is a low yield. Then the plant must be uprooted and destroyed. On a commercial basis we need to apply chemicals.
Reaping the harvest
"We must also identify when to reap the harvest. There are ridges in the pod and we can be sure the time is right when the ridges expand in size. When the pod matures you can reap the harvest. We know the pod has matured when the ridges widen and thicken. Through experience it can be determined. The color also may change. Size could get elongated," pointed out Siriwardhana
When growing Bitter Gourd in your home garden, you have two alternatives.
"You can directly plant in in the garden (direct seedling) or you can plant it in a polythene bag (the bag must contain organic manure and top soil). When you plant the seeds in the polythene bag and when the seedling emerges, you can strip off the polythene and place the soil mound containing the seedlings in the hole in the garden. Before transplanting the soil mound, the hole in your garden should contain organic manure and top soil. The height and width of the hole should be 1ft. When planting the seeds in the Polythene bag it takes one week to two weeks for the seedling to appear.
We can also use direct seedlings. (When you plant the seeds straight away in the hole). What is done there is the hole is prepared and three seeds are planted. When the seedlings emerge we keep two seedlings and remove one. We keep the two best seedlings and remove the other one. Because the hole is not sufficient for three seedlings," added Siriwardhana
Even commercially like in Home Gardens direct seedlings are used - that is planting them directly in the fields.
"But when conditions are not favorable the seedlings are prepared in the nursery. However when conditions are favorable people go for direct seedlings- planting them directly in the field. In the field, the hole should contain organic manure and top soil. Commercially the spacing should be 1.5m x 1m. (This is not necessary when growing in home gardens). Again three seeds are planted, the best two seedlings are kept and the other one is removed.
In around 60 - 75 days the pods appear," pointed out Siriwardhana.
These Karawila plants can be grown in Dry Zone and Wet Zone. However in the Dry Zone it is grown according to the seasons - Maha and Yala. During Maha season - it is grown during October and November and in the Yala season - April and May.

Boeing kicked off the 2017 Paris Air Show in style with the launch of the much-anticipated 737 MAX 10. The aircraft, the newest member of the MAX family, is pitched directly against the long-range Airbus A321LR and features a 66in (cm) fuselage extension over the smaller MAX 9, giving it the capacity to carry up to 230 passengers.
The 737 MAX 10 extends the competitive advantage of the 737 MAX family and were honoured that so many customers across the world have embraced the outstanding value it will bring to their fleets, said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Kevin McAllister. Airlines wanted a larger, better option in the large single-aisle segment with the operating advantages of the 737 MAX family. Adding the 737 MAX 10 gives our customers the most flexibility in the market, providing their fleets the range capability, fuel efficiency and unsurpassed reliability that the 737 MAX family is widely known for.
Boeing launched the MAX 10 on the back of more than 240 orders and commitments from over ten lessors and operators including ALAFCO, SpiceJet, TUI Group and the China Development Bank Aviation.
In addition to the extended fuselage, the CFM International Leap-1B-powered MAX 10 will also incorporate other changes over its stablemates including levered main gear, a flat aft pressure bulkhead (rather than the existing dome design) and a modified wing to reduce low-speed drag. (Airliner World)

Bottom trawling to be banned
Parliament is to pass laws banning bottom trawling in Sri Lankan waters next month.
With the passage of the legislation, Sri Lanka will recognise fishing operations utilising trawl nets as a punishable offence.
A Bill to amend Section 28 of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, No.2 of 1996, will be moved for this purpose by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera on July 6.
According to the Bill, fishing operations utilising Trawl Nets towed by motorized or mechanized fishing boats and the sale, import and transport of such nets and the issuance of licenses relating to utilization of such nets will be prohibited.
However, concerns have already been raised that the Bill proposes very lenient punishments for those who are found to be guilty of the offense. The Bill only proposes a jail sentence for a term not exceeding two years or a fine not less than Rs.50,000 for persons convicted by the court for violating the above mentioned law. Those who engage in bottom trawling in Sri Lanka are businessmen and they make huge profits. Lenient punishments would encourage them to continue the offense than discourage them, JVP Parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti pointed out.
Ministry Secretary W.M.R.Adikari speaking to the Daily News said attention has been paid to increase the minimum fine during the Committee Stage of the Bill in the House. An Amendment to increase the fine from Rs.50,000 to Rs.500,000 is being considered, she said.MP Galappatti also told the Daily News that the Bill does not cover the foreign trawlers engaging in fishing in Lankan waters. Replying to this concern, the Ministry Secretary said officially banning the use of trawl nets in Lankan waters would in turn make the Indian trawlers culprits for two offenses, namely for trespassing the borders and engaging in an illegal method of fishing. She also said an Amendment to Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act No.59 of 1979 would be in the House in another two weeks time, adding that it has proposed significant increase of fines upto Rs.100 million on foreign vessels engaging in illegal fishing in Lankan waters.
This legislation, which is at the Attorney Generals Department, has provided sufficient teeth to act against foreign vessels poaching in Lankan waters, she added.
The legislation to ban bottom trawling was compiled incorporating details of the private members bill presented to the House by TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran in April 2015.

British woman stranded in Sri Lanka after husband killed

A fifty-nine-year-old British woman has been left stranded in Sri Lanka after selling her home and marrying a twenty-six-year-old local who was shot dead.
The British woman, Diane De Zoysa says she gave 100,000 to husbandPriyanjana De Zoysa when she moved to live with him in Ahungalla, in the south west of the country, last year.
She met her husband who works in a hotel when she was on holiday in Sri Lanka six years ago, before returning seven months later to marry him.
However, her husband was tragically killed last month after being shot three times at a friend's house.
Diane De Zoysa says her husband was killed by men trying to blackmail him for money.
She said 'They thought he was a rich man as he had a nice house, a minibus and a three-wheeler. He paid them but they wanted more.'
The widow explained that she sold her home in Edinburgh to live with her husband in Sri Lanka last year.
She then bought a house in Sri Lanka under her husband's family's name, as well as helping him set up a minibus service.
Diane De Zoysa said: 'My husband and his family are very poor, so I have helped them. I gave up everything to join my husband here.
'I never imagined that I would be at my husbands funeral. I thought that I would die first, seeing as Im a lot older than him.'
She says she is now desperate to return to Scotland, but is unable to do so due to her financial situation.
The police investigation into the death of Priyanjana De Zoysa is still underway.

Bumper deal for Bombardier
Canadian manufacturer Bombardier has received a major boost for its Dash 8-Q400 turboprop after securing a significant commitment from Indias SpiceJet. The letter of intent, signed at the Paris Air Show, covers up to 50 examples including 25 firm and 25 purchase orders and is valued at up to $1.7bn if all options are exercised.
Announcing the deal at the Paris Air Show, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer said: We are proud to sign this agreement as it is another demonstration of the Q400s superiority in the turboprop market. When finalised, the repeat order will increase the Q400 aircraft fleet in the fast-growing market in the Asia-Pacific region and will launch the high-density 86-passenger model of the Q400 aircraft in India. This is also compelling evidence that the demand for turboprop aircraft is healthy in short-to medium-haul markets that cant economically support jets that are more expensive to operate.
Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet added: I am delighted that we will be acquiring 50 Q400 planes. SpiceJet operates Indias largest regional fleet and is the only organised operator in this space. The acquisition will help us further increase connectivity to smaller towns and cities and help realise Prime Minister Narendra Modis vision of ensuring that every Indian can fly. Our passengers will be able to fly to more cities and help expand Indias already booming aviation market.
Deliveries of the first examples, which will be configured in a high-density 86-seat layout, is expected early next year.
The SpiceJet deal came just hours after Philippine Airlines increased its outstanding Q400 order to 12 aircraft by firming up its seven purchase options. Meanwhile, the Canadian manufacturer confirmed Ethiopian Airlines as the undisclosed customer behind last weeks five-aircraft order. (Airliner World)

Cheers!
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has this tendency to swim against the tide. When he was a minister under the Chandrika government he spearheaded the Sudu Nelum Movement that was meant to extend the hand of friendship to the Tamil community, as against the LTTE, which was not well received by the nationalist and Sinhala hardliners who viewed all Tamils as Tiger sympathisers. These elements wanted the war to continue in earnest and the Sudu Nelum campaign was viewed as demoralising the security forces.
Presently Minister Samaraweera has spoken in favour of reducing the price of soft liquor such as wine and beer so that more and more imbibers, bent on hard liquor, would switch their preference to the less injurious brands. Speaking in parliament on Thursday, while moving a Notification on under the Excise Ordinance, for debate, the minister proposed to relax laws pertaining to the sale of wine and beer in the country adding that relaxing the issue of licenses for wine and beer sales would deter consumption of illegal liquor (kassippu) which commands a market as high as 61 percent. It has been found that consumption of kassippu goes up when we increase the duty on liquor. We cannot forcibly reduce liquor consumption. Instead, what we can do is to give more relief to types that have less impact on health, he told parliament. What the minister meant was to offer relief to distillers who manufacture their product under a strict standardization, unlike in the case of rotgut. In other words, the villain of the piece here is the much cheaper kassippu, which is the preferred brew of labourers and the toiling masses. Some weeks ago Labour Relations Minister John Seneviratne too spoke in favour of reducing the price of certain brands of arrack such as the popular Gal'. He was of the view that this particular brand was now out of reach of the common man following the serial increase in the price of hard liquor recently with the slapping of VAT. One recalls Prof. G. L. Peiris, onetime Cabinet colleague of Minister Samaraweera, expressing similar sentiments in favour of reducing the price of soft liquor in order to wean away those addicted to hard liquor, arguing that this would in no way affect the excise revenue to the government given the increased numbers who will switch their preferences .It is moot though if those bent on hard liquor (as opposed to kassippu) could be persuaded to go for beer or wine, especially those engaged in the hare grind, who would naturally prefer a kick from their liquor.
Be that as it may, any proposal to reduce the price or liquor (hard or soft) is bound make our imbibers drink a toast to the health of the Minister Samaraweera who is known right along for his daring and the unconventional moves though this particular suggestion may not endear him to the wives and, more importantly, clergy of all faiths, particularly the Mahanayaka's whom the Minister met only days after making his recommendation. Nor will they view his proposal to have liquor shops opened on Poya days with the logic that the minister holds onto ie. in any event liquor is consumed on Poya days, even more so than the other days, after having stockpiled ahead. The Minister's claim that liquor shop owners, restaurant keepers et al. sell liquor on the sly for double the price on Poya days, and other days the liquor outlets are forced to close under the law, is only all too well known. As the Minister contended, the fact that Thailand, which is predominantly a Buddhist country, closes it's liquor shops only on election day is enlightening indeed. What is more, as the Minister said, closing liquor outlets on Christmas day which is associated with jollity and merrymaking will be viewed by many Christians as a paradox indeed.
Hence, the Minister has called for a reappraisal of outdated laws and practices governing these restrictions. Most of these restraints and taboos surrounding the subject of liquor are no doubt rooted in ignorance and hypocrisy. The fate that befell mathata titha of the ardent Buddhist Mahinda Rajapaksa is all too well known. The number of liquor permits issued and the mushrooming of wine stores in every corner of the country after the mathata titha campaign was launched had the public coin the hilarious term tithata matha (loosely read, liquor flowing).
The hard fact is, it is difficult to wean away the hard drinker from the habit, try as the authorities might with their various temperance campaigns and religious preachings. What is therefore prudent is finding ways to rid the hard drinker from the highly injurious moonshine and making him go for a standard drink produced under professional supervision.
As the minister said, bringing down the license fees and other levies imposed on liquor manufacturers would invariably bring down the prices of standard liquor that would not pose grave health hazards to the habitual drinker.

Damaging properties
It is our duty to safeguard our national assets (public or private). People should realize that replacement, repairs etc are borne by the Tax Payers' money which could be used for development.
Mentioned below are some noteworthy incidents:
a) In the case of protest marches vehicles are damaged  buildings are stoned.
b) In the case of strikes, buildings, motor vehicles are set on fire, stoned etc.
c) When an accident occurs, crowd burns the vehicle and manhandles the driver too.
This is in addition to revenue losses occur due to strike. Severe penalties should be imposed when public properties are damaged. Organisations should be warned on time that they have to bear the losses. Sometime back in Singapore, there was a protest organised by immigrant workers and public properties were damaged. Singapore Government did not hesitate in expelling most of them out of the country, others were warned and made to pay penalty.
An American youth was given proper lashes for damaging cars with paint, despite an appeal made by the American President for pardoning. A Singapore lady proudly said on the TV when you are in Singapore you are bound by Singapore rules. No exemptions are granted.
This is the attitude we have to develop in preventing capital and revenue losses on a large scale.
We have to stimulate National feeling and love for development.

COPA commences real time evaluation
The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has commenced real time evaluation of the performances of public institutions enabling the Committee to question and hold the relevant officials accountable on financial malpractices occurring in them.
The COPA has already commenced evaluating the audit reports of 2016. It will soon present to Parliament a report relating to 857 public institutions coming under its purview based on 2015 Audit Reports. After 1972, it is for the first time that the COPA is presenting real time reports to the House, Information Systems and Management Director of Parliament Mahesh Perera said.
Previously, the COPA was dealing with old records as it waited years and years until the annual reports come out. In some cases the annual reports were delayed upto 15 years. By questioning on old records, you can hardly expect the Committee to make any change as many responsible officials may have retired or moved to other institutions by then, he pointed out.
He pointed out real time evaluation has enabled the Committee to monitor whether its recommendations are being implemented or not, adding that this has helped to enhance the productivity and efficiency of public institutions.
The real time evaluation is being done using an Intranet Portal to which all Parliamentarians and Parliamentary Staff have access to from wherever they are in. This portal has been connected to the official Parliament website and the public can direct their observations, complaints and proposals with regard to each of the institutions being summoned before the Committee. All Ministries, Departments, Provincial Councils, Local Authorities, District Secretariats and Divisional Secretariats are coming under the scope of COPA.

Blue-chip JKH also contributed to ~19% of total crossings for the week helping drive the weeks average turnover levels to an 8-week high of LKR 1.1Bn. Despite the positive momentum generated by HNI/Institutional and foreign investors though, Retail investors remained on the sidelines yet again, and Equity markets moved sideways over the week to consolidate at the key 6700 mark as Index losses (~51 points) at the start and end of the week were partially offset by mid-week gains (~47 points).
Markets meanwhile, failed to be moved by the CBSLs monetary policy decision to hold policy rates steady, gaining a marginal 0.6 points on Friday amid the largely anticipated move by the monetary authority.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to gain some traction although some profit taking is also likely to continue.
CBSL holds policyrates steady
The CBSL maintained policy rates (Repo: 7.25%, Reverse Repo: 8.75%) at its latest policy meeting on Friday, citing an anticipated recovery in H217 GDP growth and inflation levels at mid-single digits.
The policy move is the first since the Monetary Authoritys decision in March of this year to increase rates by 25 bps. The CBSL added that although the Sri Lankan economy slowed in Q117, a rebound in economic activity is likely in H217 as the impact from adverse weather conditions ease.
CBSL added that inflation is expected to further moderate and range at mid-single digit levels by the end-2017, as the impact from VAT revisions and weather-related supply disruptions wane.
The CBSL added that private credit growth is expected to slow amid the prevailing high lending rates, and that the improvement in Gross Official Reserves to LKR 7.0Bn (with the issuance of International Sovereign Bond of LKR 1.5Bn) and moderate depreciation in the LKR (2.3% Y-T-D) also justifies its decision to hold rates steady.

Doctors launched a strike just to obtain a statement from the President; it is very unfair, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. He said so addressing the gathering during a ceremony held at Bulathsinghela recently.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, President Maithripala Sirisena had presented the same set of proposals which was formulated by the government and given publicity through newspaper advertisements in order to educate the public.
The minister pointed out that the doctors should have been asked to release the statement without taking trade union action, putting patients in trouble. The set of proposals will be gazetted after get the Cabinet approval on June 27.
If the doctors encourage university students to take arms, they are not doctors or scholars, the Minister added.

Economy to recover  during second half - CB

Targets inflation of 6% by end 2017

With due consideration to the prevailing and evolving domestic and international macroeconomic environment, the Monetary Board, at its meeting held on June 22, 2017 was of the view that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and decided to maintain the policy interest rates of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka at their present levels.
The decision of the Monetary Board is consistent with the objective of maintaining inflation at mid-single digit levels over the medium term and thereby facilitating a sustainable growth trajectory. The rationale underpinning the monetary policy stance is set out below.
According to the provisional estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the Sri Lankan economy has grown by 3.8 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2017. Growth in the first quarter was weighed down by the impact of unfavorable weather conditions, particularly on agriculture related activities.
The performance of industry related activities was largely driven by the continued expansion in construction, while services related activities recorded a moderate growth.
The economy is expected to recover during the second half of the year.
Following the increasing trend in the first quarter of 2017, year-on-year headline inflation, based on both Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) and National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), moderated during the months of April and May, as envisaged. Core inflation has also displayed a similar trend.
As the impact of the revisions to the tax structure and weather-related supply disruptions is expected to dissipate in the period ahead, inflation is projected to moderate to mid-single digits by the end of 2017 and stabilise thereafter.
Monetary expansion remained at elevated levels by end April 2017, driven by the expansion in domestic credit channeled to both the public and private sectors from the banking system. The growth of credit to the private sector continued to decelerate gradually. A further deceleration in the growth of credit to the private sector is anticipated, given the prevailing high nominal and real lending rates in the market.
The recent expansion in credit obtained by state owned business enterprises (SOBEs) poses a risk to the behavior of overall domestic credit, reflecting the need to address concerns in relation to the financial performance of key SOBEs.
Meanwhile, a decline in net credit obtained by the government (NCG) was observed in the month of April 2017. The continuation of the governments revenue based fiscal consolidation process and inflows to the government on account of foreign borrowings appear to have reduced the pressure on interest rates in the government securities market substantially.
Despite improved export performance in March and April 2017, a sustained increase in import expenditure resulted in a wider cumulative trade deficit.
Tourism related foreign exchange inflows grew on a cumulative basis, and the decline in tourist arrivals observed in the month of May 2017 is expected to be temporary. Workers remittances recorded a slowdown in the first four months of the year, and any further escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could adversely affect such inflows in the period ahead.
A net foreign inflow was observed in the government securities market since March 2017, while inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) also displayed a positive trend. The Central Bank continued to absorb foreign exchange from the domestic market since March 2017 to build up international reserves.
In line with these developments and the successful issuance of the International Sovereign Bond as well as the receipt of syndicated loan proceeds by the government, gross official reserves improved to above US dollars 7 billion by mid-June 2017.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated against the US dollar by 2.3 per cent during 2017 up to June 21.
Against this backdrop, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent, respectively.

## Title: Education and the economy

Education and the economy
Education was taken over by the state by privatization of schools in the name of free education, a political decision considered a good move to make free education available to all citizens.
A grievous mistake was made by making the medium of education Sinhala only. Dropping English converted the country in to a Third World within a few years. The country is still struggling to get over the backlash.
We as Ceylon were economically ahead of all countries in Asia other than Japan at that time. Our neighbor India continued English education and now they have overtaken Sri Lanka in IT and many other fields. Our English in the past was better than English-speaking countries. We have now gone to the extent of suggesting importing teachers of English from India.
Some time ago we had a programme funded by England and Australia to teach teachers to teach English when current Prime Minister was Minister of Education.
After the mistake was realized, the same Government that took over private schools was compelled to allow private schools, with the restriction being placed that GCE examinations be conducted as London General Certification of Education with subjects taught in English.
Many private schools in the English medium sprang up all over the country. Some with high quality, some below quality but students sat a common London GCE. No private schools in Sinhala Medium were established. Parents and investors realized the value of English education. All these schools educated students to sit for London GCE examinations.
GCE standards are set by the University of London International Examinations Department. The GCE Sri Lanka Standard is set by the Department of Examinations.
Private schools as well as state schools are gradually starting classes for Sri Lanka GCE English medium. The obstacles are the lack of teachers who are able to teach in English as they have been educated in Sinhala.
This is one country where state education is considered superior to private education as the demand to enter state schools and state universities is far greater than available capacity. For the good fortune of the students of the country private schools as well as degree-awarding private colleges affiliated to numerous colleges and universities overseas were allowed to be operated in the country.
Yet approximately 3,000-4,000 students of affluent parents leave the country each year for higher education to overseas universities of G7 countries and some to less developed countries who offer recognized degrees affiliated to G7 universities in high-profile professions.
Very few of these students come back to Sri Lanka. A brain drain of affluent students encouraged by governments in power since 1960.
Now we come to the debate of private medical education. Should state be the only educator of medicine in Sri Lanka Then all doctors who have obtained their medical degrees oversees, should be disqualified from practising in Sri Lanka although they have passed the Eligibility Requirement to Practice medicine (ERPM) Examination conducted by Government of Sri Lanka as the degree has not been awarded by Government of Sri Lanka Medical Colleges. Approximately 1,000 foreign-qualified graduates from universities outside of Sri Lanka sit ERPM conducted by the Government. The pass rate is 25  30%. The quality of these foreign universities is so poor although Government has recognized these universities as suitable for medical degrees. There are many who call themselves doctors in business and other professions as they could not pass ERPM.
The Kotalawala Defence Academy Medical Faculty, although fee-levying, does not fall in to a private degree-awarding medical college as it is owned by the state and the number of students are 25 to 30 per batch. This gives them better opportunity to interact with the faculty.
A quick fix for the current crisis at the Malabe Private Medical College as well as medical colleges to be set up in future would be for medical students of all faculties to sit for the same examination conducted by state medical colleges as done for Sri Lanka GCE OL/AL examinations.
Immediate action needs to be taken to adjust curriculum of the Malabe Medical Faculty to be compatible to the Defence Academy Medical College as the teaching faculty of both colleges are retired state university practitioners and lecturers.
A cut-off mark could be set by Government for entrance to private colleges as for state colleges according to number of seats available in private medical colleges to ensure that students with high marks follow the degree.
As per GMOA and students unions, they object to medical degrees being awarded by Malabe Medical College stating that the degree is not in par with standards. Has GMOA or students unions specified the standards or offered a solution other than objecting to the functioning of the private medical college
Once the standard is specified by Government, all doctors in practice who do not meet this standard must be compelled to meet the specified standard or resign from service. As per GMOA and students unions, we cannot have two standards and rules in the same playing field. By this method a common MBBS degree can be awarded by Malabe/Kotalawala and any other private medical colleges to be set up in future.
Another big question is, does Sri Lanka need this many doctors
Approximately 1,200 doctors pass out of the medical system each year. If the per capita doctor/population ratio is studied, Sri Lanka compares well with the developed world but doctors are not available in the required rural areas.
Most of the MBBS doctors have not obtained postgraduate qualifications and specialized. Those who have specialized try to concentrate on the cities where private practice is thriving and educational facilities for their children are available. The poor farmer or those living in rural areas do not have a doctor for many, many kilometres or as per the population ratio.
It must be made mandatory for a doctor qualifying from a rural area to serve the said area for a minimum of five years before being eligible to serve in another area. There should be a good appointment and transfer scheme to ensure doctors serve at least 10 years in rural areas. Government must ensure the facilities in rural hospitals be improved and family accommodation provided in all rural hospitals for doctors and secondary staff.
The wise move would be to improve the facilities of the existing medical colleges. Colombo Medical College was ranked amongst the world's best up to about 1970.
Research Facilities should be set up in medical facilities. We have many diseases endemic to Sri Lanka. Research could be done to find solutions for these. The media says we are to import anti-dengue products from Australia.
At the rate Sri Lanka is producing doctors, there will not be capacity to offer internships in government hospitals. There will not be vacancies in the Government medical service to offer jobs for doctors. In the near future, we will have unemployed doctors protesting on streets asking for jobs in state service. If protests versus loss to the economy is calculated, the government could have improved the health services tenfold. Eventually it is the people who suffer, not Malabe Medical College, GMOA or the Student Union. Students who boycott lectures and their parents need to realize that it is they that suffer the loss and not those who incite boycotts and protests.
If a serious calculation is done on loss to state, public life, disruption of services to the public, damage to property will run to billions. Can this loss to the economy be recovered from those who encourage disruption of services, incite work stoppage and damage to property
Ninety-nine percent of the population pay for the loss caused by less than 1% of the population. Our Judicial system is so slow, it will be another burden on the public.
Those who are against private medical education will have to give serious thoughts with respect to loss to the economy.

Ekroma supports evolving trends of condominium living
One of the acclaimed realtors introducing the concept of boutique apartments to condominium living in Sri Lanka is Ekroma Realtors (Pvt) Ltd who will be adding to the skyline of Colombo City with their latest project Elegant 16.
The pioneers of boutique apartments in the country with their debut project, Ekroma takes great pride in the design and construction of Elegant 16.
The concept of boutique apartments revolves around the idea of offering maximum luxury within a minimal space in an urban location and the latest project from the contemporary realtors embodies the concept well.
Elegant 16 is located in the heart of Colombo 5which is gradually transforming into a commercial hub yet it offers conditions for luxurious, safe and tranquil living.
Since the apartments are constructed in accordance with the boutique concept, the complex will only house 16 units. However, unlike most apartment complexes housing a smaller number of units that lack in terms of amenities that larger complexes offer, Elegant16 hopes to go against the grain and provide homeowners with facilities such as a swimming pool, gym, childrens play area, rooftop jogging track, BBQ area and more.
At Elegant 16, we take pride in perfecting everythingt o provide a high end finished product said Managing Director of Ekroma Realtors Onesh Subasinghe.
Each and every aspect of the apartments from the pantry cupboards to the gas detectors, the sanitaryware and the tiles for the flooring will firmly meet and exceed the customers needs and expectations, he added.
Ekroma Realtors future plans include a number of different projects in the pipeline leading up to the year 2022 as they hope to be a long-term player in the industry. Some of their future projects will include a commercial tower, a super-luxurious apartment complex that caters to a more affluent clientele and many more.
We are not looking for just investors. We want the end user who will be the homeowner of our units. What differentiates us from the rest of the players in the market is that we are not just another apartment complex with an extensive amount of units because we hope to build a small community that grows with us, Subasinghe also said.

Embilipitiya paper factory to be revived
The Embilipitiya paper factory, believed to be the largest paper factory in Asia, set up at Kandurugasara in 1975, is today, in total neglect. Its machinery is rusting and its buildings are overtaken by jungle, following its decline set in motion in 2002.
Today, an organisation calling itself the old friends of the paper factory, have teamed up under the patronage of Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha thera to revive and inject new blood to the factory which provided permanent employment to 2,600 and 2,000 casual employees.
Part of the 700-acre premises of the factory was occupied by unauthorised people and parts of machinery, doors and windows of the factory were removed by vandals.
Members of the new organisation are led by Ven. Vijeriye Sumana Thera and the factorys Founder Manager Asoka Subasinghe. Former General Manager and Factory Manager M.A. Justin and Provincial Council member S.V.P. Ananda, who was a former factory employee, held an inaugural meeting at the Leisure Park reception hall at the Sri Lanka Army Camp Engineering School to map out their strategy.
Asoke Subasinghe said, he is shocked over the unfortunate fate of the factory which he left in 1978. He was prepared to assist any endeavour made towards reviving and rehabilitating this factory.
M.A. Justin said, they should make a genuine effort to revive the factory without blaming anyone about past mistakes. He said, the factory could be re-established by even obtaining a foreign loan. Since people were being weaned away from the habit of using polythene, the revived factory could be utilized to produce the countrys total requirement of paper bags.

Exciting new Sri Lankan music video launched
The explorer's impulse to travel and zest for new experiences and adventure have been perfectly captured in a vibrant new music video produced and launched in Sri Lanka with sponsorship support from CEAT, a popular tyre brand.
Aptly titled 'Never stop moving' the video produced and directed by the award-winning Sri Lankan music director, playback singer and a video director Sachith Peiris features American pop and classical vocalist Casey Breves who recently sang with Adele at Radio City Music Hall.
The video's intensely stirring lyrics - the work of the prolific Sri Lankan rapper, singer and songwriter Ashanthi De Alwis - and powerful and evocative imagery of Sri Lankan places and pastimes combine in a pulsating audio visual jambalaya that is expected to take social media by storm.
A 2'43'' kaleidoscopic showcase of Sri Lanka with stimulating references to blazing trails, unleashing wings, embracing the power and flying through the air, the video is all about the journey and the importance of never stopping.
Speaking at the music video's launch in Colombo, Mr Bishri Latiff, Deputy General Manager - Marketing of sponsor CEAT Kelani Holdings said the company found the producer's effort to portray Sri Lanka's potential as a cornucopia of attractive locations and exciting experiences appealing and worthy of support. "As a maker of tyres, CEAT's principal role is to help people get to places, and the title and theme of the music video was so aligned to what we are about, that we did not need convincing to support its production," he said.
'Never stop moving' is the second music video sponsored by CEAT. The first, 'Miringuwa Parada' (conquering the mirage), by the Germany-based Sri Lankan musician Chitral Somapala was a phenomenal success when it was launched in 2013.
Sachith Peiris, the Producer and Director of 'Never stop moving' said in a press release that he hopes the exciting imagery created by Director of Photography Chamath Hansaka and the skills of Production Coordinator Yashinka Silva would resonate with audiences around the world and generate wider interest in what Sri Lanka has to offer its people as well as visitors, while providing music video enthusiasts with great entertainment.
'Never stop moving' can be viewed on YouTube, Facebook and Google and is also expected to be telecast by local channels shortly. The vocalist Casey Breves performs across the United States, Europe, and Asia. He sang with the Grammy award-winning male vocal ensemble 'Chanticleer' from 2010 to 2013 and has recently been recording originals and pop covers and releasing videos on YouTube.

Federer thrashes Zverev to win ninth Halle title
Halle Westfalen: Swiss great Roger Federer thrashed Alexander Zverev to win his ninth title at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in Halle on Sunday.
The top seed lost his first match of the grass-court season last week in Stuttgart to Tommy Haas, but was in imperious form all week at Halle, culminating in the 6-1, 6-3 final victory over the home favourite Zverev.
Federer will head into Wimbledon, which starts on July 3, as favourite to win an outright record eighth title.
Italian Open champion Zverev had won all three of his previous finals this season, but was blown away by a vintage performance from the 18-time major champion in only 53 minutes.
I played great, I felt good from the start, said Federer.
It was by far my best match of the week. After my long break, Im feeling excellent and its a pleasure to be back and Im fit for Wimbledon.
The 35-year-old, who skipped the entire clay-court season, has still only lost two matches this year en route to four titles, including the Australian Open in January.
My goal was to keep myself 100 percent for the grass season, he added.
I now hope that Ill stay healthy in this second part of the season and well see what happens.
Federer raced out of the blocks and broke serve twice to reel off the first four games of the match.
The home crowd tried their best to get behind the world number 12 Zverev, and even though he got on the board in game five, Federer broke again to wrap up the opening set in just 23 minutes. Zverev, 20, battled hard to stay with his illustrious opponent at the start of the second set, but failed to make any inroads into the Federer serve.
The 18-time major champion was in irresistible form and he brought up two break points after a scintillating rally.
A trademark forehand passing shot and a comfortable service game moved Federer to within a game of victory. AFP

Grapes prevent tooth decay
Eating grapes can protect your teeth from decaying as a recent study suggests a natural compound found in grapes can strengthen teeth and boost the strength of fillings.
Scientists from the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry say this discovery could stop people from losing teeth as the grape seed extract - a byproduct of the wine making industry which can be purchased from health food shops - has long been linked to health benefits such as improved heart function and better circulation.
Now the substance could reduce tooth extractions by increasing the longevity of composite-resin fillings - or tooth-coloured fillings - which typically last only five to seven years. The results suggested that the extract has been found to toughen dentin, the tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth, which lies beneath the hard external enamel, reports the Mail Online. This means that when teeth are damaged, the remaining structure can be made stronger to bond with materials used in fillings.
It could spell good news for patients who opt for resin fillings because they are more aesthetically pleasing, even though they are not as tough amalgam fillings, which last 10 to 15 years or more.
A researcher Dr Ana Bedran-Russo said that when fillings fail, decay forms around it and the seal is lost. The team wants to reinforce the interface, which will make the resin bond better to the dentin.
Tooth decay can occur when acid is produced from plaque, which builds up on your teeth.If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.
The cavity begins to eat away at the second level of tooth material that lies beneath the enamel: the dentin.
Interlocking the resin and collagen-rich dentin provides better adhesion and does not rely on moisture, the researchers stated.The study appeared in the journal of Dental Research. ANI

Growing Roses in Containers
Growing roses in containers is a lot like growing them in your garden bed. The same keys to healthy roses apply: sun, great soil, fertilization, ample air circulation and consistent watering.
Selecting Roses
Choose varieties that are more compact and disease resistant
Climbing roses and large shrub roses are better suited for the garden bed unless you have room for very large planters and trellises
Why grow roses in containers
Container grown roses are an easy addition to a patio or deck
When placed on casters, containers are easy to move roses in containers.
Ease of Access
Place container roses by a door or open window to enjoy their fragrance
Eliminates the need to bend and stoop in the garden to deadhead spent blooms, remove diseased foliage and keep the soil clear of debris
Watering and Feeding
Growing roses in containers does require a bit more diligence when it comes to watering and fertilizing.
Containers dry out more quickly than garden beds
The smaller the container the more quickly the soil will become dry
Water container roses at last once a day (early morning and evening hours are best)
When the soil is dry just under the surface, your roses need more watering
The extra watering container roses require leaches nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in a garden. Container grown roses may need feeding every two weeks or weekly with a diluted solution of fertilizer.
Re-potting
As the roses grow, increase the size of the container, or simply cut back the plant and its roots to maintain a smaller size
Refresh potting soil every few years
Winter Protection
Where frost and freezing temperatures occur, protect container grown roses in the garden shed or basement
If garden space allows, plant the roses, container and all, in the garden and top dress with mulch

Heavy happiness
Kapka Kassabova was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1973, and emigrated with her family to New Zealand after the fall of the Berlin Wall; she now lives in Scotland. Her childhood summers were spent on the red Riviera, the southern beaches of Bulgaria on the Black Sea, where every second barman was in the service of the Bulgarian State Security and Stasi agents disguised themselves as holidaymakers to spy on East Germans. At night, people would attempt to cross the border, on foot or by water, into Turkey, and many paid with their lives. The forest was full of soldiers, and warning signs posted in two languages. Once near a border, she says, it is impossible not to be involved, not to want to exorcise or transgress something. Just by being there, the border is an invitation. Kassabova is drawn back thirty years later to a crossroads where the hard borders (between Bulgaria and Greece, now EU member states) have become soft, and soft borders (between Greece and Turkey) have been hardened by Europes attempt to control an influx of peoples displaced by recent wars. It is this attraction to the forbidden places of her youth that drives her riveting, beautifully written account of travels in Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, Border: A journey to the edge of Europe.
For Kassabova, the past, and childhood especially, really is a foreign country. Doubly so, of course, for an migre who grew up under another political system. The Berlin Wall continues to divide the eras of her life. But it is this sort of dissonance that can make for a good writer, someone always on the outside, always observing. Kassabova, a poet and novelist as well as an essayist, is ideally placed to take us on a journey to a corner of Europe that even today seems exotic and little known, the shifting zone between East and West, North and South, Europe and not-Europe, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Christianity and Islam, Balkan and Mediterranean  a region overlapping with the vague ancient expanse known as Thrace. Thrace, as Kassabova points out, was where Orpheus was torn to pieces by raving Maenads, his singing head floating down the River Hebrus (Evros).
Treasure-hunters
Kassabovas travels form a circle, taking her from the Black Sea summer resort of her childhood to the mountain range of Strandja and on through the plains of Thrace, the Rhodope range and Greece, and then back to Strandja. In this region nearly everyone is at only one or two generational removes from exile and displacement, scattered among three alphabets and several nations; and along the way Kassabova meets treasure-hunters, refugees, retired spies, smugglers, hunters, botanists, healers, artists, Gypsies (Roma), forest rangers and border guards. She brings to her account a deep understanding of the regions Byzantine (literally and figuratively) and Ottoman history, wearing her learning lightly.
The Balkan peoples are perhaps not renowned for a sense of humour, though a fatalistic sense of the absurd is endemic. Kassabova, though, is funny; her wry wit leavens the narrative and keeps it from collapsing under the weight of cumulative tragedy. It is hard to identify one strand of this story as the kookiest, but the Uzbek-bred vipers are hard to beat, she writes at one point. Back in the house, Ziko and Nikos were in the late stages of lachrymose male bonding, she writes at another. An affectless waitress always plonks down food for customers with the grim exhortation Enjoy; a kleptocrats villa is categorized as gangster-baroque. And Kassabova has a novelists flair for character sketch; there is, for example, the lost-looking Dutchman out of a Graham Greene novel who seemed to drift towards the East, dressed in light linens.
Kassabova begins in Strandja, the last mountain range of south-east Europe, whose forest, having escaped the Ice Age, preserves a veritable open-air museum of relic species from the Tertiary age. She settles in a place she calls simply the Village in the Valley, a beautiful but underinhabited place.
Arbitrarily uprooted
The village is dying; there is no work, few visitors and no children, though the mayor has aspirationally constructed a school. The village had been Greek before the Balkan Wars (191213); in the euphemistic exchange of populations, the resident Greeks had been moved to the villages around Thessalonki, and the vacated village resettled by Bulgarian refugees from Turkey. Again and again in her travels, Kassabova encounters peoples who have been arbitrarily uprooted and moved to an empty house in a foreign country with the kitchen pots still warm. (Besides the population exchanges of the Balkan wars, Kassabova mentions a more recent but perhaps lesser-known incident, the expulsion of 340,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria in 1989.) It emerges here that empires, despite their problems, are in some ways the lesser of two evils, mixers of ethnicities, languages and faiths; nation states, by contrast, have been catastrophic centrifuges, unmixers of peoples, particularly in the Balkans. Kassabova describes, among other colourful episodes, witnessing Greek and Bulgarian fire walkers (in an ecstatic rite involving walking over live coals), and placing herself in the hands of smugglers on the Road to Freedom, crossing into Greece on foot without a passport. She also relates a bizarre legend-cumconspiracy-theory straight out of an Indiana Jones movie, involving a secret ancient Egyptian pyramid, radiation, Nazis, Soviets, a clairvoyant and the Bulgarian Minister of Culture. Poetic interludes define words from different languages or tell short allegories: agiasma is Greek for curative spring; klyon, the nickname Bulgarian border soldiers gave the razor-wire fence; zmey, In Slavic folk mythology, a shape-shifting dragon that embodies protection and possession; chesma, Turkish for a road-side public fountain; uroki, Bulgarian for the evil eye. The vocabulary of food and drink bridges cultures. Turks are amused when Kassabova calls parsley maydanoz because its one of those Turkish food words that have seeped into Balkan mouths permanently. The words for food cant be ethnically purged. (In Greek it is Madanos, possibly a corruption of a word meaning Macedonian.)
The West tends to view Greece as relatively poor, and politically insignificant except for its nuisance value. It is easy to forget that within the region, Greece is relatively prosperous, with a GDP of more than all of her Northern neighbours  Albania, Bulgaria and the (once Yugoslav) Republic of Macedonia  combined. Greece also has a cultural prestige that is the envy of the area.

I am no communalist : Wigneswaran
Q: The attention of the whole country was drawn towards the Northern Provincial Council during the past few weeks. This situation which cropped up after the report of the anti-corruption committee appointed by you was released had created a suspicion that the problem had not reached a permanent solution. What has actually happened there
A: Members of our PC had levelled several allegations against ministers of the Provincial Council for a long time. When these allegations were made, we thought of conducting an investigation into them and appointed a commission. The commission submitted its report to us several days ago. The report stated that two PC ministers had committed wrong. Since the person who had made allegations against the other two persons had gone abroad, it had not been investigated. When the report came to my hands, I took action and asked the two persons who had allegations against them to resign. Since investigations were not conducted on the other two, as the complainant had gone, I asked the two of them to take a month's leave.
Q: Haven't you done an injustice to the two persons against whom investigations had not been done
A: Since the complaint did not return, the term of office of the commission expired. But there was a sand that an investigation had to be made. Similarly, more allegations had poured in from people. I thought this was a problem concerning limitation of days. After an investigation was made against the new allegations and the ministers, if they were found not gently, they could resume work.
Q: The TNA is a collective of several parties. How did the leaders of those parties respond to the sacking of the ministers
A: Sampanthan and Senathiraja told me that my action was wrong. I told them that there was nothing wrong. Because if the ministers were present during the recording of evidence, the witnesses would be afraid to give evidence. I had to do that because I had to prevent direct or indirect pressure being exerted on the witnesses. If that was not in order, I asked them to give me a written undertaking that no pressure or influence will be exerted on the witnesses. I told them to make observations while we set about our work, but they did not agree to that as well. I said, if Sampanthan gave such an undertaking, I would accept it. But they were not willing to give such an undertaking. The problem was that if I a allowed them, it would have driven fear into the minds of witnesses.
Q: On what basis did you appoint a three-member commission to conduct investigations
A: The allegations were made by our own Provincial Council members; if I myself tried to probe them, I would not have been able to do other business of the council. That is why I appointed two retired High Court Judges and a retired public servant as members of the committee.
Q: Did the report of that committee say that they were corrupt
A: There was some change. Although the allegation was financial misappropriation, such a thing had not happened. What has happened was while holding office, they spent excess funds on the meetings. There had been no financial corruption.
Q: According to our reports, about an year ago, there had been a request for you to remove these four ministers. But didn't you keep silent then
A: Yes, this happened about an year ago. Sixteen members submitted a signed letter requesting their removal. I didn't take action against them because there were no allegations against them at that time. It was just a request to remove the four of them and appoint new ministers. When allegations were levelled, I asked them whether they still insisted on their request; twelve out of this 16 members still persisted with the request and the balance four said there was no need to remove them and requested that they be allowed to carry on.
Q: Were those who made allegations against them denied the facilities offered by the Provincial Council
A: At first, the two ministers asked to resign were requested to return all facilities, but later, I decided that it should not be done and further investigations should be made. I thought of a means to give a less harsher punishment. To the other two, I told them only to stop visiting office for a month until investigations were completed. They are still drawing their salary and using the official vehicles.
Q:You are the chief minister of the four ministers of the NPC. They are alleged to have done wrong under your period of office. Doesn't this rebound on you
A: I have told earlier that if there were allegations against me, they too, should be submitted along with this because I am prepared to face them. I still say that if there were allegations against me, an independent investigation should be made into them and I am prepared to face it.
Q: You became chief minister by joining hands with the TNA. But according to the current happenings, there seems to be a clash between you and the TNA.
A: No. There is no such thing. But they are suspecting that I have connections with another organisation named Tamil Makkal Peravai. They think that I am going against the TNA by joining hands with it, but there is no such thing. We have an election manifesto, but I see them going against it. I am against such a thing, but I am not against the party. I am not opposing the leadership. What I say is that there is duplicity on their part. They say one thing here and another different thing in Colombo. This is the problem and nothing else.
Q: Didn't the Tamil Makkal Peravei organisation organise the Elangu Tamil meeting sometime ago What sort of organisation is it
A: It is not a political party as most people thought. It is only a people's organisation.
Q: This is a time when the TNA had joined hands with southern political parties to put forward a new constitution to the country. At such a time, aren't your activities an obstruction to the southern unity
A: I will give you a clear answer. What they are talking about the people in the North and East is their constitution rights to be given to them. In such a situation, they should know the ideas and aspirations of our people; when our leaders in Colombo talk something different from the views of our people, we should speak out. Hopes and aspirations and views of the Tamil people are encapsulated in the TNA manifesto. When they stay in Colombo and do something different to the ideas and views of the people, my duty was to point it out. That is all what I am doing.
I can give you an easy example. Today, only the 13th amendment is left. If they refuse to give us a federal system, it is wrong. What we want is a federal system. It meant that we would be looking after our own affairs and both parties would be living happily in a single country. But in the 13th amendment, the Central Government had retained all rights. They have given us what they pleased. There is a difference between the two and that is what I am pointing out. Although I am doing this, I have no clash with the leadership. I have no problem if actions are in-keeping with the policies.
Q: But the TNA had come to the conclusion that as regards the national problem, it was useless to cling on to mere wordings.
A: That is correct. But we must see what decision is given by these people in Court. If it is known in the decision that it is not the federal system and the unitary status is still protected in the country, they may not give us that right. This should be changed. We say that it should be changed and we should go for a federal system. It could be worded in a different manner, but the idea should be there.
Q: There is much talk about a coterie of people engaged in spreading communalism in the country. Many people refer to you as a communalist trying to set the country on fire.
A: What can I do when they brand me like that I have only two children who have married Sinhalese. I too, was born and bred in Colombo for the most part of my life. How on earth could I become a communalist then What do I gain from it This is only senseless talk.

India too strong for England in Womens World Cup opener
LONDON, Saturday  India beat hosts England by 35 runs on the opening day of the 2017 Women's World Cup at Derby on Saturday.
India piled up an imposing 281 for three in their 50 overs thanks to fifties from Smriti Mandhana (90) and Punam Raut (86), who put on 144 for the first wicket, as well as 71 from skipper Mithali Raj.
Only reigning world champions Australia had previously made a success of chasing a bigger target in a women's one-day international. England just about kept themselves in the hunt and were still in with a chance thanks to Fran Wilson's maiden fifty at 229 for six in the 44th over.
But her departure for 81 -- one of four run-outs in the innings -- left the lower order of England, now a team of full-time professionals, with too much to do.
Three-times champions England, who've won the previous two World Cups staged in their own country, were eventually bowled out for 246. It was a brilliant opening partnership between Smriti and Punam, said the assured Raj, who was seen reading a book before she came into bat wearing a floppy hat rather than the now ubiquitous helmet.
After I batted, I realised that the wicket didn't have much assistance for the bowlers, and that the spinners, in particular, will have to bowl in the right areas.
England captain Heather Knight, who opted to field first after winning the toss, added: I thought the wicket would do a bit more, but to be honest, we didn't put the ball in the right areas.
We bowled too short and let them get away. We backed ourselves to chase it down but lost wickets and struggled.
India took the game away from us with the bat. It was an exciting match but I'm really disappointed to end up on the losing side. Scores: India 281-3, 50 overs (S Mandhana 90, P Raut 86, M Raj 71)
England 246, 47.3 overs (F Wilson 81; D Sharma 3-47) - AFP
