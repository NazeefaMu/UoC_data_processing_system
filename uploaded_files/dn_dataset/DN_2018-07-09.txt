The team to beat - are Belgium now favourites for the World Cup
Belgium showed a little bit of everything a World Cup-winning team need in the 2-1 quarter-final victory over Brazil - so are they now favourites for the tournament
Roberto Martinez's Red Devils were phenomenal in the first half, leading 2-0 and threatening to blow Brazil away, before showing strength of character to hold on for the final 15 minutes after Renato Augusto's goal set up a tense finale.
This victory came just four days after they fought back from 2-0 down to beat Japan 3-2 in the last 16.
We have known for years they have the players, but questions have lingered over their mentality.
Many of those doubts now seem to have been answered, with Match of the Day pundit Rio Ferdinand saying they are the team to beat in Russia as they bid to win their first major tournament.
GOLDEN GENERATION ANSWERING CRITICS IN PERFECT WAY
Belgium were commanding from the outset, taking the lead when Fernandinho scored an own goal before Kevin de Bruyne added a fantastic second from 25 yards.
This result was huge, said Ferdinand. They seem like they have a few leaders. This team were questioned for their mentality and character coming into this tournament - they disappointed at the Euros two years ago.
This golden generation are answering their critics in the perfect way. The manner in which they dispatched Brazil, the way they started the game and bullied a very good team and then got over the line, shows they have got the bit between their teeth. They are the team to beat now.
Belgium will meet France in the first semi-final on Tuesday, while an all European final four will be made up of England and Croatia.
Jurgen Klinsmann, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990, was similarly impressed: It was a stunning performance. They hung in there and fought. You can see they have an amazing team spirit. They are very close - Roberto Martinez is doing an amazing job.
BBC 5 live summariser Pat Nevin added: Belgium have got every chance of winning it.
It helps when your players are on form. Eden Hazard was brilliant, as was De Bruyne, who you know always makes the right pass, and Romelu Lukaku was unplayable up to 60 minutes.
MANAGING EGOS: HOW MARTINEZ TURNED BELGIUM AROUND
Less than two years after being sacked as Everton boss, Spaniard Martinez will take Belgium into a World Cup semi-final with France - their first appearance in the last four since 1986.
They turned to him after going out in the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 - the latter to Wales - with a very real danger that this golden generation would fail to deliver a trophy.
Now, they are unbeaten in 24 games since a defeat by Martinez's homeland in his first game in charge.
Ferdinand said: That's being able to manage egos. Hazard, De Bruyne and Lukaku are all the main men at their clubs and they've had to be brought together. The manager has got them playing together and got them believing in a dream.
Ex-England captain Alan Shearer said: The big question about Belgium was are you a team of individuals or can you come together as a team And he's gelled them together. That's got to come from the manager. There's a huge difference between where they are now and where they were two years ago.
Klinsmann, who managed Germany at the 2006 World Cup, said: He formed this Belgium team in a way that they believe in it. They stick to the plan. He changed tactics, the players bought into it and it seems everyone is on the same page. They have good chemistry.
The quarter-final is the most important point of a World Cup - you either make it or break it.
Martinez made a big call at 2-0 down against Japan, bringing Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli off the bench - with both players scoring in the comeback.
Both kept their places in the team which beat Brazil as Belgium abandoned their wing-back formation, instead playing 4-3-3 with no main striker and Lukaku on the right.
Shearer said: The manager made big changes against Japan. He brought Fellaini on and he changed the game. He kept him tonight and he was magnificent, the way he and Axel Witsel supported that back four. All the decisions he made, like pushing De Bruyne further forward and changing the system, all worked.
Nevin said: Roberto Martinez will make many decisions in his managerial career but he won't make many better than today. We thought Belgium would struggle with a back three against Brazil, so he changed it. Credit to him for that.
You have got to do something special to stop this Brazilian side. It was a big call to bring Fellaini back, but he stuck to his job so the system was perfect.
Former Wigan manager Martinez said: Brazil have so much finesse and you know that they can cut you open. But I didn't think for one second that the players would give up.
They've done something special and I hope everyone in Belgium is very, very proud. It has created a nice memory and we should treasure it. But now we need more energy for our next game to try to make sure we're just as good in the semi-finals.
I'm the proudest man on earth because I gave the players a very tough tactical assignment and the way they believed until the last second was incredible.
It is special. We can't let them [fans] down back home now.
DID NEYMAR DIVE COST BRAZIL
Brazil striker Neymar's diving and exaggeration has made lots of headlines in the World Cup - and the BBC pundits think that might have cost his side a legitimate penalty.
The Paris St-Germain player went down easily after going past Fellaini - and was lucky to avoid a booking. Five minutes later, Vincent Kompany appeared to foul Gabriel Jesus but no penalty was awarded. The referee did not go to view the incident on a screen. BBC One co-commentator Danny Murphy said: I don't know how they can see what we have just seen and not give a penalty. That's a huge let-off for Belgium. Kompany got very lucky.
Shearer had a theory after the game: This [Neymar dive] is the reason I think they didn't get the call of the VAR five or 10 minutes later. If the guys are looking for any dodgy or iffy decisions, it's going to go against Brazil because of that.
That doesn't help his team because of that blatant dive and trying to cheat. I think they've been punished because of that.
Klinsmann said of the tackle on Jesus: It's a clear penalty. Do the VAR leverage the dive of Neymar What are they saying to the referee  BBC

Barbie feet is the new Instagram trend
Instagram is full of picture perfect people. Sometimes it can feel incredibly daunting posting your own snaps for your followers to see.But if youre keen to improve your photo game, theres a new trend you need to know about.
Or more specifically, a new pose. If you take a closer look at any celebrity Instagram account, you might have started to notice a certain similarity between their photos.
Thats because theyve all been doing something very specific with their feet.
Dubbed, Barbie feet by Who What Wear , the stylish pose has taken social media by storm. But the trick is so simple youll kick yourself for not thinking of it before.
Barbie feet involves balancing on the balls of your feet, as if wearing an invisible pair of high heels. The shape and position of the foot when doing the pose can be compared to that of a Barbie doll, whose feet are molded into a permanent point - hence the name.
People are opting to strike a pose in this way for one very obvious reason.
Its incredibly flattering Its no secret that heels are the most flattering form of footwear as they elongate the legs and make them appear slimmer.
So Instagram pros are opting to create the illusion of wearing heels to appear more photogenic in places where shoes just arent practical. Its especially favoured by stars posing in bikinis on the beach with bare feet.

Over 85% Lankan businesses are SME
SME is a key focus area for Nations Trust Bank as we recognize it as a sector that can really unleash the potential we have in the country. over 85% to 90% of businesses in Sri Lanka are SMEs which play a significant role in facilitating the countrys economic growth while also providing 70% of employment. said Bandara Jayathilake, Senior Executive Vice President of SME Banking at Nations Trust Bank.
Elaborating on the Small and Medium Enterprises Sector of Sri Lanka, Jayathilake said that the Bank over the past years is striving to become the ultimate banking partner that facilitates and mentors growing entrepreneurs in the country.
Any business with a turnover of less than Rs. 750 Million falls into the category of Small and Medium Enterprises. SME is a key focus area for Nations Trust Bank as we recognize it as a sector that can really unleash the potential we have in the country. SMEs play a significant role in facilitating the countrys economic growth while also providing 70% of employment. said Jayathileke.
Adding further, Bandara Jayathileke said, Many believe that the primary concern of SMEs is overcoming their financial inadequacies which is a misconception. SMEs manage to source their capital from self-savings or through aid from family and friends. However, the rate of failure for SMEs remain very high with 75% closing down within seven years.
This is simply due to the lack of market research, planning, due diligence and most importantly the inadequate guidance they have before starting a business.
Understanding this scenario, we have come forward to be a banking partner that can help SMEs thrive in their businesses by facilitating them financially and as well as proper mentorship and advocacy that will ultimately contribute to reduce the high fallout rate of SMEs in the country.
Commenting on how SMEs can increase their chances of success to retain themselves in the industry, he explained that, Fresh entrepreneurs should not just start a business without having educated themselves about the market, competitors and financial management. They should acquire the knowledge for themselves or be prepared to hire people with those skills.
During our time in establishing the Nations Trust SME banking sector, we realized that our employees should be trained in order to guide the SME customers to overcome their real time obstacles.
Therefore, we partnered with the German non-profit organization Frankfurt School of Business to structure trainings for our staff. We launched our SME training academy with curriculums from the Frankfurt School of Business and lectures were delivered to equip our team with the skills needed to guide and mentor SME clients.
We have now completed over 100 seminars and have partnered with university professors and industry specialists to share their knowledge and discuss issues such as branding, capturing export markets, tax planning and post budget analysis.
Raising a concern on where the Sri Lankan SMEs stand in comparison to the global counterparts, Jayathileke stated Sri Lankan SMEs are lagging behind in terms of technology, mechanization and automation. We still rely heavily on manual labour.
Even though, mechanization requires significant initial investment, it streamlines production allowing massive increases in productivity and cost efficiency. This is why we often find imports cheaper as mechanization in source countries has reduced their cost of production and increased their competitiveness in the global marketplace.
R&D is also essential for growth but investment in R&D is sadly low among Sri Lankan SMEs unlike their global competitors. This must change because we cant develop products and then look for markets; instead we need to understand what the market wants and then deliver.
Setting Nations Trusts SME services apart from others is the Banks drive to personalized servicing, SMEs, like all businesses, go through good times and bad. Its at crucial times that in such scenarios we really want to get involved and help owners understand where their business is going wrong and guide them to make good decisions whilst steering them away from a financial debacle. Most business owners dont see that there is a problem until its too late but our intention is to make them aware about future threats before it escalates out of control, claimed Jayathilake.

Psychic octopus killed for food
Its too late for both Japan and its psychic octopus at the World Cup.
The national team squandered a 2-0 lead in a 3-2 loss to Belgium on Monday, eliminating the Japanese. Meanwhile, the octopus credited with predicting the outcome of Japans previous three matches had already met its demise sold as seafood, outlets reported.
Fisherman Kimio Abe caught the octopus last month off Hokkaido and assigned it match-forecasting duties, according to a translated article on the Mainichi website.
He placed the octopus in a plastic tub containing flagged boxes that represented Japan (for victory), its opponent (for defeat) and a draw. Wherever Rabio (or Rabiot, as some outlets have it) swam first was considered the creatures prediction.
The octopus proved to be a spineless Jimmy the Greek, correctly choosing Japan to defeat Colombia, tie with Senegal and lose to Poland. Im glad that all the forecasts turned out correct and Japan moved on to the knockout stage, Abe said.
The oracle octopus didnt get a chance to prognosticate Japans elimination game against Belgium. Abe sold it to market, meaning the octopus could be sashimi by now.
Deadspin and at least one Twitter user blamed Japans defeat on the octopuss death.
Other outlets made sport of the creatures fate. PETA was not amused.
The BBC noted that Rabio wasnt the only invertebrate to act as a media-propped prophet. In 2010, a German octopus named Paul predicted the outcome of six World Cup games. Huffington Post

ADB grants US$9.5 mn to support women entrepreneurs
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has granted USD 9.5 million through the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We  Fi) to support the ongoing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)  Line of Credit.
Financial inclusion for SMEs is important to realize the development objectives of the Government such as promoting exports, generating jobs and increasing per capita income. As such, the Government mobilized USD 100 million from ADB in 2016, with the objective of financing SMEs and having successfully disbursed these funds, another USD 75 million was mobilized from ADB, in 2018 as an additional financing to further enhance the benefits to the SME sector.
Since women led SMEs face significant difficulties in accessing finance, a grant of USD 12.55 million will be mobilized from the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We  Fi) , on top of the loan funds for encouraging women entrepreneurs. Out of the grant of USD 12.55million, USD 9.5 million will be provided to the Women entrepreneurs on grant basis through Participating Financial Institutions. The balance amount of the grant will be used for Technical assistance and administrative cost. Additional incentives will be provided for women who complete business skills training and for women in Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Northern & Eastern provinces.
The Ministry of Finance and Mass Media will continue to be the Executing Agency of the project, as in the ongoing SME Projects funded by ADB.

The Minister emphasised the need for every school student to have religious education to live a life of integrity.
Accordingly, all school students have to be directed to Sunday Dhamma schools according to their respective faiths and school teachers too have to inculcate human values in the minds of students, while teaching, to shape students attitudes to avoid negative feelings such as anger, revenge and unwarranted competitiveness to achieve educational goals, the circular says.

[APPRECIATIONS - (09-07-2018)]
Rev. Canon Raylin Andradie
Servant of the Lord
During his 64th death anniversary, Rev. Don Raylin Henry Andradie, a distinguished son of Moratuwa, will be remembered as one who gave himself completely to the service of his church as an indefatigable servant of the Lord, a faithful priest and a committed pastor.
His regular visits to his parishioners as well as his impeccable memory and winsome ways, stood out as hallmarks of his ministry. Rev. Andradie, his full name being Don Raylin Henry Jacob Andradie Warnakula Jayasuriya, prefixed by Arasakulasuriya Arasanailayaitta Adiya, was born in his ancestral home called Andradie Niwasa at Lady Evelyn de Soysa Road in Idama, Moratuwa.
He was baptised and confirmed at the Church of Holy Emmanuel, Moratuwa. At Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, he acquainted himself well with studies and was successful in both the Cambridge Senior and Matriculation Examinations.
He was ordained a deacon in 1924, after having successfully completed a course in theological studies at the Divinity School in Colombo and a priest in 1925. In May 1927, he married Balapuraduge Letitia Charlotte Mendis, a teacher attached to Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. She was at the time, residing at Mount Pleasant in Moratumulla, Moratuwa. The marriage was solemnised at the Church of Holy Emmanuel, Moratuwa. They were later blessed with two children: Christopher and Pauline.
A doughty champion of the Anglo-Catholic cause, he steadfastly held to its traditions wherever he served. His 30-year long ministry extended from Matara through Panadura, Egoda Uyana, Koralawella, Horethuduwa, Dandugama and Kurana, along the West coast and from Badulla through Kandy to Kurunegala, in the hill country.
As an erudite scholar proficient in many a language; Sinhala, English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Pali and Sanskrit; his bountiful knowledge was made use of not only as a lecture in Sinhala in the Divinity School in Colombo, but also as a translator of the Holy Scriptures and the Book of Common Prayer into Sinhala.
Bishop Archibald Rollo Graham Campbell, the eighth Bishop of Colombo, in a tribute to the late Rev. Andradie made at the Diocesan Council Sessions of 1945, said, During the 30 years of his ministry, he laboured faithfully to fulfil the responsibilities of that ministry, while caring for the people committed to his charge. All the time, he laboured to make the Bible and other prayer books available all communities, in their own tongue.
Rev. S. W. Douglas de Mel, in an appreciation published in the Ceylon Churchman during September in 1954, said, The reward for all his efforts is seen perhaps in the progress made by Tamil students in a language quite foreign to them and the desire he kindled in the hearts of Sinhala students to love and learn their mother tongue better.
While Rev. Andradie was in service at St. Pauls Church in Kandy during 1932, he had the rare privilege of meeting the Duke of Gloucester when he arrived in Ceylon for the enthronement of the last King of Kandy.
Among his publications are The St. Peters Prayer Book (1939) and Sith Uyana (1946), which are widely used even today in most Anglican homes, especially in Moratuwa. Childrens Prayers (1947) is one of his lesser-known works. He was the editor the Sinhala monthly journal Dharmadeepthiya.
In 1953, in recognition of his faithful service to God, Rev. Andradie was appointed a Canon of the Cathedral Church of Christ to the seat of St. Lawrence Church, by Bishop Archibald. During the latter years of his life, the Rev. suffered due to his failing health, but still travelled a distance of 20 kilometres each day to Dandugama, to teach students at the Divinity School in Colombo. At the time of his death, he had almost completed a commentary of St. Mathews Gospel in Sinhala.
Six years ago in 1954, Rev. Andradie was called to rest on June 22, in the presence of a large gathering. It was a glowing tribute to the piety and faithfulness of the much-loved priest. PP

Niroshan Srideva
A brave believer
Everything happens in consonance with divine will.
My son Niroshan who was a final-year medical student at the Sri Jayawardenepura University, met his untimely demise on July 6, 2001, on Guru Poornima Day. He sacrificed his life to save me, his father. If he wanted to, he could have escaped, but instead, rebelled against the assailant and fell prey to his blade.
Even though the incident took place 18 years ago, he is always remembered by his fellow Sai devotees. Unfortunately, the culprits are still at large. Brahma once addressed sage Narada and said, I create the bad in order to highlight and promote the good. I cannot comment on what is said in scriptures. Why were murderers created
For the protection of the world, for upholding righteous action (dharma) and for fulfilling the yearnings of devotees, God willed a special physical human form as Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Niroshan became an ardent devotee of Swami from the age of 8.
Nirosh treasured the stories and leelas of Swami.
They filled him with love and devotion to God. In his room, he had a number of books on Swamis teachings as well as Buddhism and Christianity.
He also possessed books on Saints such as Ramana Maharishi and Ramdas, which he would have read with joy. He had a sound knowledge on the atma, which enabled him to keep himself on an even keel, neither rising when praised nor falling when blamed, while never worrying about the past, present or future.
After he sustained stab injuries on that fateful day, he had a calm composure, with a smile on his face. Niroshan, my dearest son, I miss you immensely and anxiously await my liberation or mukthi, as I am now free from all familial obligations.

Manthri Kariyawasam
Eminent pioneer in education
The saddening news of the passing of Manthri Kariyawasam reached us from Melbourne, Australia, on Saturday morning. He was 85 years old when death overtook him.
To many in Sri Lanka, even to those in the professional or academic communications fields, the name Manthri Kariyawasam may not ring a bell. But the stark truth is that Manthri played a central and pioneering role in the introduction of Mass Communications Studies to the Tertiary Educational Level in the country.
Since history enabled me to perform the principal series of activities involved in this tertiary educational innovation, I am the most suitable person to assess and chronicle the significance of Manthri Kariyawasams service and contribution to this history-making educational movement.
Manthri and I were on the editorial staff of Lake House in the early 1960s. He impressed me as a brash and daring young person. At that age, he had a peculiar fascination for sports cars. He would occasionally ask me to have a ride in his car. At the wheel, he was almost fiendish, but always safe. Although I had minor qualms, I knew that Manthri was fully aware of what he was doing.
Eventually, he left Lake House and took up a state assignment. In the course of his official duties, Manthri was put in charge of the Mass Communications Department of the newly-established Junior University.
One evening, he called me. He asked me, almost off hand, Edwin, can you teach Mass Communications at the Junior University I, of course, said yes.
He proposed this because he was convinced that I could handle that academic responsibility. He knew how deeply I studied the latest developments in the fields of Media and Mass Communication.
He gave me a free hand. I created an extensive syllabus which included not only academic aspects, but the crucial practical facets of Mass Communication as well. I formulated assessment systems and on-the-job training. The research work for the final exam was part of the system.
Manthri assured me; Edwin, you do all the academic work. I will be merely the mover and shaker. I am grateful to him, that he enabled me to achieve an eminent place in the tertiary educational history of this land, by formulating the pioneering, comprehensive syllabus for this discipline. He remained my unswerving friend and the supreme patron of this new discipline.
Our students, Harold Pieris being the foremost among them (assessed objectively), testify to Manthris humane and easy-going ways with the students.
He remains ever fresh in my memory, as my ever kind friend who enabled me to achieve the historical status of the academic pioneer to introduce Mass Communication to Sri Lankas tertiary education.
Our condolences to the bereaved family. May Manthri attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana. Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa

Doreen Mural
An exemplary mother
It is with grief and gratitude that I pen these few lines on my only aunt Kurukulasooriya Doreen Mural (nee Perera). She passed away on June 21, 2017, at the age of 83.
My aunt (my fathers sister), was the youngest in a family of three. Her only brother late K. Joseph Mervyn Perera was a Time-keeping Clerk at the Colombo Port Commission (Now Sri Lanka Ports Authority). He was 56 at the time of his death in 1987.
She received her education at our Lady of Victories Convent at Moratuwa and was keen on her studies. However, she discontinued her studies when her father fell ill. Aunt Doreen was fluent in Sinhala, English and Tamil.
She later married Lawrence Mural from Negombo. They were happily married and uncle Lawrence loved his wife unconditionally. He served in the Department of Census and Statistics for 36 years and later, went into retirement in 1919. He passed away in 1992.
Aunt Doreen and uncle Lawrence were blessed with four sons. Their eldest son Rupert was a close friend of mine. Corlo was their secondborn, Rosemund was the third and Quintus was the fourth; he is currently in Italy.
Aunt Doreen was the pivot around which her family unit revolved around and family always came first. She symbolised the quintessential qualities of motherhood. Aunt Doreen was an exemplary mother whose devotion and concern for her children extended beyond their childhood years. Her unconditional love and understanding allowed her children to carve their own path in life and today, all of them are faring well. My aunt was a prayer-warrior, both beginning and ending each day with a prayer. She spent much time reading the Bible. She was a friend, mother and a spiritual guide to me; during difficult times, she was always there, praying with me and during good times, she was there, praising god with me.
We visited her and her family during every church feast (St. Sebastians Church, Moratuwa), but in 2015 and 2016, we failed to do so due to unavoidable circumstances. Aunt Doreen passed away peacefully and was laid to rest on June 24, 2017, at the Grand Street Church in Negombo.
Our deepest sympathies go to her sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren. May her soul rest in peace.

Your sudden demise
Just before you left for home
After a seminar In Colombo,
Shocked and grieved so many, so much.
Your illustrious service
In various education districts
As a zonal director,
Left a large gap.
We miss you immensely
You were an eminent educationist
The thesis you had been writing for your PhD,
Is now left half-done; incomplete.
Unfortunately, thats the way of life
Allah has limited and extended our doings
Your decency, straightforward ways,
Strict discipline and especially,
Your pure hands in all what you did,
Were brightly reflected in the pouring in
Of several busloads of people
From various districts.
You served until your final breath
All your good deeds will surely
Safeguard you hereafter,
Insha Allah.
Those devoted to life, to education,
Never die; they are said to
And attain eternal bliss;
Everlasting peace.
Allah, you are most gracious and merciful
We pray you bless our dearest Ahamed
With Jennathul Firdowz.

Point of view
Sri Lankan equities remained in the doldrums yet again this week, recording its 2nd highest weekly loss for the year (~86 points cf. 103 point loss two weeks ago) and breaching the key 6100-mark to hit a 15-month low (6044.03 points).
However, the ASPI rebounded from this low within a day as the continuous slide on the benchmark index over the last seven weeks led to bargain-hunting on blue-chip stocks.
The ASPI consequently recorded its highest daily Index gain in 14-months, with the Index gaining ~74 points (or 1.22%) on Thursday (cf. ~97 point one-day loss in April 17).
Stronger buying on Thursday helped push the Index back over the 6100-mark and appeared to establish 6100 as the new support level for the Index.
However, confusion over fuel price changes created a sense of policy uncertainty once again, and dragged sentiment lower on Friday.
Sri Lankas fuel-pricing revisions which were previously scheduled to come into effect every two months, was unexpectedly changed on Thursday to be revised weekly.
The broad share ASPI consequently dropped a marginal 9 points over Friday, but the Index held on above the 6100-level mark to close the week at 6108.7 points.
The foreign equity sell-off on the Sri Lankan equities meanwhile, continued once again this week, with the net outflows from the CSE expanding notably to Rs. 900Mn from Rs.392 last week.
Foreigners have been net sellers on the Index for four consecutive weeks, tracking the heightened risk-aversion (over the last four weeks) for EM/FM assets in general.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues both from domestic political developments and broader global financial market themes.
Policy rates held steady for second time since April
The CBSL held policy rates steady during its 4th review for the year (SDFR-7.25% and SLFR-8.50%) citing stabilizing inflation levels and amid slower Q118 growth.
The Monetary Authority noted that although money market rates have remained elevated (despite its rate cut in April), nominal and real interest rates would gradually adjust downwards in line with the CBSLs neutral policy stance and the prevailing low inflation environment.
The CBSL also noted that private credit growth has moderated from the festive season-led credit expansion in Mar18 and that inflation is expected to stabilise at mid-single digit levels despite temporary supply side pressures.
Urban and national inflation levels remained at low single digit levels, despite upward revisions to domestic fuel prices and although the CBSL expects some upside pressure on near term inflation due to the off-season of domestic food supplies, inflation over the remainder of the year is expected to remain at the desired mid-single digits amid firmly anchored inflation expectations and appropriate policy adjustments.
The CBSL acknowledged meanwhile that Q118 GDP growth remained subdued (3.2% Y-o-Y cf. 3.3% Y-o-Y in Q117) amid slower growth in Industry-related activities.
The Bank noted that while the i) sustained recovery in the global economy, ii) the low inflation environment and, iii) appropriately valued flexible exchange rate are expected to facilitate higher growth over the remainder of the year, the GoSLs continued commitment to the implementation of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation will be vital for the country to achieve its medium-term growth potential.

Beers and cheers as England fans go wild over World Cup win
LONDON, Saturday - Fans back home erupted in celebration and the beer went flying as England reached the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 28 years on Saturday.
At Flat Iron Square in London, where 650 people crammed in to watch on a giant screen, the party began with beer showers and chants of Football's coming home after the 2-0 win over Sweden in Russia.
Friends leapt on one another's shoulders to belt out the song from the 1996 European Championships, an uplifting Britpop anthem of maintaining hope against precedent.
I've been going thirsty to the well of pain for a long time, said long-suffering fan Stephen Walter, 42, from north London.
Now we're a well-organised team, there's a good feeling all round, the flags are flying again. The stars seem to be aligned!
Steve Richardson, 50, a sales director from Cambridge in eastern England, said he told his 22-year-old son he would never experience this again in his lifetime, let alone mine.
We could actually win this. This is exactly what the country needs. I absolutely believe we will be world champions.
I've seen it for 50 years and we've always fallen. This is it! The last time England reached a World Cup semi-final was at Italy 1990, when 16 of the current squad were not even born. It was closer in time to England's 1966 World Cup triumph than today. Margaret Thatcher was Britain's prime minister. Phones were coin-operated, came in red boxes and people queued to use them.
The 1990 squad starred Gary Lineker, John Barnes, Chris Waddle and Paul Gascoigne. Peter Shilton, England's goalkeeper then, is now 68.
In Flat Iron Square, in scenes mirrored across the country, many had the England flag -- Saint George's red cross on white -- painted on their cheeks, and while many men wore replica England shirts, many more stripped off in the baking 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) heat.
An air horn went off to cheers at the first appearance of the teams in the tunnel and God Save The Queen was belted out in a full-throated rendition.
A tight first quarter quietened the mood but the place erupted in the 30th minute when Harry Maguire headed in England's opening goal with beer flying everywhere, gallons raining down as people roared in celebration.
At half-time, Camilla Mosley, 24, from London, said: If we win the World Cup, I will shower in beer for the rest of the year.
She did not have to wait long for the next dousing when Dele Alli doubled England's lead and the drinks went flying once again and people clambered on the tables as they bounced around in delight.

A bid to defang dengue
Talavou Allailima founder of Power World is a strong man of muscle, yet not even he could prevent the silent killer, the angel of death from biting all three of his sons. Allailima nearly lost all three of his sons to this menace, but through the grace of god as Allailima puts it, all three recovered. How secure are you that your loved ones will survive this menace For Allailima this is a personal vendetta against Dengue. He has started a campaign to wipe this menace out of Sri Lanka for good.
Promoter Death to Dengue Campaign and Founder Power World, Talavou Allailima, said we in Sri Lanka face challenging times. Allailima stressed that now is the opportune moment to strike with all our strength.
The message I have for you today is very important and needs to be carried across Colombo and the nation of Sri Lanka. I want to complete this mission that we all have in mind. This must be the end game. Dengue has weakened. Last year we did a campaign in August when it was at its peak. In January it was supposed to peak but it did not.
The enemy is weak and we must hit it harder and end this. You do not realize how horrible Dengue is until your child is affected badly. My baby at the age of five months got Dengue. The doctors told me that there was a 90 percent chance that I would lose my baby boy. Because of Gods grace the worst that could happen did not happen. My boy came out of it. At the same time my other son was in Nawaloka hospital fighting for his life. These experiences really shook me. I then wrote an article called Beating Dengue which went Viral. I basically spelt out the steps we need to take to prevent dengue and steps to beat Dengue if the child gets Dengue. I was interviewed on it. Some schools handed it over to parents as a hand out. People have walked up to me and thanked me for the article saying the article had helped, said Allailima.
Allailima said there is a plan right now with a few initiatives that need to be implemented. These initiatives have been thought through thoroughly since last August.
I have spoken to a lot of people about how to beat Dengue. I have spoken with all kinds of experts. In addition to spraying from helicopters, they have tried different methods to beat Dengue. What really works What really helps beat Dengue The result of my conversations was that the best method was the neighborhood taking the responsibility for their neighborhood. And that is what nations have done to bring Dengue to minimal levels. So how do you get the neighborhood committed How do you sustain the interest to continuously clean up Colombo and keep the Dengue problem at bay We needed to come up with not only a program that will get the neighborhood involved but one that will be successful  a dengue free zone in the neighborhood. How do you keep people hooked right through the year every single week So the initiatives have been planned with those ideas in mind. Hopefully in the next three weeks by July 28 we will have at least 5,000 neighborhood leaders in place, so that when the cleaning takes place on the 28, the whole community and most of Colombo will get together to clean their area and neighborhood, explained Allailima.
Former Commander of Army General Daya Ratnayake, Promoter Death to Dengue Campaign, with his insights on the battlefield commented that we must completely crush this enemy that is dengue.
Dengue is not only Sri Lankas enemy it has a reputation around the world and is recognized as a fearful disease. One problem is that when Dengue weakens, we tend to relax, discontinue our efforts and lose focus on the need to eliminate it completely. So we need to re-organize. On the battlefield when engaging the enemy, we must annihilate the enemy and do so in such a way that the enemy cannot recover. We must become an example to other countries when destroying Dengue. Our weapon must be that of spreading awareness. In our battle against the LTTE we used land, air and sea power. It was a combination. These initiatives are very promising and we can win this battle against Dengue, said Ratnayake.
Provincial Director of Health Services, Dr. Anil Samaranayake, commented that he is fully aware of the difficulty of the task that we are all faced with.
As a public sector we have come a long way but the journey is not over. To reach the end we have to join hands with the other organizations. From the beginning I believe in the multi-sectoral approach because the mosquito born viruses change. You wont believe how fast the viruses change. It is a real problem for us as doctors. I, as a doctor, I am open to any idea. We even encourage any idea when it comes to mosquito traps. If there is any efficiency I am for it. That is a principle I follow, so I totally support Talavous ideas. We have to change our strategies. I am impressed by these new initiatives. These APPS are very exciting in my opinion, said Samaranayake.
Additional Secretary to the President, Nalaka Kaluweva, said there is a great need for these kind of initiatives.
I wish to congratulate Allailima for his bold and refreshing initiatives. From the point of view of the Presidential Secretariat this should indeed be a multi-sectoral approach. The government cannot do this alone. We cannot combat this kind of menace alone. Last year we had a very bad period with the Dengue Epidemic. During that period as a government we had a lot of programs and recorded many successes also. But again if the government stands alone they cannot win this war against Dengue. We need support from the civil society, private sector and all the stake holders.
These initiatives proposed can really help us eradicate this problem. Getting the active support of the private sector is not that easy. So we need everyone to join hands with each other and finally bring about an end to this problem. So I feel very encouraged from what I am hearing today, and from the governments side we really endorse this, said Kaluweva.
Executive Committee Member Death to Dengue Campaign, Priyanath Peiris spoke of this campaign to wipe out Dengue as the vision of Talavou Allailima.
This is a needy cause that all of us face in this country and it affects all of us regardless of whatever background we all come from. Last year we saw an attempt being made to clean up Dengue breeding spots in many parts of the country.
We have planned something much bigger than that this year with the help of the provincial councils. We have invited them to join us. This campaign will go on, until we see no Dengue in this country, said Peiris.

INITIATIVES PLANNED OUT TO ERADICATE DENGUE
Rapid Response Team
They are planning on positioning Vehicles all over Colombo and in the greater Colombo area. These are positioned so that when a patient enters hospital, immediately the information goes to the vehicle and the vehicle goes to treat that area where the person came from. So they need to set up these rapid response teams. They are working with certain companies. They have some commitments saying that they will be given a vehicle for a year. These vehicles will be positioned with people who can treat. So they have invited organizations to step in and join them. They have also developed an APP. The hospital clicks the APP, the information travels to the vehicle and the vehicle takes off. The rapid response will work in that way.
Developing a Child Friendly Leaflet
This needs to be handed over to every child in Colombo. Every child will be provided information. If we get the children on board, and if they are able to understand what is needed to keep them safe, we will cover a lot of ground. They will influence the parents to keep these instructions in mind. This will help bring about the protection that is needed. There is a plan to distribute it to 500 children in Colombo and suburbs. The target date for the Death to Dengue Campaign to take place is July 28 (Saturday).
Introduction of Mosquito Traps to schools
We need to get the more affluent schools to have these traps so the parents who are affluent can invest in this. When children see this protecting their schools, the message will go to their parents. And in turn the parents will try and buy some for their homes. So 20,000 of these traps in these homes will have a mitigating effect in our city. But we now have to settle on which trap works because there are so many out there.
Death to Dengue Campaign will take place on July 28
We will ask the Colombo and Greater Colombo residents to Watsapp an image of the location with the address- what they feel is a dengue hotspot in their vicinity. We will map it (like last August where we covered 150  200 locations). On the 28th the Pest Control Companies will go and attend to those areas. They will know if it is really a hotspot or not. And they will address on how to treat it. What the people will do is they will send the information about what they feel threatened about.
The Death to Dengue Mobile App
This is where we really need help. This is what is going to bring everything together. This is the solution to disrupt Dengue. So how it works is that you download the APP like you do any APP. So then you register, you log in, you put in your password and then you set it up. You will also have a profile where you can put your information in, and a profile is built for you. There are actually three objectives of the mobile APP. The first, primary and the most important is the neighborhood takes care of the neighborhood to make it a Dengue Free Zone. Once you have downloaded the APP and your neighbors have downloaded the APP, one person would be designated as the leader. He/she signs up the neighbors who will allow him or her to visit their homes  to see whether there are mosquito breeding sites. So these people will be added into his/her group. So systematically the checking will happen every seven days. The leader is expected to go into each house and see that everything is in order. At the end he will say submit and then the Head of the home will get a message saying  your house was checked. So for that particular home the checking has been done. The owner of the house in turn will respond saying that it was cleaned. So that is how the systematic checking will take place in every neighborhood.
SOS Button
When people go on the road and see a possible mosquito breeding hotspot, there is an SOS button that you can also use in the APP and take a photograph of the location and then hit send. And when that is sent, that message goes to the closest neighborhood leader asking him if he can handle it. If he cant handle it the message will go to one of the vehicles. Within a couple of hours the rapid response vehicle will go and check the site. If that does not happen it will be escalated to the central command who will alert the private pest control companies, who will pay a visit to that location.
The neighborhood stands with each other to build a secure neighborhood
Lets say a thief jumps into your house at one in the morning. You see the rogue coming but you dont know what to do. There is a watchman button on the APP. So you press the button if some emergency happens. And that in turn alerts all the houses. So within two minutes you will come to my home. The beeping sound will go on until you switch it off. This is a security function that is there. If someone gets sick and you need help and you are desperate, then you press that button. So it helps a lot since everyone in the family have that APP. We also put a sticker on every gate saying it is a Watchman activated home. So everyone knows that the particular house has the Watchman button. It brings security and protection.
This APP is available on Google Play to be downloaded at this point. APPLE by next Monday, all Apple phones can download this.

Boat capsizes at Ekgal Oya; three dead, one missing, five rescued
The bodies of three out of the four persons who had gone missing after a boat capsized at Ekgal Oya in Damana yesterday, were recovered.
Th bodies of a school principal, a 13-year-old student and a 43-year-old teacher were recovered, while the watcher is still missing.
The boat was carrying a group of students and staff members of Siri Seevali Vidyalaya, Kandana, when it capsized at around 6.45 am yesterday.
The nearby fishermen were able to save five persons and the Police diving team with the assistance of the villagers launched a rescue operation for the missing people.
The group was attending an excursion organised by the Kandana Siri Seevali Widyalaya Welfare Society. The group which consisted of 45 persons had been staying at a nearby resort and nine people had gone to Ekgal Oya yesterday morning for a bath in a boat which was later capsised. Speaking to the Daily News, a person who was rescued said that the group had only one oar and some of the members started to panic after the boat had started to sway and subsequently tilt in the middle of the Ekgal Oya.This resulted in the boat capsizing.

Breast-cancer drug doubles the risk of womb cancer
A breast-cancer drug taken by thousands of women more than doubles the risk of womb cancer, new research suggests. Taking the medication tamoxifen for 10 years rather than the standard five raises womens risk of endometrial cancer from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, an Irish study found.
Endometrial cancer affects the lining of the womb. Previous research suggests tamoxifen blocks the hormone oestrogen from stimulating breast cancer growth. It can be given as a treatment or a preventative therapy in people with a strong family history of the disease. Although the drug prevents oestrogen in breast tissue, it acts like the hormone in the uterus, which raises users risk of endometrial cancer.
The researchers, from St Vincents Hospital Group, Dublin, analysed four studies that investigated the link between endometrial cancer in people who took tamoxifen for 10 years. Results further suggest that taking the drug for five years raises the risk by two per cent.
The findings were published in the British Journal of Surgery. According to the American Cancer Society, tamoxifen causes endometrial cancer in around one in 500 women.
If a breast-cancer patient is given tamoxifen, they can reduce their risk of endometrial cancer by maintaining a healthy weight, eating healthily, exercising regularly and keeping their diabetes under control, if necessary. The researchers add there does not appear to be any benefit to assessing women for endometrial cancer if they are on tamoxifen but not showing any symptoms.
Signs of the disease include abnormal bleeding or discharge while not menstruating, unusual pelvic pain or pressure, difficult or painful urination, and pain during intercourse.
Antioxidant in red wine halts the protein that causes cancer
This comes after scientists revealed last month how red wine may prevent cancer. An antioxidant, called resveratrol, in the tipple stops the formation of protein clumps that are found in 50 per cent of tumours, a study by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro found.
It is unclear how much red wine people need to drink to reap the benefits of resveratrol, which is also found in cranberries, blueberries and peanuts. Researchers hope the findings will lead to the development of a drug that prevents such protein clusters.
One in two people born after 1960 in the UK will develop cancer at some point in their lives. Some forms of the disease are rarer than others, with bladder cancer affecting one in 27 men and breast cancer one in 10 women in the US.

Towards a nation of integrity
CIABOCs high hopes and moderate expectations
Everyone is waiting for us to catch the next whale. Well, if you want to catch whales, then whales have to be willing to give evidence, said Sarath Jayamanne, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), at a forum of civil society activists and the media at Colombos Movenpick Hotel last Monday.
Jayamanne was referring to this past May, when CIABOC arrested President Sirisenas Chief of Staff Dr. I.H.K. Mahanama, and the State Timber Corporation Chairman Piyadasa Dissanayaka, for accepting an initial bribe of Rs. 20 million from an official of an Indian company. Dr. Mahanama was the highest-ranking official to be arrested in Sri Lanka in 60 years. And yet, CIABOCs success this May is now perceived with a slight sense of disappointment. One CIABOC official at the event explained how they thought the arrests would have a chilling effect in the government, a potent deterrent for those who partake in bribery or corruption.
It was merely one indication of how CIABOC is evolving to distinguish its hopes from its expectations, the difference between the Commissions goals, and the many obstacles in its reality.
Problems and penalties
The opening speeches from three officials within the government - Jayamanne, CIABOC Commissioner Chandranath Neville Guruge and Additional Secretary to the Finance and Media Ministry Thilaka Jayasundara - depicted the profound importance of CIABOC at this moment. At one point, Guruge shared findings of CIABOC surveys, which found that 25 percent of public sector officials are allegedly corrupt and 75 percent of officials have no opportunity to raise their voices. He added that within the 25 percent of allegedly corrupt people, there is an even smaller 10 percent who are simply intractable unless faced with legal action. Jayasundara emphasised the importance CIABOCs efforts: I think it is a very timely and important discussion we are having. She then shared statistics from Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking Sri Lanka in 91st place worldwide (behind China and India).
The event later morphed into a wide-ranging discussion of the causes and implications of corruption and bribery in Sri Lanka, as well as possible solutions. Every member of the media and civil society organisations present was given the opportunity to speak and offer recommendations.
The gathering was split into six groups, each of which focused on a different core area of CIABOCs National Action Plan. Core areas in need of development under the NAP included strengthening the CIABOC, the effective use of media platforms, the establishment of greater integrity in the public sector, deterrence in the private sector, prevention through education, and finally, the mobilisation of communities.
Participants thought of ways to rank public and private sector organisations on the basis of their due diligence and on the transparency of their assets. Civil society activists pointed out existing legislation that could be enforced better. Many focused on the importance of education in order to instill the values that prevent corrupt practices.
Director General Jayamanne addressed many of these issues: We must attach importance and gravity to punishments, he said, with regard to Chapter 63, Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act 1975, which provides that a person who is convicted of an offence under the Act will be liable to a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. Transparency International Sri Lanka added that, often, the magistrates with the responsibility of imposing either penalty discriminate between government officials and private citizens. In our country, the system takes several years to prosecute. The system has to change.
Roadmaps for NAP
From the beginning of the discussion, the Director General used Bhutan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore as examples where systems are used effectively to check bribery and corruption.
Topping the list, Bhutan was put forth as roadmap for the NAPs success. On the corruption index, Bhutan consistently fares better than its South Asian counterparts, said Jayamanne, waving a Bhutanese booklet of guidelines to handle corrupt practices. Separately, Jayasundara noted Bhutans happiness index as an indication of the countrys value-driven governance.
The speakers commended Hong Kong, a bulwark amongst Asias anti-corruption institutions, and remarked upon Malaysias increasingly determined effort to eradicate corruption. In fact, Malaysias 2004 National Integrity Plan, is echoed even at the level of language in CIABOCs National Action Plan, with its slogan of Towards a Nation of Integrity.
Again and again, the speakers mentioned Singapore, which holds seventh place on the global index of corruption, and has numerous safeguards, as well as strict audit controls that have allowed the countrys free-market economy to flourish.
Jayamanne suggested that Singapores economic success - securing the investments of more than 3,000 multinational corporations over the past few decades - is deeply tied to its corruption-free government. With references to Singapore, CIABOC expressed the desire for Sri Lankas rapid economic growth, and the understanding that such growth will only be possible with a greater level of transparency.
High hopes, realistic approaches
The forum revealed that, at the present moment, there is a distinct tension between what is necessary to eliminate corruption in the future, and what is possible in the present moment. The scope of the discussions highlighted the sweeping reforms that the NAP hopes to accomplish over a long period of time. On the other hand, the Director General maintained a practical understanding of CIABOCs reality: We have 29 legal officers. We have 200 police officers.
By the end of the week, CIABOC will have completed five consultations in Colombo alone, and 16 such forums nationwide. One official at the event said that they were facing stacks and stacks of proposals that they must consider before implementing the NAP.
Ultimately, the onus to improve will be placed not only upon officials within CIABOC, but also upon the same individuals who agreed to participate in CIABOCs forum, and, gradually, more active participation will be required from the citizenry.
In order to eliminate corruption and bribery in the country, said Guruge, We must set an example on all fronts - we must be exemplary.

Former Minister Vijayakala Maheswarans political speech is vehemently rejected by all democratic politicians and all citizens of our country.
As a state minister she should have paid her attention for the sake of future generation. Prabhakaran for the past 30 years had ruined this country, making communal struggle.
Therefore take immediate legal action against this former minister. All the members of this parliament have been sworn in the presence of President of this country for the people on their solidarity. Therefore Vijayakalas remark should legally be solved not by politicians.

Coffee drinkers may live longer
Caffeine is probably not responsible for the healthful effects of coffee. Drinking coffee is associated with lower mortality rates, and a new study suggests that caffeine is not responsible for the effect.
Researchers had demographic and health data on 498,134 British people, average age 57, including information on coffee consumption and on the genetic variants that affect caffeine metabolism. More than three-quarters were coffee drinkers.
Over 10 years of follow-up, there were 14,255 deaths. They found that the risk of death from any cause, and particularly from cancer and cardiovascular disease, declined steadily as coffee consumption increased. Those who drank a cup a day had a six per cent lower risk than those who drank less than that, and people who drank eight or more cups a day had a 14 per cent lower risk.
The study, in JAMA Internal Medicine, adjusted for age, race, smoking, sex, body mass index, alcohol consumption and other health and behavioral factors.
The associations were similar for ground and instant coffee, and for caffeinated and decaffeinated. Moreover, it made no difference whether people had the genetic variants for slower or faster caffeine metabolism.
Does this observational study mean that everyone should drink more coffee No, said the lead author, Erikka Loftfield, a research fellow at the National Cancer Institute.
At this point, the study provides reassurance to coffee drinkers, not guidance. The results dont indicate that people should begin drinking coffee for its health benefits.

Court calls for video recordings
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday issued an order directing several media institutions to produce their unedited video footage and paper articles pertaining to the statement made by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran regarding the resurgence of the LTTE at a public gathering held in Jaffna.
Filing a B report regarding this incident, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division alleged that the former State Minister could be charged under the offences that appears to have been committed under Section 115 and 120 of the Penal Code, violating the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and provisions stipulated under Article 157A of the Constitution. Article 157A of the Constitution provides Constitutional provisions for prohibition against the violation of the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
Article 157A(1) of the Constitution cites that no person shall, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.
The Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake that Police have commenced investigations into this incident pursuant to a complaint made by Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Ven.Magalkande Sudaththa Thera.
State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheshwaran decided to temporarily resign from her ministerial portfolio following a huge outcry in the country.
Addressing an event held at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna on July 2, former State Minister had allegedly said she would like to see the resurgence of the LTTE.

England set up Croatia World Cup semi as Russia crash out
SAMARA, Russia, Saturday - England reached their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 on Saturday, comfortably beating Sweden to set up a last-four clash against Croatia, who ended Russia's fairytale run in a nailbiting penalty shootout.
Gareth Southgate's young team started their match in Samara as firm favourites and had too much for the Swedes, although they were indebted to another fine performance from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in a 2-0 win.
But the later game in Sochi was packed with drama as Russia -- the lowest-ranked nation at their own tournament -- refused to die despite enjoying just 36 percent of possession against a superior Croatian team led by Luka Modric.
Croatia thought they had won the match when Domagoj Vida rose to nod in a corner in the first period of extra time after the sides were locked at 1-1 at the end of 90 minutes.
But refusing to let the dream come to an end, Mario Fernandes headed home from a free-kick with just five minutes remaining to infuse the home fans with renewed belief.
Russia, who beat Spain on penalties in the last 16, failed to convert two of their spot-kicks, leaving Barcelona's Ivan Rakitic with match point and he made no mistake, sealing a 4-3 win.
Another drama for us, said Modric. We didn't play well in the first half, we didn't control the game as we wanted.
From the start of the second half we played much better, but unfortunately we couldn't finish the game. We showed the character again.
Croatia, who last reached the semis in 1998, now face the challenge of trying to recover in time to play England in Moscow on Wednesday after their second consecutive penalty shootout drained their players of energy.
MAGUIRE, ALLI SCORE FOR ENGLAND
England's progress earlier in the day was much more serene.
Leicester defender Maguire headed in the opener from a corner on 30 minutes -- England's eighth goal from a set-piece at the World Cup -- with Alli adding a second, also from a header, just before the hour.
Man-of-the-match Pickford made three outstanding saves to keep Sweden at bay, further burnishing a reputation that has grown throughout the tournament.
It's a great achievement for the team, we owed it to the fans back home who believed in us, said Alli.
It's always nice to score, especially on occasions like this. It's an amazing feeling to be going to a semi-final at a World Cup. The tournament's leading goalscorer Harry Kane failed to find the net for the first time in the competition, but the England captain said confidence was high after posting the country's best run at a major tournament since Euro 96.
We're buzzing. We know there is still a big game ahead, but we're feeling really good, he said.
As England basks in a long heatwave, life came to a standstill for the match, with fans watching the game on big screens at events up and down the country.  AFP

Farming in the age of market drought
Selling farm products is an inherent problem due to the seasonality of production as a result of the biological nature of production. Farming takes place based on the monsoons. As this problem is common to both developed and developing countries, every country has specific policies to mitigate this problem. Price policy is a common to develop and developing countries but the nature of implementation varies by countries. In the United States, the operating system is called deficiency payments in which farmers are requested to keep the stocks at harvest time till price increases and deficiency payments are made by the government if prices fall below the target price which was determined by the government after taking the cost and desired profit into account. In countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand farmers are encouraged to keep stocks rather than selling the entire harvests at harvest time by providing marketing loans to meet the immediate cash requirements. In China, there are two procurement prices; one for the season and another for the off-season. The purpose of dual pricing policy is providing an assured market for off-season whereby encouraging farmers to hold stocks rather than selling entire stocks at harvest time. Commonly, these measures are known as supply management strategy. In the past, the main supply management strategy was procurement by the government at the predetermined price at harvest time. By now, this strategy has become a least important due to inefficiency in operation and high cost to the treasury. Many countries are now moving to other supply chain management policies such as the promotion of farm storage and market-led production plan whereby the government has become the last buyer instead of the main buyer.
Current problem of selling vegetables
A severe problem of selling pumpkins and tomatoes has been reported in the recent times. According to the observations, farmers cultivated more pumpkins and tomatoes in abandon paddy fields due to the inability to grow paddy resulting from the shortage of water. The root cause of the problem is excess supply. As a vegetable, these two commodities are not popular among the Sri Lankan consumers, unlike beans and carrots which are never being thrown away so far in the country. Hence, demand for pumpkin and tomatoes are not increased considerably even the price drop which results in a sharp decline of prices. To protect the farmers, the government should make arrangements with either government agencies or private entities to purchase and sell to the big institutional consumers such as prisons, hospitals and zoos. India is practising this strategy when there is unexpected excess supply. Even for these short-term arrangements to implement, the excess supply should be estimated in advance. Despite the well established institutional mechanism, the problem is unaware of excess supply until the media highlight it.
There is a system to monitor the crop situation at divisional, district and national levels. At the divisional level, the agricultural committee chaired by the Divisional secretary monitors the crop condition. At the village level, Agricultural Research and Production Assistants (ARPs) can monitor crop situation and report to the committee through the Development Officer at the Agrarian Service Centre (ASC). According to the designations, crop monitoring should be a mandatory function for them. At the district level, there is a committee chaired by the District Secretary to monitor crop situation while at national level Ministry of Agriculture is responsible to monitor crop condition. Accordingly, it is clear that there is a well-established system to monitor crop situation and estimate excess supply well in advance. The reality shows the inefficiency of the system.
Solutions to the problem
Many people suggest cold storage and food processing as solutions to excess supply in the short term despite the fact that past experience shows the failure of these solutions. Under the Mahaweli project (MARD) a cold storage was set up at Piburattawa in the System B of the Mahaweli project area with the capacity of two metric tons to store vegetables but it was a failure due to lack of vegetables to store. It was also found that storing vegetables was not economically profitable because the price of stored vegetables was higher than fresh vegetable harvested on the field at the time of releasing stored vegetables on the market. Those who recommend cold storage should understand the cost of storage that adds to the final price and availability of vegetables adequately to function the stores. If the non-stored vegetables are cheaper than the stored vegetables there will be a problem in the marketing of stored vegetable profitability. The failure example was the establishment of a tomato processing factory in Matale which had to be closed down due to an inadequate supply of tomatoes.
In addition to the short-term solution, the long-term solution is production planning based on the market requirements. That will give the permanent solution to the problem. The need for the market-led production system to solve the marketing problem of vegetables has been identified a long time ago. In 1995 the Cabinet appointed the subcommittee to study marketing problems of vegetables and suggest solutions to the problem.
The present secretary to the President was also a member of the committee and he was the secretary of the cooperative ministry at that time. The writer was also a member of the committee. The committee examined the problem critically and recommended a series of recommendations to solve the marketing problem of vegetables. One recommendation was the implementation of the market-based production system. Since it was not materialized the same recommendation was repeated in almost all policy documents until today. I have seen in the newspapers the same recommendation was made to the current problem of vegetable marketing.
In this country, functional plans are lacking and hence many recommendations limit to the paper. Having identified this problem the writer when he was at Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research at Training Institute (HARTI) initiated to formulate a functional plan towards the market led production system for vegetables in 2012 in collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture.
Initially, the country requirements of vegetables by varieties were estimated based on the information available in the Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES). In that survey, per capita monthly vegetable consumption is available by varieties and the country requirement was estimated per capita consumption multiplying population. The second step was to estimate the extent required for each vegetable that was calculated based on the estimated production dividing average yield of the variety concern. Having identified the monthly requirement of extent under each vegetable, the third step was the identification of locations and allocation of extent for each identified location. For this exercise, the two-day residential workshop was organised at HARTI with the district and divisional agricultural officers of Central and Provincial Ministries of agriculture. The final outcome was the preparation of the market led vegetable production plan and it was submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture for implementation. Since it was not implemented, the problem remains as it is and the need of market-led vegetable production system is being talked about continuously.
The question is why the functional plan was not implemented. The answer can be found in the management science. In management, responsibility, authority and accountability are three main concepts that determine the performance. Responsibility is a commitment to undertake assigned duties. Authority is right to give orders to get the work done. Accountability is answerable to the higher authority regarding the work done. These three principles are functioning smoothly in the private sector and hence performance is good while in the state sector these concepts are not taken seriously. In case of the vegetable problem of farmers, no one is answerable or accountable, hence the problem is not taken seriously.
Another issue related to the lack of accountability is doing and repeating mistakes without any fear. The HARTI suggested not to be established the Economic Centre at Weeawilla due to inability to compete with the existing pola system. But it was constructed and failed. The same mistakes repeated in Wariyapola that was also failed. There are many examples of failure cases such as the construction of Govisevana, the introduction of plastic crates and setting up public markets.
The public can see how many government buildings ruined even without an opening. According to the management, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies should be undertaken to examine the validity before starting it. In Sri Lanka, this practice is not happening in many instances. The reason is lack of answerability for the work.
Although the agricultural sector is the main driver of poverty alleviation and food security the sector performance is unsatisfactory as evident by the high incidence of rural poverty and increasing food imports. The sector cannot be developed until the agricultural management is improved. As Peter Drcker, father of modern management pointed out management is doing things right and leadership is doing the right things. With regard to marketing, the right thing is a selection of crops based on the market demand. Higher the demand means higher the production and vice versa and the doing things right means producing product at lower cost and following agrochemical practices acceptable to the community.
The products that were unable to sell were pumpkin and tomatoes. They have lower demand and become difficult to sell when vegetables like beans, carrot and potatoes are available in the market at a cheaper price. During the period of March to May, vegetables are cheap due to the arrival of Maha season crops. For instance, farmers in Matale and Dambulla areas cultivate vegetables after harvesting of big onions in September and October and harvesting commences from January onwards.
In this context, cultivation of pumpkin and tomatoes on abandoned paddy lands is not the right thing. Pumpkin should have been stored for some time as prices of vegetables are on the increase since the end of May to end of July of the year until the vegetable supply arrives in the market from Marassana and Rekillagaskada areas known as Kandy vegetable season.

'Female councillors should empower women'
Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara Jayasinghe, addressing the 243 female councillors elected to local government institutions in the Southern Province, last Friday (6), said, All eyes are on you so prove your mettle and earn the trust of the people.
She was addressing a capacity-building workshop for local female councillors in the Southern Province titled Creating Effective Leaders, which was organised by the Strengthening Democratic Governance and Accountability Project (SDGAP) funded by the Sri Lankan Government and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
The 25-percent female representation in local government bodies was achieved while facing many hardships, mainly due to the dedication and support extended by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the minister said.
She added that even though 52 percent of Sri Lankas population were female, males were given preference to be elected to decision-making bodies, as there was doubt whether women could play the role of a decision-maker in the political arena.
She reiterated that it was a novel situation where women have been elected as decision-makers in local government institutions and all eyes would be vigilant on how those novice councillors would perform.
Minister Bandara called upon all the councillors to unite irrespective of political affiliation, to resolve the problems faced by Sri Lankan women:
Even though most of you here today have been elected from the preferential list, you should strive to gain the trust of your constituents and win your wards at the next election, she added. Addressing the gathering, Member of Parliament Sudarshani Fernandopulle said that she hoped that the 25-percent female representation would be extended to provincial councils and even Parliament.
Professor Kamala Liyange, Sama Rajakaruna, Indika Dayarathna, Ajith Kaluarachchi and Kumari Vitharana were among the panel of resource persons who had been invited to the workshop.

A fillip for the media
Journalism and the media industry in Sri Lanka had ups and downs, but in all probability, they never ever faced a period like 2005-2014. From the daylight assassination of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge to the forced disappearance of cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, this was one of the bleakest periods for journalists and journalism in Sri Lanka. Indeed, several other journalists escaped death or disappearance by a mere whisker. The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime was known for its open hostility to the media and journalists who wielded their pens to expose corruption, misuse of power and nepotism associated with that regime. Many other journalists fled the country.
The Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena promised to end this dire situation. In fact, this was one of the main election planks of the Rainbow Coalition that propelled him to power. Today, anyone  not only journalists  can harshly criticize the President, the Prime Minister, Ministers and also Government projects without any fear of retaliation and retribution on the mainstream or social media. This alone is an achievement worthy of recognition.
Apart from ending the practice of intimidating journalists simply for doing their job, the Good Governance Government has taken many other steps to restore media freedom. The Right to Information legislation (RTI) was passed, which compels Government institutions to disclose details of their work, tenders etc. to journalists or ordinary citizens who make a request. This has led to greater transparency in Government business. The Government has also taken steps to improve training facilities for journalists and also provide financial assistance for buying laptops, cameras and other equipment.
The latest such move is the establishment of the Presidential Media Awards, which will be presented for the very first time in December this year. We have Presidential Awards in many other sectors including film, literature and drama, but this is the first time that journalists will be honoured in a similar fashion.
A total of 54 awards will be handed over to outstanding journalists working in all three languages in print, television, radio and web media at this ceremony. The awards covering a variety of categories will be decided upon by independent and impartial panels of judges. Applicants can nominate themselves or another person such as a colleague or editor can nominate an applicant.
The awards have been named Presidential Awards to impart the highest possible recognition to talented journalists and President Maithripala Sirisena has given his fullest backing to the project, along with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is a very laudable initiative that will encourage journalists working across different media to perform better. Those who do not win awards this year will naturally strive to get one next year.
The inclusion of web media shows how the media landscape has changed in our country in the last decade or so when the Internet went mainstream. Today, almost everyone has a smartphone through which news can be accessed 24/7. It is no longer possible to kill or ignore news stories as someone else will publish it somewhere on the web. In fact, social media such as Facebook and Twitter have made inroads into the traditional media set up to the point where some people get their news fix exclusively from them.
But here they risk falling for fake news, a social media phenomenon where false narratives pass off as seemingly true stories that people enthusiastically share. If one shares a fake news post at this moment, it would have gone around the world in the next five minutes. This is exacerbated by the fact that anyone with a smartphone can become a journalist broadcasting to the entire world by posting material or videos to Facebook Live or other such services. It is impossible to control or censor the social media in any case.
But the traditional media still has a role to play by vigorously defending the truth, facts, ethics and high reporting standards. Despite the intense competition among media houses to get the news out first, their journalists must not lose sight of these basic tenets of good journalism.
The electronic and social media often give only a fleeting glance at a news story and it is up to the traditional print media to probe the relevant issues in-depth. This role will perhaps not go away as people still rely on the newspapers to give them more than just headlines.
All media are converging  all newspapers have websites and apps that have audio and video content and the reverse has also happened in some countries  web magazines now turn out print editions. Technology is so advanced today that one person can audio-visually record an entire event and post it to the newspapers website and then write an account of it in-depth. Yes, there is a fear that the traditional print newspaper may not survive the next century in its present form, but the one thing that will not disappear is good journalism. There will always be a place for incisive, insightful and informative reporting, the like of which will be recognized by the first-ever Presidential Media Awards in December.

Demand to track down missing seven fishermen in sea
Fisher folk protest at Verellana
A large number of people and family members held a protest blocking the Galle Road at Werellana on July 7. They alleged that there had been no positive response from the Fisheries Minister or the Government about tracking down the seven fishermen who went missing after leaving the Galle Fisheries Harbour for fishing in the sea on June 14 on a multi-day fishing boat.
The protest started around 10 a.m. and went on past 10 p.m. Meetiyagoda police took steps to divert vehicles along alternative byroads.
The owner of the multi-day boat Sindur-4, M.W. Rohan Manoj of Seenigama, said that nearly three weeks had passed since his boat set out to sea with the seven fishermen and since they had lost contact with the boat, the Ministry, Navy and all others concerned had been alerted about the missing boat and its seven-member crew.
He said that there is a vessel monitoring system to track boats out at sea for which a heavy annual tax had to be paid to the government by every boat owner for a multi-day boat.
The VMS is operated from Denmark but it had not been activated so far to track down the boat, he alleged.
A. B. Asela Chamantha (46) and K. H. Duminda Sudeen Kularatne (34) of Werellana; N.H. Susil Praneetha (46), W. Rohitha (47), and R.H. Kalidu Melanga Chandane (26) of Totagamuwa; S.H. Samantha (50) of Seenigama and A. Janitha Prasanna (27) of Telwatte are the missing persons, he said.

Fulbright Specialist Program at Jayewardenepura campus
The United States-Sri Lanka Fulbright Commission has initiated a unique project where a group of students at University of Sri Jayewardenepura and three IT organizations involve in a collaborative problem solving exercise.
The problem solving is done with the help of virtual media, during the course of their academic program.
United States Fulbright Specialist and University of Wisconsin Professor of Mathematics Kirthi Premadasa is coordinating this project with Dr. Ravindra De Silva of University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Three leading software organizations, IFS international, Creative Software, and CodeGen International are currently participating in this unique project.
This innovative project was created under the inspiring patronage of Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sampath Amaratunge and Professor Sudantha Liyanage, the Dean of the Faculty.
The project is offered in two different forms to benefit the special degree students and the general degree students. The initial courses that will be part in the project include Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interaction and Machine Learning.
Thanks to virtual communication platforms such as Twitter and Slack, professors now have the opportunity to overcome the constraint of time that they face in the classroom in problem solving assignments given to students and provide students the opportunity to solve problems outside the class time, collaboratively over a period.
Professor Premadasa has done significant research on instructional technology and was chosen by the World Learning section of the US State Department as a Fulbright Specialist to conduct this project. His significant classroom experience in Sri Lanka as well as in the United will contribute to the success of this project.
Through this method, the industry will get an opportunity to present good problems that will enhance the technical and problem solving ability in students, creating a mutually beneficial outcome.
The project offering to the general degree student has connections to the flipped classroom model, which is popular in the United States and world over. Each participating company will first present a short video of a concept, which they would like students to study at home.
Research Assistants Udaka Manawadu and Kavindu Madushanka , who serve as the student coordinators for the project feel that students at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura have enthusiastically endorsed the project and appreciates its usefulness for the student body for years to come. Forty-one students in the third year are currently participating in the project.
The project is currently progressing according to plan and a formal inauguration ceremony will take place at 10.00 am on Thursday July 5 at the Faculty of Applied Sciences.

Global attention to the democratic revolution
It is good to note that the real conspiracy is between Trump supporters and the Sinhala racists who want Lanka off the global HR agenda. However, we should not forget that one of the earliest pledges with the presidential victory was to get the UN resolution thrown away with Trump's help. Unfortunately, left-leaning governments in the UNHRC either opposed or non-committal to the resolution. Although our faith in the global working class forces pushing for justice, no movement is evident. At least, I havent seen having it in their international agenda and I believe it is upon us to get the global attention it needs, said my friend who has doubts about our democratic revolution. What he said is proved by cries made by former Minister Vijayakala.
At the bottom of his mail, there was a note from a speech by Sambanthan at the launch of a book named A Judge Speaks by Wigneswaran. My friend thought this gives an idea of how the government is working on Tamil issues. The implied message is that even the Mahinda regime was compelled to look at Tamil demands when the armed struggle was live!
As for the OMP, the militant mothers in the north are boycotting. The clear and concrete demand is for the OMP to get the release of at least a 100 so that they can have trust in its intentions. In addition, apparently, the President has appointed a 48-member Task Force for the north without consulting TNA. Apart from many Sinhala ministers, it has tri forces commanders and police chief. This is a blatant effort to bring the north under the central government once its term lapses instead of devolving power. When considering these developments, obviously it would be better to have a more critical approach to the governments action on the Tamil issue, than applauding its cosmetic manoeuvring.
The global powers helped the Lankan regime to destroy an armed movement for the liberation of the oppressed Tamil people. Thus the Liberation Tigers were overcome and destroyed completely. The Lankan government at that stage gave a promise to the international powers to give a just political solution to the problem. Not only that; during the time where LTTE was active, the government gave various proposals for a political solution. Today the Yahapalanaya and the parliament, due to pressure or undue fear are reluctant to offer anything. This no doubt, goes to the consideration of the international; international community pressed by progressive movements understands its responsibility.
UN resolution on Lanka
Many civil organisations and human rights campaigners believe that it is necessary for the government to fulfil the commitments it made in the UN resolution on Lanka. However, the pro-Mahinda politicians including some left organisations condemned this resolution as an act of imperialist subjugation. So-called patriots have been in the forefront of agitation against this resolution claiming that is an attempt to strengthen the conspiracy for the division of the country.
They deny that there is or were any national discrimination in Lanka. Further, they claim the Tamil liberation is an American supported military action to divide the country and strengthen the American interest in the Indian Ocean. This opinion is challenged by the democratic movement that helped to overthrow the fascistic Mahinda regime. This democracy accepts these commitments are ones that need to be kept whether or not the government has international commitments or not; because these were national commitments spelt out by Democracy. These are for the release of civilian land held by the military, release of prisoners held without charge for years, demilitarization, removal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and establishing a truth-seeking and accountability mechanism to investigate and prosecute violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law.
The recently announced release of yet another hundred acres of land by the military in the North to the civilian population is a message that the process of land returns is continuing. This is complemented by the governments decision to build a further 50,000 houses in the North for those who were affected by the war.
This should be done whether the affected are LTTE suspects or not. Suspects are suspects under PTA; their family members not even suspects. Hence any discrimination based on PTA investigation should be prevented. In spite of such lapses, the government has been providing livelihood assistance to war victims, rehabilitating ex-LTTE cadres, and has recently passed a law that criminalizes enforced disappearances, set up an Office of Missing Persons, and is in the process of establishing an Office of Reparations. These were done with UN assistance and UNHRC supervision.
It is necessary for the government to seek to implement the remaining commitments made in the UNHRC resolution, which include reducing the military presence in the former war zones of the north and east and engaging in constitutional reform that would devolve more power to those areas. The military should be confined to the camps and barracks as in other areas of the country.
Democracy and human rights campaign
Devolution of power should include land and police powers. These are necessary to bring about a lasting solution to the nationality conflict that has plagued the country since its independence and prevented it from developing as a united, democratic and strong nation. The government also needs to be more democratic, collective and with a single programme, in communicating the truths about the need for reform and for change to the larger population.
It is necessary to communicate so that they understand them to be part of the process of national integration and unification of nationalities in the country. This should be taken to the hearts and minds cleaning and eradicating racism and chauvinism in the aftermath of decades of war and conflict.
The US departure from the UNHRC exposes the fallacy spread by Sinhala racists that the US is behind the UN human rights campaign and it is the western conspiracy against the developing world. On the contrary, the US was against the democracy and human rights campaign continued by the left and workers movement in the developed world.
This act of Donald Trump may weaken that global institution, but the rise of the left and workers power will support Lankas commitment to ensure the protection of human rights and achieve reconciliation within our own country. Clearly, this is for the good of all Lankan people and certainly, not in any way giving in to the international powers.
The US action should not be seen as leading to a lessening of international attention on Lanka. On the other hand, we must defeat racist who sees this as an opportunity for either this government or future governments to evade engaging in the reforms that would bring a political solution to the national problem and make national reconciliation a reality.

GMOA gunning for NBTS acting Director
The government medical officers attached to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) will strike from today, the Government Medical Officers Association said yesterday.
GMOA representative Dr. Danushka Devapriya said trade union action will begin today and will continue until the weekend lest the government fails to address the issues raised by them.
The GMOA demands that the current Acting Director NBTS Dr. Rukshan Bellana be removed from his post due to a series of issues relating to his administrative decisions. The national blood transfusion service will undergo serious disruptions if the issues are not immediately addressed, GMOA warns.
Medical officers attached to the National Blood Center, Narahenpita will cease work today, which will affect administrative activities of the institute including planning, teaching and quality sections. In-house donations at the Narahenpita National Blood Center will also cease.
An NBTS source responding to the Daily News said that the main reason which led them to take trade union action is relating to a disagreement between them and the Head of the Department upon a US$ 1 mn fund allocation which was received as part of foreign aid.
There are two foreign funded, Cabinet approved NBTS projects which are under the purview of Health Ministry. We are monitoring one of them, which is the Peripheral Blood Bank Upgrading Project. There is US$ 1 mn that needs to be utilized at the earliest possible, otherwise that amount will be returned to the source. The NBTS Director, quoting an expert committee, had given an instruction to purchase an HLA testing machine that is used in matching bone marrow transplants from a specific company dealer using the above mentioned US$ 1 mn . However, the same committee has issued a statement saying that such a machine is not urgent and there are other necessities that should be prioritized. It will take three or more years for Sri Lanka to begin allogeneic bone marrow transplants. There are more urgent needs that we should deal with. For example, an HLA testing machine for kidney transplant is of extreme importance at the moment. The NBTS source pointed out.
The source alleged that there had been several discrepancies pertaining to purchases and tender procedures of which the acting Director should be held responsible. The source also alleged that some medical officers were harassed by the Acting Director.
We held a series of discussions with the Health Ministry relating to these matters. We arrived on some agreements as well. They agreed to conduct an inquiry with regards to several charges against the acting Director and to stop any procurement until the inquiries are done. They also agreed to temporarily remove the acting Director from his post until inquiries are carried out. However, that was not done. We are compelled to take trade union action because of this reason. the NBTS source said.
Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa said the Ministrys investigation division has already begun a probe into this issue. Sugathadasa expressed confidence that the trade union action will only be a token strike.
Sugathadasa said that there are several parties involved in the matter who express their own versions. The two main parties involved in the matter give out different reasons.There are some officers who speak to the media while an investigation is on. It is an act of indiscipline and we will take disciplinary action against such statements, Sugathadasa said.
Acting NBTS Director Dr. Rukshan Bellana said he had given his fullest support to all inquiries conducted against him and willingly submitted all documents to the inquiring officers. I requested for an inquiry to clear my name, Dr. Bellana said.

Heroin worth Rs.1,248 mn seized
The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) seized 103.9 kilogrammes of heroin worth Rs.1,248 million on Saturday night in one of the departments biggest drug busts ever.
The Police were also able to arrest two suspects with the drugs.
Acting on a tip off, PNB officers found 33.3 kilogrammes of heroin concealed in a jeep at Prathibimbarama Lane in Kalubowila. The heroin was packed inside 30 parcels and the two suspects were arrested with the jeep.
Gas cylinders used to transport heroin.
Upon further questioning, the PNB was able to raid a three storey house at Subhoythipura, Battaramulla and was able to seize 70.5 kilogrammes of heroin concealed in 66 parcels.
PNB officials had also found two cut and opened gas cylinders used to transport heroin, three mobile phones and two electronic scales used to weigh the drugs.
The PNB was able to seize 96 parcels of heroin weighing 103.9 kilogrammes during the two raids conducted.
Speaking to the Daily News, a Police Media Division official said that this drug bust was the largest in the country for 2018.
Further investigations found out that the raided house was rented for a monthly sum of Rs.75,000 from January 2018 onwards and the Jeep was rented from a vehicle supplying company for a monthly sum of Rs.150,000.
The arrested suspects were identified as Mohomad Mahir, aged 29 and Mallikarachige Chathura Jayashantha, aged 40. Both suspects were residents of Dehiwala and were scheduled to be produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court yesterday.
Further investigations have revealed that this drug trafficking scam was led by the drug lord Susei who is currently imprisoned in the Welikada prison. Susei was arrested in 2013 with two kilogrammes of heroin and was sentence to death. The PNB had found text message conversations between Susei and Mohamad Mahir from the suspects mobile phone and the suspect had revealed the information of the trafficking upon questioning.
The Police Narcotics Bureau is conducting further investigations.
In 2016, the PNB detected over 900 kgs of cocaine from an Indian bound ship docked at the Colombo port.
This haul is the largest cocaine seizure recorded in South Asia with an estimated street value of Sri Lankan Rupees 12 billion.

Visa (NYSE: V), the Official Payment Services Partner of FIFA, released an analysis of foreign travellers spending during opening days of2018 FIFA World Cup.
The results found that in the 11 Russian host cities of the tournament, approximately one in every five (17 percent) purchases with Visa used contactless payment technology, including smart phones, bracelets and rings. In the stadiums themselves, the share of contactless payments was 54 percent, inclusive of purchases made by fans from Russia and abroad.
On average, across the 11 host cities, Visa cardholders spent3, 575 rubles (approximately $56.65) per transaction, with fans from the United States spending the most  followed by China and Mexico in second and third, respectively.
Many of the international visitors attending this summers tournament have never been to Russia before and were excited tobe providing them with the ultimate tournament experience, powered by the speed and ease of Visas digital payments, which are increasingly happening on contactless cards, devices and wearables, said Ekaterina Petelina, country manager, Visa Russia.
Spending by Host City
The five host cities that saw the highest amount of tourist spending - both in and out of stadium - were as follows:
* Moscow:1.7 billion rubles ($26.9 million)
* St. Petersburg:506 million rubles ($8 million)
* Sochi: 104 million rubles ($1.6 million)
* Kazan: 71 million rubles ($1.1 million)
* Ekaterinburg: 48 million rubles ($760,800)
The largest average individual purchases were seen in the following categories:
* Luxury goods: 23,000 rubles ($364.55)
* Lodging: 15,000 rubles($237.75)
* Fashion: 8,000 rubles ($126.86)
Overall, a majority of purchases in host cities fell into the lodging, fashion and restaurant categories.
Luzhniki Stadium led all venues for total number of payment transactions, where fans spent 139 million rubles ($2.2 million) - of which71 million rubles ($1.12 million) came from non-Russian citizens and 68 million rubles ($1.1 million)from Russian citizens.
The opening match between Russia and Saudi Arabia on June 14 -- where fans from 123 countries filled the stadium -- saw the highest volume of payment transactions.
Additionally, Russian fans made twice the amount of transactions for food and drinks compared to non-Russian fans, however, the average per-transaction amount for non-Russian attendees was 1.5 times higher than Russian purchases in those categories.
For the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, Visa is the exclusive payment service in all stadiums where payment cards are accepted. In-stadium, fans can pay with contactless Visa credit and debit cards and mobile payment services at the more than 3,500 point-of-sale terminals and 1,000 mobile concessionaires that have been equipped with the latest in payment innovation.

Inflation in Asia Pacific region likely to reach 3.5%
Price inflation in Asia Pacific regions developing countries including Sri Lanka is projected to rise to 3.5 per cent during 2018 and 2019 compared with 3.2 per cent recorded in 2017.
This was revealed at a round table discussion held at Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies, conducted under the theme `The Economic Outlook for the Asia- Pacific and Mobilising Finance to Sustain Growth. United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP), Associate Economic Affairs officer Zhenqian Huang chaired the discussion which was moderated by Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja.
Huang said that developing Asia Pacific economies are estimated to have sustained a relatively high economic growth rate of 5.8 per cent in 2017 compared with 5.4 per cent recorded in 2016.
The recent recovery in global manufacturing investment and trade is providing a tailwind to the already steady expansion of economic output in the Asia- Pacific region, she added.
Huang also revealed that investment expenditure and trade volumes which have shown lukewarm growth in recent years also showed signs of recovery in 2017.
Supported by robust domestic demand and improved global economic prospects, developing Asia- Pacific economies are projected to grow by 5.5 per cent in both 2018 and 2019. She further said despite moderation in new trade- restrictive measures in 2017 , there is a slowdown in new trade liberalizing measures both globally and within the Asia- Pacific region.
She also said there has been an increase in non-tariff measures which are less transparent and could be more harmful and the rise in trade barriers may disrupt cross border production networks, affecting not only trade but also long term investments and productivity growth. It was also noted that damping of capital flows to the Asia Pacific region and associated financial vulnerabilities cannot be ruled out.
So far trade balances have remained mostly manageable in the region along with strong capital inflows due to the regions economic buoyancy, she added.

Japan floods: Death toll climbs to 94 after 'historic' rain and landslides

The number of people who have died in floods and landslides triggered by historic levels oftorrential rain in Japanclimbed to 94 on Monday, with the eventual death toll expected to exceed 100.
Almost 2 million people were still subject to evacuation orders, while tens of thousands of rescue workers battled mud, water and rubble to search for survivors stranded in their homes.
The heaviest rainfall seen inJapanfor decades has caused destruction over large parts of the country, particularly in the south-west, where 58 people are missing.
More than 50,000 members of the self-defense force, police officers, firefighters and coastguard personnel, aided by helicopters and paddle boats, were trying to rescue people from buildings, some of them stranded on rooftops just meters above the waterline.
On Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, said efforts to locate those still stranded had turned into a race against time.
In one of the most dramatic rescues, patients and staff  some still in their pajamas  were helped from the balcony of a hospital in the city of Kurashiki on Sunday and rowed to safety on military paddle boats.
Officials said 170 patients and staff had been evacuated from the hospital, while the public broadcaster NHK later said about 80 people were still stranded.
Im really grateful to the rescuers, said Shigeyuki Asano, a 79-year-old patient who spent a night without electricity or water. I feel so relieved that Ive been freed from such a bad-smelling, dark place.
TV footage from across the affected region showed rivers that had burst their banks, submerged vehicles and houses destroyed by landslides.
The rains are the worstweather-related disaster in Japansince two typhoons struck in quick succession in August and September 2011, killing nearly 100 people. The death toll is higher than that seen in 2014, when more than 70 people died in landslides caused by torrential rain in Hiroshima.
By Monday morning, the rain had eased off in the worst-affected areas, with soaring temperatures presenting a new health risk to people left without water and electricity.
We cannot take baths, the toilet doesnt work and our food stockpile is running low, said Yumeko Matsui, whose home has been without water since Saturday.
Kaori Ito, the mayor of Kurashiki, said thousands of evacuees were in desperate need of clothes. Nobody has anything to wear. We need shirts, trousers, underwear, socks and even shoes, Ito told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
More than 30,000 people were staying at emergency shelters on Sunday afternoon, while authorities vowed to quickly rehouse displaced people in private accommodation or public housing.
Japans meteorological agency described the situation as one of extreme danger and warned of further landslides, even as the water recedes.
Younger victims included two sisters who attended a primary school with just six pupils on the sparsely populated island of Nuwa. The disaster happened so suddenly, I am struggling to come to terms with it, the schools principal said. In Hiroshima Prefecture, rescue workers found the body of a three-year-old girl whose home had been hit by a landslide.
The disaster has affected manufacturers with plants in westernJapan. The carmakers Mazda and Daihatsu said they had suspended operations at factories in three prefectures because they were unable to procure parts.

However, Ranga literally blew up and shot an uncharacteristic final round 77 to slip to 4th place at six under par well behind the winner Indika who shot a final round 68 to consolidate a total of 11 under for the tournament to win from Sisira Kumara and Sanjeewa joint runners up at eight under par.
The two professionals playing alongside the amateurs as a form sharpener in preparation for the Asian Games, underlined their experience and class with Thangaraja firing a flawless 64, seven under par final round to be 19 under par for the four rounds. Mithun Perera continued his consistency returning a final round 69, to finish on 276, eight under for the four rounds.
Youngster and captain of the Sri Lanka Junior team for the International Junior Championship last year, J K Januka Dilshan fired a stunning 65, six under par, final round to finish on 285, one over for the tournament in joint 6th place.
The standard of golf was exceptional with the course in a state of repair for the better. The consistency of the amateur golfers keep rising up the World Amateur Golf Rankings making Sri Lanka proud, with the excellent scores returned, thanks to the continuous sponsorship of the Grand Prix played monthly, by UTE Engineering.

Job skills for youth with reputable frills!
The world commemorates Youth Skills Day, on Sunday July 15. The United Nations (UN) will observe the special event on the theme of Skills Development to Improve Youth Employment. Understanding what works to support young people in todays and tomorrows labour market through training and skills development will be key to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, and will be at the centre of this high-level event.
Young people are almost three times more likely to be unemployed than adults and continuously exposed to lower quality of jobs, greater labour market inequalities and longer and more insecure school-to-work transitions. In addition, women are more likely to be underemployed and under-paid, and to undertake part-time jobs or work under temporary contracts.
That is why education and skills training are key determinants of success in the labour market. But unfortunately, existing systems are failing to address the learning needs of many young people and surveys of learning outcomes and skills show that a large number of youth have low levels of achievement in basic literacy and numeracy.
According to a recent International Labour Organization (ILO) publication, 73.4 million young people were estimated to be unemployed in 2015 and this figure is expected to increase in most regions by 2018. One reason for youth unemployment is structural unemployment, a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer and the skills demanded of workers by employers.
Much has been written on the importance of skills regarding the requirements of the current and future labour market. Trend reports, vocational guides the search for a job and/or the development of ones professional career necessarily include improving skills and abilities as a key element in personal branding.
Following the recognition in 2014 by the UN many international and regional organisations, will assist in raising awareness on promoting skills as a means to address the challenges of unemployment and under employment. There are more youth on the planet than ever before. These young people are poised with all of the potential and energy to be our next generation of leaders, workers and parents. Fostering the acquisition of skills by youth will enhance their ability to make informed choices with regard to life and work and empower them to gain access to changing labour markets and viable employment opportunities.
While many of todays youth inhabit a world of unlimited opportunity and possibility, millions more are being left out. Globally, the youth unemployment rate is almost three times higher than the rate for adults. Basically speaking these youth are stuck  left at a crossroads with little opportunity to reach their full potential due to a lack of employment opportunities and a lack of education and basic skills. Unfortunately, with few choices, many youth are vulnerable to a life of poverty or violence.
There is also a need to internalise the realisation that vocational and technical training is as important as tertiary education. The dynamics of the global economy and the needs of companies, have led to increased demand for professionals with specific expertise and skills that are not necessarily available at traditional universities. Many industries and fields are looking for people with specific skills to solve problems in a practical, simple and pragmatic manner.
Long before World Youth Skills Day was inaugurated there were eminent trailblazing legends in our own nation who left behind a legacy of addressing such burning issues. I am referring to people such as the late Lorna Wright, a free-lance woman journalist, broadcaster and social worker who assisted the marginalized to embark on small scale and viable economic ventures. She emphasized the need to identify and harness the innate talents and skills of the rural and suburban poor and the need to work within the cultural, economic and social constraints of their environment.
Lorna Wright deplored the fact that for thousands of youth the chances of participating in the development of the nation had been lost because of the lack of opportunities to further their educational skills and also because of the woeful system of our education. Lorna was quick to highlight the heartbreak of these underprivileged youth who had received little or no formal education or opportunities that were essential to enter a dignified occupation and enjoy a reasonably satisfying livelihood.
She always demonstrated an enthusiastic interest in both womens and youth affairs by providing them with guidance and opportunities to break out of their poverty-stricken world. She was resolute in offering them the necessary skills and determination to step into a brighter future. Lorna came up with the innovative concept of the Ath-Udauwwa programme with the focus on training youth in basic hands-on skills which included masonry, carpentry, welding and plumbing among other such occupations. As an incentive to instil in them the dignity of honest labour they were provided with certificates and uniforms as a mark of prestige (thathweya).
Lorna possessed Australian citizenship, but was granted a permanent resident visa for Sri Lanka by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. And so she returned to become the recipient of several international awards including the SAARC Awards for Women of Excellence and the Zonta Award. In 2004 she was conferred the Order of Australia, the countrys highest honour in the Queens Birthday Honours list. The award was bestowed on her in recognition of her service to international relations through social welfare activities in Sri Lanka particularly through the Memory of Mother Foundation (MOM).
She deservingly received international awards in recognition of her noble activities, but lamentably in the land of her birth Lorna Wright remains without any official state acknowledgement. Yet at her funeral one witnessed long lines of people waiting to express their condolences and among them the tear-streaked faces of hundreds of mourners.
Lorna was aware that there was for her a special place in the hearts of the thousands of people whose lives she had touched in a meaningful way by her gracious patronage. They paid the founder of MOM the greatest tribute by conferring her with the matchless and most reverential title of them all. They called her Amma.

Katherine Mansfield Would Approve
On Katherine Mansfields birthday, I walked up the edge of a long driveway in gale-force winds. I walked for a long time, with cars passing me. The windthe wind. I was walking to Government House, which is at the top of a hill, where there would be a party. Katherine Mansfield was 125 years old today.
The driveway to Government House has bushes and trees on either side, and these were beaten and pushed about by the wind. I thought about turning around and just going home, but that would mean walking past the guard at the entrance again. Every time someone drove past me, I felt more self-conscious. Finally, a hybrid car stopped, and a woman wound down the window. Are you going to the Katherine Mansfield party I was. Thats a long way, dear. Do you want to hop in
As we zoomed up the hill between the trees, we shouldve talked about the end of Mansfields story The Garden Party, in which a big dog runs by like a shadow and Laura walks down that smoky dark lane, because that driveway recalled it to us. But instead, we talked about whether wed been to Government House before. The woman had been many times. I hadnt been.
Pristine gravel
Government House, the governor-generals official residence, is an enormous brown-and-cream building with dark jarrah weatherboards and a flag tower. A rectangular pond is feathered by the wind. Cars were still creeping over the pristine gravel or were parked nearby, and the new director of the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace, a woman named Emma, was standing by the door with one of the board members and greeting people. Id met Emma at the Birthplace that morning, my final morning as the acting director.
Id shown her through the house: the tiny office stacked high with filing boxes, where the new director would sit each day; the scullery with its steel pots hung on the walls and its meat grinder, on which she, too, would bruise her leg as she went by; the dim roped-off bedroom where Mansfield was born, where a hairbrush and hand mirror were fixed with catgut to a dressing table, and where a dehumidifier now hummed and slurped.
At the end of every day, the birth-room dehumidifier was heavy with water. Now Emma would be the one to carry the bucket down the stairs and empty it in the little sink in the scullery. Id handed her my lump of keys, which opened countless cupboards and cabinets and internal doors, then wheeled my bike out from where Id parked it behind a sack of blood-and-bone in the rose garden and cycled down Tinakori Road, grinning as the wind pushed me on.
Permanent director
I got the job at the Birthplace on a whim. The previous director had left suddenly, and the board needed someone to look after the volunteers, to schedule tours, and to organize that years birthday party while a new permanent director was found. Id visited the housea square weatherboard building with a red corrugated-iron roof, built in 1887on a school trip when I was maybe nine or ten, and I knew that Mansfield, a famous writer whose story about a garden party had frightened me, had lived there until she was five years old. But I couldnt remember much beyond heavy Victorian furniture and dark drapes and walls lined with photographs of Katherine and her family.
On my first morning, I sat nervously in the cold kitchen. It was my first full-time job in a long time. The chairman of the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace Society and the four paid staff were there, all in winter coats. Ashleigh will be here five days a week, the chairman told us all firmly, and shell be in charge. She is our director for the foreseeable future. The kitchen had stained timber walls and a hefty coal range. Pretty floral plates were held in place with wire on a sideboard.
A bowl of Granny Smith apples was set on a velvet tablecloth below a single window that overlooked the back garden. I later learned that the garden had once sloped into a gully. Mansfield had complained about wretched people throwing their empty cans into it. And also in the kitchen was the replica of Mansfields dollhouse, painted spinach-green with yellow windowpanes and a red roof. Its frontage was locked, but two figures collapsed in armchairs were visible through a window. Open it quickly, someone! I knew that inside, the rooms would be papered and that in the middle of the dining-room table would be a tiny amber lamp.
Greg introduced me to Caryl, who managed the accounts, a pretty silver-haired woman with red lipstick; to Linda, whose current job was to sort all the files in the upstairs office (once a nursery) and who had a bad back and seemed to communicate mainly in rapid eye blinks and hand gestures; and to Sue, who worked only on Sundays but had made a special trip to meet me today.
Footpath
Its wonderful to have you here, she said with glistening eyes, in the grotto. Id passed her a few minutes before, as I pushed my bike on the footpath toward the house, and she had beamed at me. I knew it mustve been you, she said now. You had Katherines look about you. Sue was in her sixties, with bright-gold hair and a constant smile.

Lanka hold Lithuania to goalless draw
The first football match between Sri Lanka and Lithuania ended in a goalless draw in the friendly international tournament played at Racecourse yesterday.
Sri Lanka kicked off the match and in the first half the team from Europe Lithuania played very slow game. Sri Lanka were more concerned on the defensive side and also made some passing errors during the first half.
In the second half Lithuanian started their campaign with their forwards and attempted a goal attack but were foiled by the Sri Lankan heavy defense that spoiled all Lithuanian attempts.
Speaking to media head coach of Sri Lanka Pakeer Ali said: Our team played well defensively especially when facing such a strong team like Lithuania. Its a good opportunity for them to upgrade themselves.
This same team will be touring Japan tomorrow for another international tournament and our B team will battle out with Lithuanian in their second match. Sri Lankas last international outing was their participation at the inaugural AFC Solidarity Cup held in Malaysia in November 2016.

I feel like I am hitting the ball really well and getting into the groove
Mathews rearing to go against Proteas
Having missed a major portion of the three-Test series against West Indies in the Caribbean, former Test captain Angelo Mathews is keen to prove his worth as a senior statesman of the Sri Lanka team in the upcoming two-Test series against South Africa starting at Galle on July 12.
Mathews was one of four Sri Lankan batsmen included in the Board XI side to gain valuable practice ahead of the Test series and he made the most of it by scoring a brilliant 92 off 124 balls in the two-day warm-up match against South Africa at P Sara Oval.
I felt really good I was hitting the ball really well and the wicket was also good. The confidence is pretty high obviously when you score runs against a top quality team like South Africa, said Mathews. I feel like I am hitting the ball really well and getting into the groove.
Mathews hit 13 fours and three sixes and spent over three hours in the middle taking on the pace of Philander, Steyn, Rabada, Ngidi and the spin of Shamsi (who took five wickets) and Von Berg.
Mathews is of the opinion if Sri Lanka plays to its potential there is nothing to stop them from beating South Africa.
South Africa has played extremely good cricket at home and away over the past couple of years so its not surprising that they are no 2. A couple of years ago in 2016 we beat the no. 1 ranked team Australia 3-0 here so it is an opportunity for us to once again showcase and beat a very strong South African team and try and win the series at home, said Mathews.
Usually the spinners bowl quite a lot in hot and humid conditions the wicket will break very soon. But you need to score runs as well.
It will be tough test for both teams. We just need to try a way to score as much runs as possible.
They have got good fast bowlers as well as spinners as we saw yesterday (Saturday). There will be effective reverse swing coming to play here in the subcontinent. Its all about trying to score runs. Both departments can win you matches, he said.
PLAYING THE ROLE OF SENIOR BATSMAN
Being the senior batsman of the Test side Mathews said he had a role to play.
Even though I am not the Test captain I am still leading the ODI and T20 sides. As seniors we are leaders in the team regardless of being a captain or not. We have to lead by example and rally the youngsters around and try and guide them. That is our job at hand and at the same time our performances also matters, we have to deliver, said Mathews.
The former Test captain is trying to come out of a frustrating year and a half through injuries.
Ive done my very best to do everything possible to stay out of injuries but sometimes you just cant control it. I am doing the best I can. I am getting all the expert advice and working with them. Sri Lanka Cricket has also been very helpful providing all the necessary resources to me, explained Mathews.
One thing that the experts have told me is to have a good long break because Ive played such a lot of cricket in the past four years and it has taken its toll. I cant put it down to zero percent all I can do is manage my injuries and work load and do the things that I have been doing in the past 3-4 months to manage it.
The majority of Mathews injury tends to stem from his lower limbs.
When I was playing for my school also I had lower limb injuries. Its just that the experts dont have a concrete answer for that. What they say is the work load can also take a toll on the body. Keeping up with the rehab is very difficult to do while you are playing because you can overstrain yourself. Youve just got to have a balance in everything you do. Have to manage and balance your workload. Its all about how you feel. I know a little bit of my body since I am into my thirties now. Still I may makes mistakes my problem is that I sometimes over train.
LEAVING CARIBBEAN INCIDENTS BEHIND AND STARTING AFRESH
Mathews praised the efforts of the Sri Lanka team to make a comeback from being 0-1 down and draw the three-Test series one-all by winning the third Test without him, Dimuth Karunaratne and skipper Dinesh Chandimal who form the core of the batting.
It was a fantastic effort in the midst of so many other distractions. To pull that game off was a brilliant effort by the whole team. Suranga (Lakmal) was outstanding he got the backing of the players and they rallied around him. When something like that happens obviously the players will get together to fight for each other. Thats what they showed on the field, said Mathews.
It was an unfortunate incident that rallied the team around. But we dont need that kind of things to happen to rally around we always go into a game helping and supporting each other.
Those little sparks will obviously spark life in the team unfortunately it was not a very good incident for us. We like to leave that behind because we are starting a fresh series and just play the way we did in the last test against West Indies.

Mind-bending food illusions
Things are not what they seem on the plates of Chef Ben Churchill. His food art is an ongoing series of optical illusions that conceal delicious desserts under the guise that theyre inanimate objects or completely different dishes.
Churchill is a master at forming his pannacotta, sponge cakes, and jellies to mimic the size and shape of what hes trying to imitate; they look so convincing that you only realize theyre sweet treats once you dig in.
Churchill has been a chef for over 10 years, but its only been over the last two years that hes tried making pastries.
I decided to learn the basics, he explained, but decided to move into mimetic food, just to see what could be done. This gave me the bug to start teaching myself more and more.
He allows inspiration to come from anywhere, which has resulted in unexpected creations like pannacotta cigarettes in an ashtray and a cleaning sponge complete with suds or rather a sweet milk foam. My Modern Met

National Audit Bill restricts Auditor General - JVP
The National Audit Bill passed in Parliament last week does not have the features to empower the Auditor General, his staff and the National Audit Commission, the JVP said yesterday.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said the original Audit bill that was drafted by the Auditor Generals staff and amendments had been done on several occasions at Cabinet and in Parliament as well. He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) head office in Pelawatte, Battaramulla.
He said a flaw in the National Audit Bill is that the Auditor General cannot audit the Internal Audit reports of Corporations, Boards and other such institutions.
On the other hand if a surcharge is imposed on an officer found guilty by the Auditor General, it would be implemented by the Secretary of the Ministry to which the officer is attached, MP Handunnetti said. The Ministry Secretary is vested with power to hold a disciplinary inquiry and take a decision in that connection. If a Secretary had done an offence it is the President who had to take action.
MP Handunnetti said that however this measure has been taken to protect the Ministry Secretaries who implement Ministers orders. He also said that the maximum fine against those officers found guilty was Rs 5,000 as amended by the government and it was increased to 25,000 on the JVPs insistence.
Handunnetti said the government was not willing to take most of the amendments made by the JVP. The Bill that was passed also contradicts some of the rights guaranteed by the Right to Information Act, MP Handunnetti said. Auditor General cannot publicize the reports that he expects to take legal action against and it breaches the rights guaranteed by the Right To Information Act.
He added that however it was not the Bill that the public needed.

New Workforce Competitiveness Initiatives from TSC
Private Sector Tourism Committee (TSC) unveiled the Tourism Workforce Competitiveness Roadmap, which aims to combat a growing employment deficit in Sri Lankas fast-growing tourism sector recently.
TSC estimates that every year, 25,0000 to 30,000 new employees will be needed to accommodate for the growing number of visitors to Sri Lanka, but each year only 10,000 people are trained to work in tourism.
Created by international tourism experts James MacGregor and Srilal Miththapal, the Roadmap will mobilize the private sector in an effort attract more Sri Lankans to careers in the industry and cultivate higher quality hospitality around the country.
Malik Fernando, Managing Director at MJF Group, Dilmah Tea, talked through the Roadmap, which is a multi-step solution focusing on training, outreach, and support. Fernando called the initiative the most targeted action plan in the history of tourism.
Reed Aeschlimen, Mission Director at United States Agency for International Development (USAID) spoke at the launch event, recounting 70 years of bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and the United States in a wide array of industries.
Today, we appear in support of the private sector, a growing, vibrant sector here in Sri Lanka, with some of the nations most innovative and socially responsible companies, he said.
Aeschlimen praised the initiative for its comprehensiveness and detail. This roadmap demonstrates the kind of vision, leadership, and cooperation from the private sector that is needed to ensure Sri Lanka gets the most from its incredibly talented young women and men, he said.
To address the employment deficit, the TSC will develop intensive, specialized training modules allowing new employees to join the workforce quickly. The committee also intends to update Sri Lankas tourism education to better align with global standards.
As a long-term solution, the TSC will work to expose Sri Lankans to the tourism industry earlier in life through career counselors, boot-camps, and internship programs. They also hope to recruit young employees with a job-listings mobile app specifically for the tourism sector. The committee intends for Sri Lankas youth to better understand the diversity of career opportunities in the industry and the potential for fulfilling, well-compensated work. The committee also highlighted the shortage of women in the industry. In Sri Lanka, only 10% of the tourism workforce is comprised of women, in comparison to the global average of 65%.
TSC expressed a commitment to researching and implementing ways to create a friendlier work environment for women, such as safe transport and affordable childcare.
The Roadmap is supported by the Technical and Vocational Education Commission of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training & Kandyan Heritage; the Sri Lanka Institute for Tourism and Hotel Management; the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and YouLead, a $12million project funded by USAID.

PMs Office Initiates Weekly Cultural Show At Arcade
Broadening the horizons of Colombos public entertainment sphere, the Tri-forces and the National Youth Services Council (NYSC) have started a weekly cultural show at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo.
The project, initiated by the Prime Ministers Office, is supported by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). It is also in line with the Tourism Strategic Plans (2017-2020) recommendation to expand entertainment opportunities for tourists and locals visiting the Colombo city.
The Cultural show starting at 7 pm every Friday includes musical performance by military and NYSC bands, dancing items and other entertainment. The Prime Ministers Office said the public could witness the show free of charge.
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister and Prime Ministers Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, commenting on the initiative, said it was only a start and the concept would be further developed based on feedback from the public.
There has been a highly positive response from the public so far. Those who witnessed the show last Friday were excited by the idea and considered it a fresh start. But, we want to add more colourful cultural elements to the show as we move along, the Minister said.
He also added this would familiarize tourists and locals with the cultural roots of the country.
We, as Sri Lankans, have a rich cultural heritage and a knack for good music and entertainment. From a tourism perspective, this offers a glimpse of our colourful life. At the same time, it gives an entertainment for those who gather around Independence Square on Fridays just to unwind, the Minister added.
The project is coordinated by Major General Mihindu Kulasuriya, Coordinating Advisor to the Prime Ministers Office.
The initiative will be carried out without disrupting the current setting of Arcade and the Independence Square. Thats why we have planned it as a one hour show without much fanfare and decoration. What we need is the quality, not the noise or frills, Kulasuriya added.
He said the organizers were looking at the possibility of having the cultural show at different locations of the Colombo city, allowing more people to engage with the programme.

PM calls for increased Forex earnings to overcome debt trap
An export economy should be established in other parts of the country as well by taking a cue from Biyagama. The country desperately needs to increase foreign exchange earnings in order to overcome the present debt trap, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after opening the new three storeyed building of the Biyagama Divisional Secretariat at Makola, Sapugaskanda on July 6.
The Prime Minister said that at the time the Government assumed office, the countrys economy was in such a parlous state that it was insufficient to service the enormous debts owed by the country. The government had been able to change this situation by doggedly facing challenges on its path.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe recalled that when he took over the Biyagama electorate as the Chief Organizer, it was the smallest and most underdeveloped electorate in the region. Its total number of votes was around 44,000 with only about 36,000 of them casting their votes at the election.
Cadjan huts were conspicuous in the area although the petroleum refinery was situated in the electorate. People were mostly engaged in the Beedi industry. There was no electricity in the area either and when he stepped into some of the houses he saw people making beedi in houses lit with kerosene lamps and as a youthful MP he was deeply shocked about the plight of the people in the area, the Premier said.
 I made a firm determination to improve the lot of those innocent people, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said he was elected as Member of Parliament for Biyagama at the subsequent election and the J.R.Jayewardene government launched the Greater Colombo Economic Commission which started the first Free Trade Zone in Katunayake.
When he requested J.R.Jayewardene to set up a second Free Trade Zone at Biyagama, he asked as to how the government could find the land for it. When he agreed to find the necessary land, J.R. Jayewardene agreed to proceed with the proposal and gave him all the support.
This was the manner in which I laid the foundation for the development of Biyagama to its present status, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that late Suranimala Rajapaksha gave him all the support for this endeavour.
The assistance rendered by Assistant Government Agents Amarasinghe and Ruparatne should also be recalled with gratitude. Today, Biyagama had become an area with an export economy disproving pessimists who predicted the FTZ to be failure, Prime Minister Wickremeainghe said.
The Biyagama FTZ alone had about 55 to 60 factories while there were about 90 factories encompassing the whole Biyagama Electorate. People also made a living by maintaining container yards. Other income avenues had also been created for people to maintain three wheelers, shops and indulge in minor vocations. All this happened due to the development undertaken centred on Biyagama, the Prime Minister added.
Makola and Spugaskanda which were small villages then had today become urban centres. The entire Biyagama region has now been urbanised owing to the development undertaken there, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said that when he subsequently assumed duties as Minister Industries, he set up the Seethawaka Trade Zone launching industrialisation on the Kelani Ganga bank centred on Ranala.
Subsequently, another FTZ was launched at Koggala. President Premadasa later launched the 200 garment factory programme. The 1977- 1994 era was a period of massive industrialisation which was not carried forward after 1994. Vietnam which only started industrialisation in 1993 has now surpassed us economically by leaps and bounds, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Yahapalana Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena which assumed power has once again decided to go in for an export economy. As such, economic development plans should be formulated for other areas by taking Biyagama as an example, the Prime Minister said.
The Governments objective was to take the country towards development under a proper plan. Plans had already been drawn up to set up the biggest Trade Zone at Millaniya, Bandaragama. Plans were underway to set up Industries in Ekala. Ja-Ela, Bingiriya and Mawathgama too. Industrial Zones would also the launched in Hambantota and Matara as well, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Today, the world has gone in for knowledge based technological industries. The government has decided to set up a Higher Education Institute of Technological Studies to facilitate this process. It will be open to Sri Lankans and foreigners who want to undergo higher technological studies, the Prime Minister said.

Policy rates to remain at current levels-CB
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its last meeting, decided to maintain policy interest rates at their current levels.
Accordingly, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) remain at 7.25 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively. The Boards decision is consistent with stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term, thereby contributing to a favourable growth outlook for the Sri Lankan economy. Headline inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), remained at low single digit levels, in spite of the transient acceleration.
According to the provisional estimates released by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the Sri Lankan economy grew by 3.2 per cent, year-on-year, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the revised annual growth rate of 3.3 per cent in 2017.
Economic growth during the first quarter of 2018 was mainly driven by the Services and Agriculture related activities while the Industry related activities recorded a moderate growth. It is envisaged that the governments continued commitment to the implementation of structural reforms will help the economy to attain its potential over the medium term, amidst fiscal consolidation.
The sustained recovery in the global economy is likely to support domestic economic growth, while the prevalence of a low inflation environment and an appropriately valued flexible exchange rate are also expected to facilitate higher growth. Interest rates remain high both in nominal and real terms, while growth in money supply decelerated.

## Title: The Radical Campuses of 1968
## Supertitle:

The Radical Campuses of 1968
Universities were the most obviously politicized sites of generational identity in the long year of 1968. Some campusesBerkeley in California, Nanterre in Paris, Essex in Britain or the Free University in Berlinbecame bywords for political radicalism. The occupation of university buildings was common and became associated with wider protests that were not directly linked to university matters. Teach-ins on matters of political significance, the Vietnam War in particular, were common. Some proposed the end of examinations or the abolition of the distinction between academics and students. In the United States, students demanded, and sometimes established for themselves, new courses on topics such as black studies. At Birmingham in England a Free University offered courses on, among other things, workers control, psychedelia and the theory and practice of counter-institutions. In London, an anti-university offered for a time courses by thinkers such as the psychologist R.D. Laing.
The growth of graduate studies fostered radicalism in universities. It created a cadre of students who remained in place for long enough to establish political movements. The Teaching Assistants Association was formed at the University of Wisconsin in 1966 to represent graduate students who earned money teaching, and soon linked the material dissatisfactions of its members to wider questions relating to race and Vietnam. The lives of graduate students were not interrupted by the inconvenient obligation to sit exams. The leisurely pace of life was captured by the jibe in John Irvings novel The World According to Garp (published in 1978 and set mainly in the 1960s) that gradual school was where students gradually realize that they do not want to go to school anymore.
Educational innovations
Graduate study expanded sharply in the 1960s. This was particularly notable in the United Statespartly because of the institutionalization of research and partly because attending graduate school became a means to avoid being sent to Vietnam. The idea of graduate education, like most American educational innovations, spread to Britain and Europe. A lawyer at the trial of student activistslargely Americans undertaking postgraduate courseswho had stormed the administrative building at London University remarked briskly that doctorates are two a penny in the United States.
Who were students against Sometimes there was a mood of bitter hostility to teachers who were seen as authoritarian or complicit in some wider power structure. Equally professors were sometimes hostile to student activists whom they saw as a threat to the qualitiesorder, tranquility, reasoned debatethat they regarded as essential to university life. Though students often denounced their enemies as fascists, their bitterest critics were often Jewish professorsAlexander Gerschenkron, Raymond Aron, Theodor Adornowho were old enough to have personal memories of Nazism.
However, the struggle in the universities was never a simple conflict of generations and never completely divided teachers from students. Some academics maintained good relations with their students in 68, or even presented themselves as neutral figures in a struggle between students and the universitythe rise of the professional academic administrator sometimes gave students and teachers a common enemy.
Political affiliations
During the occupation of Columbia University in 1968, students marked their political affiliations with various colored armbands, but members of the faculty wore white bands. Very few professors were either completely for or completely against the student protests, and some took unexpected stands. The historians Rodney Hilton and John Saville, both ex-Communists in their fifties, acted as intermediaries between protesting students and the university authorities at Birmingham and Hull. Rene Remond, a senior historian of relatively conservative views at Nanterre, later remarked that he was a soixante-huitard himself in a way because he welcomed the chance to reform his university.
Sometimes there was sympathy between student radicals and professors. The sinologist and historian of science Joseph Needham was master of one of the most conservative colleges in Cambridge but also belonged to Socialists in Higher Education, whose members sought a critical destabilization of the system. Antonio Negriborn in 1933 and a professor of sociology at Bolognawas a leader of the radical Marxist Lotta Continua. He was later prosecuted for having inspired terrorist acts by the Red Brigades, and the Italian authorities denounced him as the most prominent of the bad mastersa term that implies that some Italian students listened to their professors too assiduously.
Many academics led double lives that straddled the frontier between academic authority and student rebellion. Jonah Raskin spent some of his nights in 1968 participating in the student occupation of Columbia University but by day he commuted to Stony Brook University to teach his own classes. He was Dr. Raskin to his students, Jonah to his colleagues and Jomo to readers of his articles in the underground press.
University teachers
In any case, the expansion of higher education in the post-war period had blurred the boundaries between teachers and students. This was in part because university expansion brought an increase in the proportion of young university teachers.

Revolt against rape
* Six-year-old raped and murdered in Jaffna. It led to an uncharacteristic public outburst by the Deputy Minister whose portfolio included protecting women and children.
* Rape and murder of 18-year-old Sivaloganathan causing massive public outcry in Kilinochchi, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Jaffna. The accused allegedly filmed the gang rape. * Seya Sadewmi was a four-year-old Sri Lankan child who was abducted, raped and murdered. * Colombo High Court imposes death sentence in Kirulapone rape case on an accused who raped and killed a six-year-old girl who was said to be his niece. * 14-year-old girl gang raped in Tissamaharama. Im dyingIf I had done wrong to my family, relatives or friends, Im sorry. I love my friends and family. Letter written by a 14-year-old girl, to her parents, friends and family. This young girl took her own life, after she was gang raped by three young men -one of them was her boyfriend. The victims family found her hanging from a tree.
Rape is a subject on which this writer has worked on for a considerable period of time. One sad story related to that of a teenager raped taking lunch for his farmer father. The case dragged for years. Another was an instance in which a father stood accused of raping three of his four daughters with the knowledge of their mother, one of whom bore a child. More recently a woman who had been raped whilst also having her husband taken away missing to date, asked what crime she or others in similar circumstances has committed to be raped. She refused the concept of reparation or damages and was concerned about ensuring future generations do not have to face similar experiences as hers.
Addressing sexual and gender-based violence
Around 60% of Sri Lankan women are reported to be suffering from some form of domestic abuse, while a study of the 250 university students who had spent at least three years at universities have found that 72.2% of female respondents had faced gender-based violence during their time at universities.
The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs launched the Policy Framework and National Plan of Action (NPA) to address Sexual and Gender-based Violence with the aid of the UNDP. The NPA is the first national-level agreement that allows several ministries to work together to end VAW. Nine ministries, including the Economic Development and Employment, Education, Empowerment and Prevention, Health and Justice and Law Reform, have worked to draft plans that each of them would implement with the hope of eradicating SGBV in Sri Lanka. The NPAs goals are to guarantee violence free lives for women and children and also to create an environment of zero tolerance for gender-based violence in the country.
In her speech at the launching ceremony Chandrani Bandara, Minister of Women and Child Affairs, noted that educating the population was essential to eliminating the grave problem of SGBV, which, she said, lies largely hidden in society and is further reinforced by the culture of silence.
Incest is common but very rarely reported. The subject of violence against women has been written on ad nauseum. Each time a woman or girl child or even a boy or man is raped the impact is radioactive. Support is scarce. Relief nearly useless.
****
Empowering young women
The framework undertakes a three-pronged approach: prevention, intervention, and advocacy and formulation of policies and laws. The prevention portion of the NPA is aimed at taking action before SGBV occurs. It concentrates on curtailing the factors that lead to violence and addressing the motivating causes of SGBV. This is essentially an attempt to change the culture that condones VAW. Implementation would focus on raising awareness of SGBV, working to change peoples attitudes about the issue and educate both men and women about the deleterious effects of VAW.
A central tenet of the NPA lies in educating various at-risk populations, including groups such as children and estate workers about the issue, while also promoting positive gender relations, challenging gender stereotypes and running workshops to teach people about the existing laws and regulations that deal with SGBV.
Moreover, the ministries also plan to educate and empower young girls and women to protect themselves against SGBV, while also teaching young boys and men not to perpetrate acts of VAW.
Alternative pathway
Different groups of victims may require different options: offending by young offenders and adult offenders, intra-familial sexual abuse, sibling abuse, abuse between juveniles, child victims of abuse and adult survivors of child abuse, known and stranger assault.
The adversarial criminal justice system serves an important symbolic function in the censure and punishment of sexual assault, but in practice provides effective justice for a relatively small proportion of victims.
A starting point for use of an alternative pathway would be, first, the desire of the victim to take an alternative pathway and, second, the willingness of the offender to accept responsibility for the harm and to proceed through the restorative pathway.
Restorative justice mechanisms can be employed at various points in the process, such as pre-trial diversion from court, or pre-sentencing and also post prison.
Victims also clearly want an opportunity to share their story in an unhurried, comprehensive way in a safe and nonthreatening environment. Victims want reassurance that the violence will stop. Just as the offence has taken away their control, the criminal justice process also risks their continued disempowerment and indeed irrelevance. A process is needed that does not reinforce their victim status, and that gives them a genuine voice. Effective justice is expected to include a reduced risk of the harm being repeated. The relevant Ministries with the Law and Order agencies have to become serious if the acts of assaults on women are to be reduced. We have the means and the knowledge. Our commitment to address the issues have been poor, lethargic and ineffective.

Rugby won the day - ex DIG Hafeez Marso
(Part 2  Part 1 appeared on Saturday)
Inaction & Injustice
On the question of assault to the coach, besides the Police action, concerned individuals may want to know the action taken by the authorities against the culprit. Let us make the point very clear that the Police acted merely on a penal offence on receipt of the complaint lodged by the victim coach; whereas constituting disciplinary action against the wrongdoer is a matter for the organisers to look into. Reportedly, an official is supposed to have made a remark that framing charges against culprit is not possible because the incident had taken place after the match. This seems ironic, if at all such an utterance is made. In that case, arguably no person can be taken to task if that person assaults an official or a player after the match within the playing enclosure or inside the venue. Incidentally, the assault is reported have taken place a few minutes after the match inside the venue. Consequence of inaction is bound to invite more complications at a time rugby has its hands full. It is therefore incumbent upon the school authorities to get a clarification on this matter to clear the air.
On the legal proceedings, the Police on order of the Magistrate will initially refer this case to the Mediation Board and it will be taken back to Courts for hearing only if the parties fail to come to a settlement; and the legal process, if it is to proceed till the end, takes a long time and everything will be forgotten by then. More so, a penal offence has to be proved beyond any reasonable doubt in a Court of law; whereas in a disciplinary inquiry, the charges have to be proved on balance of probabilities and thus make things all that difficult to punish the offender. Against this backdrop, it would be prudent for the authorities to act swiftly having cleared the matter and not let the culprit to be at -large; else this would remind us of the legal jargon - Justice delayed, Justice denied.
Implications, Obligations & Disciplinary Control
Many of us wouldnt have realised the consequences that otherwise may have caused, if not for the timely intervention of the Hon. Minister. The question remains as to why the authorities leave room to compel the Minister to intervene to trivial matters that could have been sorted out within a system that is well documented. Right thinking lawmakers would like the sports bodies to operate independently and so do the Minister who categorically made such revelations at a recent meeting with the SLR. Sports administrators are suppose to guide and advice the Minister to make his job easy; but it is sad to note that the even the former Minister had to intervene to settle issues between the two parties. Good relationship, understanding and respecting each other is the only way to iron out the differences to get along with the business.
Be as it may, let us come back to the interesting point. What happens had the SLR kept silent and allowed the situation to grow perceiving that the issue in school rugby is none of their business given the strain relationship between the SLR (Sri Lanka Rugby) and SLSRFA which is no secret Obviously, the SLR as the chief custodian of the game of rugby football had its obligation by its Constitution, the World Rugby Regulation and more so, the Sports Law to act precisely and promptly, which they did by reporting the issue in schools rugby to Hon. Minister when things did not work within the system; these obligations and responsibilities do not stop at that, it goes down the line for all the other stakeholders to follow suit constitutionally.
Then again, imagine the problems that may have arisen had the referees boycott the matches of the three schools whose players or supporters alleged to have misbehaved castigating the referees. Werent there any understanding between the SLSRFA and the Referees Society to sort out the matter without leaving room for the Hon. Minister intervenes Did the disciplinary authorities take action over the conduct of the individuals of those schools who supposed to have meddled with the referees Was the inaction on the part of disciplinary authorities led the referees to contemplate a stand - off All these questions beg answers. In a worst case scenario where would the matter end up What would have been the repercussions Can anyone of us fathom the depth of the worsening situation
Averting a situation is not appreciated or talked about; tendency is that the magnitude of the crisis is realised only after it breaks out; then comes in abundance all sorts of criticisms and advices. Agitation is not the answer to solving a problem in any sports; instead the tournament has to go on with mechanisms in place to deal with the offenders. Disciplinary Control is the key factor to overcome the issues and it has to be equally applied to all for the mere fact that there had been instances where the real offender responsible to the root cause of the incident gets scot-free, whereas the person who reacts or commits himself for others wrongful action only gets punished. There is no provision in the laws of rugby for immunity and as we see this notion is being misinterpreted by some. These are some of the grey - areas that needs to be addressed and the responses to those are presented in the proposed document handed over to the Hon. Minister and it is up to the authorities to mean business if they are so desirous to find the answers.
In a nutshell, what the authorities need to take cognisance is that majority of the issues that are experienced can be resolved by the application of stringent regulatory tools. The World Rugby Regulation Nos. 17 (Discipline & Foul Play), 18 (Disciplinary & Judicial Matters) and 20 (Misconduct & Code of Conduct) has provisions to deal with. Considering the importance and significance of discipline, for the first time such provisions were incorporated to the new Constitution of the SLR at Articles 42-45 and 49 under Disciplinary Procedures and Code of Conduct, respectively. Looking back at the situations faced, this would be an ideal opportunity for all the affiliates to familiarise these provisions relating to disciplinary matters to have some understanding and knowledge of the subject to be able to have proper checks and balances of their own. In this respect, the Technical Committee of the SLR has a bigger role to play in straightening out things when it really matters and there again the responsibilities of this Committees enshrined at Article 38 (3) of the said SLR Constitution. It is to be noted that the regulations published in the extraordinary gazette notification of November 2016 under the powers vested on the Minister of Sports has made it mandatory for all the National Sports Bodies to form such Technical Committees.
Compartmentalization
It seems apparent that a few stakeholders may have had the idea of running the tournament uninterrupted but strangely failed to forecast or foresee the challenges ahead of them and eventualities that may come as the tournament progress despite experiencing similar situations in the years gone by. Prognosis develops with knowledge, experience and intellect. Core issues that can affect the conduct of the tournament have been repeatedly emphasised and discussed at length but nothing meaningful has been forthcoming. Now the time is ripe with lessons learnt to get rid of these issues for the betterment of the future. No stakeholders can work in compartments within themselves isolating the parent body whose guidance and advice would also be essential to conduct their affairs.
Petty politics and monopoly has to be cleansed in to; issues between or among the stakeholders should not be a hindrance to the progress. Most importantly, everyones intentions should be to contribute to the national interest whilst giving priority to their responsibilities and objectives.
The SLR also needs to bring more light and appraisement to achieve its vision and objects working in cohesion with the parties concern. So lets everyone get together and work for the well - being of rugby concluded Marso.

Russias fairytale World Cup run ends in tears
MOSCOW, Saturday - The impassioned shouts of Ros-si-ya died away on the streets and tears filled the stadium as Russia bowed out of their home World Cup in the cruellest fashion: on penalties.
The men in red exceeded the wildest expectations by coming within a penalty kick and a save against Croatia of making it into the semi-finals for the first time since 1966.
They lost the quarter-final shootout 4-3 after extra-time ended with the sides deadlocked at 2-2 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
It was that close -- and it all ended just as the nation was starting to believe.
We leave the tournament with tears in our eyes but our heads held high, the team tweeted as the stadium emptied of the 45,000 or so who had lost their voices cheering them on.
They had reason to be proud.
Russia were the lowest-ranked team entering the tournament and many in the sceptical media thought they would be lucky to win a game.
They trudged off the pitch after making it to the quarter-final for the first time in 48 years.
A semi-final was within grasp and the loss stung.
But the Russian team showed heart and won what seemed like the entire nation's gratitude.
The champions of our hearts, the popular Sport Express daily said in a headline.
Then it paid them the highest compliment possible by declaring: Russia knows how to play football.
Fans who had been dancing in the streets after a heart-pounding shootout win over 2010 champions Spain in the last 16 last Sunday were gloomy but grateful.
The nation was mourning on Saturday -- but also paying its respects.
Chants of Mo-lod-tsy -- an almost untranslatable word of praise and thanks that roughly means Good job, guys -- echoed across the dark streets of Moscow and other cities.
What can I say It's a pity we are out of this tournament but I am very proud of my team, said Muscovite Alexander Khramoichenkov.
I'm very proud of Russia, the 34-year-old said.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called the team's performance magnificent after the watching the game from a VIP box with Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. He came down into the players locker room and suggested that Russian football would never be its disappointing old self again.
We will simply have a different type of football after this, he said. I am absolutely certain of this.
But coach Stanislav Cherchesov -- his moustache becoming the unofficial symbol of Russia's Cinderella waltz through the tournament -- seemed visibly distraught.
I am still not myself yet, he admitted after listening to a press conference question and then being unable to say a word.
Midfielder Roman Zobnin sounded very similar moments after he walked off the pitch.
I have no emotions left. I left them all out there, he said with difficulty.
I feel empty inside.

South African batsmen warm up for first Test
South African captain Faf du Plessis, senior batsman Hashim Amla and middle order bat Temba Bavuma struck half-centuries apiece as they warmed up for the two-Test series against Sri Lanka commencing at Galle on July 12.
The two-day warm-up match played at P Sara Oval ended in a draw with South Africans replying to the Board XIs first innings total of 287 scoring 338 tumbling from a strong position of 223-3 at one stage.
Missing out on runs on the placid track were South Africas opener Aiden Markram who was dismissed for a first ball duck by Lahiru Gamage and lower middle order batters Quinton de Kock and Theunis de Bruyn.
Du Plessis was most convincing against the Board XI spinners using his feet confidently to hit 13 fours and a six in his 95-ball knock of 79.
Earlier Amla struck 11 fours before retiring on 78 and having figured in a partnership of 77 with Bavuma whose half century off 103 balls comprised six fours and a six.
Spinners Wanindu Hasaranga and Test cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva caused some concern among the South African batting ranks capturing five wickets between them.

Sri Lanka should rebrand as a start-up nation-SLASSCOM
Sri Lanka should rebrand as a start-up nation, through the implementation of policy reforms to facilitate a more start-up friendly culture, said newly appointed Sri Lanka Association of Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Chairman, Jeevan Gnanam after their AGM.
By this move small tech and fintech companies will be encouraged and incentivized to experiment in a sandbox environment, while encouraging innovations like crowd funding to drive micro investments into the sector, he said.
Gnanam said that he has an ambitious vision to rapidly grow the countrys IT industry to Rs. 5 billion by 2022 and called for greater utilization of existing and future Free-Trade Agreements (FTA) to build bridges and deepen regional integration between public and private sectors.
Similarly, he also called for greater regional integration within Sri Lanka by encouraging local companies to set up satellite operations in Tier 2 cities or towns like Negombo and Ja-ela while also exploring the possibility of selective skilled employment migration.
There must of course be clear and defined policies to ensure that such processes occur without disadvantaging local talent, but we also need to ensure that we are open to new, global thinking. If managed correctly, I am confident that we can strike an optimal balance that will power this industry and the economy forward, Gnanam asserted.
Moving forward, he called for the industry to rally around a 5-point agenda focused around developing local capacity for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, building a culture of innovation across the industry, economy and society, supporting start-ups, the promotion of regional integration internationally and locally, and the commencement of selective skilled employment immigration programmes in order to facilitate invaluable knowledge transfers.
I am confident that the industry target to Rs. 5 billion can be achieved by 2022, he said.

Sri Lankan all-rounder gets a new deal in T20 Blast
The T20 Blast is England is considered as one of the most popular T20 leagues across the cricketing world.
The 2018 edition of the tournament is expected to live up to all the hype and buzz that it has managed to generate thus far.
In the lead up to the season, the teams have started signing up their overseas recruits.
In a recent update, veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder Thisara Perera has bagged a deal in the competition.
Thisara Perera, who is a globe trotter in the world of T20 cricket, had a stint with the Gloucestershire side in the previous County season.
This season, he has again been signed by the Gloucs for a couple of matches in the T20 Blast.
Thisara Perera will be playing as a cover for Australian all-rounder Andrew Tye. Tye will miss out on some part of the competition owing to his national duties.
He is currently in Zimbabwe with the Australian side.
The Chief Executive of the Gloucestershire side is happy to have Thisara on-board in the meantime as an ideal cover.
Having a player of Thisaras quality join the club is a huge coup for Gloucestershire, Chief executive Will Brown quoted as per the quotes in BBC.
AUSSIE VETERAN RETAINS HIS PLACE TOO
Meanwhile, veteran Australian cricketer Michael Klinger is set to feature for the Gloucs yet again this year.
Klinger had taken a break from cricket towards the end of 2017 after his wife, Cindy, was diagnosed with cancer.
Recently, speaking to the BBC Radio Bristol, Klinger gave an update on the health condition of his wife and remarked that she is recovering very well.
Shes doing really well. Shes had a tough five or six months going through chemotherapy and needs some ongoing treatment going forward, but shes improved a lot from where she was six months ago, Michael Klinger remarked.
We got some really positive results six weeks ago and, once we got that, we made the decision for me to come over here and play, because that was in doubt up until then, the 38 year old veteran cricketer added further.

Thomas Bayes and the crisis in science
We are living in new Bayesian age. Applications of Bayesian probability are taking over our lives. Doctors, lawyers, engineers and financiers use computerized Bayesian networks to aid their decision-making. Psychologists and neuroscientists explore the Bayesian workings of our brains. Statisticians increasingly rely on Bayesian logic. Even our email spam filters work on Bayesian principles.
It was not always thus. For most of the two and a half centuries since the Reverend Thomas Bayes first made his pioneering contributions to probability theory, his ideas were side-lined. The high priests of statistical thinking condemned them as dangerously subjective and Bayesian theorists were regarded as little better than cranks. It is only over the past couple of decades that the tide has turned. What tradition long dismissed as unhealthy speculation is now generally regarded as sound judgement.
We know little about Thomas Bayess personal life. He was born in 1701 into a well-to-do dissenting family. He entered the Presbyterian ministry after studying logic and theology at Edinburgh and lived in Tunbridge Wells for most of his adult life. Much of his energy seems to have been devoted to intellectual matters. He published two papers during his lifetime, one on theology, and the other a defence of Newtons calculus against Bishop Berkeleys criticisms. The latter impressed his contemporaries enough to win him election to the Royal Society.
Probability theory
The work for which he is best known, however, was published posthumously. Bayes died in 1761, but for some time up to his death he had been working on a paper entitled An Essay towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances. His work was passed on to his friend Richard Price, who arranged for it to be presented to the Royal Society in 1763. Bayess essay marks a breakthrough in thinking about probability.
Probability theory was in its infancy in Bayess day. Strange as it may seem, before the seventeenth century nobody could calculate even such simple chances as that of a normal coin landing five heads in a row. It wasnt that the information wouldnt have been useful. There was plenty of gambling before modernity. But somehow no one could get their head around probabilities. As Ian Hacking put in his groundbreaking The Emergence of Probability (1975), someone in ancient Rome with only the most modest knowledge of probability mathematics could have won himself the whole of Gaul in a week.
By Bayess time, the rudiments of probability had finally been forged. Books such as Abraham de Moivres The Doctrine of Chances (1718) explained the basic principles. They showed how to calculate the probability of five heads on a normal coin (it is 1/32) and indeed more complex probabilities like five heads on a coin biased 75 per cent in favour of heads (that would be 243/1024  about ). At last it was possible for gamblers to know which bets are good in which games of chance.
Not that the Reverend Bayes was any kind of gambler. What interested him was not the probability of results given different causes (like the probability of five heads given different kinds of coin). Rather he wanted to know about the inverse probability of the causes given the results. When we observe some evidence, whats the likelihood of its different possible causes Some commentators have conjectured that Bayes interest in this issue was prompted by David Humes sceptical argument in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748) that reports of miracles are more likely to stem from inventive witnesses than the actions of a benign deity. Be that as it may, Bayess article was the first serious attempt to apply mathematics to the problem of inverse probabilities.
Piece of string
Bayess paper analyses a messy problem involving billiard balls and their positions on a table. But his basic idea can be explained easily enough. Go back to the coins.
If five tosses yield five heads in a row, then how likely is it that the coin is fair rather than biased Well, how long is a piece of string In the abstract, theres no good answer to the question. Without some idea of the prevalence of biased coins, five heads doesnt really tell us anything. Maybe were spinning a dodgy coin, or perhaps we just got lucky with a fair one. Who knows
What Bayes saw, however, was that in certain cases the problem is tractable.

US, N.KOREA PEACE PROCESS HITS A SNAG
JAPAN: The peace process between the United States and North Korea was in crisis Sunday after Pyongyang angrily rejected Washingtons gangster-like demand for rapid nuclear disarmament, despite two days of intense talks. Speaking privately, US officials suggested the harshly-worded North Korean statement was a negotiating tactic. But after two days of theatrical amity in Pyongyang it appeared to mark a return to the Norths traditional hardline position.
The Norths Foreign Ministry took exception to Pompeos effort to secure concrete commitments to back leader Kim Jong Uns promise, made at a summit last month with US President Donald Trump, to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
And it did so in stark terms, according to a statement relayed by the KCNA state news agency.
The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that the DPRK would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset, the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official initials.
Pyongyang noted that it had already destroyed a nuclear test site -- a concession that Trump haspublicly hailed as a victory for peace -- and lamented that Pompeo had proved unwilling to match this with US concessions.
It dismissed Trumps unilateral order to suspend joint US and South Korean war games as a cosmetic and highly reversible concession and criticised US negotiators who never mentioned the subject of bringing the 1953 Korean War to a formal end with a peace treaty.
We thought that the US side would come with a constructive proposal... But this expectation and hope of ours was so naive as to be gullible, KCNA said. Last month, Kim agreed to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula in return for security guarantees and an end to a dangerous stand-off with US forces.
Trump hailed this as a successful resolution of the crisis. But the short joint statement was not a detailed roadmap to disarmament and it fell to Pompeo to follow up and put meat on the bones of the sparse commitment.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday shrugged off North Korean accusations of gangster-like behaviour and said sanctions on Pyongyang would only be lifted with final denuclearisation.
Speaking in Tokyo after two days of intense discussions in Pyongyang, Pompeo insisted the talks were making progress and were being conducted in good faith.
In stark contrast, Pyongyangs take was overwhelmingly negative, with the North warning that the future of the peace process was being jeopardised by overbearing US demands for its unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Speaking privately, US officials suggested the harshly-worded North Korean reaction was a negotiating tactic. But after two days of theatrical amity in Pyongyang it illustrated the gulf that remains between the two sides.
In Tokyo, Pompeo briefed his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on the talks, and sought to reassure them that the dialogue with North Korea would continue.
His trip to Pyongyang had been aimed at fleshing out denuclearisation commitments made during last months historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. - AFP

Vettel wins British GP, Hamilton fight back
Ferraris Sebastian Vettel passed the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas to win a British Grand Prix full of action as Lewis Hamilton fought up from the back of the field to take second.
Hamilton drove superbly to recover from a first-lap collision with Vettels team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, and the result hinged on two late-race safety cars, on which the world champions Mercedes team took a strategic gamble.
Unlike rivals Ferrari and Red Bull, Mercedes chose not to pit both their drivers for fresh tyres at the first safety car intervention. The decision promoted Bottas, who had run second from the start, to the lead ahead of Vettel, while it gained Hamilton two places on the track, promoting him to third ahead of Red Bulls Max Verstappen and Raikkonen.
It was a gamble that paid off for Hamilton, winning him crucial points in his title fight with Vettel, limiting the damage that could have been caused after the first lap, but failed with Bottas, who ran out of tyres and was passed by Vettel, Hamilton and Raikkonen before the end of the race.
Hamilton is eight points behind Vettel in the championship which is as tight as ever as the season approaches its halfway point.

We need to focus on human resource development - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said our country has a wealth of human resources and emphasised the need for utilising this human resource effectively and meaningfully.
The Prime Minister made these comments at a meeting held in Moneragala Mahanama National School after opening a new aesthetic building on Saturday.
The Premier urged the necessity of regulating technology-based factories in our country. Technology is used in agriculture and many other fields in countries like Ukraine, Singapore and other Asian countries. Our education should focus on technology to prepare students to face the future.
He said students must be trained to enhance their knowledge of science and management in order to fulfill the future requirements of the business sector.
We need to focus on human resource development as mere infrastructure development is not enough for economic development of the country, he said.
He also said the export economy would play a key role in the economic revival of Sri Lanka in the future.
The export economy commenced with tea cultivation and in 1977, the textile industry was introduced as an export venture, which is very popular even today.
The Prime Minister went on to say that the Nearest School is the Best School project which was initiated by the government recently emphasises the 13-year compulsory system, developing school infrastructure and teacher training in order to uplift the education in the country.
The government under the Nearest School is the Best School project earmarked Rs. 70 million to develop 10 projects in Moneragala Mahanama National School.

Wimbledon shock as Halep, Zverev crash, Nadal, Djokovic move on
LONDON, Saturday: German fourth seed Alexander Zverev and womens world number one Simona Halep wilted in 33-degree heat and crashed out of Wimbledon in the third round on Saturday.
Zverev, playing for the third day in succession, was shocked by Latvian qualifier Ernests Gulbis, ranked 138, in a gruelling five sets, 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-0.
French Open champion Halep lost to Taiwans Hsieh Su-Wei 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 which leaves just one of the top 10 seeds in the last 16.
Meanwhile, two-time champion Rafael Nadal made the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 win over Alex De Minaur of Australia which ensured he would retain the world number one spot at the end of the tournament.
Three-time winner Novak Djokovic made the last 16 of a Slam for the 44th time with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win over Kyle Edmund, the last remaining Briton.
Despite being widely-tipped to be a Grand Slam threat, it was another letdown for Zverev whose run to the quarter-finals at Roland Garros last month remains his best performance at the majors.
Gulbis, a former world number 10 who famously defeated Roger Federer on his way to the French Open semi-finals in 2014, will be playing in the last 16 at Wimbledon for the first time at the 11th attempt.
The 29-year-old will take on Japans Kei Nishikori who registered his 350th career win with a 6-1, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 victory over Australian Nick Kyrgios.
His win on Saturday was his third successive five-setter having also played three matches in qualifying.
Its a great day, its been a great match for me, said Gulbis who before Wimbledon had won just one match on tour in 2018.
He fired 18 aces and 61 winners past Zverev who said he felt he had been unplugged in the fourth set.
I didnt think I could win after losing the third set, but he got tired and I played smarter, added Gulbis.
Defeat for Halep means that Karolina Pliskova, at number seven, is the only womens top 10 seed to reach the fourth round.
Its the first time in the Open era that none of the top five womens seeds have made the last 16 of a Slam.
Hsieh, the world number 48, battled back from 2-5 down in the final set and saved a match point when the Romanian served for the match at 5-3 in the decider.
It will be Hsiehs first appearance in the last 16 at Wimbledon where she will face Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia. Its my first win against a world number one, said 26-year-old Hsieh. Its amazing. I was 2-5 down in the final set but the crowd pushed me to fight.
Halep was left to rue her lost opportunities.
UNPROFESSIONAL HALEP
I was leading the match, I was up, and I couldnt finish it, said the 2014 semi-finalist.
It was an unprofessional attitude from me today.
Nadal reached the last 16 for the eighth time, making sure of keeping the world number one ranking.
The 11-time French Open champion and bidding for an 18th career major will next face unseeded Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic.
It was a positive match against a player with a lot of energy, said Nadal, the 2008 and 2010 champion.
Djokovic was furious when he was denied a break of serve in the seventh game of the fourth set on Centre Court when the ball bounced twice before Edmund hit what was ruled a winner.
But the Serb managed to refocus after a lengthy complaint to umpire Jake Garner.
I was 100 percent convinced it was a double bounce, Djokovic said.
It was an important point. I asked the chair umpire how is it possible he plays that shot if it didnt bounce twice. It didnt make sense.
Djokovic next plays Russian world number 40 Karen Khachanov.
Juan Martin del Potro made the last 16 for the first time in five years when the Argentine fifth seed defeated Frances Benot Paire 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
The former US Open winner, who made the semi-finals in 2013, next faces unseeded Gilles Simon of France.
Other winners Saturday included Belgiums Alison Van Uytvanck who followed her upset of defending champion Garbine Muguruza by beating Anett Kontaveit, the 28th seeded Estonian, 6-2, 6-3.
Switzerlands Belinda Bencic, a former top 10 player whose ranking slumped out of the top 300 last year after wrist surgery, made the fourth round for the second time with a 6-1, 7-6 (7/3) win over Spains Carla Suarez Navarro.
Bencic, now at 56 in the world, next faces two-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber who swept past Naomi Osaka of Japan.

Wipe out nasal bleeding scare
Today Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya (MBBS (Colombo), D.L.O.M.S (Otolaryngology), FRCS (Edin) and one of the three senior Consultants attached to the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital speaks about Nasal bleeding, one of the common medical condition report from children and adults.
Q: Why do kids experience nasal bleeding 
A childs nasal bleeding is usually caused by a ruptured small blood vessel in the nasal septum. Severe blood loss usually does not occur.

Clamping the nostril tightly for few seconds will stop the blood flow. Placing ice on the head and nose may also help. Frequent incidents like this need medical attention. There are several possible causes for the rupture of blood vessel.
Q: What are the other conditions that lead to nasal bleeding in children 
Nasal septum deviation causing discomfort to the child. He/she may be frequently be putting a finger inside. Nails must, therefore, always should be short. Dry weather may cause the formation of dry crusts. Removing these with a finger may lead to bleeding. Putting foreign objects into the nose may cause a smelly discharge mixed with blood. But this may not be fresh blood.
The nose has a high density of blood vessels. Bleeding occurs easily if these are damaged. Certain diseases delay the clotting of blood and a patient with this condition may experience excessive nasal bleeding. Such conditions are platelets count becoming low due to dengue, Leukemia, Haemophilia.
Bleeding can also occur due to nasal infections, tumours and cancers. If an adolescent boy frequently experience bleeding heavily from the nose angiofibroma (tumour of the nose) has to be suspected. This is not a cancer but it spreads around the site of origin at the back of the nose. It can slowly spread to the brain and eye. CT and MRI scans will show the extent of the disease. Complete surgical removal can cure the child. Never ignore the bleeding nose of a male child. Consulting an ENT surgeon is essential.

Nasal bleeding in an adult is dangerous. First aid should be administered and the patient taken to hospital as soon as possible. Medical treatment should be given under the supervision of an ENT Surgeon. Blood transfusion may be required. The patient should be kept clam and under the supervision of nurses for a few days. The patient may need to be examined under anesthesia to investigate the reason for bleeding.
Q: Is there a connection between hypertension and nasal bleeding 
High blood pressure (Hypertension) is not the only cause of nasal bleeding although excessive bleeding can occur due to high blood pressure.
A patient on medication for hypertension must consequently have weekly checks and follow medical advice accurately.

Zaman leads Pakistan to T20 tri-series title with win over Australia
HARARE, Sunday - Opener Fakhar Zaman cracked a career-best 91 to help set up Pakistans six-wicket win over Australia in the final of the Twenty20 tri-series at Harare Sports Club on Sunday.
Zaman shared in a century stand with Shoaib Malik as Pakistan recovered from an early wobble in their pursuit of Australias 183 for 8, and Malik then showed all the experience of an 18-year international career to see his team home with an unbeaten 43.
It looked as though Australia had produced a masterstroke in opening the bowling with Glenn Maxwells offspin as debutant Sahibzada Farhan was stumped off the first ball he faced and Hussain Talat sliced a catch to point three balls later to derail Pakistans chase.
Australia threatened to storm to victory, but Zaman quickly set about re-building the innings. First, he added 45 with captain Sarfraz Ahmed to take his team out of immediate danger, and he then added 107 for the fourth wicket with Malik to seize the advantage for Pakistan.
When Zaman fell cutting out to deep cover, Pakistan still needed 30 from 24, but while Malik remained at the crease their chase was always safe.
Their ultimate victory capped a mixed day for Pakistan. Australia captain Aaron Finch was given a first-ball reprieve when he was dropped by Malik in the deep after top-edging a hook, and several misfields allowed any pressure with the new ball to be immediately dissipated.
Their errors allowed Australia to get off to a flier, with Finch putting together a 95-run opening stand with DArcy Short. Short was also dropped just after he had reached a 39-ball fifty, but he could not better his previous T20I high score of 76 and Pakistans bowling at the death kept Australia in check.
From 95 for 0 after the first 10 overs, Australia lost 8 for 88 and their 183 for 8 was not quite enough to better Pakistan in the final analysis. AFP
