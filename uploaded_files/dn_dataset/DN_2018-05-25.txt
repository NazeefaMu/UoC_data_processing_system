VAT to reduce by 2.5%  in 2020 - FM
Around 46,000 new tax files were opened during the first month after the new Inland Revenue act was implemented said Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera.
The Minister appreciated the generosity of the people for opening tax file voluntarily.
He added that the Customs and the Inland Revenue Department are the two main departments that bring revenue to the government.
He also said that the Customs Ordinance is over 200 years old, (introduced during the reign of Queen Victoria) and therefore a new Customs Act would be brought to Parliament before the next budget.
Minister Samaraweera made this observation when he addressed a ceremony to award Letters of Appointments to newly selected 68 Assistant Superintendent of Custom officials at the Finance ministry auditorium. Around 10,000 candidates had sat for this exam.
It is the poor people who mostly pay taxes to the government by way of indirect taxes. We should relieve them of this burden. Therefore, I expect to reduce the VAT by 2.5% in the year 2020, the Minister added.
The Minister whilst stressing on the importance of actively contributing to the economy by way of revenue collection, said that this government was left with a debt-ridden country when it came to office. But the government has been able to manage the debt servicing by increasing the national revenue making it possible to meet the recurrent expenditure.
The Minister further said that after Independence in 1948, the highest amount of debt servicing has to be paid in 2018. The total foreign debt to be paid this year is US$ 2,845 million and of which US$ 1,789 million has to be paid for government borrowings done before the year 2015. Only an installment of US$ 1,056 to be paid for the foreign loans borrowed after 2015. Accordingly, 63% debt installments to be paid this year are repayments of debts that had been borrowed during Mahinda Rajapaksas tenure as Finance Minister. It was at the level of 75% in 2017.
This situation would further worsen next year. US$ 4,285 million have to be paid in 2019 and of which UD$3,315 or 77% of the repayment are for the debt obtained during the tenure of the previous regime.
Another US$3,768 million will have to be paid as loan installments and the interest in 2020 and of which 77% or US$2,905 million is the debts that were borrowed before 2015. Only US$ 863 million have to be paid for the debt that was borrowed after 2015.
In 2021, 83% of the foreign debt installments will have to be paid to repay the debt taken before 2015.

This is out of the total of 250,000 teachers in service, he said. This ineligibility is not with regard to the qualifications but in terms of respect, dedication, skill and ability in their service.
The weaknesses evident in the teaching profession, government service and political arena should be removed for the nations march towards success, said the President. He said the reputation and dignity of any field is evident through the character and good image of professionals.

Slow economic growth could  hinder women empowerment
The progress of women empowerment efforts undertaken by various organizations in Sri Lanka is likely to hinder owing to slow growth in the Sri Lankan economy and less consumer spending.
These sentiments were expressed by Dr. Rohantha Athukorala, Chairman - 2018 Panel of Judges of at the launch of eighth Professional and Career Women Awards 2018, organized by Women in Management (WIM) in collaboration with International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Dr. Athukorala also stated that sometimes he finds it a challenge to evaluate the progress made by women towards the overall economy, and also to consistently identify and recognize these exceptional women leaders across every level, from corporates to the grassroots due to decline in GDP growth.
Now in its eighth edition, WIM awards recognize Sri Lankan women who excel in their careers, businesses and everyday life, while also inspiring others. Nominations for these prestigious awards are open till June 15, 2018. The awards ceremony itself will be held on August 7, at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo.

Alleged misappropriation of Rs. 21 million
Brian Shaddicks wife gives evidence against Gammanpila
The wife of Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, the third witness in the alleged financial fraud case filed against the two accused, including Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday informed the Colombo High Court that she had never put her signature executing a Power of Attorney to Gammanpila, for the selling of shares belonging to the Digital Nominees Company.
Witness Janet Elizabeth Shaddick, (69), was present before Colombo High Court A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe for allegedly misappropriating Rs.21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000. In replying to a question raised by Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris regarding a power of attorney, the witness said her signature had been allegedly used.
I was shocked to see this document because there are a number of forged things. Whoever put the signature was not known to me. It looks like this Power of Attorney was given by us for Gammanpilas benefit. It is a silly act. I have not given such authority to Gammanpila, Mrs. Shaddick said.
Meanwhile, after perusing the document in question, the witness said the handwriting in the document that looks like it was written by Gammanpila. When asked as to how she came to such a conclusion, the witness said she was familiar with Gammanpilas handwriting since he had earlier sent a fax message with his handwriting.
Sydney Jayasinghe and Gammanpila were employees of our company. I was enthusiastic to learn about Buddhism. I wanted to ask Sydney Jayasinghe about the wife of The Buddha. He said he was a Christian and asked that this question be referred to Gammanpila.
Udaya Gammanpila was an office boy of our company. He was employed under the recommendation of Sydney Jayasinghe. Gammanpila had sent me a fax message in his handwriting regarding the wife of The Buddha. So, I can recognize his handwriting which were written in block capital letters, the witness said.
Meanwhile, the witness further said she was informed by his husband that Udaya Gammanpila and another person named Jagath had told him that there is a conspiracy to assassinate him by the youngest son of Sydney Jayasinghe. Thereafter, he did not come back to Sri Lanka until 2015, the witness further added.
The witness was cross examined by Defence Counsel Nalinda Indatissa.
Further trial was fixed for today (25).
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has cheated Rs.20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman called Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent Power of Attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shadick.
The AG has listed 20 persons as the witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Hamburg ban diesel cars
Officials said they would begin banning older diesel cars and trucks from a main road in the center of Germanys second biggest city starting on May 31. Another key road in Hamburg will also be off limits to older dieseltrucks.
Germany has been under rising pressure from residents to improve urban air quality since Volkswagen (VLKAY) admitted rigging diesel engine emissions tests in 2015. But the countrys powerful car industry lobbied hard against outright bans.
Dozens of German cities frequently exceed air pollution limits set by the European Union, and in February the countrys top court ruled that they could ban diesel vehicles.
Hamburg has installed roughly 100 signs to alert drivers to the new rules and offer alternative routes. A city spokesperson was not immediately available to clarify if local residents would be exempt from the diesel ban. (BBC)

Interest rates on Chinese loans  to Lanka very low: envoy
Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan yesterday said there is no truth in alleged Chinese militarization of the Hambantota Port. He dismissed speculations pointing out that the company running the Hambantota port now is in a joint venture between Sri Lanka and China.
He was answering a question at a symposium hosted by the Chinese Embassy titled, From Millennium to the New Era: Jointly Build the Belt and Road and Embrace the Sri Lankan Dream, on Wednesday. The Chinese partner in this company consists of several companies; it is not Chinese investments exclusively. So, any decision-making is not by China alone, he said.
Answering a question on interest rates on loans to Sri Lanka, the Ambassador said the interest rates on Chinese concessionary loans to Sri Lanka are very low compared with international market rates. Besides, he said, the loans are given on relatively long repayment structures and grace periods. Responding to another question, he said there are about 6,000 Chinese migrant workers in Sri Lanka. However, he said the Sri Lanka Immigration Department may have the correct figure, including executives and managers, whose jobs are necessary to run certain investment projects.
These migrant workers are here in accordance with government rules and regulations, the Ambassador said. He explained that certain projects cannot be done without Chinese personnel. In such instances, Chinese people were recruited with the government approval. The Ambassador further explained that Chinese projects in Sri Lanka have created a large number of job opportunities for Sri Lankans. For instance, the CICT (port project in Colombo) has recruited over 1,000 locals and many have received training in China as well, he said.

International Day Against Drug Abuse on June 26
The National Dangerous Drug Control Board (NDDCB) has decided to commemorate International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking for a week from June 26.
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking falls on 26 June, said NDDCB, Chairman, Prof. Saman Abeysinghe addressing a media briefing at their offices yesterday, But we felt that rather than just have one day, it was better to commemorate it over a week.
The NDDCB will be working together with the Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Drugs for an illicit drugsfree country.
The two agencies have been working together over the last year to raise awareness among schoolchildren, university students, vocational training institutions, early childhood development centre staff, government officers, law enforcement officers and communities. At the end of 2017, the NDDCB had conducted awareness programmes for 126,456 school students through 614 programmes,
The youth are the most vulnerable group when it comes to drug use and more often than not, it starts due to a lack of information, said the Chairman.
Senior advisor to the Presidential Task Force, H.M. Tilakaratne, said in addition, programmes from the grama nildhari level to the district level were being operated through district drug prevention committees to village drug prevention committees. They were being supported by community policing units around the country.
We have also trained 400 military personnel through the universities including civil defence force personnel to work with communities on drug prevention programmes and they assist officials to conduct awareness programmes. In addition, 600 youth from the Mahaweli areas have been trained to work to prevent drug use in their villages, said Tilakaratne.
He noted that their programmes were being constantly updated to use what works. Further officials have been instructed by the President to act without political interference to curb the drug problem.
All government officials have been given the power to act, but whether they do so remains doubtful. So the President has undertaken to monitor the progress once a month or once in three months.

JLanka inaugurates international  business entity in Bahrain
Sri Lankas foremost renewable energy and technology solutions providerJLanka Technologies has officially inaugurated its first international business entity, JLanka international, based out in Bahrain.
Commencing operations in this region, JLanka has commissioned to conduct an exclusive training program in Bahrain in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Bahrain, along with the countrys Sustainable Energy Unit (SEU) and the Electricity and Water Authority (EWA), to train and certify solar PV installers.
JLanka has also been commissioned for a comprehensive survey of government buildings in Bahrain for solar energy potential for an upcoming tender based feed-in-tariff (FiT) program.
We are pleased about the opportunity of knowledge sharing and enormous potential for our solar and pioneering renewable energy and technology solutions in Bahrain, the Gulf region and Middle East, said Jayantha Jayamanna, Chief Operating Officer of JLanka.
Our proven expertise and established operation has led to JLankas global acceptance as industry leaders, where we were awarded two projects through an international competitive bidding process.
Equally important is the fact that both these projects are long-term agreements (LTAs) signed with the UNDP Bahrain, which further cements JLankas continued presence and collaboration in the region.
The JLanka leadership team including Jayamanna, on a visit to Bahrain met with Dr. Abdul Hussain bin Ali Mirza, Minister of Electricity and Water Affairs of Bahrain as well as Bahrains UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Amin El Sharkawi.
JLankas significant research and development capacity in renewable energy and technology solutions, installation and management was commended by Bahrain authorities, along with the companys approach for industry advancement via knowledge dissemination, leading to their collaboration with the UNDP Country Office and Ministry of Electricity and Water Affairs of Bahrain. El Sharkawi also highlighted the important role JLanka will play in Bahrains alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially in promoting Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy for All.
The training workshop, scheduled to be held in June is organized by the Ministry of Electricity and Water Affairs of Bahrain in cooperation with the countrys Sustainable Energy Unit, a Government-UNDP established unit for forming strategies, policies and legislations and for stimulating initiatives and investment projects that promote energy efficiency and widening the share of the production of energy from renewable sources.

Kishu Gomes quits to serve country better
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Chevron Lubricants Lanka Kishu Gomes who resigned from his post said that he did so as he felt that he could do more for the country in a different role.
Gomes said he was with Caltex for over 18 years and made the company from a less known entity to a household name.
Within a short time I increased the revenue from Rs. 600 million to 3.5 billion with a complete Sri Lanka management.
He recalled that he first joined the multi nation Coca Cola and severed it for 11 years.
While I was serving I saw a vacancy ad and decided to apply for Caltex and I was impressed in the manner in which I was interviewed for over two hours by a foreigner in a five star hotel.
Soon after the interview I was told that I was selected and after two weeks I joined Caltex even though my financial package was lower than what I was getting. My family also supports me moving to the new job as they felt it was a challenge for me and I would be successful.
He said that within a short period he rose up to the top slot of the company and remained there for over 18 years becoming the youngest and longest serving Managing Director of a multinational in the Sri Lankan history.
My hard work was recognized and during that time there was a saying in the corporate sector that Kishu was Caltex and Caltex was Kishu.
Gomes who has won several business awards including the best Sri Lankan in the business sector by Lions International.
He said that one year ago too, he wanted to resign but decided to stay on until last week. I am proud of my history at Chevron and the fact that I was able to successfully manage it without any foreign management.
Today Sri Lankan corporate brings down foreign CEOs and administrators to work in Sri Lanka and pay them around Rs. Six to 20 million monthly while sending Sri Lankan house wives and unskilled workers overseas for jobs for around Rs. 40,000. I am the shining example to say that Sri Lankans does not need foreign CEO to manage local businesses.
Though Sri Lanka boasts of a 95.5% literacy rate the education is not focused towards fulfilling the requirements of the current demands of work. The education syllabuses are outdated.
For this the politicians of successive governments are responsible as they have not fine-tuned the education sector to meet neither the present nor future employee demands.
Gomes emotionally pointed out that about 25, 000 schoolchildren in Sri Lanka in rural areas have to travel round 10 kilo meters per day to school.
Out of this number 25% of children walk barefoot to school and dont have a luxury to eat in the morning. They only have their first meal at 3 30 p.m.
He said that the country cannot expect politicians to create a better tomorrow for them as successive governments since independence have failed in this regard.
I am hoping to actively get involved in helping to change this scenario in the future.
Chevron said that Rochana Kaul will be replacing Gomes with intimidate effect in an acting capacity.

Korea provides USD 7.5 million to improve  education in Kilinochchi
Taking a step forward in its endeavours to improve the education sector in the Kilinochchi district since 2011, KOICA has decided to provide grant aid worth USD 7.5 million to renovate a number of schools in Kilinochchi.
The agreement between the two countries for the project was signed by Country Director of KOICA Sri Lanka Office Lee Dong Ku, Secretary to the Ministry of Education S. Hettiarachchi and Director General of the Department of External Resources Priyantha Rathnayake. The State Minister of Education, V. S. Radakrisnan was also present on this occasion.
Situated in the heart of the Northern Province, Kilinochchi was severely ravaged by the prolonged armed conflict which dragged on for nearly three decades. Among the many devastations caused by the war, the destruction of infrastructure was one that has greatly challenged post war reconciliation efforts, particularly in the process of resettling the internally displaced. Resettlement endeavours in this area have proven to be an extremely difficult task mainly due to the massive destruction caused to all infrastructure facilities, which require to be built from scratch.
Taking these factors into consideration, KOICA identified the importance of investing in the development of education in the war ravaged district of Kilinochchi, in order to help restore normalcy to peoples lives and build a better future for their children. Keeping in line with the Korean governments partnership strategy with Sri Lanka where education has been identified as a key priority area for cooperation, in 2011, KOICA initiated a USD 5.6 million project for the improvement of the education sector in Kilinochchi. Based on the success of this initial project which concluded in the year 2014, KOICA has decided to grant a further USD 7.5 million for a new initiative to ensure that high quality education is made available to the youth of this area who have already suffered severe setbacks in life due to the internal conflict.
The project will be an all-inclusive endeavour, focusing on the development of the education capacity of the district in a sustainable manner, including infrastructure development, teacher training, community awareness activities, and initiatives to secure parental support for the promotion of their childrens education.
This new development cooperation initiative will be carried out as part of KOICAs continued efforts since the 2000s to help uplift the living standards of less developed, marginalized parts of the island to achieve equal and sustainable development.

The Sri Jayawardenepura Parliament complex is to receive an official land deed after 36 years.
Parliament Secretary-General Dhammika Dasanayake told the Daily News that Parliament so far only possessed a Thamba Sannasa (a royal edict written on a copper plate).
He said the new land deed would be handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka during a ceremony on June 5 at 3 p.m. All MPs had been invited to the ceremony.
The Thamba Sannasa had been awarded on April 29, 1982, when J. R. Jayewardena was President. It had been presented to then Speaker Abdul Bakeer Markar by the then Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The total area of the Parliament premises, which was 12 acres, one rood and 32 perches in 1982, had extended over the time and the new deed includes all the surrounding areas. Survey activities pertaining to the land had been carried out during the past few months.
The Secretary-General said the land in Jayanthipura where the Agriculture Ministry was previously housed, had not been included into the land deed. It was taken over by Parliament recently to accommodate Sectoral Oversight Committees.
It is currently being renovated with the help of the Navy and would be ready for use by September, he said. UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana queried from the Speaker in Parliament yesterday, as to whether Parliament had been occupying the land for 36 years without a deed. He made this observation referring to the letter inviting him to the ceremony.
The Secretary-General clarified that they were not occupying the premises illegally, but that it had been handed over via a Thamba Sannasa.

Lanka plans becoming benchmark for paperless intl trade
Sri Lanka intends to become a benchmark for an integrated, paperless international trade thereby reduce time and cost currently spent by traders in preparing and submitting information and documents to multiple border regulatory agencies, with the implementation of National Single Window (NSW).
These views were expressed by Dr. R.H.S Samaratunge, Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance, at the second of four public-private consultations on the establishment of a National Single Window (NSW) in Sri Lanka, organized by the Geneva-based International Trade Centre (ITC), in association with Sri Lankas National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) in Colombo yesterday.
Dr. Samaratunge, said further, Sri Lanka has ideally positioned to become a regional trade and logistics hub and is striving to make its economy more interconnected with regional and global markets.
This excise is undertaken to compliment the work being done by the World Bank to prepare the blueprint for Sri Lankas single window initiative and is a timely intervention as it is important to obtain views of all stakeholders at the very initial stage of the implementation process.
Improving cross border formalities is one of the key successful factors for Sri Lanka, Dr. Samarathunga said adding that, as of today, Sri Lanka is ranked 111th among 190 economies in ease of doing business index. And the government has set up eight task forces, based on World Banks ease of doing business program with a view to improving the present investment climate.
According to Dr. Samaratunga, the success of NSW will depend on careful implementation and close co-operation between many public and private stakeholders who are in international transactions.
P. S. M. Charles, Chairperson NTFC, Director General of Customs, speaking at the event noted that it is imperative to identify the governance mechanism and response model during the development and operational phase of NSW. In this endeavor, ITC has prepared a discussion paper under the theme of governance mechanism of the national single window for the trade Sri Lanka, Charles noted.
The discussion paper highlights organizations structures for the governance mechanism during the development and implementation phase.
In addition to that, ITC has agreed for financing capacity building activities of customs on timely study, risk management, post clearance audit and etc.

Through SmartThinQ technology, you will be able to conveniently interact with various LG appliances and perform several errands such as decreasing the volume of your music, starting a laundry cycle, and so forth.
Consumers can choose between two options - the SmartThinQ App and a voice function compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.
The SmartThinQ app, which can easily be downloaded from Google Play Store or Apple App Store, is perfect for times when you are away from your home but need to conduct a household chore, monitor your appliances or diagnose minor technical issues. The voice command capability via Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa lets you execute tasks in the house using just your voice, without having to physically go to the device.
The Ultra HD (UHD) and OLED TVs will differ from the rest of the range by allowing you to speak directly into a SmartThinQ-enabled remote control that is equipped with Natural Language Processing (NLP), a feature delivering intelligent voice-activated control and connectivity.

The solution enables shoppers to safely pay using a mobile application with a standardized QR code support to scan the merchant-presented QR code, which works on smartphones. Ushering in a new era for digital payments in the island nation, Mastercard QR can easily be integrated into existing mobile payment solutions offered by financial service providers and works with existing Mastercard cards as well.
Mastercard is excited to bring Mastercard QR to Sri Lanka, one of its key focus markets in South Asia. Continuing to support the countrys ongoing efforts to encourage adoption of cashless payments, Mastercard seeks to simplify access to digital payments for businesses and consumers through this fast, secure, convenient and cost-effective solution, said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard.
Mastercard QR enables merchants to accept Mastercard payments using a simple EMV Co standard QR code that merchants can display at their Point of Sale (POS) without the need for any physical equipment. They can also use a dynamic EMV Co QR code generated on the merchants mobile device. It is a low cost and easy-to-deploy technology, designed to benefit every merchant, whether they are based in a major city or a remote area. Thus, it opens up a world of opportunities to small and micro merchants across the country that are challenged by a traditional terminal approach for payments.
The initial response on Mastercard QR from Mastercards local customers and partners has been very encouraging. Mastercard is working together to integrate it into their existing systems. We look forward to seeing many more merchants and consumers availing the convenience and security of digital payments through solutions such as Mastercard QR, added Santosh.
The release of the EMVCo QR Codes Specification in July 2017 has further propelled the proliferation of the interoperable QR Standards of QR Payments across Asia.

A large number of them, over 10,000, are on maternity leave annually.Pregnant teachers up to now had to wear sarees to schools causing them inconveniences.Therefore, the Education Ministry introduced this comfortable and dignified maternity dress for school teachers.
Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr.Vijith Vidyabushana, a member of the panel that designed the dress said it was designed considering the physical difficulties specially during the last few months of pregnancy.

He said that the saree is not a suitable dress for any pregnant woman, that may result in several health issues such as gastritis, uneasiness in passing urine and fungal infections among others. Moreover it is difficult to climb steps or staircases wearing a saree.There is a tendency to fall. Such cases are reported commonly, he added.
Panel member Dr.Virajini Medagedara Karunaratne of the Moratuwa university and a member of the expert panel, that prepared the dress said they wanted to bring in tradition as well as modernity when designing the pattern. The pregnancy dress comes in six patterns and in six light colours.

The National Disaster Management Center (DMC) yesterday announced that more than 125,954 persons belonging to 32,136 families have been affected by the prevailing adverse weather condition in the country with 13 deaths reported so far.
Around 43 houses have been completely damaged and 3225 houses have been partially damaged. According to DMC Deputy Director and Media Spokesman Pradeep Kodippili, people in flood risk areas have been evacuated to safe locations and to welfare centres.
Approximately 13,832 families have been evacuated to 251 welfare centres due to flood and landslide risks in 10 Districts.
However, the rainfall recorded was minimal in the major river catchment areas during the past 24 hours. Therefore, the flood levels will gradually recede.
Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said that measures have been taken to provide immediate relief to the persons affected by the bad weather.
The National Disaster Relief Services Centre has provided Rs.24.9 million cash allocations to the 12 District Secretaries to address the immediate needs of the affected population.
A meeting was held yesterday with the participation of the officials of the Ministries of Irrigation, Water Resources Management and Disaster Management, Military officers and District officials to discuss response measures to face any heavy flood situation in the coming few days.
Full access to the Kaduwela main bridge towards Biyagama road has not been restored due to damage to the side-wall of the bridge. The bridge was closed from 10p.m. to 5a.m.
However, repairs to the bridge are in progress. Access to the Panwila-Bambaraella road has been hindered due to a rock-fall in the Kandy district.
The DMC is coordinating with Military agencies through its EOC for better response interventions and NDRSC is undertaking needs assessment at local levels, especially in safety centers.
Meteorology Department Duty meteorologist Janaka Kumara said that the rainy weather condition prevailing in the South-Western part of the island is expected to continue and showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-Western Provinces.
Showers or thundershowers will occur elsewhere, particularly after 2.00 p.m. Showers or thundershowers will occur in the Jaffna, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts in the morning too.
Heavy rain falls of about 100-150 mm can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa, Western, Central and North-Western Provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. Fairly heavy falls, above 50 mm can be expected at some places in the Northern Province.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The General public have been requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity.
He further said that the windy and showery conditions are expected to further enhance in the Western and Southern sea areas and showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea areas around the island.
Heavy showers can be expected at some places, particularly in the sea area extending from Kankasanturai to Matara via Mannar, Colombo and Galle. Winds will be Westerly to South-westerly in direction in the sea areas around the island and wind speed will be 30-40 kmph.
The sea areas extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Puttalam, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota can be rough or very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 kmph at times. Temporarily, very strong gusty winds (up to 70-80 kmph) and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
The Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be vigilant.
According to Irrigation Department sources, the water levels of Dunamale in the Aththanagalu Oya and Panadugama in the Nilwala River were rising.
NBRO has still issued a landslide threat to Ratnapura, Kalutara, Badulla, Kegalle, Kandy, Matale, Nuwara-Eliya, Galle, Colombo and Kurunegala due to earthslips, cut failures and rock falls.
The public are advised to move immediately away from the areas where they notice pre-landslide signs such as the development of cracks on the ground, deepened cracks and ground subsidence, slanting of trees, electrical posts, fences and telephone posts, cracks in the floors and walls of buildings which are built on slopes, sudden appearance of springs, emerging muddy water, and blockage or disappearance of existing springs.
The NBRO warns people living in landslide prone areas to be extra vigilant and ready to move quickly to safe places if the need rises.

Road damages from floods much less than before - RDA
The damage caused to the national road network and highways by the ongoing heavy rains and floods are much less than on previous occasions, Road Development Authority(RDA) Chairman Nihal Suriyarachchi said.
He said there was a similar flood situation last year as well. But, this year, damages to the national road network and highways are minimal compared to last year, due to the precautions taken by the RDA.
RDA engineers and officials visited the affected areas by road and by air to identify the reasons for the floods and inspect the damages caused to bridges and roads.
Having taken into consideration last years experience, precautions were taken to remove bridge barriers and blocks on roads and highways with the support of all relevant government organisations.
This has helped prevent the severe flooding of highways this year, he added.
Only eight roads and two bridges in the entire island had gone under water and damaged due to soil erosion. One section of Nagoda in Wanduramba- Athumale main road experienced an earth slip. We have estimated a sum of around Rs.100 million for clearing debris from inundated roads. When floodwaters recede, the affected areas are often blanketed in silt and mud. Therefore, we need to clear and clean these areas.
Sections of the Ratnapura- Idangoda-Ayagama road, Panadura - Nambapana  Ratnapura road, Kelaniya- Mudungoda road, Hanwella-Urapola road via Kohilawatta, Welihinda junction in Negambo-Girulla road, Makavita section in Ja-ela-Ekala road and sections in Thoppuwa-Nattandiya-Madampe roads have been inundated.
Meanwhile,the bridge in Dandagamuwa,Kuliyapitiya and the approach road to the Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge damaged due to soil erosion are being reppaired.
He said the damage to the Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge was not severe and repairs can be completed by tomorrow. He said a temporary bridge will be erected to replace the damaged approach road.
He requested the people to use the Hotlines of 1968 for non highways and 1969 for highways to inform about road difficulties.

SLTDA to launch mobile registration service in Jaffna
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) will launch a mobile registration service in Jaffna at the District Secretariat auditorium on May 30 and 31.
The mobile service will ensure that all tourism-related businesses in the area such as hotels, restaurants, bungalows and travel agencies are registered with the SLTDA, the apex body of Sri Lanka Tourism.
The initiative is assisted by the Northern Province Tourism Association.
According to the Tourism Act of Sri Lanka, all tourism-related businesses and service providers must obtain registration from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and come under the regulatory framework of the organization.
The mobile registration, according to the SLTDA, is a significant step towards facilitating this registration process.
Informal or unregistered tourism-related business entities provide useful visitor services and generate employment and as such, form an important segment of the industry. But we want them to come within the registration mechanism of the SLTDA now so that standards can be monitored and improved over time, SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said, commenting on the mobile registration initiative. The SLTDA said a delegation representing the institution, in collaboration with the Northern Province Tourism Association, visited Jaffna last week to inform all industry stakeholders in the area of the mobile registration programme.
A similar mobile registration programme will also take place in Weligama and Mirissa on June 3 and 4.

Speaker tables names of  Watchdog Committee members
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday tabled the names of members appointed to Parliamentary Watchdog Committees, the COPE, COPA and Public Finance Committee, for the new session of Parliament.
Only slight changes have been done in the three committees.
The Joint Opposition and the JVP expressed their opposition for re-appointing the four Parliamentarians, who made controversial phone calls to Perpetual Treasuries beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, to the COPE again. The members of COPE remain the same except that MP Weerakumara Dissanayake, who crossed over to Government from the JO, has been replaced with MP Jayantha Samaraweera to represent the JO.
JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake brought to the attention of the House that it was improper to re-appoint the MPs found to have made phone calls to Aloysius while the COPE probe on the Treasury Bonds was on.
We have made a complaint against them at the Bribery Commission and investigations are going on. Therefore, it is not suitable to re-appoint them, MP Aluthgamage said.
The Speaker said the JOs concern was communicated at the Party Leaders Meeting, but the Government was of the opinion that those members can continue, as allegations against them have not yet been proved.
If we are to remove all the members with allegations, then we will have to remove many. The Governments stance was that allegations should have been proved and I cannot influence the decisions of the Government, the Speaker said.
MP Dissanayake pointed out that COPE should be rid of tainted individuals, but this has not been the case throughout history.
MP Susil Premajayantha on behalf of the SLFP Group of 16 in the Opposition requested from the Speaker to reconsider the appointments to the Committees stating that their group has not been given fair representation in them.
The Speaker said all appointments were made collectively at the Party Leaders Meetings and that he did not make arbitrary decisions at any time.
MP Udaya Gammanpila has replaced Prasanna Ranatunga in the Committee On Public Accounts (COPA) while the other members remain unchanged. MPs Bimal Rathnayake and Shehan Semasinghe have been appointed to the Committee on Public Finance replacing MPs Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Sunil Handunnetti.
The COPE and COPA comprises of 26 members and Public Finance Committee comprises of 19 members. The Chairmen of these committees will be agreed upon on their first meeting. At the previous Parliamentary session, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti headed the COPE, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna headed the COPA and TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran headed the Public Finance Committee. It has been proposed to continue with the same Chairmen.

Strong growth trajectory in listed hospitals to continue - Fitch
Fitch Ratings expects the balance sheets of Sri Lankas listed hospitals to improve in the medium term.
Most private operators expanded capacity in the last few years to meet growing demand. As a result, the combined net debt-to-EBITDA of the four largest listed hospitals rose to 2.6 fold at end-December 2017 from 1.7 fold at end-March 2013. However, we believe most hospitals will now focus on stabilising operations and strengthening balance sheets before funding further expansion, Fitch said.
Fitch expects the EBITDA margin of the listed hospitals to improve modestly in the medium term as patient volume increases. Higher occupancy at hospitals and larger revenue contributions from high-margin value-added businesses, such as diagnostics and laboratory services, should help to more than cover the high fixed costs of the sector and widen margins.
We also believe hospitals should be able to pass on cost increases from staff-related costs or currency depreciation to end-customers amid strong demand for private healthcare.
However, regulatory pressure from increased taxes on healthcare and recently introduced price controls on certain procedures may limit sector profitability in the near term. The listed hospitals EBITDA margin averaged around 23% in the last five years.
Asiri Hospitals Holdings PLC, the largest listed operator in the country in terms of revenue and number of beds, was able to maintain better margins than peers due to its strong laboratory revenues.
Fitch believes the increasing demand for private healthcare is driven by Sri Lankas aging population and rising incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which state hospitals are not well-equipped to handle. Geriatric care tends to be long-term, while treatment of NCDs requires long hospital stays, long-term medication and, in some cases, palliative care.
Demand for private healthcare in Sri Lanka is likely to improve in the medium to long term with wider acceptance of medical insurance, helped by government-led insurance schemes and increasing personal income. Fitch also expects further expansion of private hospitals to be hobbled by the shortage in qualified physicians and nursing staff. We do not expect the shortage to resolve in the medium term.
We do not expect the listed hospitals to face liquidity pressure in the medium term because they have more long-term debt in their capital structures, spread-out maturity profiles, and stable FCF generation as capex declines.
Historically, it is only around 25% of the sectors debt structure consisted of short-term debt, with half of it in revolving credit facilities used for working capital requirements.

Thabbowa sluice gates opened
Since the water level of the Thabbowa Reservoir has exceeded 17 feet, six of its sluice gates have been opened to discharge excess water into the Puttalam lagoon through the Mee Oya, a spokesman for the Irrigation Department said. He said water is gushing out of the sluice gates at 1,328 cubic feet per second.
If more sluice gates were opened, villages around the banks of the Mee Oya lower reaches would be inundated. As such, they had taken precautions to release water from the reservoir in a manner that would not inconvenience the people.

Timber Corporation to launch  tree planting campaign
The State Timber Corporation will launch a project to plant two trees in place of one tree felling for timber, said Timber Corporation Chairman Shantha Bandara, yesterday.
He said he was formulating the project proposal and would discuss the matter with President Maithripala Sirisena, the Central Environment Authority and Forest Conservation Department to make the proposal a reality.
He added that the State Timber Corporation objects to the import of sleepers for railways. He said the Railway Department had bought sleepers it required for the construction and repair of railways from the State Timber Corporation. A decision had been reached to import the sleepers, Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
The State Timber Corporation has the capacity to provide as much sleepers to the Railway Department it needs.
He made these observations yesterday taking part in the first public ceremony to grant licences to small-scale carpenters to buy timber at concessionary rates, after assuming duties as the new Chairman of the Timber Corporation.
The ceremony was held at the State Timber Corporation auditorium in Battaramulla. Twenty five selected small-scale carpenters in Moratuwa were granted licences to buy timber at a rate of 20 percent less from the stores of the State Timber Corporation island-wide. The concession incurs a loss of Rs. 34 million to the Timber Corporation annually.
Timber Corporation Chairman Shantha Bandara said the concession granted to small-scale carpenters incurs a massive loss to the Timber Corporation but it is granted to uplift the economy of small-scale carpenters in the country. He added that the responsibility of carpenters is to produce quality furniture to prevent the import of furniture.
Chairman Shantha Bandara said the Corporation was ready to provide training to carpenters to enhance the quality of products. He added that the attitude of youths on carpentry should changed as it is a respectable employment that is lucrative.

UNP will prevent  return of military  type regime - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the sole endeavour of the UNP was to prevent another military type regime coming into power.
As such, the decision confronting the people was whether they needed democracy or a second Rajapaksa regime in power, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting held at Sirikotha UNP headquarters, Pitakotte to mark the assumption of duties by Minister Navin Dissanayake in his post as UNP National Organiser, yesterday.
The Premier added that when UNP leaders addressed Parliament with pride and honour, Pohottuwa members only shouted and disrupted the proceedings.
Their sole objective was to bring back the Rajapaksa regime to power, the Prime Minister said.
The question was as to whether they wanted to safeguard democracy if they returned to power.
Lasantha Wickrematunga was murdered and Ekneligoda was abducted during their rule, he said.
The Premier warned the few journalists who tried to foist the Rajapaksa regime back in power that they would face the same fate if that regime was returned.
The Prime Minister while congratulating the new UNP office bearers and wishing them well,requested the people to assist the new youth leadership installed as office bearers of the party.
Minister Navin Dissanayake who assumes duties as the National Organiser of the UNP today has rendered a great service towards the progress of the party as a young parliamentarian and Minister. He had made a major contribution towards the partys victory in the Nuwara Eliya district. Youthful leaders like him are a vital need of the hour for party reorganisation, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said young leaders like Navin Dissanayake was the need of the party to take it forward.
The Premier recalled the great services rendered by Navin Dissanayakes father late Gamini Dissanayake to reorganise the UNP after its 1970 debacle. He (Gamini Dissanayake) contested and won the Nuwara Eliya seat in Parliament,but, he was unseated in an election petition. Later, he again won Nuwara Eliya and took an active part to re-organise the party along with late President J.R.Jayewardene. People like late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Minister Lalith Atulathmudali, Cyril Mathew and several others assisted the party reorganisation enabling it to win the General and the Presidential elections which followed.
The fact that late Gamini Dissanayake paid with his life to uplift the party while contesting the Presidential election as the party candidate should never be erased from memory, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Wickremesinghe said Navin Dissanayake too had displayed leadership traits of the calibre of his late father.
The UNP had a team of youthful leaders like him to carry forward the party re-organisation work. The party Deputy Leader, Assistant Leader, General Secretary, Treasurer and Trade Union Secretary were all youthful leaders included in a new team who had been vested with responsibilities in the party, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
There was also a long line of youthful MPs and Provincial Council members who are waiting to fill party positions in the near future. A decision on this would be taken by the party working committee at its meeting to be held next week, he said.
This youth generation should come forward as the next tier of leadership. The UNP was the only party which could display a second and third tier of leadership in 2020 as well as in 2030, the Premier added.
The UNP could proudly claim that it would rebuild the country with a new generation of leadership. No other party could make this claim. The Pohottuwa party had the same old faces including certain retired army officers. They were the same people who helped to install the Rajapaksa regime, the Prime Minister said.

Unqualified SAITM students must not be absorbed to KDU for medicine - Union
The parents union of state medical faculty students will take legal action against authorities if unqualified SAITM students are absorbed into the KDU, union secretary Gamini Ekanayake said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said the lowest Z score of the medical student who gained admission to a state medical faculty in relevant previous years should be considered as the minimum qualification for admission to the KDU, when absorbing SAITM students to the medical faculty.
The union has written to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (FMTA), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) with regard to this issue.
Listing of SAITM students should be done below that of state medical faculty students of relevant years. SAITM students who do not qualify to enter into the KDU medical faculty should be allowed to follow other courses and not medicine, Ekanayake said.
