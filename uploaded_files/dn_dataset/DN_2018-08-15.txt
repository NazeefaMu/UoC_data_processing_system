Rooftop protest continues:
End protest for discussions
Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry Secretary W. M. M. R. Adhikari said yesterday that if the female inmates end their protest, the authorities are willing to discuss their issues.
A spokesperson for the ministry said the Secretary, however, had warned that there will be no discussions as long as they engage in the protest.
The inmates continued their rooftop protest yesterday too. However, prison sources said some inmates were injured following a clash on Monday night between two groups of protesters. About 25 female inmates of the Welikada Prison went up the prison roof and staged a protest on Monday morning against an alleged decision by the prison authorities to limit the food items allowed from outside and demanding that their cases be taken up for hearing early.
However, the prisons authorities said food brought inside the prison was limited from last week as drugs were being smuggled concealed in food. A majority of protesters are serving prison terms related to drug cases.

Colombo Additional Magistrate Kanchana N. Silva ordered the suspect to be detained under CID custody until today, for further questioning.
He was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday in Lotus road, according to the Police Media Spokesmans office.
The suspect had been impersonating a guard named Polwattage Gallage Ashoka with a fake National Identity Card. He had been working as a guard in an estate in Dompe. The arrest had been made by OIC of CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva in Colombo.
Hettiarachchi was in the Sri Lanka Navy in the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He was wanted by police in connection with kidnapping for ransom, illegal detention and murder of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009. He also had a warrant issued against him in connection with the assassination of former MP Nadarajah Raviraj.
Previously, he had been issued an open warrant to be arrested by the Fort Magistrates Court. Speaking on the case, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said the CID has been given the freedom to carry out their investigations without any political interference or pressure.
Navy Sampath had a warrant issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court for his arrest but had been evading arrest and the CID believed that he was being harboured by certain parties. The CID warned that legal action would be taken against anyone found to harbour this fugitive.
The CID is currently investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth and several navy personnel have been arrested in this connection including former Navy spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake.
The CID is investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth based on a written complaint by then Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the DIG CID on May 28, 2009 against his personal security officer, then Lt. Commander Nilantha Sampath Munasinghe following which the CID was able to uncover the Navys involvement with the abductions.
Those abducted were Kasthuriarachchilage John Rit alias John, Rajiv Naganathan alias Malli, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Tillakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohomed Sajith, Jamamdeen Dilan, Amalan Leon, Roshan Leon, Anthony Kasthuriarachchi, Theagaraja Jegan and Mohomed Ali Anver alias Hajiya.
Investigations into these abductions are being conducted by the Organized Crimes Investigations Unit and the CID.

Supermarkets should promote reusable bags
The issuing of nearly 40 million non-degradable polythene bags to customers by Super Markets every month should be minimized in order to stop future environmental hazards, said Nature Plus food wrapping sheets manufacturer and exporter of compostable bags, Plastic Packaging , Chairman Mervyn Dias.
Mervyn Dias
He said authorities should take action in this regard and encourage super markets to promote environmentally friendly reusable bags such as cotton bags and other similar reusable bags.
He said even officials at supermarkets should motivate their staff in this regard as bags are issued to customers by cashiers at counters unnecessarily.
To minimize using more polythene bags, customers should use one bag to put groceries and another bag to put cleaning stuff like soap, toothpaste etc.
Chairman Dias said in addition, super markets could also charge money for additional bags to discourage customers who are asking for more bags.
He said customers should also be informed that polythene papers take over 500 years to degrade in the environment and causing a severe destruction to living beings.
He further said this message could be displayed at the counters and even the staff should request customer to bring reusable bags.
Chairman Dias highlighted that super markets are the most identified places in the country that issue large quantity of polythene bags to customers.
He said reusable bags are currently used by many leading textile shops, hoteliers and traders in the country.
Even food manufacturers still using non- degradable bags to pack food items including vegetable, meat products, sausages, spices, sugar, tea leaves, dhal etc. and authorities should focus attention towards this, he said.
It is pathetic to say that using of polythene bags by super markets will be increased to the maximum when expanding the existing super market chain.
He said in major countries including UK, USA and Singapore, almost all super markets there promote reusable shopping bags.
Chairman Dias said he is prepared to extend any organization about the know- how of reducing polythene bags as he has done similar operations abroad.

Pesi Pestonjee: The last true gentleman
Living out the Churchillian dictum Never give up was the affable P.N. Pestonjee, affectionately referred to as Pesi, always remembered by his grandchildren as their Papa and fondly as their Pups.
Many people would describe Pesi as a soft-spoken, disciplined and knowledgeable gentleman. It was certainly these qualities that made him ever so popular with his friends and the many others that came to know him. To us, his grandchildren, he will always be remembered for his loud, hearty laughter, his sharp sense of style, immaculate dress sense, no-nonsense attitude to education and learning, his smile of sunshine and his heart of solid gold. While he only got to meet two of his great grandchildren, his family that remains will endeavour to pass on the essence of his legendary qualities to our next generations.
Because of his humble nature, not many realise the extent of Peshotans achievements and contributions which have helped promote and enhance his beloved homeland of Sri Lanka. A keen sportsman from a young age, he excelled at cricket and tennis while attending secondary school at Royal College in the 1940s. However, table tennis was his true passion and it was the sport at which he excelled. He went on to win the TT National Doubles Championships with Naro Udeshi on two separate occasions at the ages of 14 and 16. He worked assiduously to promote table tennis at the YMCA and across the island, and was even President of the SLTTA at one time.
He also took it upon himself to help a number of family members, employees and friends over the years. Most notable is his contribution to the MRI Scanner Fund for the General Hospital in Colombo, set up by the notable Neurosurgeon Dr. Colvin Samarasinghe. Peshotan was the first donor to the Fund despite many other affluent individuals laughing at Dr. Samarasinghes request. Such generosity was only one example of the character of this man who, due to life circumstances, was not even able to finish secondary school.
We have been made better by his example and we will continue to improve ourselves because of the legend he leaves behind. Now the room will no longer echo with his laughter, since he has moved on into the mists of ever after. A golden heart stopped beating, hardworking hands at rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us, He only takes the best.

Dr. Richard Pathirana : Politician who stood for party growth
Leaders who commit to lead with resolute vision, fortified with a firm humanistic mission, have lasting impact on their followers, teams and organisations. Dr. Richard Pathirana, former Galle District Parliamentarian and minister, lives eternally in the hearts and minds of the people of Sri Lanka, as he was one such politician dedicated and committed towards the service of the masses.
He was a gallant political leader who rightly accomplished the task of serving people as assigned by his destiny.
Born at Kapuhempala, a charming hamlet in the Akmeemana electorate in Galle and after a remarkable educational service as a devoted teacher and an efficient principal, he entered active politics after 1977. Subsequently, he held the portfolios of Education and Higher Education Minister from 1994 to 2000 and State Administration, Home Affairs and Administrative Reforms Minister from 2000-2001 in former President Chandrika Kumaranatungas government.
His long and outstanding political journey was not a smooth and relaxed one, for he had to face numerous obstacles from various conservative and regressive elements who did not wish to see the rise of a promising new political leader in the region. However, Richard Pathirana who had been a revolutionary trade unionist and a mature civil activist could resist all such impediments triumphantly and reach the height of political domain.
As politician junior to him, the most vital lesson I learnt from him was his unmoved loyalty and faithfulness towards the party and its leadership. During the times of political storms that lashed over the Sri Lanka Freedom Party from time to time, Richard Pathirana at all times stood with the party and its leadership.
The devastating defeat of the SLFP at the 1977 election was a violent political tsunami that swept the party. The number of Parliamentary seats that the party secured in 1971 was reduced to a mere eight slots in 1977.
Following the defeat, disloyal factions of the party attempted to destroy it. A number of party leaders amazingly including Madam Bandaranaikes son, Anura Bandaranaike and party secretary Maitripala Senanayake demanded the removal of Sirimavo Bandaranaike from the post of party president.
In that power struggle between the son and the mother, Richard Pathirana with no hesitation joined the group who claimed the continuation of Mrs. Bandaranaike as party chairperson and fought sturdily in defence of the party leader. In that political game, the then SLFP chief organiser of the Akmeemana electorate, Senapala Samarasekara also supported the Anura faction. Despite the opposition of the chief organiser to Mrs. Bandaranaike, Richard Pathirana remained loyal to the party leadership.
During the past, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party faced various political problems which were very similar to the contemporary challenges of the party.
As the party experiences today, during the period of the United Front government, a group of 14 led by Anura Bandaranaike and Maitripala Senanayake left the ruling coalition and joined the opposition. Such development of discord in the party circles paved the way for painful defeat in 1977. Nevertheless, the majority of grateful party men loyal to the party, joined hands with the party leadership, amidst many hardships. Dr. Riachard Pathirana was a forerunner in such tussles.
Owing to his commitment in active politics, he was subject to political victimisation as a militant trade unionist. However, no one could stop Richard Pathirana in his revolutionary move.
Riachard Pathirana played a leading role in the 1980 General Strike which was the first working class struggle against the 1977 J.R. Jayewardene regime. Following that futile general strike Richard Pathirana was transferred to a number of schools as political punishment. But he was discouraged in his fight or retreated in his rebellious march.
As the then SLFP chief organizer, he joined the Anura-Maitri faction. The party leadership decided to appoint him as the successor to the then organiser Senapala Samarasekara.
It was not an easy task for Richard to reorganise the party cardres which had been separated into several groups. As a mature and experienced politician, Dr. Richard Pathiran could reunite all alienated factions under one banner.
He was a rare kind of politician who loved and cared for his followers greatly. Without enjoying the luxuries and perks of Cabinet portfolios, he constantly toured throughout every nook and corner of his electorate and of the entire Galle district as well.
He maintained an extreme faith and trust in his people and in turn people were also grateful and sincere to him. The peoples great love and trust was well manifested in every election he faced until his demise.
He attributed all his election victories as remarkable triumphs of the people of Galle. He did his best for the development of the region and for the uplift of public living standards. His fervent ambition was to do the utmost to solve the unemployment problem of youth in the province. He provided infrastructure facilities for every village of the area in the best possible way.

Army to shrink deployment
The Army will not close down camps in the North and East, but will shrink its deployment in a manner that will not jeopardise national security, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said.
We are ready to release another 522 acres in the North and East but we have to adjust ourselves prior to releasing these lands to the owners. We have our own infrastructure requirements and for us to move, I have to now construct billets. Hence, I have requested money for this from the government and around Rs 800 million is required of which we have already been granted Rs.100 million so far. However, even if the balance is given to me today, I cannot have these camps move overnight and I require at least around five months to construct the basic facilities to shift my troops.
Therefore, when the money is given within six months I will ensure that the lands we are occupying will be released and we will move, the Army Commander said.
By July 31, 2018 the Sri Lanka Army had released 65,133 acres in the North and East and currently the Army occupies around 19,300 acres.
As at July 31, 2018 the Army was occupying 16,115 acres in the Northern Province in the Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mullaithivu, Mannar and Vavuniya districts.
In the Eastern province the army is occupying 3,185 acres in the Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara districts.
Of these lands occupied by the Army only 2,621 acres are private lands belonging to the people and the balance 16,680 acres are all government land being occupied by the Army.
Speaking to the Daily News Army Commander Lt.Gen Senanayake said priority will be given to the releasing of private lands that belong to the civilians.
By 2009 at the end of the war the military was occupying around 84,434 acres of land which has been released to the rightful owners in stages.
However, he said that this in no way will hinder national security. We will have our presence there but we are basically shrinking our troops deployment and releasing more lands to the private owners, he said.
Responding to allegations that the majority of troops are deployed in the North, Lt. Gen. Senanayake said, By looking at the figures and the number of camps some may feel that way. But, when you take the whole island for that matter, Central, South and West and other provinces, there are much less troops being deployed. But why we are there in the North is because there was a problem there. It is a mere nine years since the war ended and I wish and pray that the Sri Lanka Police will take over control in these areas in time to come. They can have their paramilitary forces and continue while we can be confined to barracks.
However, he noted that todays issue is policing. I am not trying to lay any blame on the police but they have their limitations and restrictions in terms of manpower and resources, whereas the army has more manpower and resources than any other deployment. Hence, we are not currently reducing deployment and closing down camps but the camps will be shrunk. Even though we shrink the numbers to release more lands, we can still maintain the security at the same level, the Army Commander assured.

Banned Smith retakes top spot in ICC rankings
DUBAI, Monday : Banned Australian batsman Steve Smith reclaimed top spot in the ICC Test batting rankings from Indias Virat Kohli on Monday, despite not having played since March.
The 29-year-old was suspended for a year and stripped of the captaincy by Cricket Australia following his part in the infamous ball-tampering scandal against South Africa, but his ranking points have not changed.
India skipper Kohli had taken the number one place after scoring 200 runs in his teams first-Test defeat by England, but slipped back after managing only 40 in the second match of the series at Lords last week.
Smith is currently playing T20 cricket in the Caribbean Premier League as he prepares for a possible return to the international game next year. Englands all-time leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson remains top of the bowlers rankings after taking nine wickets in their crushing innings victory in London. - AFP

Beyond the walls of division
With a dream to be an Entrepreneur, Head Boy of Nalanda College Colombo, Kavindu Wickramasinghe is a leader who has the drive to make his dreams come true. Perfect Prefects features Wickramasinghe who is ready to help restore peoples faith in humanity.
His message to young people has everything to do with following ones heart. Passion for self- advancement and compassion for others. With todays hectic lifestyles we have little time to enjoy life and enjoy the simple things in life.
Struggle to survive
Follow your heart. Be passionate about contributing to society and always be ready to help another human being. I would like to see people happy. In todays context, people are struggling to survive and they have forgotten how to be happy, said Wickramasinghe.
Becoming an entrepreneur and starting his own business is his biggest dream and goal in life. Getting a team together to do this and achieving great heights in a way that is socially responsible is his ambition. And he intends to do all of this in an ethical manner, keeping in mind that values and morals are as important as becoming successful. For him a human life is important.
In whatever field I choose to take after my school life, I want to make a difference in peoples lives and even in a small way make them happy, pointed out Wickramasinghe.
To restore faith in humanity is something that Wickramasinghe regards as imperative. Because right now people are becoming extremely disheartened with society. Especially the youth need to be told that there is still hope and many people are good people. They need to be reminded of this. The hopes of an entire world and civilizations rest in the hands of the youth. Without thinking of our differences let us think about our similarities. We need to break down the walls of division.
Belief in the good
In todays context, we need a role model, who can inspire the youth to form strong opinions on how to eradicate poverty and believe that there is good in society. There are times that are dark and seem hopeless. But you still need to keep believing in others. Todays leaders are fighting over various issues and forgetting the simple fact that we are all humans. There is such needless bloodshed, explained Wickramasinghe.
When facing obstacles he keeps calm. There is no need to jump the gun. One must not be too hasty when confronted with a difficulty.
I like to keep calm when I face an obstacle. It gives me time and peace of mind, to go to the bottom of the problem. Then I come with the best solution needed. Being calm and addressing the correct point, helps when handling pressure. The ability to speak to others in their preferred tone of voice would help to bring down the tension, stated Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe credits his school for what he is today, citing that Nalanda has produced many great Sri Lankans in many fields in society.
Nalanda College has done this by the education and exposure they give to the child making the child understand his true potential. I have been fortunate to explore many opportunities in terms of both educational and extra-curricular activities at Nalanda. I was able to finish my A/L education with good colours and I was also able to become the all-island national champion of Rifle shooting, age group under 16. This was because of the guidance that I received at school. I represented the senior debating team of Nalanda College for four years from 2014  2018. I was able to win many titles for the college. It was a huge privilege for me to become the head prefect of Nalanda College after entering the college as a grade five scholarship student, added Wickramasinghe.
Inspiration to loyalty
Charismatic Justin Trudeau is a leader who Wickramasinghe admires. Trudeaus dedication to Canada and its people is an inspiration to Wickramasinghe who also believes that the masses need to be loyal to their country and work in the best interests of the country. Patriotism is a priority for this young man. Wickramasinghe has that feel for the people.
I admire the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau because he is a young leader who has an immense love for his country and his people. He is a true gentleman both in his political and professional life. One difference I would like to make in my own way, is helping to eradicate poverty with the help of all the others in the world who want to make a change, said Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe has many interests in the outside world. Some of these interests are cricket, climate change and eradicating poverty. He also regards the world cup victories by the Sri Lankan side in 1996 and 2014 as events that are memorable to him.
Wickramasinghe feels that the key to success, happiness and peace is knowing that what you are doing is correct and know that what you are doing is making a positive difference in the life of someone else. In other words, seeing others happy should make you happy.
I would like to thank the Ven. Maha Sanga, our principal sir, teachers and my friends and family. They have helped me a lot and inspired me in many ways. My family have always placed their trust in me and supported me right throughout my journey, summed up Wickramasinghe.

Borgs son Leo wins Swedish U-16 championship
Stockholm, Monday: Leo Borg, the 15-year-old son of tennis legend Bjorn Borg, looks to be following in his fathers footsteps, claiming the Swedish under-16 outdoor tennis championship at the weekend.
Leo Borg won two straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, to defeat Ross Weibull on Sunday to take home the junior title for the second year in a row.
Last year, Borg won both the singles and doubles national championships for 14-year-olds.
So far this year, Borg has won the indoor Salk Open junior championship, placed second in the indoor national championship and second in the Bastad junior championship.
Clearly Leo is someone we believe strongly in and who were going to work hard with so he can develop further, his coach Rickard Billing told daily Aftonbladet.
Were taking one day at a time, working hard. We feel hes doing well.
Leo Borg resembles his father with his tall, lean frame, long blond hair, and blue eyes.
Borg senior won 11 Grand Slam titles, including five Wimbledons, and was ranked world number one for 109 consecutive weeks from 1979 to 1981. AFP

Boycott rates Indias performance Nave, Irresponsible, Stupid
Former England great Geoffrey Boycott reckons India will have to show some mental strength and discipline quickly to avoid an embarrassing 5-0 thrashing. India lost the second test within four days by an innings.
The visitors could manage just 107 and 130 in their two innings with none of their batters managing even a half-century in the second test.
Great teams and great players should not buckle as easily as India did at Lords just because the ball swings and seams, wrote Boycott in his column in the Daily Telegraph. The whole point of playing cricket in different countries on different pitches and in different climatic conditions is to test your technique, character and ability to adapt.
So far, the Indian players have let themselves and their supporters down. The batting has been so naive and irresponsible, it has bordered on stupidity. Wafting drives at tempting outswingers thoughtless.
Test cricket is becoming a ridiculous mismatch with most teams winning at home and failing miserably abroad. India, the No 1 team in the world, have been awful in two Tests.  Daily Telegraph

Mel Medura opens its doors to digital and other behavioural addictions
Break free  from the cell!
Addiction occurs in many forms and for someone to be diagnosed with an addiction-related disorder the presence of physical dependence characterized by high (or low) tolerance levels and withdrawal symptoms is a requirement.
When it was realized that over 30% of suicides are linked to Alcohol and Drug addiction, the Sumithrayo Drug Demand Reduction Program (Mel Medura) was set up in 1984. Since then Mel Medura has been in the forefront of rehabilitating those with difficulties arising from the misuse and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
Now Mel Madura is opening its doors to welcome people who need help with behavioural addictions. These include smartphones and other digital devices, the internet, video games, pornography, social networking and gambling.
Compulsive behaviour
Behavioural addiction can, however, occur with all the negative consequences in a persons life but without the physical issues faced by people who compulsively engage in drug and alcohol abuse.
It is this compulsive nature of the behaviour that is often indicative of a behavioural addiction. Behavioural addictions are usually preceded by feelings of tension or arousal before and pleasure, gratification, relief, guilt or remorse afterwards.
The failure to resist an impulse, drive, or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others is the essential feature of behavioural addictions. All behavioural addictions are characterized by a recurrent pattern of behaviour that has this essential feature within a specific domain. The repetitive engagement in these behaviours ultimately interferes with functioning in other domains. In this respect, the behavioural addictions do resemble disorders caused by substance use. Individuals with substance addictions also report difficulties in resisting the urge to consume alcohol or use drugs.
Smartphone rival real-life companions since they can produce a never-ending stream of interesting things to listen to and watch. Our short attention span lifestyles are training us to seek new information at every moment so phones with those constant news updates are more engaging than face-to-face conversations and this can result in fractured relationships. Each time you get a Like on social media or some reward in a game a little dopamine is injected into the reward centre of your brain. So like smoking a cigarette  you want to have it again.
Video game addiction may seem relatively harmless when compared to substance addiction because many people can play video games without ever developing a problem. However, compulsive video game play can interrupt a persons ability to connect positively with others and have healthy relationships, maintain responsibilities at work, and make choices that support their physical and mental health (e.g., eating regularly or healthily, going to the doctor, etc.). Ultimately, they may end up completely isolating themselves from the real world, losing their ability to function, be with family, and achieve any goals outside of the video game world.
Upload connection
As in internet addiction, many people are compulsively using social media. They are posting the minute details of their life, spending hours taking photos to post on Instagram, editing videos to upload to YouTube, updating their posts on Twitter and Facebook, and instantly responding to others on those same social media forums. Unfortunately, it can mean that they do not make positive in-person connections and may ultimately reduce their options in life. Social media use can lead to addiction if it is compulsive and disruptive to the persons ability to function in everyday life. Chronic social media use can contribute to anxiety in users who often describe feelings of discomfort and agitation if they are unable to connect  an issue that could potentially be termed a withdrawal symptom.
Porn addiction shares many of the same characteristics as a substance use disorder. One of the important criteria in defining an addiction is the development of tolerance to the addictive substance. Over time, a porn addict may require more frequent and increasingly explicit porn to experience the same high or excitement as he or she originally did. Compulsive viewing of pornography can lead to the cycle of addiction, which involves a craving stage where the individual is preoccupied or anticipating the viewing of porn.
This is followed by actively viewing porn and then experiencing a negative emotional state, where the individual can become irritable or hostile. If left untreated, porn addiction can lead to broken or troubled intimate relationships, feelings of shame and guilt, problems with work or school, job loss, financial troubles, and divorce. Many porn addicts also suffer from other mental health issues, such as alcohol or substance use disorders, and mood disorders.
A Bio Psychosocial approach is what Mel Medura strives to focus on and implement. Emphasis is on respect, the focus is on strengths, the importance of personal choice, and self-determination of goals, all of which are crucial for the person struggling with substance and behavioural addictions. The service is delivered in a personal and engaging style where clients leave feeling hopeful and good about themselves while looking forward to coming back for future sessions.

China printing currencies for Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
BEIJING: China is printing currencies for governments of several countries, including Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Brazil, the Chinese media reported, quoting a top official of the state-owned banknote printer.
Liu Guisheng, Chairman of China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, wrote in an article in May in China Finance, a bi-monthly journal run by Chinas central bank, that China obtained the first international commercial order for printing money from Nepal in 2015.
The state-owned firm won the bids of 100 rupees, 1,000 rupees and 5 rupees from Nepal, Liu said.
Since then, the company had seized the opportunities brought by the initiative and successfully won contracts for currency production projects in a number of countries, including Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Brazil and Poland, Liu wrote.
The China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation confirmed that money production plants across the country were running at near full capacity to meet an unusually high quota set by the government this year, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

Politicians are hired representatives of the people
I am spurred by D. Weeratungas letter focusing on the mandate given to politicians by the people. He has quite forthrightly highlighted several home truths about our existing Political Administration system. It implies that politicians are no more an Honorary class by itself but a coterie of hired representatives or employees of the sovereign voter. It is no secret that they are amply rewarded for discharging the mandate given to them. People have now taken it for granted that one should enter Politics to make money. Gone are the days where honourable politicians dumped their own money and property to do politics and emerged as paupers!
Given this scenario, the voter or the taxpayer should enjoy the prerogative of laying down the eligibility criteria for the candidates they want to hire as their representatives as in the case of any other employer. The contesting Political parties shall act as Man Power Agencies who should prepare District wise merit lists of political professionals for nomination at elections. Such lists approved by the Elections Department on the nomination date will be available for their principals, who will make a general assessment of the Quality of the teams in addition to the Party Election Manifesto when they vote for the Party of their choice.
Towards meeting this objective, we call upon the Elections Commission to deliver peoples expectations by laying down stringent eligibility criteria and selection procedure for the candidates applying for the posts of Peoples representatives. The political parties would then be compelled to comply by the rule of law.
No doubt, all the legal impediments have to be removed by the concerned authorities to meet this long outstanding expectation of the voters. Looking for examples in other countries which operate in different political environments is an exercise in futility.
We are confident that all civil organisations including Paffrel and Caffe will work towards achieving this much-needed requirement for a mature democracy in Sri Lanka.

Coming, ready or not: thousands pour in for Asian Games
Jakarta, Tuesday: Thousands of athletes are flying in as Indonesia makes final preparations to host the Asian Games -- the worlds second biggest multi-sports event, taking place against a backdrop of terrorism fears, environmental concerns and logistical headaches.
Organisers are making reassuring noises about their arrangements but Indonesia has never hosted a sports event on this scale, with 16,000 competitors and officials descending on Jakarta and Palembang, a sleepy port city on Sumatra island.
While the Olympics has a slightly higher number of participants, the Asian Games is ahead in terms of complexity: it has 40 sports, including the full Olympic programme and some lesser-known regional favourites.
Olympic heavyweights China will expect to retain their position at the top of the medals table, ahead of Japan and South Korea -- who will march with North Korea at the opening ceremony, and form joint teams in womens basketball, canoeing and rowing.
For many of the 45 competing nations, who represent about two-thirds of humanity, the quadrennial event is the pinnacle of the sporting calendar, offering a chance for medals which remain elusive at Olympic level.
However, Saturdays opening ceremony comes just three months after Indonesia suffered its deadliest terror attack in more than 10 years, when suicide bombers killed 13 people in the nations second-biggest city, Surabaya.
Indonesias notorious haze from forest fires is another concern, while organisers are hoping to mitigate Jakartas grinding traffic with dedicated lanes, banning odd and even licence plate numbers on alternate days and closing schools.
Minor hiccups abound, from misspelt signs to a clumsy attempt to hide a foul-smelling, toxic waterway running past the athletes village by covering it with a nylon mesh.
In Palembang, fans angered by a football result ripped up seats at an Asian Games stadium last month, and Indonesias first light rapid transit railway has suffered a series of malfunctions in the countdown to the start of competition.
Indonesia agreed to step in as hosts at short notice after Vietnam withdrew in 2014, put off by the eye-watering projected costs. AFP

Artygalle murder - Part 4:
Conspiracy silenced at last
Death of Francis Artygalle and birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics: Scandalous murder; and the sensational trial 112 years ago is the true story of emergence of Senanayakes, Kotelawalas and Jayewardenes in Sri Lankan Politics, the source that financed their activities, and also the concealed hostility, enmity and rivalry for preeminence among the three families that formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy for many decades that commenced during the time of this saga and reached its peak in 1952, enduring up to the end of last century.
Piloris, nick-named Pilla, a native from Wadduwa, was competent in handling a gun following his training during Boer War in Europe (Second Boer War 18991902 was fought between Briton and two Boer states in South Africa). Baron Perera struck a deal with Piloris to act as a hired assassin, but he was kept in the dark by cousin Singhoni, in fact even the identity of his future target was not revealed to him.
A gun suitable for the job was selected jointly by the two ex-policemen cousins, Baron and Singhoni at Walkers, Fort, while Kotelawala either purposely kept away from events or was busy with his new enterprise away in Japan. They found a lodge in Pettah for Piloris, and entrusted the safe custody of the good quality weapon purchased for Rs. 25 especially for the purpose also to his custody, for a few days as scheduled. The hired attacker was held in reserve in this secret hide-out until Francis Dixon Artygalles next visit to Colombo for stay at reputed C P Dias residence in Pettah.
Who is P. C. Dias
P. C. Dias was the head-master at Wesley College, Pettah, from the time Francis Artygalle was a student at the same school. When the disturbances broke out between the two communities in 1915, C. P. Dias was a senior member of the Colombo Municipality, and also the Principal of Wesley College in Dais Place which was named after him. He prepared an account on the disorder at the request of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, the Educated Ceylonese Representative in the Legislative Council, which stated among other matters;
The disturbances appear to have been a sudden outburst of feelings of resentment on the part of lower classes of people, the Artisans and the unemployed
Francis spent most of his time at Kahatagaha mines being extremely busy with the strenuous workload of supervising the 3,000 strong workforce and attending to the tedious task of ensuring that the deadlines are met on export orders for plumbago which was in severe demand in Europe at the time.
Francis Artygalle did run an office in Colombo for expediting shipments with shippers, and for liaising with the banks, but carried out part of his work from PC Dias residence, where he was very much at home and stayed over for a few days a month as a habit. Singhoni and Baron, the two accomplices kept a watchful eye on Artigalles movements and on his next visit to Dias residence.
Around 8 p.m. on December 5, 1906, Piloris was instructed to wait behind a hedge near the gate with the loaded gun. Baron strolled into the compound followed by Singoni, who called out Francis twice for the prey to recognize the voice and walk up to courtyard, but he evaded showing his face, and allowed his cousin Baron to swap pleasantries with him. This was to mark time for Piloris, who had passed basic marksmanship in a military background to take aim at his target in the darkness.
Singhoni Perera stood 15-20 feet in front of the main entrance to the house of Dias. Francis Dixon Artygalle, the wealthy young man who was on the verandah walked up to the lawn in response to the visitors call Francis, Francis! The next moment a gunshot was heard by several people in the vicinity. The first few who rushed to the scene found Francis Dixon lying on his back holding the stomach making painful whispers. The young proprietary planter was rushed to the General hospital by Dias and the men assembled at the spot.
Singhoni Perera and Baron quickly vanished from the place, having already given firm directives to hired assassin, Piloris to take a specified route in returning for the collection of his balance contract money. He was initially paid only half of the contract money on the understanding that the balance would be settled on successful conclusion of the job.
Obviously the conspirators strategy was for Singhoni and Baron to murder Piloris at an identified isolated spot en-route. There was no electricity then, no street lights or lamps except in the Fort where gas lamps lit only the main streets till around 8 p.m. by which time the city goes to sleep. Their plan was to ambush the gunman and strangle him to death without firing a gun as per Singhonis subsequent confessions to jail guards.
Three assailants
Forensic specialists opined that the firing had been from behind a shrub in the garden from a squatting position. The three assailants made a quick depart on different paths under the cover of darkness. Piloris defied his instructions to take a particular path by Singhoni; was it Kotelawala who planned for the elimination of assailant to avoid the risk of an untrustworthy third party flourishing freely and wanted the murder carried out at an earlier marked out isolated spot en-route Piloris, the hired assassin who had already collected an advance was happy with it; but was smart enough to sense a risk to his life if he took the specified route back to his lodging.
The intelligent ex-soldier knew Inspector Kotelawala and other ex-policemen so well that there was no way that he can escape the wrath of themthey were certain to have had a plan B in mind, perhaps Singhoni and Baron misses their target of second murder for the day. After a session of brain-storming with all the pros and cons, he arrived at the safest gamble. Piloris concluded that the best option would be to admit murder, implicate the culprits, plead guilty and become a crown witness: sounds smarter than all three suspected collaborators.
As revealed at the trial, main suspect John Kotelawala using his extensive police knowledge planned and rehearsed the crime applying different options until he and Singhoni were contented with the final strategy. John set sail to Japan, to be out of the island during the murder and make an excuse for himself, the prosecution demanded, while the defending lawyers maintained that John had sailed to Japan on a business engagement. A couple of weeks later the ship bringing him back arrived in port of Colombo for the CID sleuths to go on board the ship. John Kotelawela was getting dressed to go ashore when J. H. Daniel, Assistant Superintendent of Police arrested John and took him to the Magistrates court for the relatives to responded promptly, but bail was not granted.
The Senanayakes and Jayewardenes, brothers-in-law of victim Artigalle put pressure on authorities sending the ex-policemen to remand prison at Welikada pending trial.

Crows to pick up litter
An historical theme park in France is training six crows to pick up cigarette ends and rubbish in a bid to keep it clean.
Nicolas de Villiers, president of the Puy de Fou Park in Vendee, said the initiative would show visitors that nature itself could teach them to care for the environment.
He said, "The goal is not just to clear up, because the visitors are generally careful to keep things clean."
The six "particularly intelligent" rooks are to be put to work from Friday. Each time the rook drops a piece of rubbish or cigarette end into the box, they will be rewarded with a small nugget of food.
Puy du Fou is in the west of the France, and is one of the country's most popular theme parks.
It features more than 20 shows, each with a different historical setting, ranging from Vikings to musketeers to flamenco dancing.
Birds of prey shows are also a popular part of its repertoire.

CSE hosts knowledge sharing workshop
A capital market delegation comprising of representatives from the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) and 36 Stockbroker firms from Nepal recently visited Sri Lanka for a two-day knowledge sharing workshop hosted by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The visit saw the delegation participate in sessions on trading infrastructure, capital market regulation, clearing and settlement and other topics on stock market operations.
Commenting on the visit, Priyaraj Regmi, the President of the Stock Brokers Association of Nepal said, The program was fantastic and we learned more than we expected. It helps us to implement the Internet based Automated Online Trading System in NEPSE, improve our services to investors and introduce new avenues, services or instruments in the Nepalese Capital market.
The share trading tradition in Nepal dates back to 1937 with the flotation of shares by Biratnagar Jute Mills Ltd. and Nepal Bank Ltd. The Introduction of the Company Act in 1964, the first issuance of Government Bonds in 1964 and the establishment of the Securities Exchange Center in 1976 are said to be the other significant developments relating to capital markets in the country.
The Securities Exchange Center was established with an objective of facilitating and promoting the growth of capital markets. Before conversion into a stock exchange, it was the only capital markets institution undertaking the job of brokering, underwriting, managing public issue, market making for government bonds and other financial services.
The Nepal Government, under a program initiated to reform capital markets converted Securities Exchange Center into the Nepal Stock Exchange in 1993, where NEPSE opened its trading floor in1994. At present, NEPSE consists of 50 member brokers and two market makers.
The visit was facilitated as part of an ongoing effort by CSE to advance cooperation and mutual development with peer exchanges and capital market organizations from around the world. Such an effort has seen the CSE actively engage in a number of MoUs with regional exchanges and depositories in the recent past.

Death threat on SLTB driver
A private bus owner along with several of his thugs had allegedly threatened a Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) bus driver with death at the 6th mile post in Minipe, warning him to run his bus much later than the private buses.
The Hasalaka Police arrested the suspects yesterday. They were to be produced before the Mahiyangana Magistrate. The Police arrested the suspects based on a video footage recorded by a commuter in the SLTB bus.
The private bus owner with several of his thugs had levelled the threats armed with clubs around 6 am last Friday.
The SLTB bus was bound to Hasalaka Kolongoda from Randenigala. The SLTB bus which is operated by the Hasalaka Bus Depot, operates as a school bus during the morning hours. However, the Police said that there were many complaints against the thugs who level threats against public servants hindering their service.
According to the people of the area, the private bus owner owns several buses, while two buses operates on the Randenigala road without route permits.

## Title: Of dust bowls and poor spectator turn outs

Of dust bowls and poor spectator turn outs
The poor turnouts witnessed at the Test series and the five-match ODI series against second ranked Test and third ranked ODI South Africa team is a clear indication that the cricket loving public cannot be fooled into spending money to come and watch a cricket match played on dust bowls.
That is one critical factor the local cricket administrators appear to be missing out on. Cricket is in the business of entertainment and people pay good money to turn up and be entertained with batsmen hitting fours and sixes and generally play exciting cricket. However, when you produce dust bowls in their quest to win at any cost, and expect local cricket fans to come and support their team it is not going to happen as even the die-hard supporter sees no value in winning matches in this fashion. Nobody in his right mind will pay good hard-earned money to come and watch batsman scratching around as if they were locked up in a poultry coop.
The consequences of engaging in this brand of cricket are manifold, resulting in long term repercussions. A few obvious ones are:
(a) The gates were opened during the second Test and it was freely publicized over the media. Sadly, the stands remained deserted in spite of the number 2 ranked team in the world playing here in Colombo. Normally, when you have the caliber of players such as Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis and the likes on show you would expect there to be a stampede to go and watch these world class players for free. So, why didnt that happen
(b) Playing on such dry surfaces also deprives our batsmen of playing their natural game as evident from the poor batting display from most of the top/middle order batsmen. Only Dimuth Karunaratne showed any signs of consistency scoring an aggregate of 356 runs during the series, which should cause much concern to the coaching staff. The weaknesses of our batsmen playing spin bowling should be addressed as a matter of urgency.
(c) Fortunately for us, the South African selectors blundered with their bowling combination for the second test by playing three seamers in spite of the bone-dry pitch that was on offer at the SSC. Had they picked the second spinner as they ought to have, the result could well have been quite different.
(d) The South Africans recorded their highest score of 290 in the fourth and last innings of the second Test. It was clear that their batsmen were coming to terms with the conditions and the Sri Lankan spinners with each innings. Had this been a 5-match series the possibility of them turning tables on us cannot be ruled out completely.
(e) The elimination of the toss during bilateral series has been discussed extensively at the ICC in an effort to avoid lopsided games and level out the playing field. After much deliberation the Cricket Committee has resisted pressure to do away with the toss and instead called upon member countries to produce fair tracks. If the recently concluded series in Sri Lanka is a benchmark to go by, that call is unlikely to be heeded by any member country.
The need of the hour is for the ICC to be far more assertive and appoint independent curators similar to the rest of the match officials and protect the entertainment value of the game and prevent broadcasters and advertisers from getting short changed with games been lopsided devoid of entertainment and games finishing within 2-3 days when it is supposed to go on for 5 days.
The euphoria over recording a 2-0 Test series victory against the Proteas soon became undone when Sri Lanka lost the first three matches to concede the five-match ODI series to South Africa.
It is quite understandable that the average cricket fan rejoices any victory that our cricket team chalks up. The remaining two games (that Sri Lanka won) were dead rubbers and it was no surprise the spectator turnout was poor.
As highlighted the exuberance of scoring cheap brownie points by chalking up wins in this fashion is not going to fool anyone, particularly the knowledgeable cricket fans in the country. On a more positive note the Sri Lankan captain was seen advocating better playing surfaces after the losses in the first two ODIs. This undoubtedly is a breadth of fresh air, and a welcome change of policy.

England star Stokes acquitted of affray
BRISTOL, Tuesday: England cricketer Ben Stokes was found not guilty of affray in a unanimous decision by a jury in less than three hours of deliberations on Tuesday following a trial at Bristol Crown Court.
The 27-year-old -- whose co-defendant Ryan Ali was also found unanimously not guilty -- had been charged following a brawl hours after England played the West Indies in a one-day international in Bristol, southwest England, in September last year.
His wife, Clare, cried when the not guilty verdicts were returned while Stokes closed his eyes with relief and then looked up. Stokes shook hands with Ali on leaving the dock at the end of the trial that lasted seven days.
At the start of the trial the prosecution tried to amend the indictment and charge Stokes with two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm but this was rejected by the judge.
And half way through the trial Stokess legal team attempted to have the case against him dropped but this was also refused by the judge. AFP

Sri Lanka Railways: A snapshot of issues and ideas for improvement:
Focus on the track
Several railway trade unions launched a lightning strike last Wednesday over salary anomalies. The strike was called off after four days but hundreds of thousands of commuters were stranded. Angry commuters took to the streets, some called for privatisation of the railways. Sri Lanka faces a huge problem with public transport which is driving commuters to use private transport. A study by W. J. Weerawardana estimates that 65% of the road space is used by 38% of the passengers; the increase in the use of private vehicles is the major cause of traffic congestion.
At rush hours and school times, the traffic is almost at the point of gridlock. Parking is also a problem. If even a half-decent public transport option were available many more commuters would use it.
Standards of service at the railway are shoddy and reforms to railways must form a part of a larger plan to fix public transport. A summary of some key issues follows, with some ideas for improved services.
The railways lost 6.7 bn in 2016 (7.7 bn in 2015). The railways appear to have been losing money since 1947. The expenditure of the railways exceeded costs by 10% in 1950 but by 1968 this had grown to 52.4%. The wages policy of the government and the policy limitations imposed by the government in the pricing of passenger and goods transport were factors that contributed to this situation. This has not changed much: in 2016 costs exceeded revenues by 49.4% (2015: 45.09%) for broadly similar reasons.
Lack of funds
Fares per kilometre range from 50 cents to a maximum of Rs.2.00 for 2nd and 3rd class travel. 1st class fares range from Rs.1.60-3.60 per kilometre.
Revenue does not cover even salaries. Salaries exceeded revenues by 31.89% in 2016 (28.9% in 2015). Only 42% of the trains run on time (39% in 2015). Delays exceeded 10 minutes for 43% of the trains (46% in 2015).
The assets of the railway are poorly utilised. Income from leases of railway land was Rs.119.58 m in 2016. Lease arrears not collected amounted to Rs.1.8 bn at end of 2016. The Auditor General notes: Lands about 12,000 acres in extent belong to the Department of Sri Lanka Railways had remained idle for about 150 years without giving on lease or utilizing for another purpose.
Fares are priced well below operating costs, the trains grimy and overcrowded. Maintaining rail fares at uneconomically low levels is politically attractive but has led to the deterioration of the rolling stock and infrastructure due to a lack of funds for new investment.
There has been a steady increase in passenger numbers from just under 100 m in 2011 to 136 m in 2016, but the service does not appear to have been able to respond adequately to new demands for expanded services or improved quality.
Quality and efficiency
Based on the current operating and cost structure fares would need to double to just to meet recurring expenses and rise still further if the capital expenditure is to be financed. The Government spent Rs.30 bn on capital expenditure in 2015. (2014: Rs.34.6 bn, 2013: Rs.20.2 bn). While a significant fare increase is needed and may be accepted if accompanied by improved service, passengers cannot expect to pay for inefficiency. For example, the COPA has questioned excess staff recruitment (of 1,588) and payment of overtime in contravention of the Establishment Code.
Thus there is a need to restructure of operations to improve service quality and efficiency. In a lecture delivered last year at the Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport, Dr. Priyanka Seneviratne claimed SLRs weaknesses stem mainly from lack of timely investment in fleet replacement, technology, and workforce development in the past.
The Ministry of Internal Transport confirms that 65% of the rolling stock is over 30-35 years old which increases the likelihood of breakdowns, increases maintenance costs and impairs service quality.
Dr. Senevirate identified the following measures to enhance revenue:
(i) adjusting fares and tariffs to better reflect costs and improved services;
(ii) leasing more real estate and advertising space at market prices, and
(iii) partnering with the private sector to provide freight and ancillary services such as catering, courier, and real estate management.
The railway currently partners with the private sector to provide a luxury carriage on selected routes.
This could be expanded to cover other routes or possibly even to a whole train, covering, for example, additional services at peak times to cater to office commuters. Service contracts where, for example, railway catering is contracted out could provide increased revenues and improve service. Operations of toilets, canteens could be handled in a similar manner. Idle land could also be redeveloped in partnership with private developers.
The dilemma is ensuring that a public-private partnership is beneficial when corruption is endemic and state capacity is limited.
Sri Lankas railways are a drain on the Treasury. With tight budgetary constraints, the Government will face increasing difficulties in allocating adequate resources to maintain, let alone develop, the railways.
The railway is an important component of transport infrastructure and improving its efficiency will contribute to the overall productivity of the economy.
Creating competition and private participation in the supply of services, utilisation of idle assets and supply of railway infrastructure could enhance efficiency and improve service. The Government should explore these options.

Gang up against gang violence
I read in the papers your lament that gang members released on bail return, ad vomitum, to sinful ways. Two options are available for you. First, get the law amended to make gang violence a non-bailable offence. Second, re-arrest the outlaws and bring them back in front of the magistrate who granted bail.
You were not even born when C H Spiro Gunasekera was teaching the University Entrance students Chemistry at St Joseph's College, Colombo. His lessons were boring monologues, once telling me to get out of the class if I find his lectures stale and uninteresting.
When I tried to leave, two of my friends, Lucian and Drahman, seated on either side restrained me whispering don't, you will fall into trouble with the headmaster, Fr Peter Pillai. I remember them with grace and gratitude because their wisdom saved the day for me, without which perhaps I would have ended my life as a gravedigger. Lucian later left for England to be a much heralded thoracic surgeon. Drahman stayed behind to be a devoted ENT specialist.
Athlete and a cricketer
Spiro, in cricket, was the Master of Discipline and a Selector. His word was final, hence feared by the pool of players from where the team was selected. He was much liked by Fr Peter Pillai. His spare time he spent praying in the chapel, while others, including myself, not that religious, spent the spare time either in the tuck shop or in a corner gossiping, or just loafing around within the walls.
I was lying in bed that Saturday afternoon, half dozing in the dormitory, after a heavy lunch of yellow rice, beef, vegetables and mixed pickle, a gourmet delight that occasionally replaced the boring daily staple, by the grace of the Bursar Fr Smidt, a German Oblate, and dreaming about the effort I should put to get into Thurstan Road, when the cricket captain Balthasar barged in and barked, an infringement of the rules, since no one was allowed to talk loudly in the dormitory - a singular fault of the Burgher community which l often had to tame because some believed, due to the colour of their skins, they were the cat's whiskers. I too have burgher traits which some use behind my back to call me Lancia - that Spiro wanted me immediately on the grounds. Before I came to Colombo my reputation had already arrived from Kurunegala and it was common knowledge in the corridors of St Joseph's that I was a talented athlete and a cricketer.
When I heard the name Spiro I galvanized. Into action went to the baths to wash my face, quickly gathered my gear and went to the grounds, where Spiro ordered me to wear my pads. He wanted to find whether I am suitable to open batting with Balthazars did as ordered and took my guard to face the coach G M Spittel, a fiery bowler who was then the Captain of Ceylon. The ball Spittel showed me was brand new.
The first was a bouncer which I ducked and allowed to pass harmlessly. I was wearing a cap. No helmet. The second was a wayward delivery which I hit for a six. The ball flying over the giant willow trees planted along the boundary and landing on the roof of the Home for the Aged rattling not only the tiles but also the nerves of the Revd Sisters into believing that the end of the world has begun, so written in the Gospels.
What took place inside Spiro's thick head was another matter. He was convinced I was an indisciplined buffoon. A wild, uncouth, barbarian from the rocks of Kurunegala and went into a hysterical frenzy. A retired cardiologist watching the scene would have summoned an ambulance immediately, believing Spiro had suffered a cardiac arrest.
He was trembling, frothing and shouting ordering me to remove my pads and get the hell out of the grounds. His immediate concerns were two-fold. First, what he wanted was a disciplined; opening bat not a wild jackass and my arrogance which he thought was ingrained, disgusting. Second, the loss of the new ball which had disappeared into the bowels of the Home for the Aged.
Strict boarding rules
The following year entered Thurstan Road, and in the three months between selection and entrance, was one of my happiest. The strict boarding rules did not apply and were enjoying the special food often given to boarders representing the school in any sport. In the morning after attending a late Mass, always the Roman rite, long before it was destroyed by the wretched reforms and listening to the Gregorian chant played on the pipe organ by Fr Ignatius Perera, had breakfast and till lunch I was in the library reading magazines like Newsweek, Punch or seated along the long table reading so-called smartbooks written in Latin. After lunch getting ready to go to the grounds for batting and fielding practice.
Spiro, perhaps a victim of a bout of amnesia, forgetting the nasty incident that took place on the same grounds just a year ago, had selected me to open the batting with Wilson, a steady bat. That year I topped the batting averages scoring an unbeaten century against Trinity College Kandy, led by Lala Wordsworth who was then a much-feared left-arm spinner. I am relating all this to demonstrate life is not easy and as an example to you, now fighting solo cum solo - hand to hand in the North, with the sword gangs, that obstacles are overcome with a determined spirit.
After I left for Thurstan Road, Spiro left for Royal College to take the post of Vice Principal. Later after he had retired, like Mr Chips into solitude, he met me at the BOC branch at Wellawatte where he told me your father came with you to see him to get you admitted to Royal College and he took you after he was told you are a first cousin of mine.
I had by then steadily climbed and was holding a formidable post on top of the pole and married into an influential family. I believed Spiro was giving this juicy morsel after many years to compensate for the fracas he had on the Josephian grounds that fateful day, which all lovers of cricket in school were aware. I warmly shook his hands and thanked him. By then I had taken the dispute as Damon Runyon, the American newspaperman often said as a part of the dodge called life.
In some mysterious way, we continued to be in touch. In old age he sent a daughter of a grandniece with a brief note, a scrawl, written in a feeble, shaky, hand, recommending the young girl for an advertised job. After the interview the few additional marks I gave her for deportment, clinched the job for her. When the candidate arrived to take up the job, she brought another note which simply stated: thank you, Spiro. A couple of days later he was gone, a victim of Parkinsons. A sad end to a glorious beginning.
Often I feel sad for giving the impression to Spiro that I disliked his lectures. I know I am crying over spilt milk. Still, the sadness lingers because my actions lacked respect for a teacher. The year l sat for the university entrance examination, l failed in Chemistry. Did very well in Physics, Applied math and Pure math and managed a place in the 12 that were taken that year from the whole island, into the Faculty of Engineering. Lectures were in prefabricated sheds still producing engineers that were an envy of foreign universities, some enticing them as lecturers. With fabulous salaries.
Today the Faculty of Engineering built at a great cost is in shambles. Students and parents are dancing on the streets. If my father came to know my actions led to the closure of the Faculty he would certainly have given me a whipping, not dance with me on the streets. He had to sweat for the meagre necessities I needed.
He was a widower and with his salary, he had to care for my younger brothers and sisters, one at St Joseph's the other at St Benedicts and the girls in the convent. Today the people are heavily taxed to give the lotus eaters handouts like Mahapola scholarships. Jeffrys withering cartoons exposing the vulgarity, buffoonery, tomfoolery of these jackals are worth a 1,000 words.
When you left Royal College and joined the Police as an SI your father told me he would be happy if you become an ASP. Your father is no more and you are now the senior DIG in charge of Jaffna. Recently the Chief Minister boasted that if he is given police powers he will bring the gang violence in Jaffna under control in two months. Demonstrate you can perform the task in less than half that time. Clean the place and let the people of Jaffna lead a peaceful life. If the Judiciary knocks you down, stand and be counted because the floor is not the place for champions.
Confiscate the rusty swords promptly. It is easily said than done. But it can be done. Include a Miss Maples, the inquisitive old lady in Agatha Christies novels into the intelligence system in major towns and infiltrate like the Opus Dei, aka Octopus Dei, and find the swords and turn them into ploughshares, the cutting blades of ploughs. You owe that not only to the IGP who has faith in you but also to the memory of Spiro. Keep on your desk a piece of wood on which is inscribed the Latin motto attributed to Claudio Acquaviva, a Jesuit General of the late sixteenth century: suaviter in modo, fortiter in remaining, gently in manner, strongly in deed.

GMOA praisesPresident for appointing committee on FTA
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) praised President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a committee to look into the impact of the Free Trade Agreement signed with Singapore, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press briefing at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA had requested the President to halt the implementation of the agreement for two months until the committee report is handed over to the President.
Dr. Aluthge said appointing a reputed economic expert such as Prof. W. D. Lakshman as the Chairman of the committee assures the credibility of the committee appointed by the President.
The agreement contains 19 conditions which are disadvantageous to the country. Already, seven parties, including the GMOA and the Sri Lanka Bar Association, have taken legal action against this agreement. The GMOA is creating awareness for all, including the President, the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Mahanayake Theras of the Three Chapters and others about the agreement, he added.

The government should take immediate steps to arrest the persons who attacked the neurosurgeon of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, Dr. Yohan Koralage, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told the Daily News yesterday.
If the police and the government fail to implement the law properly against all the attackers, it is possible for the Anuradhapura branch of the GMOA to take trade union action. The law should be implemented against all the attackers without further delay, Dr. Ananda said.
The law has not yet been implemented against the attackers. Ten students of the Peradeniya University Arts Faculty were responsible for brutally assaulting Dr. Koralage near the Universitys Obeysekera Hall on August 3 (12 days ago), he said.
Dr. Koralage was admitted to the Kandy Hospital and later transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. He was in charge of the neurosurgery unit of the hospital and now the service of the unit is at a standstill.
This unit covers the North Central Province, Northern Province and a part of the Eastern Province, amounting to one-third of the country, he added.

Govt has stabilised economy - PM
The government has stabilised the economy and managed the countrys debt burden systematically, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Our objective is to limit the debt burden to 70 percent of the countrys budget by 2020. We have already increased the countrys income by 10 percent, The Prime Minister said addressing a meeting after opening the Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sanitation project in Kurunegala on Monday.
The project was completed by the NWSDB under the supervision of the Town Planning and Water Supply Ministry.
The Prime Minister said the government while doing all this work had to bear the brunt of peoples flak. Despite all such criticism the government decreased the countrys debt burden. Since there is a shortage of foreign exchange in the country, the government had been forced to resolve it by going in for foreign loans.
The country could not move forward until a solution was found for this problem, he said. Although people had income avenues, the government had to improve such income sources.
While increasing resources youth should be found employment. To accomplish these tasks, the government took action to create a new economy after 2015. Steps have been taken to improve industrial factories, set up new factories, develop tourism by increasing the number of in-bound tourists and deploy new technology to develop the service and industrial sectors.
The Prime Minister said steps have also been taken to improve and develop the fisheries industry too.The past three years had been a difficult period. But since the economy had been stabilised now, the country could move forward with promise, he said.
The Prime Minister said a new road network from Kandy to Hambantota will be built to suit the countrys new economy. Work on the Colombo - Matara expressway had how begun and work on the Colombo - Kandy expressway too had also been started. The government had introduced the Megapolis Development Plan to modernise the Colombo city.
Although discussions were held in 2003, 2005 and 2013 about the Colombo-Kandy expressway, work was not started due to lack of funds. But the government had now begun work on this project after coming to power in 2015. The Prime Minister said the Colombo-Kandy expressway will pass through the Wayamba Province and will bring in massive development and economic benefits not only to Kandy but also to Kurunegala.
In the same way the UNP government of 1977 brought economic development hitherto restricted to Colombo into Biyagama, the present government led by President Maithripala Sirisena will bring development to other parts of the country including Chilaw, Kurunegala and Kandy.
As a first step, a Tourism Zone would be set up at Iranawila and two industrial zones would be launched in Mawathagama and Bingiriya. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said during the last election campaign he promised to set up two national schools in Kurunegala.
"Already work was underway to set up one such school in Kurunegala and the other school would be set up in Wariyapola. As much as we worked with great effort to win the war without allowing a division of the country let us join hands and wok with confidence to make Sri Lanka a strong economy in Asia, the Prime Minister said.

Lose ODI series but there were positives:
Has Sri Lanka turned the corner 
Sri Lanka may have lost the five-match One-Day International series to South Africa 3-2 but the question remains whether with their back to back wins in the fourth and fifth matches they have somewhat turned the corner and are prepared to play their brand of cricket that has brought them many victories and trophies over the years.
It took the team management quite a while to realise that preparing turning pitches to help win matches in the one-day format was not working according to the script although it did work in the Tests. After having been completely outplayed in the first two ODIs at Dambulla, the management got down to brass tacks and eventually came to a conclusion that the teams forte was their batting and that they were not providing the batters with the kind of pitches they can come up with match-winning totals.
This undoubtedly was a breadth of fresh air, and a welcome change of policy. It would be interesting to find out what prompted this change of tune, and who among the policy makers were advocating playing on under prepared surfaces adding little or no value to our cricketing fortunes.
Thus from the third ODI the preparation of pitches for the remaining matches was in complete contrast to the first two that were dry turners. The result was that in the third ODI both teams racked up a thumping 648 runs. Although Sri Lanka scored 285 and still lost the match by 76 runs did not matter for the foundation had been laid on the type of pitches that need to be prepared leading upto the 2019 World Cup.
That Sri Lanka was able to win the next two matches was largely due to their batting that racked up totals of 306/7 and 299/8. Against this type of totals Sri Lanka had the type of bowlers to restrict the opposition if not bowl them out without any assistance from the pitch.
MATHEWS DELIVERS
The captain Angelo Mathews was under some kind of pressure to deliver. He was criticised in certain quarters that his value to the team lay as an all-rounder and by keeping away from bowling he was giving negative signals to the team he was leading. But from Mathews point of view he was coming out of injury and was not in a great hurry to take the ball into his hand, his first priority was to see through a series without injury and to his credit it must be said he came out with flying colours. He not only played the five ODIs but was the top run-getter in the series with 235 runs at an average of 78 and a strike rate of 83. He provided the kind of consistency in the batting which his team mates lacked.
There were useful contributions from players like Kusal Perera, Niroshan Dickwella, and Dhananjaya de Silva but the consistency was lacking. The biggest drawback was the form of Kusal Mendis of whom a lot was expected. He is too good a player to fail often and is bound to come good perhaps in the next series which is the Asia Cup in the UAE next month.
As for Upul Tharanga it is difficult to see how he can fit into the team with his tendency to flash at balls outside the off-stump that has continually led to his dismissals. He is no doubt an attractive batsman to watch when on song but here on subcontinent pitches if he is going to be dismissed fishing at balls outside the off stump one wonders how he would survive in England where conditions are ideal for swing bowling. Tharanga is the most experienced batsman in the Lankan line-up with 228 ODI appearances and 15 centuries for his country since 2005, but his contributions have been few and far between for a player with his experience. Another factor is his fielding which is not that great and makes him a liability.
It took a while for the team to realise that they were wasting their time playing the likes of the two Jayasuriyas Shehan and Prabath and in the last two ODIs brought in Dasun Shanaka. What an impact he made with his exuberant batting in the fourth ODI that paved the way for Sri Lanka breaking their run off 11 consecutive defeats to South Africa. Shanakas knock of 65 off 34 balls with five sixes and his run out of JP Duminy with a direct hit at a crucial stage of South Africas run chase paved the way for Sri Lankas exciting three-run win at Pallekele.
THE SECOND COMING OF THISARA PERERA
The positive note for Sri Lanka in the series was the role played by Thisara Perera. Everyone knew of the outstanding talent he possessed but due to various factors Perera failed to perform consistently in the initial part of his career giving only brief glimpses of what he is capable of with both bat and ball. However this present support staff has been working on his batting and bowling and converted him into the player everyone thought he will be. With the World Cup fast approaching the form Perera displayed during the series was quite heartwarming. He is going to play an integral part on how far Sri Lanka will proceed in the World Cup in England next year.
Perera has the capacity to win matches on his own with either bat or ball and this is vital from a teams point of view to have a player of his calibre in the eleven. In the South African series Perera scored 148 runs (avg. 37) and captured 7 wickets (avg. 22.14). It was a far cry from the Perera we have all got accustomed to because there was positivity and purpose in his batting and his bowling has improved vastly.
In Akila Dananjaya, Sri Lanka has found a match-winning bowler who is capable of bowling opposition sides out. He rattled the strong Indian batting at Pallekele last year with figures of 6/54 and against South Africa he showed that he was made of sterner stuff that prompted his captain to remark that he is made out of steel when after being hit for 81 runs in the third ODI he came back strongly at the R Premadasa Stadium to rout the Proteas for 121 with career best figures of 6 for 29.
The key to Dananjayas success has been is that he is unafraid to experiment with his variations even if he is hit for runs. There is a big difference when you consider his debut, and you look at him now. He bowls with a lot of confidence. Hes not afraid to bowl his variations. And those variations are now also bowled with a lot of control. So those add up to a big difference, said Mathews.
RABADA, NGIDI MADE THE DIFFERENCE
South Africa perhaps felt the absence of their captain Faf du Plessis who had to leave for home after leading his team to a series clinching 3-0 lead in the third ODI at Pallekele having injured his right arm while fielding. Wicket-keeper De Kock who took over the leadership lost the next two matches.
The presence of JP Duminy in the team made a whole lot of difference to the team. Like de Kock explained last Sunday, JP has come into the series with a free mind set and its worked well for him. He is obviously offloading that mindset to the team also. He is been doing with the batting and his bowling and as an all round unit. Its great to have him in this all round mood where he will be a big part of our team going forward.
Duminy and De Kock were South Africas leading run-getters each with over 200 runs but the key to South Africas success in the series was their fast bowling unit led by Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and supported by Andile Phehelukwayo and Wilhelm Mulder who accounted for 30 of the 41 wickets to fall to bowlers.
Rabada and Ngidi as a pair were deadly with the new ball and played key roles in the first three ODIs that South Africa won to win the series initiating early breakthroughs that proved a setback to the Lankan batting. Once either of them was rested for the remaining two games the Lankan batsmen had the freedom to score freely which was proved by the opening partnerships of 61 and 50.
Those two are very high class bowlers theyve been around awhile now in Test matches, ODIs and T20Is they are always looking to strike up front and actually take wickets. In all three formats they know how to take wickets. Thats why we gave youngsters like Junior Dala and other seam bowlers the chance to learn how to take wickets and how to bowl at situations, said de Kock. The challenge before the present set of administrators and support staff is to change course and re-calibrate the wheel to prepare our team for the fast approaching World Cup 2019. The evidence of selections and general management of affairs witnessed during the on-going ODI series leaves one with little or no comfort that things are under control. We can only keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best.

Honouring a brilliant military strategist
Determination and patriotism drive military commanders to victory and political leadership to maintain the national will Major General Udaya Perera
The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) hosted its Annual Memorial Lecture Series 2018 on August 8. The lecture was delivered by Major General Udaya Perera (Rtd) RWP RSP VSV USP USA WC psc.
INSSSL, as the national security think tank, conducted this lecture to honour the late Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne and his contribution as a brilliant strategist and leader of Sri Lankas armed forces. The lecture was in commemoration of his 26th death anniversary. The aim of this Annual Memorial Lecture was to commemorate war heroes and to educate future generations about our great military strategists. The knowledge-sharing through this lecture was aimed at instilling strategic thinking and building professionalism in the next generation of the armed forces.
The event was attended by INSSSL Chairman and Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne PC, senior officials of the Defence Ministry, distinguished military officers, academics, Mrs. Wimalaratne, Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Hiran Wimalaratne, his spouse Dr. Nishanthi Wimalaratne, and the extended family of Major General Wimalaratne.
The participants included officers from Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and members of the academia and civilians. INSSSL Director General Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, in his opening remarks, reflected on the lack of military literature documenting the expertise in strategy and military insight of all the great military leaders of the country, for future reference. This annual lecture was hence essential in paving the way for such analysis and documentation. The Director General said, Today our national commitment to reconciliation and peace and our claim to build a nation with a strong national identity to be proud Sri Lankans is written in our soil by the blood spilled by our war heroes; one such hero we commemorate today is Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne.
Major General W.I.V.K.M. Wimalaratne, RWP RSP psc was killed in action at Araly Point, Kayts Island, in the Jaffna Peninsula, along with Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa, in 1992. At the time of his death, he was the Jaffna Security Forces Commander serving in historically significant battles such as the Vadamarachchi Operation, during the early days of the recent war.
Major General Udaya Perera was selected as the keynote speaker on account of his academically distinguished background and his having worked with Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne. Major General Perera studied at the National Defence University in USA.
Major General Perera, in his lecture, gave insightful comments on violence, war and peace-making: In the communication age, security is provided through bridges connecting communities and not by raising walls to disconnect communities. Trust in the military revolves around professionalism and deterrence. In the security sector, when trust increases between the military, community, government and society, the dividends of peace are more and conflict is less. When trust decreases, the dividends of peace are less, and conflicts increase.
Major General Perera praised Major General Wimalaratnes leadership as someone who encouraged learning from the highest levels of the regiment to the lowest, so that everyone was updated on the latest developments within the military sphere, to face external threats without fear. This was a good trait in a leader and he had never held any grudges against junior officers under his command, but gave all equal opportunities and commended them based on merit.
Major General Perera said that lessons can be learnt from his leadership, providing an example from Major General Wimalaratnes strategic foresight. At a time when the government attempted to disband the Rajarata Rifles, he suggested the amalgamation of the Rajarata Rifles with the Vijayabahu Regiment because disbandment could bring in long-term consequences for the military.
Major General Wimalaratne was the founding father who raised, trained, and nurtured the Gajaba Regiment, which carries a high number of gallantry awards throughout the war. Major General Perera reminded the audience that Major General Wimalaratne left behind a lasting legacy for the future. Military leaders of that calibre are rare gems in the military history of our defence forces, he said.

Italy bridge collapse kills 35
About 35 people were killed on Tuesday when a giant motorway bridge collapsed in heavy rain in the Italian city of Genoa in what the government called an immense tragedy.
The collapse, which saw a vast stretch of the A10 freeway tumble on to railway lines in the northern port city, came as the bridge was undergoing maintenance work and as the Liguria region, where Genoa is situated, experienced torrential rainfall.
Unfortunately there are around 30 dead and many injured in a serious condition, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini told reporters.
Rescuers scouring through the wreckage, strewn among shrubland and train tracks, said there were dozens of victims, as rescue helicopters winched survivors on stretchers from the ruined bridge.
Cars and trucks were tangled in the rubble and nearby buildings damaged by vast chunks of concrete, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.
The incident -- the deadliest of its kind in Europe since 2001 -- is the latest in a string of bridge collapses in Italy, a country prone to damage from seismic activity but where infrastructure generally is showing the effects of economic stagnation.
Aerial footage showed more than 200 metres (650 feet) of the viaduct, known locally as the Morandi bridge, completely destroyed.
The cause of the disaster was not immediately clear, although weather services in the Liguria region where Genoa is situated had issued a storm warning Tuesday morning.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in a statement expressed my deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who have died, and to the Italian people.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also sent her condolences Genoa, home to half a million people, is located between the sea and the mountains of northwestern Italy.
In March last year, a couple were killed when a motorway overpass collapsed on their car near Ancona on the country's Adriatic coast. - AFP

Death threat to his life:
Malagamuwa says no action from police
Dilantha Malagamuwa has lodged a complaint at Police Headquarters on July 08, regarding a threat to his life. He alleged that no action had been taken by the police to investigate the threats made on his life.
However, when contacted by the Daily News, Police Spokesman Superintendent of Police Ruwan Gunasekara said the DIG had forwarded the complaint to the Kelaniya SSP through the Western Province Senior DIG for full investigation. The allegations are that the investigations were not being done by the police, he said.
When I inquired from the Kelaniya Police, they said that they had on several occasions tried, but had not been able to obtain a statement from Malagamuwa, as his house in Battaramulla had been closed and they were unable to contact him by phone as it was non-responsive.
Somehow, I managed to get in touch with Malagamuwa and I connected him with the DIG in order to facilitate investigations, the Police Spokesman said.
According to police sources, the threat to Dilanthas life is over a land dispute of a tea estate in Mathale, where a former Kelaniya provincial politician had given a contract to kill Dilantha to an underworld member currently in prison. It is said that the contract to kill Malagamuwa had been given to underworld figure Kosgoda Tharaka, the Police Spokesman added.
SP Gunasekara said that the investigations are now underway regarding the threat to the life of motor racing champion Dilantha Malagamuwa.

MRs selective amnesia
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has apparently taken the Sri Lankan public for imbeciles. Addressing yet another Temple gathering in the south, over the weekend, Rajapaksa says that the state media which is being maintained by the tax payers money should not be used by the government to sling mud at its political opponents. With the private media it was different and they (private media) can be left to their own devices, since these institutions are financed by the private ownership, according to Rajapaksa.
The former President, as the public only knows too well, is the last person who can point the finger at the government for alleged abuse of the state media. Rajapaksas concern for the waste of tax payers money, through use by the government for political purposes, can be justified if he himself took the trouble to prevent this wasteful expenditure that made state media institutions incur losses. It was Rajapaksa who defaulted on a massive Rs 115 million to the ITN as unpaid for advertisements for the promotion of his candidature during his third attempt for the Presidency, causing a not inconsiderable loss to the state owned TV channel.
Rajapaksa, certainly, has shot his foot and placed it in his mouth when he says the government has no right to abuse the state media to attack its opponents. One has only to hark back to the last Presidential Election campaign to realize the hollowness of this remark. The Common Candidate was subjected to the most base and degrading form of humiliation by the selfsame ITN which was under the full control of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Not only mudslinging. State television was used to spread blatant falsehoods and misinformation during the entire duration of the campaign. On election day, Rupavahini and ITN interrupted their regular programmes to announce that Sajith Premadasa had withdrawn from the Common Candidates campaign and thrown in his lot with the Rajapaksa camp. Only the intervention of that intrepid Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, who threatened the two TV stations with dire consequences, it was who saved the day for the Common Candidate.
A similar incident was played out during the 2010 Presidential Election when, on election day, Rupavahini and ITN aired the news that Sarath Fonseka was disqualified from contesting since he was not a registered voter. This time too it was the Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake who had to clear the air in this regard by recourse to a private TV channel. Being a mild mannered individual in contrast to Deshapriya he would not have dared challenged the state run TV channels. Not only that. The state television also withheld the paid for advertisements of the Common Candidate and distorted the statements made by him on the campaign trail. Handpicked journalists were deployed to sully the image of the CC.
When Rajapaksa says that the private media should be left to their own devises, unlike the state media, which is responsible to the masses he fails to mention that most of the private media, both print and electronic, are firm backers of the Rajapaksas (one private TV channel is owned by a Rajapaksa). It is a clear attempt to show the state media in poor light to the public so that they will switch onto the other channels supportive of the Rajapaksas who then will hog the entire limelight. Two such TV channels are wholly dedicated to Rajapaksa propaganda following the former Presidents every step. In one of these channels the individual hosting the morning programme that brings to the viewers the news of the daily newspapers gives his own personal views and interpretations to the happenings on the political scene that is grossly one sided, while another channel gives free rein to selected individuals who are fierce opponents of the government to attack the leaders of the government, perhaps out of pique, having failed to obtain a Presidential pardon for the release from death of a sibling of the owner of this channel.
True, like Rajapaksa says, the state media should not be abused to sling mud at political opponents. All governments are responsible in this connection and it differed only in degree. However, given the present circumstances where the government is being virtually under siege by the private media on a scale unprecedented, it ought to have some means by which to defend itself. It is apparent that the private media does not give the whole picture to the public. This is more so with the ongoing development programmes of the government which gets little coverage on private television. The recent train strike showed to what extent private TV channels would go to embarrass the government. In one instance a group of Advanced Level students going for their exams, who were inconvenienced by the rail strike, was interviewed by a TV channel in such a way so as to elicit an answer that was uncomplimentary of the government.
Hence, the need for the government to have exclusive use of the state media, particularly state television, to put across its point of view to the public and bring them up to date with the development programmes undertaken on their behalf.

Nabbed for cheating over Rs. 1.1 mn

Nations Trust Bank now enjoys many benefits after the upgrade. Processes are centralised, streamlined and reports are standardised. Ramanika Unamboowe, EVP - Human Resources, Nations Trust Bank said, Whoever was assigned to handle our project gave their 100%.

Sri Lanka PHIs Association President Upul Rohana was speaking at a meeting of the PHIs Association at the Chilaw Town Hall recently.
The PHIs, who were on duty at the State Vesak Festival Week at Bingiriya Raja Maha Viharaya, Kurunegala, too had not been paid their allowances.
Therefore, we have decided to launch trade union action soon because the NWP health authorities have ignored our demands, he said.

Pakistans Independence Day celebrated in Sri Lanka
The Pakistan High Commission and the Pakistani community based in Sri Lanka celebrated Pakistan Independence Day, yesterday.
Acting Pakistani High Commissioner Janbaz Khan hoisted the national flag at a ceremony held in the High Commission premises.
He read out the message of Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain which stated: Our forefathers waged a unique struggle and gave unparalleled sacrifices for achieving Pakistan. Now it is our responsibility to shape Pakistan according to the dreams of its founders and to achieve this objective there should be good relations, harmony and brotherhood among all strata of society.
The Pakistani President had added: The objective of developing the country and rekindling its glorious past can only be achieved if we work single-mindedly, keeping aside our personal interests.
In his message, Pakistani Prime Minister Justice (Retd) Nasir-ul-Mulk said: Undoubtedly, our beautiful country is blessed with every gift of the nature. From an ideal geo-strategic location to the most talented and progressive youth, we have all the ingredients to carve out our own destiny and rise as a successful nation of the world.
The Prime Minister added: Unswerving commitment to the ideals of the Quaid-e-Azam and following the principle of Unity, Faith and Discipline would certainly help us overcome our present-day challenges and make Pakistan a self-reliant, economically vibrant and a prosperous country.
On Pakistan-Sri Lanka relations, the Acting Pakistani High Commissioner said Pakistan had established diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka immediately after her independence in 1948. Since then relations, based on mutual understanding and common interest, have flourished continuously, he said.
He added that Pakistan has always supported Sri Lanka in her quest for national security, promotion of democracy, rule of law and economic progress.
He conveyed Pakistans best wishes for peace, unity, harmony and progress to the Sri Lankan government and people.
The ceremony was attended by a large number of people including members of the Sri Lanka-Pakistan Friendship Association, Sri Lanka-Pakistan Business Council and the Pakistani community in Sri Lanka.

Pizzalicious museum opens in Chicago
The U.S. Pizza Museum has officially opened its doors in Chicago, raising the ire of some New York-style pizza fans.
The museum, which previously displayed exhibits online and at pop-up events, opened officially on Friday at Chicago's Roosevelt Collection and is scheduled to remain open through the end of October. The Pizza Museum features pizza-related pieces of memorabilia including menus, vintage ads, boxes, toys and artworks.
"As America's favorite food, pizza provides an easy entry point to learn about history, pop culture, and the people behind the pizza," founder Kendall Bruns told USA Today. "We expect the exhibits to have a nostalgic effect on viewers."
Not everyone is excited about the museum opening in Chicago - even the New York Mayor's office weighed in on Twitter. "New Yorkers may not agree on where to get the best local slice, but we do know that deep dish is not pizza. Case closed," the office tweeted.
Comedian David Cross also took umbrage with the museum's choice of Chicago as a home.
"In other news, the Seafood Museum will be opening in Fargo, the NY Deli Museum will be opening in Fairbanks, and the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is being moved to Key West," he tweeted.

Poetry of  logical ideas
My Choice, the Tamil Poetry collection in English was compiled and translated by Dr K Shriganeshan, Senior Lecturer attached to the English language Teaching Centre, an experienced and prolific writer for years. It is one of the best collections of English poems in the form of a book. This collection comprises thirty poems. The readers can recall the scars of the war in most of the poems. The struggles and agonies of human life are skillfully portrayed.
Most importantly, the readers can observe that many of the poems were penned by the women writers. This type of translation work brings the hidden talents of female poets name and fame to the world from the nook and corner of the nation. Its the great opportunity for them to continue their service to their community by the words and the verses and pull out the inner struggles in an authentic manner.
Modern trend
The translations in the book are beautiful and it inspires the readers turning over the pages without feeling bored. In fact, translation has become worthy in the modern trend, which helps reach the non-native language readers. Translating a poem into another language, that is, its content, its form, its tone, its nuance, is, as almost everyone who has done it knows, a difficult task.
Eventually, it gives enormous rewards for the translator, the reader and poetry itself. Meticulously, the translator of the book my choice has overcome the challenges with his language expertise. Be that as it may, translation is a daunting task because the translator has the immense responsibility and the goal in maintaining the meaning, the feel and liveliness of the poems when they are translated into another language. To succeed in the effort, the translator should have sufficient collection of vocabulary to give the original effect on them without changing the meanings of the poems, a merit to the translator.
Moreover, there are two main types of translations: one is the word to word translation, a strenuous task, and the other is absorbing the concept of the poem and translating into the target language. The translator of this book successfully handled the meanings of the poems using the strategies and language techniques.
Real meaning
For instance, in the poem My Choice the lines are on neither beauty nor youth, in using the word neither, the lines are shortened and the real meaning of Tamil has been simply brought out by the translator. Using the conjunctions and the punctuations in the appropriate context are very much important in the use of the English language. It has been absolutely done by the translator.
Adding to it, in the poem Paled East, the line of the second stanza, malarkalai illantha malarkal, is very deep in meaning, clearly translated as women who lost their flowers. This shows the translators competency in both the languages, Tamil and English. Many of the original poems in Tamil express the human sufferings, struggles between life and death, sorrowful situations, stained and bloody experiences the people and the society underwent in the past and they were effectively and efficiently reflected in the translated versions. The apt use of metaphors and simile are very much appreciable.
For instance, in the poem, Understanding You, Unnudaiya paarvai oru neruppu, oru olipilumbuoodam, uthayam and oru uyirkolii are translated in the following way:
Your gaze is a fire
Your gaze is blaze
Your gaze is dawn
Your gaze is boat
Your gaze is killer
Using the transitional signals in writing is one of the techniques which link the sentences and paragraphs smoothly together so that they have a flow and there are no abrupt jumps or breaks between ideas. This can be noticed in the poem Burdens where the transitional signals such as on the one hand and on the other are applied in two different stanzas.
Oru puram is on the one hand
Marupuram is on the other
Further, this collection of poems has a dramatic effect by using direct speech which adds more nativity and naturalness to the readers. As a result, the specific scene flashes in the mind of the readers.
Example 1: Burdens
I am hungry, mum (amma pasikirathu)
Example 2: Dumb Grief
Look here, open the window...
The maiden banana dances...
In Dumb Grief, the lines Are you crazy Close the window the chill is bad... are noteworthy.
The interrogative form gives an impact to poetic verse. The translator has used various grammatical elements to keep up the originality of the poems. All in all, this book consists of poems with deeper meaning and the language used to compose the poems is concrete and thought-provoking. The readers can enjoy reading them. The themes of the poems are very dynamic and making sense. This is a very interesting application and it will be great to see what the future holds for this application in terms of additional content and features. In a nutshell, it is a very comprehensive work done by Dr K. Shriganeshan.

Poetry transcreated
I wish to translate a few poems taken from a book called Arraith Thingal written by a Danish Tamil lady. She was originally born in Lanka and now settled in Denmark with her family. Her real name is Jasmine Kennedy and uses her nom-de-plume as Nakkeeran Mahal.
The purpose is to show that some of the expatriate writers and poets have not forgotten their mother tongue and write appreciable poems.
This book of 80 pages published by Valary Eluthukkoodam in MaanaMathurai in India in 1916 contains 60 short poems. The publisher himself is a former Lankan now an Indian citizen, Aruna Sunthararajan. He has written a perceptive Introduction to the book while Dr Bhanumathi has written an analysis of the poems. The poet herself gives some information about herself and her purpose in writing.
Social evils
She was born in Postparty in Vadamarachi region in Yaalpaanam. The name her parents gave was Sivenewari. She studied in 5 schools there including Udupiddi Girl School and the Paruthithurai (Point Pedro) Methodist Girls High School.
Her purpose in writing is to shed away with social evils in her society: oppression, casteism, dowry system, female subjugation and the like. When she emigrated with her husband Robert Kennedy, who encouraged her to continue with her writing the late Balasubramaniam Sivakolunthu who edited a little magazine called Amuthu in Newbo in Denmark, her contributions were published. Her poems were used in foreign TV channels like TRT, ABC, IBC and TTN.
She worked for some time as a Tamil teacher in Demark. She wrote plays and poetry for the children there to improve their mother tongue. She has spent 23 years in a foreign clime. She made use of the social media like the Facebook to give expression to her thoughts and feelings via poetry since 2014. She has dedicated her book to her younger sister who died falling a victim to the lust of a sex maniac.
Poetry translated
Let us see through English what her feelings are as a poet from some lines from her poetry.
Conscience is the supreme witness to tell you what is justice coming from your inner heart.
Dont think that no one will know what the wrong things we do within the four walls, there is one who sees that within you. You have to answer him.
When our nest was broken, when wings were cut and the hunter killed us, those that looked at us with curiosity say they will give us the nest and the wings to fly high. From the crows nests, some cuckoos too join in the singing.
Instead of filling the stomach of a lame man like me, they bypass me and are filling the tills in the temple. Is the God handicapper more than I
The relationship is like a stick bound by the rope of affection and forms a cage called family.
The woman, why are your eyes wet Arent you energy itself on this earth Rise Up. Humans evolve within the portals of yours. Pure lass, do not bend any more. Dont bow down, Stand straight. Dont ask anyone for a solution. Burn the bad. Drive away the unbearable sorrow. Walk up the stairs and go high. Shed away your ignorance. Love your man as you like yourself. When sorrow comes join hands with the womankind. The worlds wealth may ignore you. Create history before those horrible men.
What Colourful dreams while waiting in the pedestal setup for the wedding, while she waits for the consummation, a screen called dowry came and disturbed her dreams. Today the dreams and the sideburns have gone grey. She is a not a matured but a young maid.
There wasnt any distinction as low and high, even God has not created us separately. Some among the ancients to keep some as downtrodden designed the caste differences.
Dewdrops as diamond vanish within a second sunlight falling on it proving the human lifes impermanence.
The pain of the poor searching a morsel of rice from an empty pot is like a pregnant womans pain in giving birth to an infant. No words to describe.
I have tried to recreate what she says in understandable terms only because if I were to translate the poems word to word the essence of what she says will be lost in translation.
Nakeeran Mahal, aka Jasmine Kennedy is a graduate from the University of Denmark in Danish.

Prima sets up $2mn schol for Lankans at SMU
Prima Limited made a contribution of $2 million to set up a new scholarship scheme to motivate outstanding incoming Sri Lankan undergraduates pursuing any degree programme at the Singapore Management University (SMU).
With matching contributions from the Singapore government, the total endowed fund for the Prima Ceylon Scholarship amounts to $3 million.
Prima Limited Chairman and CEO Primus Cheng and SMU President Professor Arnoud De Meyer signed the gift agreement at SMU, yesterday.
Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Singapore Nimal Weeraratne, and senior management and staff from Prima Limited and SMU were also present.
Cheng said: to mark the 40th anniversary of Prima Ceylon Private Limited, we think it is appropriate to donate to SMU to endow the Prima Ceylon Scholarship for the benefit of deserving Sri Lanka students studying at the university.
We express our appreciation to Prima Limited for setting up the Prima Ceylon Scholarship at SMU. This new gift by Prima Limited will not only take the scholarship recipients on an educational journey that is holistic and meaningful, it will also contribute to a richer and more vibrant educational environment in the university.
We look forward to continuing this meaningful partnership with Prima Limited, Professor Arnoud De Meyer said. The scholarship will be awarded annually from academic year 2019-20 to a student with demonstrated financial needs, offering financial support towards the recipients annual tuition fees and/or study-related expenses.
Each non-bonded scholarship of $90,000 is tenable for the recipients four years of study, provided that the student maintains good results and continues to demonstrate high standards of personal conduct and remains active in community service and co-curricular activities.
The recipient may be offered internship and/or recruitment opportunities by Prima Limited.
The SMU and Prima Limited have a close and longstanding relationship stretching back to March 2000, just two months after SMUs establishment when Primus Cheng made an endowed gift of $1.5 million to SMU to establish the Cheng Tsang Man Professorship in Accountancy. This was in honour of his late father, the Honorary Life President and Founder of Prima Ltd.
To date, 27 internationally renowned accounting experts have held Visiting Professorships under this gift, conducting joint research with the SMU faculty as well as delivering public lectures.
Primus Cheng, in April 2011, made a $1 million endowed gift to the SMU to establish the School of Accountancy Research Symposium, an annual research symposium which enables the faculty from the School of Accountancy to interact with researchers from top schools worldwide, to commemorate Primas 50th anniversary.

Prolonged applause for W A Abeysinghe
A writers task brings forward his ideas, emotions and attitudes. A creative artiste capitalises on his creative capacity to express emotions in an artistic manner. That said, a creative writers final product gives an idea about his or her personality. The ideology, as well as the stream of consciousness, counts most important in this regard. The question is if this creative effort  or exercise, rather  can influence the prevailing social order.
Sri Lanka has a plethora of creative writers engaged in composing poetry, lyrics and other genres. However such work does not seem to have a proper driving force on the prevailing social order. Most of such stories could be enjoyed on par with fairy tales, albeit with not much effect on the societal growth. Or do they lead the society to some kind of downfall
The discourse on veteran writer Dr W A Abeysinghes literary and social service emerges at this crucial point. A comprehensive anthology covering his contribution to the society and the literature was launched recently at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. The anthology titled Abhaya Mudrawa is edited by Chandrasiri Seneviratne and Udeni Sarathchandra. Another anthology titled Anandayen Pragnanawata  Abeysighe Sara sangrahaya edited by Deepachandri Abeysighe and Sumudu Chathrani Jayawardena were also launched to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Dr Abeysinghes literary career.
The second step of the launching ceremony will take place at the Kuliyapitiya town Hall on August 21 at 2 pm as a special literary programme.
Dr Praneeth Abhayasundara of Sri Jayawardenepura University and Senior Journalist Thimbiriyagama Bandara will deliver the keynote speeches while Jagath Kumara Jayasinghaarachchi (who features the lions character in the present production of Sinhabahu) will please the audience with his vocal and performing abilities. Wayamba University Vice Chancellor Professor E M P Ekanayake will chair the event.
Whatever the genre  be it poetry, lyrics, short story, newspaper writing or translation  Dr Abeysinghes literary contributions lay a direct touch on the social plane. He makes use of international literature to expose the contaminated social body while intermixing law and politics with an amazing dexterity.
He represented Sri Lanka at the Afro-Asian Writers Conferences held in Baku, Soviet Union in 1966 and in Beirut, Lebanon in 1967. Dr W A Abeysinghe has been awarded the Sahithya Suri award by the Wayamba University and the Government has presented the Kala Keerthi award.
This special programme, designed to appreciate Dr Abeysinghes social and literary contribution, is a joint collaboration of the Kuliyapitiya Provincial Secretariat and Kuliyapitiya Urban Council Public Library Consultant Committee.
Dr Abeysinghes latest works will be available as Sarasavi publications for a nominal sum.

Reassessing  Piyadasa Sirisena
Though the scholarly name, Piyadasa Sirisena, was a household name in the past, he and his volumes of narrative have not been assessed in terms of the modern awareness on the part of the local literary scholars. Piyadasa Sirisena (1875  1946) is known to have rendered a yeoman service in the capacity of a social reformer who was instrumental in moulding f a national reawakening, as a Sinhala journalist who happened to be the pioneer editor of Sinhala Jatiya first as a monthly journal and then as a weekly newspaper.
He selected the art of expression via both poetry and narrative forms that addressed the varying issues of nationalism and moral reawakening during and after the postcolonial rule. As August 31 happens to be his birthday, some of the literary comments on my part could be an ideal tribute to this communicator par excellence.
Resourceful introduction
We ought to be initially thankful for the compilation of his complete works, the novels he has written, by the Senior Lecturer of Sinhala and Mass Communication, Jayalatha Medawatta of the University of Sri Jayawardanapura.
The five volumes contain 19 of his Sinhala novels, of all types, with a profile and an introduction resourcefully presented. The period of his writings covers between 1904 and 1944. On reading that one of the pioneers remarkable creative work could be cited as the novel titled Apita Vechcha Dey chronologically ascertained as his second work.
The title, in English, could be rendered in English as What befell us. Taking an overview of the influence of the colonial rule, Sirisena peeps into the inner lives of those who benefitted from it but became the victims of the same as rootless individuals fallen prey to circumstances beyond ones cognition.
He selects the family life of a Mudliyar (or Mudali), a title-bearer well known during the colonial times. The Mudliyar and his wife happen to be rich and have the only son named as Wilfred Vijayasinha. Wilfred, though given a good education, failed to live up to the parents expectations. This was solely due to the grandiose living conditions enjoyed in the utmost possible manner. With the money as earned by the father, the son had the chance to squander every penny to his hearts desire before and after the demise of the former. The mother is made to suffer and she had failed to bring up the only son in the way she wished. He becomes a liquor addict and a club-goer who gathers like-minded friends from the similar family backgrounds.
Cultural susceptibilities
Sirisena, as a novelist, depicts Wilfreds character as a rootless individual who fails to grasp the sensitive cultural susceptibilities of his own environment. Thus, it is shown how some women too reject him in matrimonial arrangements through the matchmakers. As an excessive drinker, he becomes physically disengaged. Gradually, he loses all his inherited money.
In his sickly mood, both body and mind, he cries out the words, apita vechcha dey (what befell us!) The onlookers see him as a mentally deranged or insane young man. But it so happens that a vein of sympathy and the prevailing social conditions create a wave of sympathy which moves him off to indigenous medical treatment. The protagonist is given clinical treatment having failed in the alien treatments. Gradually, Wilfred regains the physical and mental stability that leads him to certain areas in spiritualism.
Having become a changed person, he comes to grips with people who are balanced and clear-minded. Those who rejected him in the past rediscover him. One may call it a modern fairytale.
It could well be a present-day fairytale as everything turns out to be fine in the end. But if it could happen exactly that way is the inevitable question the writer himself poses. Piyadasa Sirisena is definitely a skilful creator of social events that open the doors to perceptive valve even for the contemporary read er. As a writer, he seems to experiment on the hazards of the so-called elitism, Occidentalism, new developmental trends and the rest as taught to us by the colonial rulers.
Sky heights
Now, please do not blame me for saying this. My attempt is not to elevate the Sirisenas creative skills to sky heights. Instead, I need to perceive in the proper perspective what he tried to say to us. For a general reader, Sirisena via his characters and events presents several significant factors such as the value of being in a more humanistic frame of existence. Then he poses the question: how far can one go with the monetary riches and possesses How much social power does one need
All these questions are addressed, interspersed with a religious conscience. They are recreated via a poetic and a folkloristic attitude that enriches and broadens the vision of a reader. It should be remembered that some of our elders have grown up with this vision of Sirisena. As such, I feel that a discourse on Sirisena and his works is a compelling need at the moment.

Sculptural symbolism  in Polonnaruwa period
In Bharatha Natyam generally, Ananda Thandava pose is used to symbolize Lord Shiva as the symbol of Bharatha Natyam. This particular Ananda Thandava pose of Lord Shiva is commonly known as Lord Nataraja. Lord Nataraja bears five important Pancha Boothams (the five elements) which are believed to be the most important elements for the creation of the world. The five elements are the sky, water, fire, wind and earth. The Lord bears the moon on his head which indicates the sky; similarly, the River Ganga flows from the terrace of the Lord which indicates water.
The dancer of the Ananda Thandava is called by several names connected with dance, namely Lord Nataraja (King of dance); Kuthapiran, Kootharasan, Aadal Valaan and Ampala Koothan are some of the other names of the dancing deity. In almost every Bharatha Natyam recital, this particular dance pose of Lord Nataraja adorns the stage. And it is the universally acknowledged symbol of Bharatha Natyam.
Different locations
Four to five different important Lord Nataraja bronze sculptures were discovered from different locations in the Polonnaruwa period archaeological sites. The dancing deity Lord Nataraja is the Lord of dance.
One Lord Nataraja statue with all traditional Hindu Saiva Agama Sastra (Traditional basic principle of Hindu codes) features was discovered at the 1st Siva temple of Polonnaruwa. This particular sculpture was discovered in 1908. According to Great scholars, this sculpture is almost the same as one of the Nataraja sculpture of Chennai Museum.
Another Lord Nataraja statue was discovered from the backyard of the 5th Siva temple of Polonnaruwa in October 1960 by C E Godamkumbura. This was one of the tallest Lord Sivas sculptures found in Sri Lankan archaeological sites. The height of the sculpture is 140 cm. It resembles some exceptional features among all other Nataraja sculptures discovered from the archaeological sides of Polonnaruwa. A cobra is seen at the right-hand elbow level of this dancing deitys statue. An excellent Sinhala artistic influence could be assessed at this sculpture.
The base of this bronze sculpture contains beautifully carved exclusive and exquisite sculptural figures. Numerous instrumental players figures are beautifully carved on the pedestal. At the extreme right end, a female figure is depicted with cymbals. Similarly, a flute player is also carved at the base. As compared to other bronze Nataraja sculptures, such beautiful carved figures at the base are not at all found anywhere else in Sri Lanka. The sculptures outer frame is generally known as Thiruwasi. According to Hindu philosophy, Thiruwasi denotes the life and death cycle of the living beings.
According to Hindu mythology, the outer frame named Thiruwasi should be round, but this Thiruwasi is in semi-square shape. The sculptor who made this sculpture, without considering the philosophical meaning of the Thiruwasi. Yet some other traditional Hindu features are seen in this statue. Beautiful anklets adorn the legs. An Uddeki is seen at the rear right upper hand. A fireball is seen at the upper rear left hand. The lower down right hand is depicted with Abaya hasta. But river Ganga and Moon at the terrace of the Lord are not seen at this sculpture. In all the traditional Nataraja dancing deity bears the moon and river Ganga at the terrace. It denotes two different elements of Panchaputhams such as the sky and water respectively. Normally Lord Nataraja sculpture is always depicted with spread hair. Such a feature is missing in this famed Siva Nataraja sculpture of Polonnaruwa.
Nataraja Sculptures
Hence to a certain extent, this particular Nataraja sculpture is quite different from the all other Nataraja sculptures. Hence it is assumed that this particular statue must be a creation of a local sculptor without understanding the traditional features of Hindu philosophy during the Polonnaruwa period. It reveals the cultural admixture or amalgamation of Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
Catalogue No CMR 13.89.293
The height of another Lord Nataraja statue is 64.5 cm. This particular bronze statue was discovered from the 1st Siva temple in Polonnaruwa. The hair is separated into six layers. On both sides, the hair is depicted as spread out. The spread out hair reveals the strenuous and vigorous dance of the Lord. According to sch olars, this is one of the excellent creations of Polonnaruwa bronzes. Like all the other Nataraja poses this resembles the same characteristic features. But the unusual feature of the statue is the length of the legs. The length of the legs is quite long. It is believed that this was made by a trained sculptor. The ornamental decoration of the statue is excellent. Normally the body should be straight and the Araimandi sitting position should be adopted in this pose. As compared to other Nataraja poses the half sitting posture extent is not much seen in this statue and the body is slanted more to the left side.
Another beautiful Nataraja sculpture was found at Polonnaruwa.
The unique feature of the sculpture is, without Thiruwasi, (the round outer frame) and tuft. It is totally based on the Saiva tradition. The height of the statue is 61.5 cm.
This statue was discovered at the 5th Siva Devale of Polonnaruwa in 1908. Beautiful hair decoration and ornamental decorations adorn this sculpture.
The Muyalavans body position (demon under the right leg of the Lord) is quite different from all the other Muyalavans body position of other Nataraja statues. Anyhow this is an excellent handiwork of a Dravidian sculptor.
The posture of Nataraja sculpture is the same as all other Nataraja sculptures.
The remarkable feature of the statue is that the absence of Thiruwasi.
The Nataraja sculptures of Polonnaruwa are unique in nature and reveal the traditional Hindu and Indian influence on Sri Lanka during the Polonnaruwa period.

Serena Williams breezes past Gavrilova, Pouille ousts Murray
Cincinnati, Tuesday: Serena Williams re-established her customary superiority, hammering Daria Gavrilova 6-1, 6-2 to reach the second round of the Cincinnati Masters on Monday.
The 23-time Grand Slam champion showed full recovery in her first match since suffering the worst defeat of her career two weeks ago in San Jose when she was crushed 6-1, 6-0 in 51 minutes by British No. 1 Johanna Konta.
But the 36-year-old was all business Monday as she cleaned up on Australian Gavrilova, with Williams winning an 11th straight match here.
Im feeling pretty good tonight. Its never easy, no matter what the scoreline says, Williams said.
I definitely felt relaxed after the first break, but youve got to keep going and try to go in for the whole thing.
Though she has not played the tournament in three years, Williams lifted back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015 after losing the 2013 final to Victoria Azarenka.
Andy Murrays injury comeback was sidetracked as the three-time Grand Slam champion lost 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 to Lucas Pouille.
But fellow injury patient Stan Wawrinka opened with a defeat of 12th seed Diego Schwartzman 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic survived a stiff test, needing nine match points to outlast Steve Johnson of the US 6-4, 7-6 (7/4). Djokovic is coming off a third round loss at last weeks Toronto tournament. Murray, returning from January hip surgery, was unable to get past the French 16th seed, hampering his preparations for the US Open starting on August 27
Physically, I felt okay. Its quick conditions here, Murray said. He was a little bit sharper than me out there.
I maybe wasnt reacting as quickly to some shots I would have liked.
Murray last played 11 days ago in a Washington third-round match which took him three hours to win and ended at 3 a.m.
The 31-year-old two-time Wimbledon winner is working his way back slowly and felt he could not subject his body to a quarter-final just over 12 hours later, prompting him to withdraw from that event.
After Washington, I took four, five days off the tennis court. I did a lot of training, a lot of rehab.
As the year goes on, Ill be able to get a little bit more consistency like on the practice court and on the tennis court.
Pouille had lost his previous three matches to Murray, the last at Dubai in 2017.
Spanish 13th seed Pablo Carreno Busta started his week with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 defeat of Frances Richard Gasquet, while Japans Kei Nishikori put out Russian Andrey Rublev, 7-5, 6-3. Peter Gojowczyk of Germany defeated Joao Sousa 2-6, 6-4, 7-5 and will next line up against seven-time winner Roger Federer, at second the highest seed in the field after the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal.
Canadian Denis Shapovalov beat US tournament debutant Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 7-5
Sam Querrey beat ninth-seeded American compatriot John Isner 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/5).
In the womens first round, Azarenka made her first appearance here since 2015 count as she defeated Spanish veteran Carla Suarez Navarro 6-7 (5/7), 6-2, 6-4.
Double Grand Slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova continued her 2017 injury comeback, beating Swiss Stefanie Voegele 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/5).
US Open finalist Madison Keys, seeded 13th, defeated wild card Bethanie Mattek-Sands 3-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4; Frances Kristina Mladenovic advanced when Julia Goerges retired hurt trailing 6-4, 3-2. AFP

Sri Lanka wins by three wickets in tight chase
Sri Lankan spinners wrought havoc amongst the South African batting ranks dismissing them for their lowest ever T20I total to set up a thrilling three-wicket win in the one-off match played in front of a jam-packed R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Winning the toss and batting first South Africas batting was dismantled for 98 in 16.4 overs by spinners Lakshan Sandakan (3/19), Akila Dananjaya (2/15) and Dhananjaya de Silva (2/22).
For South Africa to have any chance they needed early wickets upfront and Kagiso Rabada provided them with just that by sending back Kusal Perera (3) and Kusal Mendis (1) in his opening over.
But Dinesh Chandimal returning for his first international match after serving a 3-Test and four-match ODI ban provided the stability to the batting adding a useful 53 for the third wicket with Dhananjaya de Silva (31) and staying right till the end to see his team home as wickets fell in a canter around him at the other end thus heightening the tension in the match.
Chandimals cool head saw Sri Lanka home as he guided them to 99-7 in the 16 th over remaining unbeaten on 36 scored off 33 balls (3 fours, 1 six). However it was Isuru Udana who made the winning hit a straight drive for four off Lungi Ngidi as the stadium erupted.
South Africa started off on a positive note with Quinton de Kock hitting three fours off the first four balls bowled by Kasun Rajitha. However Sri Lanka hit back in the next over when Dhananjaya de Silva with his off breaks had Hashim Amla caught at extra cover for a duck and added the vital wicket of skipper JP Duminy for three to carry away the Man of the Match award.
Dananajaya and Sandakan then joined the attack to dismantle the rest of the South African batting as they ran amok. Sandakan struck deep into the hearts of the South African batting when he sent back Henriech Klaasen (18), Andile Phehelukwayo (0) and Rabada (0) in his third over.
There was no come back for the Proteas from there onwards as they slid deep further into the mire to be dismissed three short of their previous lowest total of 100 against Pakistan at the Centurion in 2013. It was a morale-boosting win for the Lankans who have now won three one-day games in a row against the Proteas.

Militants gained control of the base in Ghormach district of volatile Faryab province after days of heavy fighting, according to army spokesman for northern Afghanistan Mohammad Hanif Rezaee, adding that 100 soldiers were on the base when it was first attacked Sunday.
It is a tragedy that the base fell to the enemy. Some soldiers were killed, some captured and some fled to nearby hills, Rezaee told AFP.
Faryab MP Hashim Otaq said that 14 soldiers were killed and about 40 others were captured by Taliban fighters in the base, known as Chenaya.
The Taliban victory in Faryab comes days after militants launched a brazen attack on the southeastern Afghan city of Ghazni late Thursday, some two hours drive from the capital Kabul.
Tahir Rehmani -- head of Faryabs provincial council -- said the base fell after the soldiers begged for reinforcements and air support from Kabul but were ultimately ignored.
They were too busy with Ghazni, said Rehmani.
Afghan Security Forces, beset by killings, desertions and under intense pressure, have been struggling to beat back insurgents since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.
The attack on Ghazni is the largest tactical onslaught by the Taliban since an unprecedented truce in June brought fighting between security forces and the Taliban to a brief stop, providing battle-worn Afghans some welcome relief.
The city remains in government hands, officials have said, but the insurgents appeared entrenched there Tuesday, according to residents who said they were burning buildings, killing civilians and firing on security forces conducting a clearing operation.- AFP

Asoka Handagama said: "For many years had been planning to do a film, not on the war, but the impact of the war. Still, there unresolved issues and we wanted to make a movie that would prompt a dialogue on such issues."
He said that the premiere had received positive feedback with requests from both Sinhala and Tamil communities to show the movie in their communities, some had offered to organize public screenings and such received great interest with engaging post-screening discussions.
Prasanna Vithanage, in his remarks, said Our film is about the aftermath of the war. The war created many stories - stories without closure. All three stories in Thundenek are about people who are looking for closure." He pointed out that the Sri Lankan people could easily relate to the polarization of communities, thus the title Her. Him.
The Other. "For the Sinhala people Tamils have become The Other and vice versa; the same goes for Muslims."

Twenty five special units to combat drug related crimes
Twenty five special units comprising police and STF personnel to combat drug related crimes and organised crimes will be set up countrywide, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said these special teams will function under the IGP. However, the minister noted that the Tri-Forces can only be involved in such operations under Emergency Law but that his ministry was looking on how they could utilise the forces in drug operations to control the drugs scourge.
Today drugs come in various forms. Schoolchildren are targeted and we intend to commence an operation at the beginning of the next school term targeting all schools and conduct an awareness programme to warn schoolchildren of the dangers of these drugs in order to prevent them falling victim to this drug menace.This operation will be carried out island wide, he said.
The Minister also noted that even medicinal drugs are now being used by drug addicts and his ministry and the police are also looking at ways of preventing these medicinal drugs from being used for other purposes other than for its intended uses.
Today one of the main topics is the drug menace and the organised crimes taking place in the country. However, we have stepped up our operations and by that we have been able to drastically reduce the number of such incidents while increasing the number of arrests and detections. The supply of drugs to the market has reduced and the price of drugs has also increased. These drug operations are being carried out mostly from overseas persons and those within prison. However, we have also taken measures to prevent these drug operators from carrying on their businesses from within prisons.
With the assistance and manpower of the police and the STF we have launched a massive operation against these drug operators to prevent the flow of drugs to the country and our society, Minister Maddumabandara said.
In 2016 the police had made 27,458 arrests in connection with heroin related offences and in 2017 the number of heroin related arrests were 29,272. This year within the first six months police had made 19,962 arrests with regard to drug offences. The minister said that the number of arrests have increased while the number of crimes have reduced and the government intend to further increase these operations and the number of arrests through these special operations.
He added that the police had obtained blue warrants on several of the drug kingpins who are overseas and intend to intensify the operations against these drug operators. In the past most of these drug operators were being shielded by politicians and they could operate without any hindrance with their protection. However, this government will not tolerate such actions and we will not hesitate to arrest anyone who is connected with drugs irrespective of who they are or what their position is, the minister warned.
The minister also noted that measures are being taken to implement a system to destroy the stocks of drugs that is taken into custody once it has been sent to the Government Analyst and a report is obtained. He said previously these are being kept until the cases are completed but added that this would change in the near future and these drugs would be destroyed as soon as the initial procedures are completed.

Unity Govt. has ensured democracy, law and order in country: Sagala
There is no better place in the region than Sri Lanka, where people could come and do business and where tourists could visit, said Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayaka.

This period has been more challenging than in any other period that the world had moved through. Technology has taken away boarders and boundaries. We are in an era of global village. Youths of Sri Lanka has had no choice but to become part of this global village. Its a challenge. But the youths have to be equipped by themselves with what is required to meet this challenge, the Minister said.
He further said that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had designed the National Youth Corps in order to help Sri Lankas youth to meet the future challenges.
As a young minister, the Prime Minister wanted me to provide leadership to these youth corps. We wished to build up a disciplined youth who would be equipped with the skills that are required to meet the demands in the employment sector, he added.
With the establishment of more and more industrial zones and the boom of tourism, there would be plenty of employment opportunities for Sri Lankan youths, while there would be plenty of peripheral services where young entrepreneurs would have to come forward and fill those opportunities.

Vocational training for 272 Mahaweli youth
The Mahaweli culture created under the giant Mahaweli irrigation scheme and massive human settlement endeavour producing skilled farmers, sportspersons and artistes from 1979 will be revived to revitalise the national economy,Mahaweli Development State Minister Weerakumara Dissanayake said.
"Agriculture and livestock projects under the Mahaweli scheme contributed largely to increase national productivity while producing skilled farmers. That culture has suffered a set back now. Today, the Mahaweli is dominated by the fourth generation of its original settlers.A large number of Mahaweli youth have no employment. It is our duty to direct them for the skills development and vocational training in order to uplift their livelihoods, he said.
Scholarships will be given to 272 Mahaweli youth to follow vocational training courses atthe Vocational Training Authority.
Science, Technology and Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said vocational training plays an important role in responding to the market demand for skilled, qualified and capable individuals.
"The national universities can accommodate only 2% of the total student population who sit for their GCE A/Ls. We must guide youth for the vocational training programmes to produce skilled youth to meet the requirements in both local and foreign job markets. Opportunities are available for youth who have vocational qualifications. Most of them earn good incomes. In Sri Lanka, there is a shortage for 200,000 people which we have to fill with labour from overseas," the State Minister said.
The Mahaweli youth can face any challenge but they should improve their skills through the vocational training.
