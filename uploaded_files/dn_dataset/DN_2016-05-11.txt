## Title: From waterless village to rowing in Rio

From waterless village to rowing in Rio
Pune, Tuesday: An Indian rower has achieved an improbable feat by qualifying for the Rio Olympics - despite coming from a drought-plagued village where there is not even enough water to drink.
Dattu Bhokanal, whose father dug wells for a living, said that when he took up rowing after joining the army he was scared, because he had never seen so much water.
But just a few years on, and with his arid ancestral home hit by severe water shortages that have affected more than 330 million, Bhokanal is dreaming of single sculls glory as India's only Olympic rower in Rio.
"There is a huge water shortage in our village," said Bhokanal, referring to tiny Talegaon in Nashik district, around 165 kilometres (100 miles) northeast of Mumbai.
"We used to travel long distances to get water and also stand in long queues to get our buckets filled from water tanks," added the 24-year-old of his childhood.
Earlier this month, the government said a quarter of the India's population, spread across 10 states, had been hit by drought after two consecutive years of weak monsoons.
Bhokanal's tale is all the more remarkable as he couldn't even swim when he first started rowing, and also has the pressure of his mother being seriously ill in hospital. He joined the army in 2012, needing a way to support his family after his father died from bone cancer the previous year.
Stationed in the much lusher district of Pune, he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw a vast expanse of water where recruits practised rowing.
At first Bhokanal was intimidated, and wondered why water was being used for sport when so many people in the farming belt were thirsty. But over time he defeated his fears.
"Eventually I got comfortable with the water and there was no looking back," he told AFP.
Bhokanal quickly showed skill to match his impressive, lean six-foot frame and in 2014 he competed at the Asian Games in South Korea where he finished fifth.
During regional Olympic qualifying races in April in Chungju, also in South Korea, Bhokanal made the grade for the men's single sculls in Rio de Janeiro in August.
"It feels nice that I am bearing the fruits of my hard work," he told AFP. "But this instant stardom does not make me any different and I will not lose the focus of my goal."
"I am still the same person looking to get an Olympic medal," Bhokanal said, adding that his mother's plight has only "strengthened (his) resolve".
He also said the hardships of Indian village life can be a good breeding ground for aspiring athletes, despite the lack of water and other resources.
"I believe that people from villages tend to work harder," Bhokanal said.
"Farming and housework activities require a lot of physical labour and that makes us tougher. City life is much more relaxed and people tend to just enjoy themselves more," he added. India's chief rowing coach Ismail Baig hailed Bhokanal's "brilliant" dedication and down-to-earth nature.
"He was new and inexperienced but he was hungry to succeed and he worked extra hard to prove himself," he told AFP.
"Even though he's now in the limelight he remains a simple guy who has no airs and graces," Baig added.

Lanka faces stiff opposition from Malaysias Fijian imports
All rugby fans in Malaysia will wend their way to Royal Selangor Stadium in Kuala Lumpur to witness in what should turn out to be a closely fought out battle between two evenly matched teams in the Asia Rugby Division one championship where defending champions Sri Lanka will take on vastly improved Malaysian side with a Fijian flavour today. Kick-off will be at 4.30 p.m.
The contest should turn out to be a battle between the respective forwards. With a set of heavy and strong forwards, the Sri Lankan team should have the edge upfront. Also they should see plenty of good ball coming their way through the line outs where players like Soyuru Anthony, Sharo Fernando, Jason Dissanayake and skipper Sudarshana Muthuthantri can zoom over their rivals. The visitors may be able to have their own way in the set pieces, through their hefty Fijian third row forwards.
But the Tuskers team led by that tear-away forward, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, will answer with a mobile back division, who are fit, fast and can mount tremendous pressure on their opponents.
The Lankans will be searching for possession in the loose through their young forwards, who are fast and furious to penetrate the Malaysian defence. The Sri Lanka, back division has the ability of co-ordinating well which could prove awesome with their superior mid-field play through their faster three quarters.
In the absence of Kandys play maker and full back Nigel Ratwatte who has undergone a knee operation, ex CR, Navy and Police full back Rizah Mubarak will play in the full back position like he did against Singapore, while CR and FC wing three quarter Kavindu Perera will play alongside Havelocks skipper cum co-winger Sandun Herath.
With Marija been not available due to a back injury (slip disc), Navy player Chanaka Chandimal will play as fly half while CRs Bhanuka Nanayakkara is likely to come in his place as fly half in the second half.
Danushka Ranjan who had suffered from an injury has now fully recovered and will partner with CR centre Kanchana Ramanayake. Both players had earlier represented Sri Lanka sevens team hence they are expected to pair off well. Ranjan in fact ended being the most valuable player of the tournament last year when Sri Lanka beat Philippines in the final.
Both teams have players, who could produce individual brilliance, to make this game a most exciting one. But in the end it will be the team that indulges in cohesive rugby that could prove to be the winning factor. Sri Lanka are determined to play their running rugby in the caliber of the Fijian style, that too with sweeping moves to rattle the Malaysian defence.
Last year Sri Lanka turned tables to win this championship in an absorbing contest. It turned out to be a spectacular performance by the Sri Lankan Tuskers where the white shirted team won convincingly against favourites Philippine Volcanoes in the finals to remain unbeaten and win the championship for the first time in their over 100-year history.
Young Jason Dissanayaka, who finally donned the Sri Lankan jersey, is now playing his normal running rugby by opening out many holes in the opponents defence. A hard-running youngster he has the ability to form the overlap from being a forward towards the three quarter line. But in today's tie his opposition team mates with the help of Fijians are sure to mark him.
Sri Lanka national head coach Western Samoan Tevita Laga Tulagaese said, It will be a close fight and I personally think if we (Sri Lanka) minimize the space for those Fijians to run then we will come out on top.
My heart is telling that Sri Lanka will pull it off even in the last minute; but we really have to get our defences right.
We were bit rusty against the Singapore side in the last match but its understandable because the players were after a hectic club season. Dont worry in the end we will win, cheers to Sri Lanka, Laga said.
Whoever wins this crucial match, will be one step closer to the championship enabling them to be the ultimate winner.
Sri Lanka (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Nivanka Prasad, Ganuka Dissanayake, Jason Melder, Sharo Fernando, Sudharshana Muthuthantri, Jason Dissanayaka, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weerarathna, Chanaka Chandimal, Kavindu Perera, Kanchana Ramanayaka, Danushka Ranjan, Sandun Herath, Rizah Mubarak (WAI)

Rankothge to blow at Bradby Second Leg
Asian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) elite A panel and leading A Division Referee Aruna Rankothge has been appointed by the Referees Society of the SLRFU to referee the second leg of the 72nd Bradby Shield match between Royal and Trinity at the Trinity Sports Complex in Pallekelle, Kandy on May 14.
Rankothge, a product of St. Sylvesters College Kandy represented the 1st XV team from 1989-1991 and later turned out for Kandy Youths CC and Kandy Sports Club from 1992-1997 as a flanker.
His first coaching experience was at his alma mater St. Sylvesters College and under his guidance they entered the Division one of the schools rugby tournament and put up a stunning display in defeating Trinity College at Pallekele in 1998. By a strange twist of fate Rankothge has successfully coached the Trinity junior rugby teams for several years before he quit.
Rankothge has 20 years experience in rugby refereeing both in Sri Lanka and at international matches. He has been in the Asian Rugby referees panel for a long time.
Locally he has officiated at top level club and school rugby matches including the prestigious Bradby clash between Trinity and Royal on three occasions before.
His experience in rugby refereeing has taken him to many countries like India, Pakistan, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Kazakhastan, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi.
He had the honour of refereeing at the under 20 Junior World Cup (IRB) qualifying matches in China (2004), Korea (2008), and Philippines (2009). He was also picked to officiate at the South East Asians rugby sevens tournament in Thailand (2007).
Rankothge was given a promotion and did the big league at the Asians Five nation encounter between Arabian Gulf and Hong Kong in Dubai and the India vs Kazakhstan encounter as an assistant referee.
He did another assignment at the Dubai Sevens in December 2010.
He is only behind Dilroy Fernando and Nizam Jamaldeen in terms of refereeing experience, especially at international level. He recently completed a Level III part-I (in Dubai 2011) and Referees Level III part-II (in Manila 2012).
Its a real honour as an experienced referee at my level to officiate the prestigious Bradby Shield which I have done three times before, said Rankothge.
I know the good and the bad of officiating at this traditional encounter since I was the referee at last years Bradby second leg encounter in Colombo. But personally for me its another match taking up the whistle as the in-charge and nothing more than that. I believe its the same feeling with other referees as well. (WAI)

Prasad injury scare ahead of First Test
Spearhead of the Sri Lanka bowling attack Dhammika Prasad suffered shoulder niggle that saw him walk off the field in the middle of his 18th over in their 3-day tour match against Essex at Chelmsford.
Prasad the architect of Sri Lankas maiden Test series triumph in England in 2014 with figures of 5 for 50 at Leeds was forced to limp off the field during Essexs first innings on the second day. His over was completed by Dimuth Karunaratne.
Team mate Kaushal Silva said that it was a shoulder niggle but the management later confirmed that Prasad would be sent for a precautionary scan.
He's a big bowler for us, Silva said. He has been the spearhead for the last two years and in the last series against England he was the one who changed the game, so he's an important character in our bowling line-up.
