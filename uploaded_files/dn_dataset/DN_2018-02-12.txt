40 model villages for Kurunegala
Steps are being taken to set up 40 model villages in the Kurunegala District this year, said Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and Housing and Construction Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake, speaking to the media yesterday at the Nikaweratiya SLFP office.
About 1,000 new houses are to be constructed under this programme which is to be implemented under the guidance of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa and myself, Bandaranayake said.
These houses will be given to public servants and low-income families who have no houses of their own. The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) would carry out this massive project covering all 30 Divisional Secretary divisions within the district. Government land has already been identified for this purpose and those who wish to build houses under this project would be awarded with a soft loan of Rs.500,000 each, he said.

Aguero scores four in City romp, Kane leads Spurs past Arsenal
LONDON, Saturday - Sergio Aguero scored four goals as Manchester City extended their Premier League lead to 16 points and Harry Kane netted again as Tottenham Hotspur beat arch-rivals Arsenal 1-0 on Saturday.
After a sluggish first half in the early kickoff at Wembley, Kane jumped highest to head home his seventh derby goal in seven games and 23rd in the league this season.
Spurs, who would have won by a greater margin but for an inspired performance from goalkeeper Petr Cech, climbed two places to third while Arsenal sit six points adrift of Liverpool in fourth and Juergen Klopps side have a game in hand. At the Etihad Stadium Aguero and the brilliant Kevin De Bruyne, who added three assists, were in inspired form as City blew away Leicester in the second half to seal a 23rd league victory from 27 games this season.
I think we played brilliantly today, the boys did really well and of course Sergio Aguero was a different class today, Raheem Sterling, scorer of Citys opener, told the BBC.

Ruled out of T20I matches against SL
Bdesh captain Shakib targets Nidahas tri-series for comeback
DHAKA, Sunday: Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasans comeback from a hand injury has been delayed further with the all-rounder set to miss the opening T20I of the two-match series against the visiting Sri Lankan side.
While Bangladesh chief selector Minhajul Abedin was hopeful of his return for the second T20I, Shakib himself expressed doubts over his participation for the remainder of the series against Sri Lanka.
Shakib sustained an injury to his left hand during the tri-nation ODI series final and later had to receive stitches. The 30-year-old, who was named the Test and T20I skipper of the national team, was subsequently ruled out of the two-match Test series with Mahmudullah leading in his place.
According to Minhajul, the stitches on Shakibs left hand have been removed and it would require at least a week to heal. We knew that he might not be available for the opening T20 but we are hopeful that he will be in back in action when we will play the series concluding game in Sylhet, Minhajul said.
Shakib, meanwhile, said hes unlikely to be unavailable for both the games, setting his sights on the tri-nation T20I series in Sri Lanka, also involving India, for his return to national duties. I dont think I will be available in the T20 series, he told reporters on Sunday (February 11). The doctor told me that it will take two weeks to heal fully. I am looking forward to playing in the Nidahas Cup by completing my rehab fully during the upcoming two weeks.
The T20I series against Sri Lanka begins in Dhaka on February 15. The second match of the series will be played in Sylhet on February 18. The tri-nation series in Sri Lanka is set to begin on March 6.

Bangladesh beaten at their own game as Lanka pocket Test series
To say that Bangladesh were beaten at their own game is a tad closer to describing the two-Test series that Sri Lanka won by a 1-0 margin.
Without their key player and captain Shakib Al Hasan who had a finger injury and was ruled out of the Test series, Bangladesh prepared a dead pan pitch at Chittagong for the first Test that was a heartbreak for bowlers and resulted in a high scoring drab draw.
Coming to the second Test at Mirpur, Dhaka the pitch prepared for the second Test turned out to be just the opposite where batsmen who had been so dominant at Chittagong were struggling to put bat to ball. Right from the first day the pitch started to turn square and produce uneven bounce so that the first two days saw 28 wickets tumbling. By the third day before tea the remaining 12 wickets were consumed and the Test was over with Sri Lanka winning by a handsome margin of 215 runs.
If ICC Match Referee David Boon found the Chittagong pitch too heavily in favour of batsmen across the five days and rated it below average he might as well repeat the same for the Dhaka pitch substituting the batsmen for the bowlers.
The scores in the two Tests make contrasting reading:
Chittagong Test  Bangladesh 513 and 307-5; Sri Lanka 713-9 declared.
Dhaka Test  Sri Lanka 222 and 226; Bangladesh 110 and 123.
If Bangladesh thought that they could rattle Sri Lanka on a spinning track they were sadly mistaken because Sri Lanka proved they were very much up for any challenges that was thrown to them. Also they had the added advantage of head coach Chandika Hathurusinghas knowledge in the dressing room. Hathurusingha knew the strength and weaknesses of the Bangladesh team as well as their pitches like the back of his hand having been their mentor and coach for the past three years. So whatever challenges Bangladesh threw at Sri Lanka they were able to counter them successfully.
One neednt have to look that far to realize how Hathurusingha operates. The selection of Akila Dananjaya ahead of Lakshan Sandakan proved a master stroke on the Dhaka pitch.
Dananjaya who till then had been recognized only as a one-day bowler proved how effective he can be in the longer format too capturing eight wickets in the match on his Test debut and subjecting Bangladesh to a three-day defeat. The Bangladeshi batsmen were all at sea against Dananjayas range of spin. Although he is rated as an off spin bowler Dananjaya bowls a variety of deliveries from off-break, leg-break, carrom ball, wrong un and doosra to confuse the batsmen and on a treacherous pitch proved unplayable. To say that he picked up his eight wickets in the match bowling only a total of 15 overs shows his mastery over the Bangladeshi batsmen.
The other factor that was in favour of Sri Lanka was the toss that played a decisive role in the outcome of the Test. Dinesh Chandimal who is turning out to be an inspirational leader called correctly on this occasion and the rest we all know.
So far on the tour Hathurusingha has shown his hand by first guiding the team to win the One-Day Tri-Series and now in the longer format the Test series. The two losses will certainly hurt Bangladesh as only four months ago Hathurusingha was sitting in their dressing room. The two T20Is is the next challenge that Sri Lanka faces before completing the tour.
It is still early days to judge the Sri Lanka team on how good they are. But Sri Lanka having gone through a torrid 2017 would welcome any kind of victory to boost the morale of the side and its supporters.
That Sri Lanka won the Test series without their most experienced batter Angelo Mathews and sans Kusal Perera and Asela Gunaratne shows the depth they have in their batting with virtually all the players having recovered from the various injuries that affected the team performances throughout 2017.
If Dananjaya proved to be a surprise packet as a match-winner for Sri Lanka in the second Test, the find of the series was Roshen Silva who deservedly took the Man of the Match as well as the Man of the Series awards. Silva who had to wait a long time to break into the national Test side is making full use of his opportunity to cement a permanent place in the team.
Having begun his Test career with a duck in the first innings of the third Test against India at Delhi, Silva as a middle-order batsman scored an unbeaten 74 to help Sri Lanka force a draw. In the just concluded series against Bangladesh Silva scored his maiden Test century at Chittagong and followed it up with two high class half-centuries on an uneven Dhaka pitch where all the batsmen struggled to negotiate the bounce and turn. His unbeaten 70 off 145 balls in the second innings was the highest individual score made by any batsmen in the Test.
The other encouraging factor for Sri Lanka was the return to form of their brightest star Kusal Mendis after being left out of the series in India. A big game player Mendis scored another of his massive knocks for which he is gradually earning a reputation for, compiling 196 in the Chittagong Test and following it up with an innings of 68 in the first innings at Dhaka. At 23 Mendis is still young and has a lot to learn especially when you are close to a landmark like a double century in Test cricket. For the second time in his brief career he missed out on the opportunity  on both occasions against Bangladesh.
Mendis in this series was asked to open the batting with Dimuth Karunaratne. Whether that is a good move or not one has to keep ones fingers crossed. Mendis needs to be tested against some of the top bowling sides in the world and see how he copes with extreme pace, seam and movement to fit in as an opening batsman. In his 24-match Test career so far Mendis has batted from positions 1-5 without ever retaining a permanent position.
This is not good for a batsman of Mendis extraordinary talent to be shifted up and down the batting order without giving him a permanent slot. The management and national selectors must decide soon which position is best suited to his style of play where they can get the maximum out of him as a batsman.
The vital number three slot for the time being has been filled in by Dhananjaya de Silva whose fluent stroke play is bringing him some useful runs in that position. Recalled for the series in India, De Silva marked his return to the Test side with a match saving century at Delhi against India and following that he made a career best 173 in the drawn first Test against Bangladesh at Chittagong.
He too like Mendis has not been given a permanent place in the batting line up having batted from positions 3-9 in his 13 Test appearances.
Despite Akila Dananjaya grabbing the limelight with his dream Test debut performance Rangana Herath referred often by his captain Dinesh Chandimal as the wily old fox continued to produce the match winning performances that he is capable of. His effort of 4/49 in the Bangladesh second innings at Dhaka took him past Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akrams tally of 414 Test wickets and made him the most successful left-arm bowler in Test history.
With Herath nearing 40 how long he can continue playing Test cricket will depend on the condition of his troubled knees. It is good that Sri Lanka are starting to groom some young spinners like Dananjaya and Sandakan to succeed him before he eventually calls it a day.
After a long time Sri Lanka that has a long tail are starting to produce some useful runs. Top of the list is Suranga Lakmal who has developed into a fairly good tailend batter having the ability to stick around even if he is not scoring runs. Dananjaya adds to that list. Lakmals confidence comes from the way he has developed into a strike bowler for his team.
As for Bangladesh without a permanent head coach they will continue to struggle. Their honeymoon with Hathurusingha is over and they may have to start from square one again to become the team they once were barely a few months ago.

CaFFE says polls peaceful, calm
The local government election which concluded yesterday was peaceful and calm with no major incidents being reported. There were a few incidents that were reported, but on the whole voting went on in a peaceful manner, said CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tannakoon.
Speaking to the Daily News he said however that the people had given the government a clear sign to step down. What we have seen in this election is a very unique situation. The flower bud party very clearly won the election. No government in power has ever lost so badly. This clearly indicates that during the past two-and-a-half years this government has failed miserably. However, the issue here is that the UNP is going to continue until 2020, despite this defeat. Ranil Wickremesinghe is a leader who has lost for the thirtieth time and this is not a good sign for the country.
Tennakoon noted that there are around 100 persons around the Prime Minister who will support him, but on the other hand there are around 2,000 people who will not. How is he going to carry on the government with all these people against him The main reason for the UNPs defeat is nothing but the arrogance of its leader. During the Treasury Bond issue, the government was unconcerned about the country and the people clearly defeated them because of this, he said.
He also noted that another reason for the governments defeat is the high cost of living. The people are suffering and with all this fraud and huge sums of money being wasted by the government, people are disgusted. Moreover, the minority has also distanced themselves from the government. Therefore, the people have given the government a clear sign to step down. If a government cannot deliver on its promises, the people distance themselves from the government and this is what has happened to this government. Just giving people empty promises will not work and the people have clearly shown this to the government. They no longer believe mere words, the people demand action and this is where the government has failed and they had to pay the price for it, he added.
According to Tennakoon, the Prime Minister is unpredictable and no one knows what he will do next. However, he warned that if the government fails to respect the peoples verdict, there will definitely be a mass uprising against the government from next week.

Dr. Perera said this cancer unit was set up on the instructions of Director General Health Services, Dr Anil Jasinha. The unit started with eight beds but now has 16 beds. From January, 42 patients have already been treated here. This unit at the Ambalantota base hospital is being managed by the Hambantota general hospital.

England hang on for tense win over feisty Wales
LONDON, Saturday - Two first-half tries by winger Jonny May proved the difference as holders England beat a gutsy Wales side 12-6 in an absorbing Six Nations battle at Twickenham on Saturday.
On a freezing wet day in west London hardly conducive to silky skills, May capitalised on two moments of magic as England claimed a 15th successive home victory in the competition to stay joint top of the standings with Ireland.
England led 12-3 at the interval and although Wales threw everything at them in the second half they could not penetrate the white wall in front of them.
Gareth Anscombes late penalty, the only points in the second half, gave Wales a flicker of hope but England held out to record their 24th win in 25 games under Eddie Jones.
Wales, who started with 10 players from regional side Scarlets, could feel justifiably hard done by, though, after a key TMO decision went against them.
Fullback Anscombe, in for the injured Leigh Halfpenny, had a try controversially disallowed before the break after the video referee adjudged he had not grounded the ball.
England were also indebted to an astonishing try-saving tackle by replacement flanker Sam Underhill who denied Scott Williams what looked like being a certain score.
It was a good old-fashioned arm wrestle today but were getting good at winning those arm wrestles, Jones said.
Its great to see that when were not quite at our best we are getting the results. I never thought it would be a routine win. Wales are tough, well-coached and a good side.
Wales coach Warren Gatland was proud of his teams display but was left to rue the TMO decision.
It looked like a try to me, he said.
England got off to a flying start and were a try to the good with only three minutes on the clock.
Anthony Watson got the better of fly-half Rhys Patchell to knock back a 50-50 high ball and when Owen Farrell gathered he instantly spotted a yawning gap behind Welsh lines.
His grubber-kick was perfect and there was only going to be one winner as May raced through to gather and dive over.
Only one player in the team could have scored that, Jones said of his flying winger.
Farrell missed the conversion and Rhys Patchell failed with a long-range penalty for Wales before England launched a concerted assault on the Welsh line.
Wales defended desperately as England battered away for phase after phase but eventually cracked when lock Joe Launchbury off-loaded superbly in the corner to open the door for May to make the short dash to the line.
This time Farrell kicked the conversion.
Anscombe appeared to have scored for Wales when he seized on Patchells kick but French referee Jerome Garces took the decision upstairs and the video official deemed that Jonathan Joseph had got the first touch and that Anscombe had not applied enough downward pressure on the ball.

FIRST SITTING OF LG BODIES ON MARCH 2
The first sitting of new Local Government Authorities will be held on March 2, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the Secretary said a fresh Gazette would be issued in this regard either today or tomorrow.
He said this decision was arrived at a discussion with Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya last week.
Earlier the date for the first sitting had been fixed as February 15. However, holding the first sitting on this date is practically impossible as it takes time to finalise the members list of each LG body.We already know the members elected from the First-Past-the-Post system, but the respective political parties have to nominate the members for the seats they have won under the Proportional Representation system.This has to be done by the General Secretaries of respective political parties. It may consume time, he explained.
He said a fresh Gazette would be issued extending the date of first sitting from February 15 to March 2. He said the Provincial Councils have already started improving infrastructure facilities in each and every LG body to house the increased number of members under the new electoral system. Renovation of buildings and purchase of furniture have already started. If they need any additional funds, we will make arrangements to give them, he added.
Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V. K.Anura said a discussion would be held with the newly appointed Council members to decide on the location of CMC sittings due to space restraints at the Council premises.He said hiring BMICH is still an option and not finalised.

Historic victory for SLPP - JO
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has made a historic victory since not a single political party in Opposition, had defeated the governing party at a local government election, the SLPP said yesterday.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said a new political party had never defeated both the leading political parties in Sri Lankas political history as well. He added that not only the village, but most of the towns and cities have placed their trust and confidence with the SLPP.
They made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party head office, Jayanthipura, Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena also thanked the people of the country for voting the SLPP and asked them to enjoy the victory peacefully. He also said that it is moral for the government led by the two political parties to give up power since they have been rejected by the people.
SLPP leader Prof. G.L. Peiris stated that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has been defeated than ever before under the present leadership. He said it was also moral for him to give up the party leadership as well. He pointed out even the people of the Polonnaruwa district have placed their confidence with the SLPP as it had won with more a 5,000 vote majority.

Improving West Ham stall Watford's momentum
LONDON, Saturday - West Ham overcame Watford 2-0 in a game with plenty of chances at the London Stadium on Saturday, putting the Hammers level on points with their opponents in the middle of the Premier League table.
Watford had been looking to maintain their recent momentum after their 4-1 midweek win over champions Chelsea.
But it was the home sides Mexican striker Javier Hernandez who broke the deadlock in the 38th minute, heading in his seventh goal of the season at the far post after winger Michail Antonio wove through the Watford defence and sent in a long cross from the left.
West Hams midfielder Marko Arnautovic, back in the side after a hamstring injury, teamed up with new Portuguese signing Joao Mario to tug the Watford defence out of shape and create numerous chances throughout the game.

JHU thanks UNF voters
The Jathika Hela Urumaya yesterday expressed its gratitude to the people who voted for the UNP led United National Front at the Local Government Elections held on Saturday.
In a statement, its General Secretary Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, said the results of Saturdays election showed that people felt that, they as a government, had failed to establish Good Governance (Yahapalanaya) policies pledged during the 2015 Presidential election in a tangible manner.
A democratic government based on a peoples mandate answerable to the people should always accept the response received from the people in a positive manner and act accordingly.
It should be emphasised that it was the duty of all parties in government to undertake policy and structural reforms asked by the people.
A large majority of people flocked behind us in 2015.The results of this election indicated that even after a lapse of three years, a large majority of people had still reposed faith in us despite shortcomings on the part of the government.These people should be our first priority. It should be emphasised that it is the duty of us all to work towards the fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of the people who voted for the UNP led United National Front without leaving them behind,the statement said.

Kandy SC gives Marija a fitting farewell
Kandy Sports Club gave their star performer Fazil Marija a fitting farewell by recording their 14th consecutive win in as many matches to end the Dialog A division league rugby tournament as unbeaten champions for yet another year.
Kandy SCs Fazil Marija waves to the crowd on his farewell appearance at Nittawela.
Yesterday at Nittawella they thwarted a strong comeback in the second half by Havelocks SC to win by 30 points (2 goals, 2 tries, 2 penalties) to 28 (4 goals) after leading 22-0 at half time.
The winners got the better of their opponents with some well taken tries in front of a passionate home crowd. The hosts made the perfect start, with some good run and pass rugby. In the first half Havelocks were desperately lacking in quality and were dull in continuing to kick long even though had some good players to feed them every time.
In the second half Havelocks came back to the game and handled the ball well to score 28 points and cause some concern in the Kandy camp. Their play was superb in the second half where they were able to score four tries all of which were converted. They got off to a perfect start in the second half and took the ball up to the goal line on all occasions and were also good in attack and defence.
But Kandy, who knows how to win matches, was obviously superior for a number of reasons. Most obviously the speed of their ruck ball and their breakdown work was of the highest order with Fazil Marija who was playing his last game at Nittawela enjoying one of his finest games for the club. He ended up scoring three superb tries. He constantly taunted and teased the Park club defence and also his box-kicks were expertly done.
Kandys forward play was also magnificently reliable, with all forwards having an excellent match.
The scorers for Kandy were Fazil Marija three tries, Gayan Weeraratne one with the kicking part being done by Nigel Ratwatte.
For Havelocks Lasindu Karunatilake scored two tries and there was one each from Sudam Suriarachchi and Liston Fanty. Reeza Mubarak did all the kicking.
And at the end of the game Kandy SC skipper Gayan Weeraratne received the Dialog league trophy.

LG ELECTIONS : STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS, ISSUES AND REFORMS
In Sri Lanka, local government has been an essential component of the administrative systems even before the colonial period. However, present form of local government structure was introduced during the colonial rule of British with the establishment of Colombo and Kandy Municipal Councils (MCs) by Ordinance No.17 of 1865. Since then there had been several changes and improvements in the form structure and functions of Local Authorities (Las). At the time of independence in 1948, systems of Local Authorities in operation were Municipal Councils (MCs), Town Councils (TCs) and Village Committee (VCs).
After independence, several committees appointed to examine the problems of local government and to recommend the necessary reforms. The Choksy Commission (1953), the Moragoda Committee (1978) and Tennakoon Commission (1979) were among them.
Before introduction of Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution (1987) and establishment of Provincial Councils (1988) local authorities had been under the direct control of Central Government. The Minister of Local Government was responsible and answerable to the public through parliament for their performances in local authorities. After the establishment of Provincial Councils under the Thirteen Amendment to the Constitution, subject of local governments came under the Provincial Councils.
At present there are three types of local authorities functioning at three different levels:
Municipal Council (MCs) for major cities constituted under MC Ordinance.
Urban Councils (UCs) for developed and semi developed urban areas constituted under US Ordinance.
Pradeshiya Sabha (PCs) for rural areas under Divisional Secretariats divisions- constituted under Pradeshiya Sabha Act.
Structure of Local Authorities
With the introduction of Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, matters relating to form, structure, composition and constitution of local authorities became a function of the Central Government. Before constituting the local authorities the Minister in charge of the subject of local government has to declare the area for that purpose (i.e. a Municipality for a Municipal Council, a Town for an Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabha area for a Pradeshiya Sabha). With regard to the MCs and UCs one of the basic criteria to be considered is the degree of urbanization, density of population, economic development and provision of amenities. In determining the limits of Pradeshiya Sabha area, it is stipulated by law that the area shall, as far as possible correspond to the area of Assistant Government Agents Division. However, it was observed that there was no consistent policy in Sri Lanka in constituting and upgrading local authorities. Today local government elections are held under the mixed system including ward system.
All local authorities are corporate bodies governed under elected councils subject to supervision and guidance by two higher forms of government. They derive their powers and functions from the Constitution, Central and Provincial legislation. Other than the provisions made under main ordinances and Acts, there are many laws which confer powers on local authorities on various aspect of local administration. Some of them are Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance, Urban Development Authority Act. Thoroughfare Ordinance, National Environmental Act, Butchery Ordinance, Burial Ordinance, and Rabies Ordinance. Many of these legal provisions made by through other laws relating to LAs are outdated and need to be updated. In addition LAs are empowered to formulate by-laws on various subjects and functions.
As already known there are some similarities in the composition of local authorities. Each Municipality Councils consist of the Mayor, Deputy Mayor and a number of councilors as prescribed by the Minister by order published in the gazette. Similarly each Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabha consist of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and such number of members as determined by the Minister by order published in the Gazette. In determining the number of members the Minister shall have regard to the extent, population and the level of development of the area. (The composition of the membership of each Local Authorities is stipulated in section 5 of both MC & UC Ordinances and in section 4 of the PS Act).
Powers and functions
Powers and functions of all three types of local authorities are almost the same and basically charged with matters relating to public health, public utility services and Thoroughfare. Section 4 of the MC Ordinance states The Municipal Council constituted for each Municipality .charged with the regulation control and administration of all matters relating to the public health, public utility services, public thoroughfare and generally with the protection and promotion of the comfort, convenience and welfare of the people and amenities of the municipality. Provisions in section 4 of the UC Ordinance are almost identical with provisions made in the MC Ordinance. Section 3 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act also contains similar provision with regard to the functions of PSs. In addition, the PS Act has made some provision for Pradeshiya Sabha to engage in certain social and economic development activities in their respective areas.
Local Authorities have the following powers and functions, as provided in the respective statutes.
i. Powers to acquire, possess and dispose of properties.
ii. Powers to enter into contracts to matters relating to the functions assigned to LAs by-law.
iii. Powers to raise revenues.
iv. Powers to incur expenditures
v. Powers to issue licenses
vi. Powers to frame by laws.
In addition to traditional functions relating to public heath, public utility services, thoroughfare and physical planning, Local Authorities as have the responsibility of taking regulatory measures relating certain activities such as construction, industrial and commercial undertakings, blocking out of lands, parking of vehicles, protection of payments, stray animals etc., in order to ensure orderliness comfort, convenience, environment and to prevent nuisance.
Although the improvements in infrastructure and public utility services facilitate the speedy development of the area, Local Authorities are not assigned the functions, which are directly related to socio-economic development of the country. However, PS Act has made some provision for PS to engage in certain development activities such as agriculture, community development and relief programmes.
Council Meetings and Committee System
Elected Council is the policy making body of a Local Authority. The Council meets once a month to take decisions. Counsellors are expected to be in close touch with the people and to take decisions to fulfill the desires of the respective communities. The committee system operating in local authorities are very important and is expected to facilitate the council decisions and promote community participation in council affairs. There are two types of committees:
i. Standing Committee
ii. Ad hoc Committees.
MCs have a Standard Committee on Finance and not less than two other committees on other subjects. In case of MCs standing committees are compulsory. All matters which go to the council meetings should be discussed at the relevant standing committee and before they are taken up at Council Meeting. Under the Urban Council the standing committees discuss issues before they are taken up to the council meeting. However, under the Urban Council, standing committees are not compulsory.
The Pradeshiya Sabha Act also provides provisions for appointment of 4 committees for following subjects: Finance and Policy Planning, Housing and Community Development, Technical Services, and Environment and Amenities. These committees also are not compulsory. Except in MCs, committee system is not functioning regularly in UCs and PSs. At present, the committee system in UCs & PCs function as advisory bodies. Generally members of all the committee consist of elected members. However, there is a provision in the UC Ordinance and PS Act to appoint citizens of the area as members of the committees, but in practice it is not happening.
Revenue
Most of Local Authorities in Sri Lanka do not have sufficient financial resources to meet the needs of the communities. The revenue base of Local Authorities, except a few local authorities such as Colombo and Kandy MCs are very poor. There are three major sources of revenue for local authorities:
i. Revenue collected by LAs,
ii. Grants and re-imbursement from the Government and
iii. Loans.
Local Authorities are empowered to levy certain rates, taxes and licensing fees are permitted by Ordinances and Acts. The main source of revenue comes from Assessment Rates. These rates are mostly collectable by Local Authorities in Urban areas. Even the revenue from licensing is also derived mainly from industrial and businesses in urban areas. The principal source of revenue for Local Authorities in rural areas in the acreage tax and it is collectable from land exceeding one hectare in extent. Under the present structure of Local Authorities, there is wide gap between urban and rural Local Authorities in regard to collectable revenue.
Most of Local Authorities are collecting less than 75% of the collectable revenue. Poor performance of Local Authorities in collecting revenue had badly affected the planned development activities of the Local Authorities. At present around 75% LA revenues are spent on meeting administrative and maintenance costs leaving them dependent on grants from Central Government and Provincial Councils for development activities.
At present salaries and allowances of employees in Local Authorities are reimbursed to the Local Authorities by the Central Government through Provincial Council. The stamp duties collected by the Government in respect of land transactions in Local Authorities areas are also reimbursed to the Local Authorities by the Government through Provincial Councils. The government also provides grants to Local Authorities for capital work through Provincial Councils, decentralized budge and foreign funded project.
Devolution of powers
One of the objectives of establishment of Provincial Councils in 1987 through the 13th Constitutional Amendment is to devolve the powers of Central Government to sub national levels and thereby to find the solution to the ethnic problem that has prevailed in the country for a long period of time. It is also expected to accelerate the regional and rural development policies and programmes through the decentralized structures of governance.
Provincial Council together with local authorities constitutes a major component in the countrys administration and local government has become a significant element in the system of governance. Although local governments are recognized by the Constitution, it has been observed that Local Authorities have not been treated as an effective instrument in process of the devolution or in accelerating the local level development. The present debate on the devolution of power would have been much more realistic and meaningful if local government institutions were treated as an essential feature of devolution and local development.
At present, Divisional Secretariat co-ordinates most of the administrative and development functions within the Division. It performs agency functions of Central Government Ministries as well as the Provincial Councils on this basis. Local authorities play a marginal role as the primary tier of sub-national level when compared to the functions of Divisional Secretariat. Under devolves structures, Local Authorities are expected to be main development arm of the PCs. But in practice local authorities that were never in the mainstream of development are further marginalized by placing them under the administrative purview of Provincial Councils.
The role and functions of local government has not been changed sufficiently to meet the socio-economic and political problems that have been occurred over the years especially with the expansion of the economy. Although constitutional recognition has been given to Local Authorities under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Construction, no structural changes were taken place at local authority level to address the issues relating to devolution or local level development. No additional responsibilities were given to Local Authorities by the Government or Provincial Councils to deal with such issues.
Local Government reforms
The report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Local Government Reforms (1999) has addressed the most of the issues identified in the local government sector and made recommendations to overcome the defects in the system. Many of these recommendations are still valid to date for implementation.
 Incorporation of Local Government as a level of governance into the Constitution
 Expansion the powers and functions of Local Authorities and widening of scope of activities
 Strengthening of Committee system of Local Authorities by making it compulsory.
Making of Local Authorities to be the planning authority at local level.
 Expansion of resource base of Local Authorities
 Introduction of special programmes to develop human resources of Local Authorities.

Light of Asia
SARC represents the Greater India in the dreams of Nehru and other fighters for liberation of India from British imperialism. We unitedly represent, may be one forth of humanity. Humans are the same, irrespective of colours and bodily differences. So much so scientist say we are all children of one mother separated from Homo erectus. Yet humans like to be in groups with much commonality. Anybody coming to Indian sub condition will see that Indians are very much the same; surprisingly common things are so much, one can forget where you are in this vast land. However once you are in slowly will see the differences.
Person arriving from Delhi to Colombo and on the road from Colombo to Kandy may thank the gods for having allowed this break from the bitter cold of Delhi into such a lush paradise of warmth and water and throat-searing food. But we have to be careful because many say it is also a bit disorienting to be in this country. It feels like Indian, the landscape is especially so and yet there is something that is distinctly different.
Remarkable literacy rates
One does not get this kind of disorientation in a patently different land  Japan or Sweden for example; there everything is new, different and modern so one is clearly an outsider. And within greater India, even in places far away from ones usual place of residence there are reminders of the larger country one claims citizenship of the SARC  Hindi film music wafting out of narrow lanes, life-sized posters of unpleasant politicians wishing someone or being wished by someone.
So how are Lankans different from other Greater Indians of course there are all the textbook stuff on Lanka that was rammed down throats in classes on development in college  the remarkable literacy rates (virtually universal), the excellent health (infant mortality, maternal mortality and life expectancy levels that rival Western Europes), the fantastic public services for health and education that persist in the face of a neo-liberal economy.
Also everybody knows that this country has seen more than two decades of brutal violence, which appears to have finally ended or at least paused due to a period of even more brutal violence. But these are not things that one notes visually and emotionally disturbed enough to account for ones feeling of disorientation. Then what are these more obviously visible unique features of life in Lanka One media person answers I think that three startling differences make up the root cause of my disorientation. May be they are related, but may be they are not  they are quite distinct and dont automatically accompany economic growth.
First of all (and dearest to any democrat) is the ease and joy with which women traverse public spaces. In the densest crowds, such as in the packed public buses they ride in Colombo and in the heaving masses pay their new years respects at the Sacred Temple of Tooth in Kandy. Apparently if this had been India (and especially if this had been Delhi), there would have been few women daring enough to actually be present as well as to smile pleasantly at strangers.
Indian cities
In Lanka women smile at even male strangers, as male media people happily discover. Instead in India they would be fearful of being groped and mauled if young (or even middle-aged) and pushed roughly aside if old and weak.
The second reason for feeling out of place in Lanka, we are told, is that public spaces are unreasonably clean. Neither in Colombo nor on the road to Kandy did they see the mounds of filth-encrusted plastic bags and other forms of smelly or environment-contaminating waste that even the most expensive parts of Indian cities and towns revel in. Nor were public buildings and roadsides ungrudging receptacles for fiery red spit. We know this is an achievement in the last few decades due to the progress of modernism.
The third striking absence, according to them, was of the kind of degrading poverty one sees in such abundance in any place in India. One media person said I dont think their poor and homeless get hidden from view as ours reportedly were in Delhi during the Commonwealth Games and, yet, even the one apparent beggar I saw on the street, and tried to give some change to, turned out to have a sheaf of lottery tickets she pressed upon me in return. So Yahapalanaya is not so bad. However we must understand the situation is not as rosy as they paint. English speaking Yahapalanists in Colombo who travel by A/C cars and shop in malls can be enjoying the sunshine.
Women are landless in the north due to militarization. Nearly 90,000 have been made widows and struggle to make ends meet. Loan sharks have taken the life of several women. The perpetual search for their loved ones snatched by the military amidst government denial is the harshest burden upon them. Justice seems to be a distant dream for their missing men.
Gender-based violence
Women in Lanka also face many critical forms of discrimination, including gender-based violence and the ill-treatment of migrant women and their children. Apart from domestic violence, women are also subject to sexual abuse, putting them at risk of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.
Lankan womens already poor rates of labour force; participation continue to decline despite steady economic growth. Apparently young and poorer women in Lanka are particularly vulnerable, experiencing significantly higher rates of unemployment. How are the conditions in other parts of Greater India Is not the problem we Indians face criticism from all world famous feminist leaders.

This year saw a bumper harvest of 120-135 bushels of paddy per acre. Many farmers cultivated red rice this season.
The price of one bag of paddy is Rs. 2,500 and is expected to increase. Farmers are happy that their produce can be sold at the guaranteed price. But some rice mill owners are reducing the price as those areas experienced little rain.
Many hectares were brought under paddy cultivation in the Ampara District for the Maha season this year. Farmers want to complete harvesting before the rains begin.

Sir D. Baron Jayatilaka
The uncrowned philosopher king of Ceylon
 the society we have described can never grow into reality or see the light of day  till philosophers become rulers in this world, or till those who we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers - Plato
Tomorrow marks the 150th birth anniversary of one of Lankas greatest sons, Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka, (Sir D.B). He was a true son of the soil, born on February 13, 1868, in a remote village in Waragoda, Kelaniya. He was the eldest son of Don Daniel Jayatilaka and Dona Elisa Jayatilaka, a highly respected noble Buddhist family in Kelaniya. His primary education at the Vidyalankara Pirivena, inculcated in him true Buddhist values, under the tutelage of scholarly monks, where he learnt Sinhalese, Pali, Sanskrit and Buddhist literature.
His secondary education was continued at Wesley College, an excellent missionary school, where he was exposed to the western curriculum. The natural scholar and intellect he was, led him to obtain his BA with Honours from the University of Calcutta, in English and Latin and later on he went on to obtain his MA from the University of Oxford. He was called to the Bar at Lincolns Inn, and subsequently enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. In 1898 he married one Mallika Batuwanthudawa from Warahena Bentota.
The young Sir D.B returned from England at a time when the country was seeing the revival of its religious, cultural and national values, which was in a state of decrepit due to colonial rule. He too being passionate for this cause came under the influence of prominent persons such as Henry Steel Olcott, Anagarika Dharmapala, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, D.S. Senanayake, C.W.W. Kannangara, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, T.B Jayah and the like.
The Buddhist renaissance which began in the early eighties of the 19th century and gained greater momentum in the early years of the 20th century was orchestrated by Henry Steel Olcott, Anagarika Dharmapala, together with Sir D.B. This was also a time when Henry Steel Olcott started the Buddhist Theosophical Society which began to open Buddhist schools in various parts of the country to promote Buddhist education and Sir. D.B played an active part of this movement. This was during a time and era when education was a monopoly of the catholic missionary institution. Together they started Dharmaraja College in Kandy where Sir D.B became its first principal in 1890.
His motive was to serve the Buddhist who had no English schools of their own. It is said that he went round neigbouring villages to raise funds for Dharmaraja College and became a household name even in the remotest villages of the province. Within a short period of time, with his ardent dedication and hard work he was able to transform Dharmaraja College to a leading school in the province.
Buddhist education
The success story at Dharmaraja College brought him to Colombo to be appointment as Vice Principal of Ananda College in 1898 and soon thereafter as Principal in 1900. His determination to raise funds for the school saw him travel all over the country by rail, coach, cart and sometimes by foot. His self-sacrificing nature to a bigger purpose, to a bigger cause always got the better off him. This led him to become a national figure from a household name. His appointment as the Secretary of the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1908 gave him the necessary impetus to advance Buddhist education to even greater heights. He was passionate about advancement of education in the country in general and Buddhist education in particular.
Sir D.B not only carved himself out as an educationist but also as a scholar. The speech he made on Buddhism at the Congress of Religions in Berlin in 1910, which was given wide publicity in Germany, made him a scholar of international repute. He also edited numerous texts which were used in schools, universities and places of higher learning.
He was the founding Chief Editor of 'A Dictionary of the Sinhalese Language. These publications will keep his memory ever green among succeeding generations of students. Through scholarly speeches made being an active member in Temperance Movement, carved him out as an intellectual beyond his times.
Sir D.B though an educationist at heart, was thrown to the deep end of politics when he got involved in the nationalist movement against the colonial rule. It is claimed that he once remarked that there is no greater danger to a country than an ignorant democracy. His greatest contribution to politics was that he humanized politics with scholarship and religion. He rose above pettiness of class, race or creed. He won the love and support of every community in the island because he was preeminently a man of the people. His political career commenced when he decided to fight the cause of innocent prisoners who were arbitrarily arrested.
Sinhala-Muslim riots
Sir. D.B himself was arrested in June 1915, allegedly for making seditious speeches and writing inflammatory articles. Others such as D.S. Senanayake, F.R. Senanayake were all taken in as prisoners. Soon thereafter on May 28, 1915 the Sinhala-Muslim riots broke out and Martial law was declared in the island. Although born to be an educationist and religious and social worker, his determination and voice to get justice for the riot prisoners made him a politician and freedom fighter overnight. Sir D.B in his moments of highest political attainment, in the hour of his greatest glory, did not forget the people from whom he came. This is the secret of him not becoming a lost leader.
Sir D.B started a reform movement with fellow activist, such as F.R Senanayake, E.W. Perera and Sir Ponnambalam Ramanadhan. When the National Congress was formed in Ceylon, he became its representative in England. Upon his return to the island in 1919, at a grand reception held for him at Ananda College to welcome him (much to his displeasure for he did not like pomp and pageantry) he has declared thus; I have decided not to have receptions and precessions. I believe in giving my best to my motherland without expectation of any praise or demonstration of any kind. I believe in humility and simplicity. I believe in being one with the common man. Words of wisdom for the rulers of today!
Knighted by the British Government
On December 2, 1923 he was elected the President of the Ceylon National Congress. When elections were held under adult franchise for the first time in Ceylon in 1931, Sir D.B was elected Member of Parliament for Kelaniya. He then became the leader of the House of the State Council of Ceylon and Minister of Home Affairs. Sir D.B was Knighted by the British Government for his immense service rendered. When he retired from active politics in the eyar 1942, his strong relations with India made him the ideal candidate to be appointed as Ambassador to India.
He was appointed at a time when relation between India and Ceylon was at its lowest ebb, over the problem of Indian migrant workers in our tea estates. The philosopher statesman that he was, Sir D.B was able to smoothly handle the situation and maintain the cordial relationship with India.
During his mission in India, Sir D.Bs health was failing, first by a malaria attack and then by other complications and it was his ardent wish that he return home for treatment. On May 29, 1944 he was flown home in a special plane organised by the Viceroy of India.
On his way back to his beloved home country, it is said that he suffered a heart attack and passed away in the plane whilst still over Indian territory. His remains were cremated at Borella amidst huge crowds on June 1, 1944. Sir D.B died bequeathing unto the Public Trustee upon his Last Will his valuable home, the house and property called the Thurburn House at Bullers Road, Colombo 7. Today it house the Public Trustees Office. His trust in the public service system was unquestionable for he left his most prized and valuable asset to the care and custody of the Public Trustee. A duty that is bestowed on anyone holding the office of Public Trustee is to ensure that the property left behind by this magnanimous statesman, be persevered and his wishes be carried out. This is the least this country can do to one of her greatest sons.
Ceylon lost its most uncommon common man as he was once described. With his death Ceylon became much poorer. But then again great men never die. He was a philosopher king, the like of which we have not had in this country from then to this day. In the words of D.S. Senanayake, Sir D.B had the courage of his convictions, it was not popularity that he sought, but that he should act in the way which he thought was the best interest of the country  personal considerations never weighted for him. The interest of the country was all that he was concerned with. My humble wish is that, may the likes of Sir D.B be born amongst us and may this nation once again have a philosopher king.

UNP accepts poll verdict - Hashim
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said the party accepts the verdict given by the people at the local government elections.
Through this verdict, the people have given us a warning signal, Minister Hashim said in a statement issued on behalf of the party yesterday.
The statement said: We hope to subject this verdict to deep rethinking and dedicate ourselves to perform our role expected from us more correctly and vigorously.
The services we have rendered in the past are many. But people tend to forget some of them. This election was a case in point and a good example for this, he said.
We were able to change an expensive system of elections which promoted clashes among candidates of the same party and created a better election environment.
We stopped the misuse of State property and funds for election purposes completely. We have made several good and positive steps in a number of sectors including the education section. Some of the good deeds we rendered are still not visible.
Their results will be seen in the future bringing immense benefits and dividends to the people.
There are things we have still failed to fulfill while there are some failures.This was caused by the immense debt burden bequeathed by the Rajapaksa regime and the unexpected natural disasters faced by the country. We will strive hard to fulfill all neglected deeds and other shortcomings.
On January 8 people entrusted us with the responsibility of creating a social, economic and political change for the better. That responsibility was again emphasized at the August General Election. We will re-dedicate ourselves towards fully implementing the responsibility entrusted to us according to the mandate given us by the people in August, the statement issued by UNP General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim said.

A wake-up call
It certainly is a wake-up call for the Yahapalanaya government. Yesterday's local government election results went onto prove just how fickle our voters can be. It may be difficult for many to contemplate as to how a government, which was elected with such a fund of goodwill only three years ago hit such a nadir, as demonstrated by yesterday's electoral outcome. It (result) certainly smacked of a massive protest vote against the government for its failures on many fronts. The unusually large voter turnout at Saturday's election tells a tale. No doubt, the rising living costs, and, allegations of corruption within government ranks took a heavy toll. So was the procrastination in dealing with the corrupt, in the Rajapaksa government, casting doubts in the minds of the voters, on the authenticity of such charges.
The government also erred in not responding effectively to the charges leveled against it by the Joint Opposition. The silence no doubt created a negative image of it in the eyes of the voting public. For instance, the JO's aim at the government, accusing it of selling state assets, such as the Hambantota port and Mattala airport apparently found it's mark. Government worthies were not effective enough in countering these allegations.
At the time this is being written the pohottuwa, under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa, has virtually swept the board leaving only a handful of Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban Councils with the UNP. Of course, as expected, it won the Colombo, Kandy and Galle Municipal Councils, and, surprisingly, bagged the Hambantoa MC as well. The SLFP/UPFA was lagging far behind even in some of its strongholds with the pohottuwa winning a couple of LG councils Polonnaruwa, the President's home turf.
No doubt, there will be much soul searching on the part of the government. It should get down to the drawing boards and try to ascertain where it erred and take remedial measures in order to wrest the initiative back. The groundswell of public opinion against the government, due to its failure to tackle the day-to-day problems too had its impact. The huge majorities scored by the pohottuwa in the rural areas was proof that the government had alienated a large segment of farmers and the peasantry who have to undergo a harsh existence. The failure to promptly respond to the difficulties of the farmers like providing fertilizer on time and also problems they face in disposing their paddy harvests, no doubt, exacted a heavy price in terms of the massive protest vote. The current drought and destruction of crops certainly added to the frustration which was taken out on the government at Saturday's LG election. The bond issue too proved crucial, in the voters making their minds, especially as it was made to overshadow every other scam of the Rajapaksas.
In addition, the spate of protests, the frequent doctors strikes, street demonstrations and student agitations, almost on a daily basis showed the government up for being ineffective and powerless. Of course, such protests were dealt with an iron fist by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Still the pubic could not help but juxtapose the present situation with the discipline that prevailed during that era and found the government wanting on this score.
Certainly, the anticipated split in the SLFP/UPFA voter did not take place, with the blues virtually being decimated and the pohottuwa carrying all before it. President Sirisena may be ruing the opportunity he frittered away in taking disciplinary action against Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JO parliamentarians for going against the party, and, what is more, forming a party of their own. Now that MR had given leadership to the new party and won elections under its banner, it would be interesting to see what the President's next move is going to be.
The UNP, for its part, has much repair work to do, if it is to regain the initiative. There is a full two years left before the Presidential Election, ample time to catch up and remedy the mistakes. It is not clear as to the fate of the agreement signed between the unity government, in the wake of the election results. Of course, in a large number of local councils where the UNP or SLFP/UPFA lost, the tally of their combined votes exceeded that of the pohottuwa, and, therefore, as a unit, could muster a majority in these councils.
Be that as it may, the just concluded local government election, held under the old ward system, after a period of 41 years, was one of the most peaceful elections held in this country in recent times. The police acted impartially and even went to extent of detaining government candidates for violation of election laws. Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya deserves all the kudos for holding the scales evenly, and, implementing the laws to the letter, without fear or favour. The unprecedented voter turnout (in some LG councils it was over 85%) was proof that the people exercised their franchise in an atmosphere free of fear and tension. No state resources were abused by the governing party, unlike in the past. It clearly was democracy at work.
