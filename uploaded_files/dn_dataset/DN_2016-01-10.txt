Black Caps batting blitz leads to huge Twenty20 win over Sri Lanka
Auckland duo Martin Guptill and Colin Munro have put on a batting blitz to lead New Zealand to a massive nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second Twenty20 at Eden Park on Sunday.

Chasing 143 for victory, the Black Caps needed just 10 overs to reach their target.

After Guptill plundered 63 off just 25 balls, including five sixes and six fours, and was then the only wicket to fall, it was hard to imagine he would be bettered as the hosts waltzed to their triumph.

But Munro came in and treated his home crowd to a special innings of his own.

The No 3 hit the second fastest international T20 half-century, blasting a remarkable seven sixes and finishing 50 not out from only 14 balls as the Black Caps wrapped up a 2-0 series victory.

Skipper Kane Williamson's unbeaten 32 off 21 seemed pedestrian in comparison, the Black Caps skipper getting the best seat in the house as Guptill and Munro found the middle of the bat over and over again.

A masterful 81 not out off just 49 balls from test captain Angelo Mathews rescued the visitors' stuttering innings, his being easily the main contribution in their 142-8.

But his efforts were to be in vain, the Kiwis coming out and swiftly going about putting on a show for the 17,058 crowd.

Between the top order trio, there was a stunning 12 sixes and 10 fours. Munro put the exclamation point on the result with a towering six to seal victory.

New Zealand 147-1 (Martin Guptill 63, Colin Munro 50*, Kane Williamson 32*) Sri Lanka 142-8 (Angelo Mathews 81*, Tillikaratne Dilshan 28, Grant Elliott 4-22, Mitchell Santner 2-24, Adam Milne 2-36)

Sri Lanka fighting to keep top T20I ranking
Sri Lanka have to win the second and last Twenty20 International against New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland on Sunday to not only level the series, but also ensure that it holds on to the No.1 ranking in the format, failing which it will slip to third behind West Indies and Australia.

That Sri Lanka lost the first game was largely because of a superb bowling display by Matt Henry and Trent Boult, both of whom picked up three wickets each.

Chasing 183, Sri Lanka needed 35 runs in the last four overs with four wickets in hand. Milinda Siriwardana was hitting the ball well and had raced off to 42 in 29 balls. That is when Kane Williamson, the stand-in captain, brought back Boult, who had dismissed Tillakaratne Dilshan and Shehan Jayasuriya in the first two overs, for his third spell.

Boult produced a well-crafted over filled with slower deliveries and accounted for Siriwardana to finish with 3 for 21.

Kapugedera and Nuwan Kulasekara kept the game alive and the equation boiled down to Sri Lanka needing 13 runs off the final over. But, Grant Elliott, in his first international game since August 2015, kept things tight, Kulasekara was caught off a slower ball at deep midwicket and Kapugedara was run out in the fourth ball, as Sri Lanka went down by three runs.

Boult was the Man of the Match, but the victory had been set up by Martin Guptill and Williamson. Both the openers hit fifties and put on 101 runs in 10.5 overs before Colin Munro and Ross Taylor provided the finishing act to the innings.

While winning the series and keeping the momentum alive for the upcoming assignment against Pakistan would be high on New Zealands agenda, getting the team composition right for the World Twenty20 in India would not be far from the team managements plan.

To that end, Mike Hesson, the coach, has said Ross Taylor could be promoted to No.3 to fill the gap created by the absence of Brendon McCullum, who will retire before the multination event.

Taylor has so far batted 12 times at No. 3 in his 65-match career, the last appearance there having come against Bangladesh in November 2013. So far he averages 18 at that slot, and New Zealand has just a few games in its hand to see if Taylor is comfortable with his new role or not.

While Taylor has the cushion of an in-form Guptill and Williamson, Sri Lanka would want the entire top order to come good as early as this game so that it can end the tour, where it has already lost the Test and One-Day International series, on a high and keep its pride as the No.1 T20I side intact.
