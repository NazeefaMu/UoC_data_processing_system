Cocoing it right!
Considered an elixir of sorts, coconut water is natures answer to all your health woes. Hydrating benefits aside, the beauty benefits of coconut water are aplenty. While coconut water can be used in myriad ways, we list the best possible ways to include them into your skincare routine.
The acne crusader: Have you been fighting acne for the longest Coconut water could be what youre looking at. The presence of lauric acid in coconut fights bacterial and fungal infections. Douse a cotton swab in coconut water, and gently apply across the face. Now, scrub gently before washing it off. Doing this on a regular basis helps keep blemishes and fine lines at bay.
Eczema curer: Constant application of fresh coconut water on affected areas has proven to be really effective. This is because the presence of constituents like potassium, lauric acid and cytokines hydrates the skin and helps to maintain the Ph balance.
A natural SPF: Rich in Vitamin C, coconut water helps to reduce sun burn to a great degree. That aside, coconut water is an excellent antioxidant.

Government spends Rs. 45,000 m on state universities
The government spends over Rs. 45,000 million every year to maintain state universities, United Students Front (USF) Senior Vice President Isuru Perera said.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday.
He said it was not practical to increase the local university intake to include every student.
"Then the government would have to sacrifice the maintenance of other essential services," he said.
Private education institutions are essential to achieve sustainable development.
Private universities will ease the local students educational needs and it will attract foreign students to the country.
It will attract more foreign currencies and that will appreciate value of the Sri Lankan rupee, Perera said. He said a low interest student loan scheme should be introduced to fund students' higher studies.
USF Spokesperson Chiranthaka Palugaswewa said the SAITM is rather a production of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime.
He said the government had identified the need of standardized private education institutes as a solution to eliminate the disparities between the percentage of advanced level passed students and that of the university intake.

We need to be aggressive and positive says Mathews
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews stated that if his team was to go anywhere in next months ICC Champions Trophy in England they will have to start the tournament in an aggressive and positive manner.
With all eight teams capable of winning the title and equally strong there is no chance of a comeback in the tournament if you falter at the beginning, said Mathews whose team arrived in Colombo yesterday following a six-day residential camp in Kandy. Sri Lanka is grouped with South Africa, India and Pakistan from Group B and it is an equally tough group as Group A which comprises Australia, England, New Zealand and Bangladesh. Sri Lankas opening game in the Champions trophy is on June 3 at the Oval against South Africa against whom they recently suffered a 5-0 whitewash.
South Africa has been playing some great cricket in the past few months and it will be a challenge taking them on again. We have worked out some strategies against them and we know whats coming at us. If we play to our potential we can beat them, said Mathews.
India and Pakistan are two subcontinent sides like us and have fared well in world cricket. We have to be on top of our game to beat them. Most of the players we have played against each other and we know their strengths and weaknesses. We are not thinking too far but taking one game at a time, he said.
Sri Lanka has not played Pakistan since July 2015 and the last time they met, Pakistan ran out winners 3-2 in the five-match ODI series played in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka and India last played against each other in an ODI series in November 2014 where India won 5-0 at home.
Statistically the figures are not that encouraging for Sri Lanka but in a tournament of this nature a winning start could turn things around dramatically.
One of the keys factors towards achieving that objective is getting used to the conditions and pitches in England, Mathews said.
We have made use of all the resources available at home to us to prepare ourselves for the big event and the next step is to get acclimatized to the English weather and pitch conditions, said Mathews.
This is the first time we have practiced outside Colombo as a group in preparation for a tournament and we have made maximum use of the facilities provided in Kandy which was excellent. We underwent an intense training program and the whole idea was to get into match condition. I was very impressed with the effort, attitude and intensity with which the team responded.
The next 12-14 days we spend in England is going to be very crucial to getting used to the conditions. We have four practice matches  two against Scotland and two more arranged by the ICC against Australia and New Zealand to sort out our batting order and the combinations for the tournament, he said.
During the six-day training camp in Kandy, Mathews said the squad had addressed several issues that had affected the team during the recent series against Bangladesh especially fielding.
Fielding is very important and so are the other two aspects batting and bowling. Every day it has been a learning experience for us and a team can get better by doing that, said Mathews. Unlike previous ODI tournaments Sri Lanka has been bolstered by the return of fast bowler Lasith Malinga to the side after a near two year absence.
Lasiths presence is a tremendous boost to the team. He is a match winner and sharing his knowledge with the players will benefit them a lot, said Mathews.
Lasith has been training very hard playing matches in the IPL has also helped his build up. He is an experienced player and he knows what is required of him for the team. He is very professional in whatever he does. Handling pressure is not an issue for him. He has been through many throughout his career, he said.
Mathews stated that he was quite confident of Malingas fitness to return to fifty-over cricket and that he would utilize him for the full quota of 10 overs during the tournament matches.
Malinga will have the support of Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep and Thisara Perera with Mathews also fit and prepared to bowl his medium-paced deliveries that will be very useful in English conditions. From the batting perspective Mathews said that it all depended on the batsmen in form at the time of selection.
We have three openers and we will try to stick to the original order in the middle without making too many changes, he said.

## Title: Ajith de Silva the best left-arm leg-spinner we ever had
## Supertitle:

Ajith de Silva the best left-arm leg-spinner we ever had
I travelled all the way to Ambalangoda to trace Ajith. He is having a flourishing business in the heart of the town.He was gracious enough to give me some of his time, whilst delegating work to his subordinates. Ajith was candid about his views on local cricket, right throughout the interview.
His raw talent was spotted by the Ananda talent scouts even while playing for Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda. Subsequently Ajith was offered a place at Ananda. Although he refused vehemently at the start, he was persuaded by his parents to go to Ananda College which paved his way to the international arena.
Ajith did well at Ananda and he then joined NCC, he was a tall left arm bowler who was naturally gifted he had large hands which fitted the bill perfectly for a slow left arm orthodox bowler. He bowled a perfect arc and had a classical follow through and by now he had mastered the dipper which hung in the air to deceive the batsmen and also how to use the width of the crease as well.
I can recall way back in 1975, how we travelled up to Nottingham,Trent Bridge to watch Sri Lankans play against Pakistan. However, Ajith did not take the field that day, when inquired from him for the reason he said he was bemused being made the 12th man. I remember Javed Miandad playing in that match it was his debut year and was young, fresh and rosy cheeked completely different from the brash mustachioed street fighter he was known to be later.
Ajith recalls the 1979 World Cup tour to England again and he regrets that he was side lined due to his poor fielding. He mentions that the wickets were turners and the other two left armers S. Jeganathan and R Wijesuriya were incapable of using those conditions. He states that he cannot still find an answer as to why he was made 12th man in that match if he was a poor fielder, to cap it all when he was summoned to the field to replace an injured fielder, he took a blinder at either mid-off or mid-on, this certainly would have put egg on the face of the selectors mainly because when Ajith returned to the dressing room after showing his colours as a fielder, he then in no uncertain terms said to the selectors where they have gone wrong, and there was pin drop silence thereafter. That was not all recalls Ajith, he was not allowed to bowl in the nets thinking that his prodigious turn and steep bounce would be dangerous to our batsmen. Certainly the selectors have made a major cock up, laments Ajith.
When inquired about the 1996 World Cup winning team, Ajith was of the view that there were batsmen who were capable of scoring from 1-11 and also had many all-rounders and a team like that comes only once in a blue moon.
Rangana Herath he says is a heady bowler but his lack of inches is a major drawback because he cannot extract a lot of lift and bounce.
Another major concern of Ajith is the lack of continuity in our cricket. He quotes several examples such as Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara and Muralitharan; there were no players groomed to take over from these legends.
Ajith has no qualms about the captaincy of Angelo Mathews, he points out that although Mathews is not so demonstrative on the field, he has a good cricket brain and during breaks in play he must be liaising with the players and the support staff trying to get the maximum from the players.
Ajith was also instrumental in bringing Dinesh Chandimal from Dharmasoka Ambalangoda to Ananda College. Although Chandimal was reluctant to move, Chandimals parents persuaded Ajith to contact with Udayananda Perera the then coach of Ananda and there began Chandimals road to stardom.
Ajith himself had to curtail his career at the young age of 30 years, due to several reasons. He joined the rebel tour to South Africa, and according to him there contract was for two years and he was to get approx. Rs 200,000/= after the completion of one year. Unfortunately their contract was terminated says Ajith because their performances were not up to expectations. They had to play against the South African top team and their pace bowlers were tall and strong and bowled with a lot of zip and steep bounce. In spite of that Ajith says Anura Ranasinghe and Bernard Perera got hundreds and Ranasinghes one in particular was sparkling. Ajith was full of praise for Ranasinghe because after getting past 30 runs he treated the bowlers with equal disdain. After coming back from that tour Ajith settled down at Ambalangoda and he runs his own business apart from dabbling in politics as well. His late mother was the first ever woman to be a mayor in Sri Lanka.
When inquired about the future of Sri Lanka cricket, Ajith was emphatic that the continuity of selected players at top level should be persisted with. He said that there is no need for foreign coaches since people like Anura Tennekoon, Bandula Warnapura etc could do a better job since they know their products from grass root levels and their pulse. However much expensive quick fix solutions one brings into the picture at the last moment will not hold water, concluded Ajith.

America hails governments two-year performance
Sri Lanka has achieved economically to a stable level under the Good Governance during the last two years, American Congress Member Bill Johnson said.
He points out that he sees ruling the country by two main political parties a unique situation. Johnson expressed these views during a meeting with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on May 15 held at the Finance Ministry.
After making a tour of the North, Johnson told Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake that the ongoing rehabilitation and development activities in the North are successful. He said he is confident that the government would take necessary action to fulfil any more aspirations of the people in the North, if any.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said all parts of the country have been put under development by the Good Governance. He said Sri Lanka is internationally succeeding under the abled guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said the responses received by Sri Lanka at the recently concluded biannual conference of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund held at Washington DC are clear example to this situation.US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap was present.

According to the latest survey conducted by the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare, it has been revealed that about 10,000 aged persons have sought shelter in 306 elders homes countrywide.
These senior citizens are now housed in six government elders homes and 300 elders homes maintained by the Provincial Departments of Social Services. Most of these aged persons have been handed over to the elders homes by their own children. Some are ill- treated and neglected by their own children. About 57 aged parents of these have already filed cases against their children demanding maintenance allowances. It has been estimated that 2.5 million persons who are above 60 years are included in the total population of Sri Lanka, said W. E. Jayathilake, former Divisional Secretary for Bingiriya in Kurunegala.
He was addressing a meeting of representatives of Elders Associations of the Kurunegala District held in Bingiriya recently.

That asset called investment
Our governments preach untiringly the importance of foreign businesses and investments for Sri Lanka. For a Capital deficient and technology poor country it is essential to attract both money and know how. Whether it is direct investments in projects, foreign businesses setting up office here or investments in real estate or the stock market, we want them.
But try as hard as we may; promotions, road shows, various concessions to investors, constant visits to foreign countries by our dignitaries, international agreements, we havent got the desired results. In comparison to neighbouring countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore the volume of foreign investments we have attracted are miniscule and that too mostly in to low-tech and low return areas; not the kind industries or ventures that can push a country rapidly towards a qualitative jump in terms of development.
Despite nature having blessed this island generously and as argued often, placed it strategically in terms of international trade routes, we have not caught the attention of international business nor attracted investments sufficient to make a decisive difference. Like in many other things, we expect investors to flock in because we have nice beaches. Believing in our own propaganda, we ignore the reality.
Reality is an everyday experience. What millions of Sri Lankans encounter when dealing with organs of the government is far from doing business with ease or ease of doing business, as these ideas are commonly understood. If the people of this country find it so difficult to do their everyday business, surely we cannot create another reality only for the foreign investors, by just wishing for one. After the garlands, drummers and the dances, the foreign investor must function in this reality. And that is horrendous.
Here are experiences of two Sri Lankans which illustrate the reality of our public service. Both are known to me well.
Dehiwela /Mt. Lavinia Municipality
The first is a retired bank executive who owned a commercial property in the Dehiwela/ Mt. Lavinia municipal area. He had rented the property to a business for a number of years. After a few years the tenant reneged and stopped paying his rent. With great difficulty, including lengthy legal action and police intervention my friend persuaded the tenant to vacate the property. The elderly landlord, emotionally and financially exhausted by his desperate effort to regain his property, decided to sell.
Naturally, the prospective buyer required title and other documents. To obtain documents like the Non-Vesting Certificate my friend had to go to the Municipality Office. According to him the Dehiwela/Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council office is a nightmare of indiscipline, indecorous levity and when least expected, a pompous officiousness. The title office is a misnomer here, while the public wait: the staff walks about casually, chat with each other loudly, eat at their desks and have long conversations on their mobile phones. After a lengthy bureaucratic process requiring several visits to the Council office, when my friends file was eventually located it was in a shocking state, a dilapidated folder with several loose documents tucked carelessly into it.
Then the bad news; apparently his former tenant whose business required a Business License from the Municipality had not obtained one for eight years. The Council will not give any document to the landlord unless he made good the default of his former tenant! Although shaken by this obvious injustice, my friend decided that it will be meaningless to argue the rights and wrongs of the rule with the slovenly municipal employees. So he pleaded with the officer for some relief.
The officer had then directed him to another officer, obviously more senior, sitting in a cubicle. This officer after listening to my friend had advised him to pay just two years business license fee and in a softer voice told him to just look after the officer who directed you here.
My friend is a pragmatic man and understood the message. He did as told and gave the first officer Rs.10, 000. The Non-Vesting Certificate was immediately issued by the Municipality.
I am happy that I sold the land in the Dehiwela/Mt Lavinia Municipality area. Going to that office is a degrading experience. It feels good to escape from the clutches of a Municipal Council like that.
Kotte UC
In the second case, a friend of mine who lives overseas decided to develop an inherited property in Rajagiriya by building a commercial cum residential building. He had friends who guided him.
The first day he went to the Kotte Urban Council the officers there were bureaucratic, giving him a timeframe of about three months to approve the plans, and that too only if all his documents were in order. They had told him, portentously, that a committee has to approve his plans and that this committee included representatives from the Urban Development Authority and other government officials. My friend could not wait that long.
He had gone to the Council office with a contact and passed money around lavishly. Some officers, particularly females, to whom my friend felt uncomfortable giving direct financial inducements he had passed on boxes of foreign chocolates, dresses and shirts.
He had his approval within a week.
Contracts with the government
I can add to this an example of another aspect of the state of our public service today. This is in relation to the offer of a long term lease of an agricultural land owned by a government institution. The bidder was a foreign company which had got into a partnership with a local party. They wanted the land for a tourism related development. The draft contract provided by the Government institution was in Sinhala; if the bidder wanted to understand it, he had to get it translated.
One of the local partners showed the document to me. I did not need a translation. It was a very poorly drafted document with many repetitions and irrelevancies. Obviously most of the clauses in it were from a cut and paste exercise, with little relevance to the subject matter. On the face of it, the contract was hardly a balanced document; clause after clause was heavily loaded in favour of the landlord (government), with copious descriptions of methods of payment and so on. A person acquainted with international commercial agreements would be taken aback by the crudeness of this one-sided approach. But in the course of discussing the document we discovered that there were many loop holes, irregularities and contradictions which made the contract mostly meaningless. In any event, the local partners were nonchalant about the menacing nature some of the clauses, there is no seriousness here, they assured me.
Our public service is manned completely by products of our education system, perhaps even the best it can produce. Clearly, the three Rs of old do not suffice today. At a very basic level; to answer the phone politely, reply a letter within a reasonable time, respond meaningfully to an inquiry or request, seems too much to expect from the public servants of today. Years of politicization has diminished them, todays public service is programmed only to respond to the call of the politician. We need an education system that can produce something different altogether. If we are serious about competing effectively, we must find men of integrity; dedicated, upright as well as capable; with greater minds and a larger vision than what we now have. The future of the country depends on our ability to produce such men.
Singapore
About one thousand six hundred miles to the East of Colombo is a small island called Singapore. In size, it is only about 720 sq. kms. (Sri Lanka is 65,000). Its population is 5.5 million compared to Sri Lankas 20 plus million. These are about the only areas where we have a lead; in terms of GDP, Singapore is about 295 Billion US $ while we are a modest 82 Billion (app). Where Per Capita income is concerned, Singapore is among the richest countries, commanding a Per Capita income of US$ 53,000, while we in Sri Lanka have a Per capita income of only US$3870(app).
In the Transparency International perception of corruption index Singapore stands at an admirable number 7 , better than even countries like the Netherlands, Canada and Germany. Sri Lanka is at a lowly 95, worse than Rwanda, Senegal, India and China.
For some of the reasons for this embarrassing gap between our tiny neighbor and us, we could profit by referring to a recent book-The Fourth Revolution-The Global Race to Reinvent the State by John Micklethwait & Adrian Wooldridge.
I quote therefrom -
Lee has always made it clear that Singapore is open for business: There are few places where it is easier for a big multinational to set up shop, where tariff barriers are lower, where taxes are more manageable. But at the same time the State guides the economy. It chivies local businesses up the value chain-betting first on manufacturing, then on services and now on knowledge economy
I do not believe that democracy necessarily leads to development. The exuberance of democracy leads to undisciplined and disorderly conditions. Having seen other countries in the neighbourhood torn apart by ethnic strife, he has no qualms about forcing people live in mixed neighbourhoods in order to prevent ethnic polarization
Good government in turn relies on an educated elite of good people running the country. No country works harder at perfecting its civil servants than Singapore, nor follows such an unabashedly elitist model. It spots talented youngsters early, luring them with scholarships, and then spends a fortune training them; those who reach the top are richly rewarded, with pay packages of as much as $2 Million a year, while those who falter are thrown overboard.
Sitting around a table with a group of Singaporean mandarins is more like meeting junior partners at Goldman Sachs or Mckinsey. The person on your left is on secondment at a big oil company; on your right sits a woman who between spells at the Finance and Defense Ministries has picked up degrees from the London School of Economics, Cambridge and Stanford. High-fliers pop in and out of the Civil Service College for more training: The Prime Minister has even written MBA-style case studies for them
When looking for foreign investments, such is the field we compete in.

Bank of Ceylon continues to dominate as No. 1 Brand for 9th consecutive year
Bank of Ceylon yet again reinstates itself as the No. 1 brand in Sri Lanka for the ninth consecutive year according to Brand Finance Sri Lanka records, published in 'Brands Annual' by Media Services.
Brand Finance Sri Lanka is the Sri Lankan partner of Brand Finance UK which is a leading body with a global network in 17 countries.
Brand Finance Lanka revealed that the BOC brand has a value of Rs. 40 billion.
BOC Chairman, President's Counsel Ronald C. Perera said, "Maintaining our position as the No.1 Brand in the country is an achievement like no other. Anyone would agree with me that being the No.1 Brand in the country for the ninth consecutive year is an unmatchable achievement. We have done exceptionally well during past years and now we are the only bank that has Rs. 3 trillion on the balance sheet. Our next goal is to enhance the bank's asset base up to Rs. 2 trillion by 2019 which will surely be another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry."
Empowering Sri Lankans to realize their life goals through affordable yet best-in-class banking solutions in its steadfast journey of over 77 years, BOC has always gone that extra mile to add value to the Sri Lankan banking industry. With the pledge to commit as 'Banker's to the Nation', since its inception the bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require.
The first and only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn a profit before tax of Rs. 25.3 billion for 2015 and profit before tax of Rs. 31.2 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking. Two very significant achievements of BOC in recent history were the surpassing of Rs. 1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016. The bank's asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.
Brand 'BOC' has been able to overcome significant macro and micro environmental changes in the banking and financial industry to establish itself as a superior brand in the country. With the time tested vision as 'Bankers to the Nation', Brand BOC has delivered the best result for its true stakeholder, citizens and the Government of Sri Lanka.
BOC has earned the trust of Sri Lankans and proudly caters to over 12 million customers today. With its massive financial capacity and adaptable approach that comes with inherent commitment towards the country's social and economic development, BOC has enabled banking services successfully to a very diverse customer base from individuals to businesses and organizations of different geographic and economic strata.
BOC offers the flexibility and convenience of a whole gamut of banking services under one roof for everyone from newborn to senior citizen and micro entrepreneur to corporate business. In order to cater to this geographically diverse customer base, the bank has 625 branches spread over every nook and corner and owns the largest ATM/ CDM network in Sri Lanka with over 825 machines serving customers 24 hours, 365 days.
BOC was the first Sri Lankan bank to have marked its presence overseas with the opening of "BOC London" in 1949 at the epicenter of international banking at that time. Later BOC spread its foreign branch network to Chennai, Male and Seychelles. Apart from its own foreign branch network BOC maintains foreign correspondent banking network with over 860 foreign banks and exchange houses. "The Bank's approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind the BOC brand's 77 year long success.
Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylon's motive was the same - to promote the social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services. A very recent example was the BOC's digital transformation that completely changed the bank's internal processes along with its customer interface and infused synergy to the whole Sri Lankan banking system.
"Along with the benefits of digital transformation BOC was able to embark on green banking comprehensively for a sustainable growth together with the community," said BOC General Manager D.M. Gunasekera. "We have many on-going environmentally friendly programmes that have been there for several years. However with the digital infused transformation the bank introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that include IT and physical infrastructure."
In the bank's success story, the staff commitment, dedication and their achievements played a vital role and that has been recognized when Asia's Best Employer Brand awards organized by Employer Brand Institute endorsed the BOC as one of those classed as a Best Employer Brand for the year 2016. The strength of all these factors contribute to make the "BOC" brand No.1 for the ninth consecutive year," he added.

Batch of 23 SLITHM teachers awarded Australia Awards certificates
The Australian High Commission recently hosted a reception to congratulate 23 teachers from the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) who were awarded Australia Awards certificates for successful completion of an International Training and Assessment course.
The Hon John Amaratunga, Minister for Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Lands was joined by Charlotte Blundell, Counsellor Development Cooperation to present the awards.
Australia is a long-standing partner of Sri Lanka, this year marking 70 years of diplomatic relations. The Australian Government has a current focus on helping Sri Lanka to build a well skilled labour force to service Sri Lankas booming tourism industry.
Tourism has great potential to create work and business opportunities for thousands of people here in Sri Lanka and successful hospitality businesses rely on the skills of the people involved, said Ms Blundell at the event.
Australia Awards is the scholarship program funded by the Australian Government. Over the past six decades, the program has provided over 1000 scholarships to Sri Lankans.
For many of the SLITHM trainers who have backgrounds in the hospitality industry, this was the first time they had received formal training on how to be a teacher. As well as introducing practical and effective ways of teaching and assessing student learning and abilities, the course covered two hospitality subjects on managing diversity in the workplace and providing service to customers. Gender equality and social inclusion were cross-cutting themes of the whole program. The course was delivered intensively over a five week period by Melbourne Polytechnic, one of Australias leading institutes in hospitality and tourism management.

China slowly increasing influence in the Bay of Bengal: Indian Navy officer

China is slowly increasing its political, economic and military influence in the Bay of Bengal by forging maritime ties with the countries such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh through infrastructural fundings, a senior Indian navy officer said yesterday.
However, there is an amount of scepticism about China's military initiatives in the region, Eastern Naval Command chief, Vice Admiral H.C.S. Bisht said at a programme.
Speaking at a workshop on "India's Maritime Connectivity: Importance of the Bay of Bengal" organised by the Observer Research Foundation, he identified three trends that mark the maritime security situation in the region.
"The first is that US and some other progressive nations like Australia, Singapore and Japan are investing on purpose to make their presence felt in the Bay of Bengal to limit the power and influence of other nations, particularly China, while securing their military axis and engaging with anti-piracy and terrorism operations," said Bisht.
The second trend concerned China
"The second is China trying to enhance its military and maritime ties with countries such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, through infrastructural fundings.
"China is slowly and surely increasing its political, economic and military influence in inevitable competitions with the US and India.
"The Chinese strategy is to develop the dependencies among nations like Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh through their initiatives like the maritime silk route and the recently introduced 'one belt one road; initiative," Bisht said.
"However, there is an amount of skepticism about their military initiatives in the region," he said.
The navy officer said the maritime domain of the Bay of Bengal has achieved renewed significance on several fronts, particularly due to India's Look East policy.
The Indian Navy's capability has been significantly enhanced on the east coast, as the sea line is "strategically important" to the nation in addressing security issues and threats from the rivals.
"There has been a progressive enhancement of the Indian navy's capability on the east coast to increase the military assets on the east coast as well as in the Andaman and Nicobar islands," said Bisht.
"The Bay of Bengal is strategically important for India as it provides considerable leverage against rivals and helps in addressing the security issues that directly threaten Indian interest, including terrorism, piracy, smuggling and insurgency," he explained.
He also claimed that the infrastructural development would help "further increase India's maritime connectivity and achieve economic progress".
Asserting that the opportunities and threats necessitate a coordinated approach to achieve success, Bisht said that cooperation, rather than destructive competition is the need of the hour.
"The maritime domain of the Bay of Bengal offers the potential of being a medium of choice for regional cooperation, regional security and share economic progress for the countries that border it. Cooperation rather than destructive competition is the needed in the Bay of Bengal," he added.

ComBank posts profit of  Rs 6.34 bn before VAT, NBT
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has made a robust start to 2017, reporting profit of Rs 6.34 billion before VAT and NBT, reflecting growth of 17.93% over the first quarter of 2016.
VAT and NBT for the three months reviewed increased by 40.33% to Rs 1.12 billion due to an increase in the VAT rate and the higher profits earned during the period under review.
Consequently, profit before income tax for the quarter grew by lower percentage of 14.03% to Rs 5.22 billion, while profit after tax, at Rs 3.77 billion, increased by 16.73%. Overall, the Bank paid Rs 2.56 billion in taxes for the three months under review, an increase of 19.73% over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, which, coupled with the increased cost of funds this year,resulted in shrinking margins.
Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said, the Banks momentum in mobilising funds and lending has not slowed, even though the dynamics that apply to these areas are changing.
Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam said that although the Banks Current and Savings Account (CASA) base had remained almost at the same levels, the new deposits mobilised cost significantly higher than those mobilised in the corresponding quarter of 2016.
Commercial Banks gross income for the three months reviewed improved by 27.14% to Rs 26.96 billion, with interest income growing by 31.25% to Rs 23.69 billion. With interest expenses up by a massive 51.25% to Rs 15.02 billion, net interest income grew only by 6.76% to Rs 8.66 billion.
Other income remained flat at Rs 2.87 billion despite a 38.45% improvement in fee and commission income, as a result of a drop in exchange income due a significantly lower rate of depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee in the quarter reviewed.The Bank reported total operating income of Rs 11.53 billion, an increase of 5.03%. Its impairment charge for the three months under review amounted to Rs 241.70 million, as against Rs 995.07 million for the first quarter of 2016.
Commercial Banks asset base, which crossed Rs 1 trillion at the end of 2016, grew by a further Rs 37 billion to Rs 1.05 trillion as at March 31, 2017. Total assets increased by Rs 124.24 billion over the preceding 12 months at an average of Rs 10.35 billion per month, reflecting YoY growth of 13.44%.
Deposits grew by Rs 41.25 billion over the three months to Rs 780.82 billion at an average of Rs 13.75 billion per month, higher than the monthly average of Rs 10.65 billion for the preceding 12 months.

Divided SC to hear Geethas appeal in September
A divided three-judge-Supreme Court bench yesterday granted special leave to appeal with a petition filed by Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
They also issued an Interim Order until the final determination of the petition, staying the operation of judgement made by the Court of Appeal which declared that Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold this office.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court fixed the matter for argument on September 25. The bench comprised Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Upali Abeyratne and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for MP Geetha Kumarasinghe informed Court that Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the constitution does not apply to his client as she did not voluntarily apply for Swiss citizenship.
She received Swiss citizenship upon her marriage in 1981. She got married to a Swiss citizen and automatically obtained Swiss citizenship,Silva added.
He further said an order of Quo Warranto cannot be issued on a Member of Parliament but to a public officer.
However, Presidents Counsel J.C.Weliamuna appearing on behalf of two Galle district residents raised a preliminary objection .
. Weliamuna further submitted to Court that at the time of handing over nomination, Geetha Kumarasinghe had given a false statement declaring that she is qualified to be a Member of Parliament.

Flying amid storms
Sri Lankan officials are getting increasingly desperate to find a private-sector partner to share the burden of rehabilitating flag carrier SriLankan Airlines.
The airline, which for a decade was managed and partly owned by Emirates, saw its expenses and debt level soar after the respected Gulf carrier pulled out its team in 2008 amid tensions with then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe kicked off the search for a new partner for SriLankan last year, culminating in the selection of TPG Capital, a U.S. private equity group with a record of guiding airline turnarounds, ahead of seven other bidders.
On May 5, however, SriLankan Chairman Ajith Dias announced to staff that TPG had ended talks to buy a 49% stake after completing its due diligence on the airline and concluding potential returns were less attractive than other investment options.
The airline has been losing money since 2009 and in its annual report for the year ended March 2016, it reported current liabilities of 100.26 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($657.3 million), double its total assets.
According to a preliminary results announcement on May 4, the carrier lost Rs. 6.49 billion in the year ended March 31, excluding finance and one-off charges. The loss was aggravated by the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar because of the airlines heavy dollar-denominated expenses and by flight cancellations necessitated by the daytime closure between January and March of the runway at Colombos international airport for resurfacing work.
Officials told the Nikkei Asian Review that following TPGs retreat, Wickremesinghe appointed Minister of Public Enterprise Development Kabir Hashim, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrema and Minister of Special Assignments Sarath Amunugama to talk to Emirates, Qatar Airways and AirAsia in hopes of convincing one of them to be SriLankans partner.
The move bypasses two bidders that had originally been shortlisted by the government alongside TPG but which lacked its track record in international operations and airline turnarounds. Peace Air, a defunct private local airline that has announced plans to restart operations, had bid with support from Lufthansa Consulting, an arm of the German airline. Trans Maldivian Airways, an air-taxi service operating in the nearby archipelago, had bid with reported backing from Singaporean air services company SATS. Peace Air in March announced plans to file legal challenges to its exclusion from the due diligence process.
Family business
An official inquiry following the change in Sri Lankas government in 2015 found that gross mismanagement and corruption had ruined SriLankans finances. The investigation panel said Nishantha Wickramasinghe, chairman of SriLankan between 2010 and 2015 and a brother-in-law of Rajapaksa, was paid Rs. 500,000 a month despite having no relevant qualifications.
The inquiry said the ex-chairman had received luxury SUVs, in addition to a Mercedes-Benz car and a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Through him, the airline issued more than 700 free tickets for a rugby tournament and nighttime motor racing events in Colombo, pet projects of Rajapaksas sons.
The inquiry called for a criminal investigation into alleged fraud in the award of a duty-free contract in which Rajapaksas cousin Udayanga Weeratunga was allegedly involved. Weeratunga fled the country in 2015 and is the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant. Rajapaksa has denied that his government was beset by widespread corruption.
The coalition government elected in 2015 was compelled to pay $170 million to aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings as penalty for canceling a contract for four Airbus A350 aircraft. Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne told the Nikkei Asian Review that the airline did not require such long-range aircraft since the majority of its flights are shorter range.
Chairman Dias, who was appointed in 2015, said in October that he had inherited quite a mess and that unnecessary aircraft would be returned to lessors to cut operating losses. SriLankan, which has a fleet of 24 aircraft, has suspended loss-making flights to Paris and Frankfurt and is focusing on more lucrative routes in Asia and the Middle East. It is adding three routes into India in the coming months, which will give it the largest number of Indian destinations of any foreign airline.
Emirates bought 40% of the airline, then known as Air Lanka, for $70 million in 1998. It later increased its stake to 43% but eventually sold its shares to the government for $53 million after Rajapaksa ordered the revocation of the visa of Peter Hill, then the airlines chief executive, when he refused to accommodate a political delegation on an international flight. SriLankans workforce, which stood at 5,113 in 2008, had swelled to 6,987 by 2015 because of political appointments.
Political interference
Harsh Vardhan, chairman of Starair Consulting, an aviation consultancy in New Delhi, said SriLankan was a classic example of how political interference and bad management can ruin an organization. SriLankan was a great success story of public-private partnership which became a victim of the politics of ego, he said.
The airlines staff members are increasingly concerned about job security. According to Vijitha Herath, a member of parliament for the Peoples Liberation Front, workers are worried about the possible impact of the airlines privatization. He alleged that the airlines board and senior executives continue to enjoy extravagant perks, including free upgrades from economy to business class.
At a time when SriLankan is suffering from its worst-ever financial crisis, there is no need for such perks to be doled out to the directors and other staff, he said. What the airline needs is good management and strong political leadership to manage the board of directors and the staff, but the biggest problem is that there is no strong political leadership.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told the Nikkei Asian Review in early April that the government had no plans to fully privatize the carrier. What we are looking at is the commercialization of the airline, which will be based on a partnership or a joint venture, he said.
Whether the government can find any partner both willing and able to work with its criteria and bear the risk of further political intervention remains an open question.

Former athletics chief and coach passes away
Dervin Perera, former president of the Athletic Association of Sri Lanka and veteran coach passed away yesterday at a private hospital in Colombo aged 67.
Perera, one of the most successful athletic coaches produced by Sri Lanka was elected uncontested as AASL president in 2005.
Among his distinguished achievements as coach was guiding Susanthika Jayasinghe to win Sri Lankas first and only IAAF World Championship medal (a silver in womens 200m) in Athens in 1997 and Sriyani Kulawansa to win the womens 100m hurdles silver medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Perera is the only Sri Lankan coach to train and produce medallists at South Asian Games, Asian Games, World Championship, Commonwealth and Olympic Games level - a feat will be hard to beat. He held the post of Sri Lanka national coach for seven years with distinction.
As an athlete of distinction among Pereras personal achievements was winning a bronze medal at the Indo-Sri Lanka athletic meet in 1968, a silver medal in the 4 X 400m relay also at the Indo-Sri Lanka meet in 1968, a bronze medal in the 400m at the Asian championships in Korea 1975 and being national champion in the 400m in 1975. Pereras belief as a coach is that too much control is bad to the athletes. Athletics revolves around the natural flair of the athlete, who is working around the very basics, of the event. If we, as coaches, take it more seriously than that, we shouldnt be coaches, he once opined. - ST

## Title: Gender takes splendour of sex away from grammar!

Gender takes splendour of sex away from grammar!
Woo-hoo hoo, grammar has sex! I mean a sex. You know, more than one sex. Meaning the sexes. Few traces of gender remain in modern English. Are we surprised No sex please, were Sri Lankan. Well, but we are talking English here. Im not British, but I am speaking their language. And just to show off I am exaggerating their awesome, plummy accent.
I am sure you must have noticed an interesting trend. Many writers, conscious of sexist language, are now using ridiculously invented gender-neutral pronouns. Hir is now used in place of his/her, and zie is now used in place of he/she. This is intended to show sensitivity for people who are transgendered as well as people of either gender.
Clearly, there have to be gender-neutral or socially conscious insults available to use when dealing with the jack-assery of day-to-day living. Other than pronouns he/she, his/hers, much of the genderization on the English language is being wiped out in the name of political correctness. Journalists call it a conspiracy by liberation grammarians Benders of Gender.
Sexism is a political issue today. It affects the language we choose to use. Many people speaking or writing English today wish to avoid using language which supports unfair or untrue attitudes to a particular sex, usually women. Speakers of English are slowly adjusting to the pressures for a more neutral language. Fortunately, this change is being accompanied by a measure of humour, which, fortunately, is common to both sexes!
Questions and criticisms of sexist language have emerged because of a concern that language is a powerful medium through which the world is both reflected and constructed. Some have claimed that the use of generics - such as the word 'mankind' to refer to both men and women - reinforces a binary that sees the male and masculine as the norm and the female and feminine as the 'non-norm.'
The women libbers, sorry I mean the feminists or liberationists, insist that certain language can help to reinforce the idea of male superiority and female inferiority. What is now termed sexist language often suggests an inherent male dominance and superiority in many fields of life. Male pronouns, he, his and him are used automatically even though the sex of the person is not known. "A student may wish to ask his tutor about his course". Or we say: "Who's manning the office today"
Do you know all actresses are now actors. When grouping the sexes I refer to the whole shebang as thespian. A stewardess is a flight attendant. An heiress is, well, damn lucky. In the old days everyone referred to postmasters and toastmasters. Just imagine introducing Aunty Fifi to the wedding guests as the toastmistress.
Now I ask, is a woman cricketer going in to wield the willow a batswoman, a batter or a batterer Also will the name of the fielding position Third Man have to be changed because of feminist pressure
Little kids still drop a few sex bombs  fireman, policeman and cowgirl. Theyll grow up and homogenize their language choices soon enough. Firefighter seems a pretty effective alternative. So would Police Officer. But cowgirl would have to find a more suitable term than cowpoke. Imagine a crowd cheering a woman bronco rider yelling in unison: Ride em cowpoke!
How far will the de-sexification of the English language go What will we fall into when we cross the road if not an open manhole Will schools stop breaking the year down into semesters Switch to ovesters Or just esters There could be three per year and theyd have trimesters. Apt, since getting through high school can be as painful as childbirth.
And someone will have to tell the world that certain Sri Lankan colloquialisms are ideally non-sexist such as oyar (you) and meya (this person). And for heavens sake and for your own health never refer to a woman as araki or meyki.
No you dont say mankind anymore so its humanity. Or man-made which is manufactured and manpower which is workforce or personnel. There are also work-hours and no-man hours. And we have no founding fathers, only pioneers and forbears.
While the English language is as devoid of sex as a Vestal Virgins life, French and Spanish are rife with it. The French distinguish between feminine and masculine words with la and le and the Spanish el and la among others. As the French say, there are three sexes  men, women and clergymen.
Particular word endings also determine gender, and many languages add a third non-male, non-female gender called neuter. But all of this is far beyond my knowledge.
Sexist language also presents stereotypes of both females and males, sometimes to the disadvantage of males, but more often to the disadvantage of females. This sexism is seen universally in all languages. All right, take the example of master vs mistress to make the point. There are unequal connotations that surround these two matching terms, and to the detriment of those born female. Master has strong and powerful connotations, while mistress decidedly does not.
For example, when you switch gender while describing Headmaster, you must concede that calling a top honcho schoolmarm a Headmistress, might very well be likening her to the chief concubine of Sheikh Ali Labjar. Headmistress! Ha, ha! Come to think it, for those with dirty mindsets it does have some suggestively slang sexual undertone about it as well.
Maybe the English language has less sex  or maybe it has an elevated view. It has neutered the masculine, eliminated the feminine. Were inching closer to gender subjugation-free language. To illustrate the point there is the story of a local women's lib speaker who while addressing a large group said: "Where would man be today if it were not for woman" From the back of the hall came a male voice: "He'd be in the Garden of Eden, eating rambuttan."
The libber shot back: When God made man, SHE was having one of her off days. See Who needs sex

The Girl on the Swing..!
She walked just ahead of me in the park. I guessed she must have been around fifteen or sixteen years of age, and then she ran to a swing which was empty, sat on it happily and pushed herself to move upward, and in her eyes I could see the desire of wanting to enjoy what children much younger than her enjoyed.
She looked at me and smiled and as I saw the sheer delight in her eyes, as I saw momentum lifting her up, and the freedom she was enjoying I smiled back at her!
As the swing swept up and then took an arc downwards I could see she was enjoying every moment and suddenly I realized she was a little child in an adult body. Soon she would have to give up such girly pleasures, soon it would not be the simple swing that would swing her up and down, but life itself, as the duties of being a wife or mother would make every day become a roller coaster ride, swinging her up and down with joys and sorrows!
And then my mind went to other girls such as her, who go out to party, to enjoy life a little. All they want to do is to enjoy themselves a bit, maybe with friends and relatives, but then in the supposedly safe roads of our city or country, lecherous men with lusty hands, stretch out, grope and molest these innocents.
I glanced back at the girl on the swing, how safe was she in India
How safe are our women in the country
Would someone look at her and say, Why is she on a swing, that means she is a forward woman!
That means she is available to us!
It means she wants to have fun, let us give her some fun!
Yes you rascals who touch and molest women because you think they want to have fun, they do want to have fun, but not the fun you think is fun: They want to enjoy life, go for a party with others they are comfortable with, dress up the way they feel like dressing, not for you, but for themselves.
And then I saw the men. They were standing round the girl on the swing. They were staring at her. They did not see a child, they saw a woman. They did not see her joy, they only felt their lust.
I saw her smile vanish. I saw her hastily stop the swing and before it completely came to rest, she got off and ran away.
I felt sad. In one moment, the girl on the swing, had realized she was little girl no more, but a mere body to be enjoyed by the men of our country!
The swing swung empty, showing the emptiness of we people who cannot protect our women..!

Beyond everything else, I have become more confident about myself because I never thought I will ever be a Mrs. Sri Lanka. I just went to give my best and when I got it, I realized miracles do happen. Earning this title is being in the spotlight in the country. So it gave me a lot of confidence, faith and also hope to do a lot more in my life, Chandi said.
Chandi has been actively involved in projects that are carried out to protect and support children who may be at risk for being subjected to physical, emotional and sexual abuse or the young survivors who have endured more than we can imagine. She considers assisting children who are at risk of or are victims of abuse, children who are in alternative care, street children, and families at risk as a responsibility of one and all.
Redirecting them for proper education by enlightening the importance of education, supporting the children from the poor income families by giving educational scholarships at least till they finish the ordinary level education is important. I am glad to say that there are doctors who are voluntarily working with me in medical camps that we carry out for children in homes, children from families that live in rural areas with poor income, street kids, and young mothers, she explained.
The most important fact in all these projects is to let these children know that they are valuable and cared for. They need to realize that there is an ear for the little voices crying out silently, she added.
Chandi carries out a separate project to uplift the young mothers to establish skills for small industries.
Her recent work involves empowering abused women, women from poor income families and single mothers. This is a step away from her projects which mostly focus on children. She says that she finds it as a blessing when these women reached out to her for help. My main aim is to connect and unite women where they will no longer suffer alone. The next most important fact is educating people on the importance of the bond between the parents which leads to safeguard the family unit, she explained.
Chandi notes that Sri Lankan women have nowhere to gather with other women and talk about issues like gender equity, womens rights, or health. She has taken steps to create READ Centers which provides a safe, trusted space for women to gather and learn. They already have a couple of donors who have lent them required buildings to create READ centers.
We will educate women who havent had proper education, teach them job skills, and build up self-esteem. This is not something that can be implemented within hours or days. This takes time and support from the community and, of course, the government as well.It is my mission to spearhead this effort using all the support I can get locally and internationally from various organizations I am connected with, Chandi explained.
In the recent past she had the opportunity to sign a memorandum with Thailand to get support to implement small industries.
At the moment we are in the process of carrying out workshops to find out the most suitable small industries which we can extent the technological support. It is important to help single mothers with less education to improve their skills to own small home based business, she said.
With so many social care related projects in her kitty Chandi says that it is one person, her grandfather, who inspired her to change her life in a significant way.
He made me into a person who is driven to lend a hand whenever I see the need. When it comes to Mrs. International its all about strong women passionate about their chosen platforms. They have been involved in social services and charity work way before they are chosen as queens and with or without the crown they continue what they have started, Chandi mused.
Recalling one significant moment which is engraved in her mind during her social service work Chandi says, I work with this little boy who is neglected and gone through violence at home. He is only about five years old. Although he can speak he had stopped communicating completely. Recently he started communicating with me through his paintings. You simply have to hold your tears and read the frustration and pain he cries out silently through his work. To witness what these small children go through really makes me wonder what we, as adults, really do to save them, she said.

Dr. De Zoysa pointed out the government should not delay in announcing its stance to the Supreme Court, as an islandwide strike has been planned by several trade unions over the SAITM issue.
He said the Governments April 7 Proposals had acknowledged the facts that SAITM training is not sufficient for its students, the Neville Fernando Hospital does not meet the required standards to train medical students, the MBBS degree offered by SAITM cannot be accepted under prevailing conditions.The SLMC plays the key role in regulating the standard of medical education, he added.

Habitat for Humanity, SLSA conducts Scout Build
Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka (HFHSL) in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Scouts Association (SLSA) conducted its inaugural Scout Build, in an initiative to foster volunteerism and empower Scouts to become young leaders in Sri Lanka.
More than 200 local Boy and Girl Scouts participated in the Scout Build, in the Village of Kalugala, Aranayake. The Scout Build was held as part of the Asia-Pacific Regional Campaign known as Habitat Young Leaders Build that engages young people to volunteer, fundraise and lend their voices to the need for decent housing.
The Scout Build is an extension of the global partnership between Habitat for Humanity International and the World Scout Movement. A Memorandum of Understanding between HFHSL and SLSA was ceremoniously signed by Dr. Dinesh Kanagaratnam, National Director of HFHSL and Janaprith Fernando, Attorney-at-Law and Deputy Chief Commissioner of SLSA, in celebration of World Scout Day and founder, Lord Baden Powells 160th Birth Anniversary globally celebrated on February 22.
This volunteer build initiative in partnership with SLSA enabled volunteers to contribute their time and unskilled labour towards the construction of nearly 40 houses currently being constructed in Aranayake for victims of landslides - part of HFHSLs Kegalle Housing Project. (A Disaster Response project aimed at building more than 80 houses for victims of landslides caused by Cyclone Roanu last May in Aranayake, Yatiyatota and Deraniyagala in the Kegalle District).
Habitat for Humanity Sri Lankas National Director, Dr. Dinesh Kanagaratnam said, The Scouts Build is one of the many initiatives we will roll out this year that will help develop and build leadership amongst the youth in Sri Lanka. Scouting Associations across Asia are seeking stronger links with Habitat for Humanity under the Messengers of Peace vision.
Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka hopes to take this partnership with the World Scout Movement further by exploring the possibility of hosting an International Scout Build in 2018/2019 where international Scout volunteer teams will also be invited to volunteer in Sri Lanka.

The allowance paid to lecturers teaching at the Nurses Training Schools (NTC) will be increased by Rs. 10,000, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo recently to mark the International Nurses Day, he said that the relevant circular to pay Rs. 10,000 was issued by the Finance Minister on May 13. The over-time payments of health employees will be paid with effect from January 1, 2016.
According to Minister Senaratne, the salaries of public sector employees had been increased by Rs. 10,000. At least another 10,000 more nurses are required for the service. But, adequate number of nurses are not being produced. The four year nurses training programme has been reduced to three years due to various pressures and this is very unfair, he said.
Currently, lecturers of NTCs receive only Rs. 10,000. There are about 168 lecturers in NTCs at present. The minister said the nursing profession will be made an eminent profession within the next two years.

Jinasena launches solar irrigation systems for local agriculture
Jinasena Limited, a leading water management systems and solutions providers in Sri Lanka, has launched a solar irrigation system to provide a timely boost to the countrys agriculture sector.
The Jinasena solar irrigation system comprises a Jinasena water pump, solar panels and an inverter. It can be utilised for any type of plantation and has been engineered in a way that provides a higher performance level than other similar solutions in the market.
While a normal solar irrigation system in the market generates electricity for a total of four-five hours of pumping per day, the Jinasena solution generates sufficient electricity to provide upto 10 hours of pumping per day, at peak operational efficiency. Such efficiency levels also means that this system can be deployed in the up-country parts of the island where sunlight can be limited due to varying weather conditions.
The Jinasena solar irrigation systems are highly-customisable, very simple to install and has the added advantage of being portable.
The company provides a 10-year warranty for the inverters used in the solution while providing a 20-year product warranty and a 30-year performance warranty for the solar panels. In addition, Jinasena offers a 10-year warranty to each and every solar irrigation system.
The pilot project to irrigate farms and paddy fields in the Kalpitiya area was commissioned by Provincial Minister of Agriculture Sumal Tissera and has received very positive feedback. Additional pilot projects are to be setup in Trincomalee, Kataragama and Nuwara Eliya for farmers to familiarize themselves with this innovative method of pumping water to their farms.
In addition to agriculture, the system can be utilised for domestic purposes by adding an overhead tank as well as for industrial use in factories and warehouses.
Speaking about Jinasena solar irrigation systems, Jayan Shirantha Mendis  Senior Engineer (Energy Sector) stated, Jinasena solar irrigation systems bring together two of our products where we well versed in  water pumps and solar solutions.
In order to make these systems more accessible to a wider market, we also offer credit cardholders of certain banks the opportunity to purchase the systems on instalment basis with 0% interest, he added.
Jinasena solar irrigation systems are available through its network of 19 Service Centres located at Colombo, Bandarawela, Buttala, Girandurukotte, Beruwala, Ekala, Avissawella, Dambulla, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle, Kaduruwela, Tambuttegama, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Ampara, Embilipitiya and Jaffna. All products come with a warranty and a highly-reliable after sales service and ample spare parts.

JKOA inks deal with SAP Hybris customer support module
A leader in office automation and a fully-owned subsidiary of John Keells Holdings, John Keells Office Automation (JKOA) recently penned an agreement with SAP Hybris to integrate an innovative product in to their customer service spectrum targeted at enhancing customer experience.
The SAP Hybris Customer Support Module which will be launched shortly has been recognized globally for its functionality, user-friendliness and reporting mechanisms.
The modern technologically advanced customer is constantly on the lookout for products and services that are value for money and allows them more control over areas such as after-sales service. With the introduction of the new customer portal JKOA will open up its customer support operations to the end user who then has the ability to engage real time with the service they require and the response from the seller. To make this possible the system will include an automated breakdown assignment option, on-field estimates, repair tracking systems and social media integration.
The comprehensive self-service system improves customer satisfaction and reduces support cost by giving the customer the right tools to manage their requests, whilst allowing customers to check the status of repair, other information enabling visibility and thereby removing the dependency on a call centre. It also enables the service provider to extend services from anywhere and bringing them closer to the customer. The system tracks availability of field engineers based on territory and assigns the closest to the customer site thereby reducing travel time.In a fast-paced world this is an optimum requirement which will enable field engineers to repair and close the job onsite further reducing down time for customers.Automated billing makes sure that the job is completed in record time.
Speaking on the introduction of the new system Janoda Thoradeniya, CEO JKOA noted, For years JKOA has been recognized for superior products and quality after-sales service. The introduction of the SAP Hybris system will further enhance our offering in terms of real-time customer issue management, accessibility and connectivity between the buyer and seller.
The system is also integrated with advanced software such as PaperCut for solutions and preventive maintenance hence leading to the lowest down time on machines. Estimate creation through the app on site and immediate access to inventory real time, immediate approval by customer and immediate repair through car stocks makes after sales service a less cumbersome task.
The vision of the project is to revolutionize the after sales service landscape in the island by introducing a state-of-the-art customer support module which will deliver globally renowned service levels to JKOAs customers.

Memories of the august assembly
From the impressionable age of thirteen when I was in the 7th form of St. Josephs College I have been able to observe elections to the House of Representatives or Parliament and the Governments that came into existence in independent Ceylon/Sri Lanka.
After the Senanayake/Kotalawala Administrations of the late forties and the early fifties the real break from the lingering vestiges of British Colonial practices came in 1956.
I was then a final year student at Peradeniya. Soloman Bandaranaike the erudite Oxonian who had shed his Western attire, language and even the religion of his birth came to power on an avalanche of votes that came in the wake of the promise of Sinhala Only in twenty four hours.
Nationalization of private enterprises
When the election results were being announced we at Marrs Hall, all friends Kanthi Kamalgoda, Nehru Goonatilleke Sivalingam, Potta Pathmanathan, Bandu de Silva, Donald Abeysinghe and self and others carried our dear mate the late Dingi Karunatilleke to Caroliss tuck shop. Dingi had to bear the cost of tea and cigarettes for all. Dingis elder brother Nimal Karunatilleke had won the Matale Seat. This was the first result to be announced and this was the result that heralded the victory of SWRD. All the winning names that were being announced were new to us. No murderers or rogues had won. Nor were there such even among losers.
With Bandaranaike at the helm, the country witnessed the beginnings of ethno-religious communalism on the political front and the nationalization of private enterprises on the economic front.
With a comfortable majority that owed allegiance to the Pancha Maha Bala Vegaya the drastic changes that came into effect in the fields of education, administration, justice and policing creating innumerable points of friction between the two main ethnic groups of the country was a legacy of dark clouds with no silver linings, that were to engulf this country with frightful lightning and thunder for decades to come.
Coaxed by extremists on both sides of the communal divide the country saw racial conflicts of a brutal nature perpetrated particularly by the majority Sinhalese in 1956, 1958, 1977 (Trincomalee) and 1983. These gory events that blackened the nations history eventually culminated in the conflict that lasted nearly three decades.
Need for reconciliation
Vultures local and foreign began to see the hidden gold amidst the cruelty of the war. The civilian population of the war zones became voiceless, tragic victims of soldiers of fortune of the warring factions.
The plight of generations to come caused no worry to politicians and procurement officials of military hardware salivating at the prospect of lucrative commissions. The nations leadership crisis was indeed becoming graver and dangerous. Death squads haunting the media personnel succeeded in keeping the people in the dark and in fear.
The immediate need for reconciliation and the commencement of a meaningful dialog towards a lasting solution was submerged in the euphoria of victory. With extremists and fanatics more on the side of the majority community holding firmly to their age old views; and sub-human pseudo leaders foraging for power on racism, communalism and even religion, the prospects of a negotiated settlement keep on receding; We are back at square one. The heroes of the war have won only a pyrrhic victory!
Peoples dilemma
The present regime indeed raised the hopes of the people. But these hopes were dashed when it failed to round up the robbers of the nation.
To make matters worse rogues within have brought shame on the regime. For whom to vote at the next election has become the peoples dilemma. Robbery by the cultured or the uncultured; or robbery crudely executed or with finesse is robbery alright. The time has to come sooner or later, as it happened in the French and Russian revolutions when the people will not guillotine but hang all the rogues, green, blue or red. The real Galle Face hangings are bound to draw bigger crowds to Colombo than on May Day 2017.
Reasonable people are even beginning to surmise whether some of their professed leaders are losing their reason. If not how could one explain how a Sri Lankan politician by threatening to hoist black flags could despise and even humiliate the leader of the worlds largest democracy that gave us the Sinhala race and Buddhism. Sri Lankas march of folly keeps on gathering momentum by the day.
Quem deus perdere vult prius dementat. The Sanskrit equivalent to this Latin saying is, Vinash kale viparith buddhi. Those whom the gods want to destroy, first make them mad. The process appears to have started in this blessed land.

MR shows the way
The decision by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the latter's visit to Sri Lanka is to be commended. It was indeed a bold decision given the anti-Indian rhetoric that was been bellowed by the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila in the run up to the visit. At the Pohottuwa party's May Day rally at Galle Face, Weerawansa called for the hoisting of black flags during Modi's visit while Gammanpila, subsequently at a media briefing, justified his colleague's call. No black flags though were seen anywhere in the country during the visit reminiscent of an earlier call too by the duo urging the public to hoist black flags during Independence Day celebrations.
It is ironic indeed for Weerawansa to call for the hoisting of black flags during the visit of a leader of the country which gave the world Buddhism, embraced by seventy five percent of Sri Lanka's population, not least by the NFF leader, who apparently is a devout adherent. Fears were stoked by the Joint Opposition that the Indian Premier was set to sign trade agreements with the government in the guise of visiting the country to participate in International Vesak Day celebrations. Like all its recent predictions and forecasts, this too was proved unfounded. There were no objections though when the Chinese leader arrived in the country to sign the Port City agreement that entailed an exclusive flying zone for China in the land reclaimed from the sea.
Be that as it may, Rajapaksa had delivered a resounding slap to the Weerawansa-Gammanpila duo by his meeting with the Indian Premier when the call was to hoist black flags during the visit. It certainly had hit them where they live. Many of the JO stalwarts were seeing backtracking on their anti-Indian rhetoric after the meeting. They who claimed that MOUs were to be signed on ETCA and other trade pacts changed tune to state that the agreements were indeed signed during Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's recent visit to India. Even the Ven. Elle Gunawansa, known for his virulent anti-Indian sentiments, was forced to acknowledge that he was not against the Prime Minister Modi's visit, after the Rajapaksa-Modi tete a tete. According to the Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the discussion was very cordial and Rajapaksa had reportedly thanked the Indian Prime Minister for the development assistance granted to Sri Lanka. Besides, India also extended its not inconsiderable assistance towards the defeat of the LTTE by way of weaponry and sophisticated radar equipment.
The former President, no doubt, is well aware of the importance of cultivating good relations with our giant neighbour, whatever he or his backers may say to the contrary. In fact, during his Presidency, Rajapaksa strove to build friendship with India in a big way and in fact nominated his brother Basil as a special emissary in shuttle diplomacy to the exclusion of External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris. In fact, Rajapaksa was a member of United Front Government led by Sirima Bandaranaike which built special relations with India that extended even to a personal level between the Gandhi and Bandaranaike families. Given this legacy there can be no doubt that Mahinda Rajapaksa is keen to continue this special relationship with India, even though he is out of power, notwithstanding the anti Indian rhetoric spewed by members of the Joint Opposition such as Wimal Weerawansa on whom the nuances of foreign relations are lost in the small world they inhabit.
It is hoped that at least now the members of the Joint Opposition would shed this India phobia and come down to reality in this modern age and new world order where international borders are getting increasingly blurred. Their leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has shown the way. Antagonizing India can only be to the detriment of this country. We can no longer be xenophobic and be cut off from the larger word. Whipping up anti-Indian hysteria for political reasons is well and good, but this should not be taken too far to the extent where it will impact on the country's economy and importantly on the good relations that have been cultivated with India by successive governments.
There is a current tendency to portray India as acting inimical to the interests of the country and its economy through agreements foisted on Sri Lanka. Members of the GMOA too are making common cause with the likes Weerawansa and Gammanpila in India bashing, creating goni billas to turn public opinion against India. Any Indian involvement in Sri Lanka is viewed with a jaundiced eye by these elements without giving thought to the economic and other gains to Sri Lanka derived therefrom.
We should get rid of this siege mentality which perhaps is a carryover from suspicion grounded in history. Hopefully, Rajapaksa's meeting with the Indian Premier, in the wake of the hostile attitude towards India by some of his close confidants, will change public perception hitherto harboured against our giant neighbour.

Music is the best medicine
A man with a heart of gold and a voice of gold, Keerthi Pasquel is ready to storm the stage of Colombo this Saturday at the BMICH marking 40 years in the music business. It is called Evolution of Music with Keerthi Pasquel. This concert will be an event not to be missed by Pasquels followers and music lovers. Daily News speaks to Keerthi Pasquel about life in music.
My brother was a musician, however my parents did not allow me to play the guitar fearing that it would get in the way of my education. So they did not encourage me to take up music. But they were unaware that I used their absence and the absence of my brother to play the guitar. My cousin brother was my first teacher, teaching me how to play the guitar. After that I formed a calypso group with my cousin brothers. This was very early on in my life. We sang group songs that were popularized in the 1960s, said Pasquel.
Pasquel and his band members really enjoyed the music of that era.
At that time we did not have a bass guitarist for the band and we had a booking to play at a wedding. And the day before the wedding we still did not have a bass guitarist. Since we were simply unable to find a bass guitarist, drastic situations normally call for drastic actions and the next day early in the morning I visited a musical institute and learnt how to play the bass guitar the day of the wedding from 6.00am to 10.00am. The sound manager of that institute told me that he had an idea to form a band led by Stanley Peiris and whether I would like to play in the band. So I said yes, stated Pasquel.
This was in 1976 and the band consisted of Rukantha Gunathilake and Mahinda Bandara.
So practice started with these musicians. So we practiced every day for four to six hours in a practice session that went on for more than six months. So we formed a band called Galaxies in Kandy, which was my home town. For around four years I played with this band and we became popular in the Kandy area. In 1978 I got the chance to come to Colombo with Stanley Peiris and to participate in some recordings. During recordings I met many professional musicians. It was then that Patrick Denipitiya invited me to sing in his band which was in 1980.
In 1982  1985, I had the chance to sing and play the guitar in the chorus of Nanda Malinis Sathyaye Geethaya. I sang with her in 530 shows. In 1983 we had a reunion of Fortunes Band. By now I was making a name for myself as a bass guitarist. During that time I was able to record my originals, explained Pasquel.
In 1983 the Fortunes band did a series of appearances doing music tracks on famous singers on a musical program on ITN.
I was able to perform my song Nil Ahase on ITN. It was telecasted in 1984. After that I was much in demand. In 1985 I released my first cassette  Nil Ahase. In 1985 I went with Nanda Malini on a foreign tour. In addition to all of this I acted in four Tele-dramas as a main character. These Tele-Dramas opened up many avenues for me. From 1985 I consistently did many new songs. In 1988 I started a one man show  Keerthi Gee. That became popularized around the country. In 1996 I received an award from the World Science Council. In 2000 my life changed. I left Sri Lanka for New Zealand. I was in New Zealand for four years. I came back in 2004 and recommenced my career in Sri Lanka, pointed out Pasquel.
After coming back from New Zealand Pasquel started to rise in popularity.
I gained in popularity in a way that was not there before leaving for New Zealand. I received a lot of support from the media I must say. Now I am into a lot of social service. I have two music schools where I impart my knowledge to students. I have appeared continuously in Derana Dream Star as a judge. In addition to all of this I have rendered my services to orphanages and elders homes, informed Pasquel.
For one and a half years he has been the President of the Singers association.
Through that I have rendered a lot of services to singers. Last month we got 25 million from the government for our association to give a pension scheme for the elderly artistes, more than 65 years. So I want to assist our artistes and society and the children who are the future of our country. I am always doing new songs. With this show of mine I want to assist those in areas like Anuradhapura who have kidney problems. The biggest problem they face is, after dialysis, they have no place to stay. They are faced with the prospect of resting on benches and in parks and under trees. I want to create a proper area where they can rest with all the facilities. So this is what I want to do. So I am intent on helping these people with Kidney problems. So the funds I get through this show, I want to use it to help people, elucidated Pasquel.
The concert is called Evolution of Music with Keerthi Pasquel. The reason is that Keerthi wishes to show, how his music has evolved over the years.
Over 40 years my music has evolved. First I started with Calypso and then it evolved to when I played 70s music. The 80s music I played with Fortunes are a bit advanced. So I wish to show that with the changing times I have adapted to the various styles and developed my music.
I have also included a retinue of artistes in my show  Annesley Malewana, Erol Fernando, Dhammika Bandara, Samitha Mudunkotuwa, Nirosha Virajini, Nelu Adikari, Mariazelle Goonetilleke, Kasun Pasquel, Charuni Pasquel and Chethana Ranasinghe.
My children are my legacy and they will take what I have done into the future. So I have given them this opportunity to perform alongside me with these other stars, explained Pasquel.
The music is directed by veteran musicians Sarath De Alwis, Mahesh Denipitiya and Nalaka Sajee Jayasinghe.
My mother wanted me to become a doctor. But my heart and mind was into music. Music has the power to speak to your soul. Music is a wide subject. Music soothes the mind and gives it rest. In art, music is the extreme point.
I have an abundance of patience and I am slow to anger.
I have good mental and physical health. All this is important for a musician. I can speak to a persons heart through his or her emotions. When it comes to medicine I feel that 40 percent can be healed through music. Tension and stress are both relieved through music, shared Pasquel.
Pasquel says his style is a Western and Oriental mix pop type of music. I follow many styles of many singers. My originals are a mix of all of this. Pop and oriental styles are a part of my style.
My songs are love songs, emotional songs and even Baila. My melodies are inspired mainly from my music knowledge. I have strong will power. If I have a target I achieve it and I do the best. I dont look behind, I look forward. I do what I can do and I do this to the best.
My message to any young guy or girl who wants to enter the music field is practice hard. Be a creative musician. Learn the subject well, summed up Pasquel.

Nadal edges out Thiem for fifth Madrid Masters
Madrid, SUNDAY: Rafael Nadals flawless record on clay this season continued as he outgunned the impressive Dominic Thiem to win the Madrid Masters for a fifth time 7-6 (10/8), 6-4 on Sunday.
The Spaniard is now 15-0 on his favoured surface this year having also picked up his 10th titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona in recent weeks.
And the 14-time Grand Slam champion is now strong favourite to add a 10th French Open crown next month as he romped to victory on home soil for the loss of just one set all week.
Victory also moves Nadal above Roger Federer to fourth in the world rankings.
I am aware that if I am fit and I can play well, I have the capacity to win important titles and achieve my goals, said Nadal.
Thiem also fell victim to Nadals supreme form in the final in Barcelona two weeks ago, but there was little for the 23-year-old to be dispirited about as he pushed Nadal all the way in his first Masters series final.
Sometimes against the best players in the world, the best ever player on this surface, you even lose when you play well, said Thiem, who also rises to a career high seventh in the rankings.
Now that I did it once, playing really well in such a big tournament, the next step is to maintain this level next week.
Nadal disposed of Novak Djokovic for his first win over the Serb for three years on Saturday and victory saw him level Djokovics record of 30 Masters Series titles.
Thiem didnt finish his semi-final against Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas until after midnight on Sunday morning.
However, that lack of recovery time didnt show as Thiem struck the first blow by breaking the Nadal serve to move into a 3-1 first set lead.
Thiem handed the break back by netting a simple volley for 3-3, but showed admirable resistence to battle back from 0-40 when serving to stay in the set a 4-5 to force a tie-break.
Both had their chances in the tie-break as Thiem again fought back from 3-5 down to have two set points of his own only to be denied by two punishing Nadal forehands.
And eventually it was Nadal who prevailed with his fifth set point when Thiem fired long.
Anything could have happened at the end of the first set, added Nadal.
I think I played well in the important points at the end of the first set. I saved a few set points playing some good shots with my forehand and after that I went for it.
The marathon first set lasted a minute under an hour-and-a-half and seemed to drain Thiems belief as well as his energy resources as he was broken to start the second set.
Nadal had to stave off a break point on his own serve to consolidate the break for 2-0.
Four games without a point against the serve followed as Nadal closed in on victory. AFP

NCPC Governor rejects affidavits
North Central Province Council Governor P.B.Dissanayaka yesterday rejected 17 affidavits submitted by a group of United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members that sought the removal of North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne from his portfolio.
Further, they called Governor Dissanayaka to appoint the provinces former Chief Minister S.M.Ranjith Samarakoon to that post because they have neither confidence nor trust in Peshala Jayaratne.
They charged Peshala Jayaratne stating that he had expelled an NCP Minister,namely K.H.Nandasena, arbitrarily from his post.
S.M Ranjith resigned from the position held by him as the North Central Province Chief Minister consequent to the removal of Minister Nandasena.
Governor Dissanayaka is said to have rejected the affidavits submitted by the group of UPFA members saying that they do not comply with the 13th Amendment of the Constitution.

We deployed a relatively large transaction team to work on different aspects of the IPO including familiarising ourselves with the regulatory regime, carrying out business due diligence and valuations, and devising a placement strategy considering the needs of the company and the nascent stage of the capital market.
Ooredoo Maldives has taken a keen interest to broad base the ownership of the company with local roadshows covering all densely populated areas in the archipelago.

New Presidents Counsels
President Maithripala Sirisena recently appointed 25 eminent lawyers as Presidents Counsel and on May 25 they will take oath of office at a ceremonial sitting of the Supreme Court. Thereafter, the appointees would be considered as Presidents Counsel and are called to the Inner Bar.
Presidents Counsel is a professional rank and status conferred to the appointee by the President under Article 33 of the Constitution. Attorneys chosen to hold the honorary title are those who have practised as counsel in original and appellate courts for many years either in the official or unofficial bar.
The Daily News will in the next few days offer a brief look into the achievements of the recent appointees. We start with Attorneys M.A. Sumanthiran, Saliya Peiris and Upul Jayasuriya.
Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran
Mathiaparanan Abraham Sumanthiran is a lawyer, politician and Member of Parliament. He studied at Royal College Colombo and has a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the University of Madras. He then proceeded to Sri Lanka Law College, qualifying as an advocate.
He started practising law in Colombo, appearing in civil litigation cases in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, Commercial High Court and the District Courts. Sumanthirans successful cases include the privatization of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, privatization of Lanka Marine Services and the closure of Pramuka Bank.

Upul Jayasuriya
Upul Jayasuriya joined the Bar in 1976 and later joined the Attorney Generals Department as a State Counsel in 1978. In 1978 he was appointed as the first ever Legal Advisor to the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, (presently known as the Board of Investments of Sri Lanka - the premier Institution promoting and facilitating FDIs in to Sri Lanka of which he currently holds the position of Chairman) while serving the Attorney Generals Department as a State Counsel.
He was appointed Chairman of Sri Lanka State Trading Tractor Corporation in 1982. In 1983 he was awarded the Top Young Outstanding Professional Award under the Entrepreneurship category for converting the said corporation to a profit-making venture. Thereafter, he took over reigns of Ceylon Oils & Fats Corporation.
Jayasuriya was elected as the Secretary to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) for the period 1991  1993. During this period he initiated the filing of nearly 3,000 fundamental rights applications through the support of the BASL before the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on behalf of those taken into custody in the 1989 insurrection. It paved the way for the release of a large number of detainees and expedited the instituting of legal proceedings against scores of others who were languishing in detention without valid charges.
He was appointed Managing Director/CEO of Ceylon Chocolates Ltd in 1997 and converted the same to a substantial profit centre. He was also elected President of the Colombo Law Society in 2008.
Jayasuriya was also responsible, together with late Desmond Fernando (Former President of the International Bar Association), in obtaining the support of the IBA delegation to probe the conduct of the Former Chief Justice Sarath Silva. He was elected the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka in March 2013 with the highest ever majority in the history of the Association.
This was at one of the most critical times for the legal profession and independence of Judiciary in Sri Lanka with the illegal removal of Dr Shiranee Bandaranayake as the Chief Justice of the Country.
He defied the age old tradition of inviting the Country's 'sitting' Chief Justice ('the successor to Dr. Shiranee') for his official induction as the President of the BASL. Instead he invited Dr. Shiranee Bandaranayake whom he considered to have been prevented from discharging her duties as the Chief Justice. He gave the much-needed leadership to the Bar during this crucial period. After the new government was formed on January 8, 2015, he fought hard to bring back Dr. Shiranee Bandaranayake.
Jayasuriya was also presented with the 2015-Rule of Law Award of the Commonwealth Lawyers Association in Glasgow with a cash donation of US$ 5,000. He presented the said cash donation to the wife of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda, who was murdered by the previous regime.
Jayasuriya has also spearheaded the highly successful Golden Jubilee Law Asia Conference that was held in Colombo - Sri Lanka in August 2016 with the participation of nearly 400 foreign lawyers, as well as the Conference of the Chief Justices that published a Colombo declaration on Rule of Law. He has pioneered the establishment of a fund for the benevolence of the legal profession.
He has been appearing in a large number of fundamental rights applications and public interest matters defending the interests of affected parties and the rights of the legal profession. With regard to the conferment of Silk to seniors of the Bar he espoused the cause that more Bar Seniors from outstations be considered.

Pakistan win thriller for first Windies series victory
Roseau Sunday: Pakistan won a thrilling third and final Test with six balls to spare to clinch a first series victory in the West Indies Sunday and give a fitting farewell to the retiring captain Misbah ul Haq and veteran Younis Khan.
Roston Chases unbeaten 101, his second hundred of the series, proved in vain as the home side, set a target of 303 at Windsor Park in Dominica, slipped to 93 for six before the lower order almost rescued a dramatic draw.
This was just incredible, said a breathless Misbah after Shannon Gabriel dragged a wide delivery from Yasir Shah onto his stumps with just six balls left in the game to trigger Pakistani celebrations as the West Indies were dismissed for 202 to lose the series 2-1.
There were so many things happening in that last session - dropped catches, appeals, no-ball dismissals - it looked for a while as if it wasnt going to happen.
I am thankful for myself, the team and all supporters of Pakistan cricket that we were able to pull it off. Chase, who also top scored in the first innings with 69 and earned the man-of-the-match award, was the prime beneficiary of those near-misses.
Twice he saw caught-and-bowled attempts by Hasan Ali put down and then was reprieved on 91 when an edge to Asad Shafiq at slip off Mohammad Abbas was shown to be off a no-ball.
Im really disappointed that we couldnt hold on for just one more over, said a crestfallen Chase.
We have showed that we can compete with the best but its up to us to be able to take it all the way. It doesnt even matter that I got a hundred.
In the end he completed his third Test century but was left helpless at the non-strikers end when Gabriel, who had defended resolutely for 21 balls, inexplicably attempted a wild drive off Shah and dragged the ball back onto his stumps.
Shah finished with five for 92 and a series haul of 25 wickets, the highest of his career, as he took the man of the series award.
From their mid-afternoon perils, a 58-run seventh-wicket partnership between Chase and Jason Holder frustrated Pakistan for an hour-and-a-half, until the West Indies captain missed a knee-high full toss from Hasan Ali to be leg before for 22 just after tea. Devendra Bishoo and Alzarri Joseph also offered some resistance but it was Gabriels defiance through eight nerve-jangling overs with Chase that almost took the West Indies to safety and a drawn series.
A swift end to the match had looked likely as Vishaul Singh and Shane Dowrich both fell to Shah just after lunch.
Both were taken at short-leg by Babar Azam and on a pitch offering turn and bounce, it appeared only a matter of time before more wickets fell.
But Chase and Holder batted with calm assurance as the Pakistanis grew increasingly impatient in pursuit of the breakthrough.
Such anxieties appeared unlikely at the start of the day.
Having already lost the wicket of Kieran Powell overnight, the home side suffered two further setbacks inside the first hour of the morning.
Kraigg Brathwaites poor run of form continued when the opening batsman miscued an attempted cut off Shah for Hasan Ali to take the comfortable catch at backward point.
Shimron Hetmyer batted positively for 25 but was then comprehensively bowled by Mohammad Amir for the third time in the series. AFP

Pirates of the Caribbean 5: hackers threaten to post film online unless Disney pays ransom

Hackers claim to have plundered Walt Disneys upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film and are threatening to release it unless the studio pays a ransom, it was reported yesterday.
Bob Iger, the studios CEO, told a town hall meeting of ABC employees that hackers said they had accessed the film and would release it in segments online unless paid a ransom in bitcoin, according tothe Hollywood Reporter.
He did not name the film but said Disney had refused to pay and was working with federal investigators.
Deadline.comsaid the film was Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the latest instalment of the franchise starringJohnny Depp. It is due to reach theatres on 25 May.
Disney did not immediately respond to a Guardian query seeking confirmation.
Iger said the extortionists threatened to release five minutes of the film and then 20-minute chunks unless a sizeable ransom was paid.
Hollywood has become a prime target for cyber-criminals. Last month an anonymous hacker, or group of hackers,followed through on a threatto upload the fifth season of Orange is the New Black online after Netflix refused to pay a ransom.
Hackers have also reportedly targeted Hollywood agencies such as UTA, ICM and WME.
In 2014 hackers paralysed Sony Pictures and demanded the studio cancel distribution of The Interview, a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Koreas leader, Kim Jong-un.
Revelation of the extortion against Disney follows theglobal ransomware cyber-attackwhich has affected British hospitals and other organisations in at least 99 countries.
Disney is a potentially lucrative target. The Los Angeles-based behemoth is dominating box offices through its core filmmaking studio, nicknamed the House of Mouse, as well as Marvel studios and Lucasfilm.
It has billed thefifth instalmentof the Pirates franchise as a reboot, with Depps Captain Jack Sparrow returning to the ocean alongside Geoffrey Rush as Hector Barbossa and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner. Javier Bardem joins the franchise as an undead captain.

## Title: Pitch in for the turtles
## Supertitle:

Pitch in for the turtles
The majestic sea turtle is a national gem. The five species found in Sri Lanka, the green sea turtle, the leatherback sea turtle, the olive ridley sea turtle, the loggerhead sea turtle, and the hawksbill sea turtle frequent southern beaches and are major tourist draws.
These animals, which spend most of their lives in water, come to shore to lay their eggs. Their local nesting areas stretch from Mount Lavinia, down the west coast, across the south coast, and up to Arugam Bay on the East coast.
Sea turtles are globally threatened, and many species of the marine beasts are facing extinction. Though the turtles natural habitat spans all three oceans, the animals populations have collapsed in recent years due to numerous factors.
Natural causes are not thought to be contributing to their drop in numbers; large turtles have very few predators, and only sharks, large fish, crocodiles, killer whales, and sometimes octopi will attack an adult. Many species of fish and crabs, however, prey upon young turtles.
The key players in the decline of the sea turtle population are, as usual when discussing animal population destructions, human beings.
Many people throughout the world hunt adult turtles for their meat and fat. Nesting green turtle females, which are the most common species in Sri Lanka, are often killed for their meat, which is considered a delicacy throughout swaths of Asia. Turtle soup continues to be all too common across the continent.
Un-hatched turtle eggs are widely considered tasty treats and, to some populations, aphrodisiacs. People take hundreds of thousands of eggs are from beaches each year.
Unintentional harm
Furthermore, some hunt turtles for their shells. The Hawksbill turtle, which is critically endangered, was the main source of tortoiseshell material until laws eliminated the trade. But people still poach these turtles and sell the shells.
However, the unintentional harm that people inflict on sea turtles might be even more damaging. Countless animals are entangled and perish in fishing nets each year. Boats also strike many as they swim near the surface.
Pollution, both physical and chemical, also harms turtles. A major factor in turtle deaths is the explosion of plastic in the oceans. Adults often eat jellyfish, and they often mistake plastic bags for prey. Man-made chemicals also affect the turtles, causing fertility issues and even tumors.
But central to the turtles decline is habitat and nesting site destruction, two issues that are becoming more severe in Sri Lanka as the country develops. As once-secluded beaches host more visitors and resorts encroach on their nesting areas, turtles have little recourse to reproduce in other areas.
In order for the turtles to survive in Sri Lanka despite the aforementioned challenges, stakeholders must launch numerous wide-ranging conservation projects. The Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort launched one such project on Saturday, May 6th in conjunction with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
The resort, which opened in late 2015, sits on a beautiful, isolated stretch of Sri Lankas southern coast that is a prime nesting zone for sea turtles. After realizing that turtles were laying eggs on the beach, representatives from the resort reached out to IUCN to conduct a project that would help protect and conserve the marine animals.
Main objectives
The project, which will focus on conservation efforts both at the resort and extending over 100 kilometers of surrounding coastline, has five main objectives: conservation, raising awareness, provide a better habitat for turtles, build staff capacity, and raise funds for further turtle protection and management efforts.
With regard to conducting in-situ conservation of turtles, the Anantara-IUCN project will work to ensure that the turtles are supported and secure while nesting.
We will identify the relevant stakeholders, whether government agencies, staff, or local community actors, and work with them to do what is necessary to ensure that these turtles can complete their nesting without being disturbed, said Dr. Devaka Weerakoon, Professor in Zoology at Faculty of Science, University of Colombo and IUCN Commission Member.
The resort and NGO will also conduct an awareness workshop on how to properly record turtle nesting events.
Furthermore, the partners will conduct four separate turtle nesting site surveys, which will take place over 32 field days, from Tangalle to Yala National Park from August to December 2017.
It is important to survey the nesting sites periodically because the coastal area is changing rapidly. We want to measure the increases or decreases in nesting sites based on previous IUCN surveys so that we can prepare a turtle nest site management plan, said Weerakoon.
This first portion of the conservation plan, which extends well past the hotels limits, will also see the establishment of a database of turtle nesting site information.
The second aspect of the master plan is to raise awareness on turtle conservation and to enhance the capacity of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) to conduct conservation efforts on its own.
We need to create awareness among the guests about the project, so there will be activities that educate guests about the turtles lifestyles and the problems they face, Weerakoon said.
To that end, Anantara will establish a media wall at the resort that will display information and short documentaries on the turtles. A similar exhibition is planned for the proposed DWC office in Rekawa.
But the resort and IUCN will also work with local populations to raise their awareness about the plight of the sea turtles. They will also build cages protect eggs from predators, mostly dogs and monitor lizards, so they can hatch.
Finally, the partners will provide DWC field staff with equipment and technology to help protect the turtles.
One of the more ambitious and interesting aspects of the conservation plan is to enhance the number of native species of plants within the Anantara resort itself, thereby establishing a typical coastal habitat for native sea turtles.
Biodiversity survey
To achieve this goal, resort staff will conduct a biodiversity survey, train hotel staff on native flora, and identify and remove invasive alien plant species.
In terms of building the resorts capacity for conservation and sustainability, Anantara will conduct staff awareness programs that focus on the value of biodiversity and sea turtles and how to conduct effective conservation work.
But raising awareness will not stop at educating the staff, as the resort will develop an awareness program that would motivate guests to get involved with the project.
The project is funded by Anantaras Dollars for Deeds program, which matches east guests donation dollar for dollar. So, by choosing to donate $1 per night, guests will help conserve the local environment and promote the wellbeing of sea turtles.
We are delighted to have this incredible opportunity to work closely with IUCN to kick start this milestone conservation project. Out of the seven species of marine turtles recorded around the world, five visit the shores of Sri Lanka for the purpose of reproducing. With our resort beach being a prime nesting ground for the turtles, we are in a fortunate position to have the ability to support these endangered turtles by all possible means and also to have the chance to educate our guests, team members and the local community about our conservation efforts, comments Ross Sanders, General Manager of Anantara Tangalle.
While providing local and global conservation benefits, this project will serve as a model to enhance Sri Lankas nature, culture and heritage based tourism potential, said Dr. Ananda Mallawatantri, Country Representative, IUCN.

Pochettino foresees golden future in Spurs new home
London, SUNDAY: Mauricio Pochettino described Tottenham Hotspurs final day at White Hart Lane as perfect, but said moving into their new stadium would take the club to the next level.
Local hero Harry Kane scored the decisive goal as Tottenham beat Manchester United 2-1 on Sunday in their last game at the Lane, which is due to be demolished and rebuilt in time for the 2018-19 season.
The game was followed by a pitch invasion and then a ceremony involving Spurs greats from yesteryear, a rainbow breaking through the clouds with perfect timing as a shower of white tickertape brought the festivities to a close. I think for me the most special day will always be the last day at White Hart Lane, Spurs manager Pochettino said. For me it was a very exciting day because I think it was perfect. The preparation of the game, the game, we played well and we got the three points.
And at the end the ceremony was fantastic to share with all the legends, the people, the staff, the fans, the family.
Pochettinos side will play at Wembley next season before returning to their new 61,559-seater stadium, which is already taking shape beside the Lane. Spurs have twice come close to the Premier League title in the last two seasons, losing out to Leicester City last season and Chelsea this. But despite admitting to feeling sad and disappointed about Spurs latest brush with glory, Pochettino believes even brighter days lie ahead. We were talking a lot. We believe that when the new stadium opens the door, it will help the club to reach the last level, said the Argentine.
That is our expectation. That is our idea. The facilities, the training ground, the new facilities with the new stadium will put the team and the club in the last level in Europe. It was Spurs 14th successive home league win -- equalling the club record, set over two seasons in 1987 -- and confirmed they will end the season in second place, their highest placing since a runners-up finish in 1963. United, meanwhile, are now assured of finishing outside the top four, meaning they must beat Ajax in the Europa League final in Stockholm on May 24 to secure a place in the Champions League. AFP

Port City introduces livelihood support programmes for Negombo fishermen
Several development programmes to improve the livelihood of fisher folk and provide them with financial benefits were launched by the Colombo Port City in collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development.
The programmes were launched earlier this month at a ceremony attended by Fisheries & Aquatic Resource Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera as Chief Guest.
The Minister laid the foundation stone for the first phase of the project, which included a number of development programmes such as Community Halls in Dikkowita and Uswetakeiyawa; and two shelters for the boat landings in Keppungoda and Aluthkuruwa. The first phase of the development programme would benefit fisher families in the Wattala, Uswetakkeiyawa, Seeduwa, Keppungoda and Negombo areas. Seventeen fishery associations representing these areas were awarded Rs. 2 million each at the ceremony, so that the money would be distributed amongst fishermen in the form of interest free loans, so that they would have the opportunity to either purchase equipment or otherwise invest in their professions to better their livelihoods. There had been baseless propaganda in the past, spread by civil society organisations, leading to negative reactions by several fishery associations towards the Colombo Port City project. Allegations were made, stating that fisher folk were loosing fish breeding grounds, due to sand dredging in the Negombo area. However, investigations made by NARA proved that the manner in which the dredging was done had no impact on fish breeding grounds nor were the dredging locations in areas where there was coral and other marine life.
Identifying the need to uplift the fishing industry as a whole, the Colombo Port City decided to grant Rs. 500 million to the Fishermen Livelihood Support Society set up under the direction of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development. Under the Livelihood programme, plans are underway to provide several other Fishery Associations in the Negombo and Wattala fishing regions with financial aid and other facilities to uplift the livelihood of fisher families and the industry in general.

Is privatization perilous
The Government has announced that it intends to sell a few non-strategic State-owned Enterprises (SoEs). The five entities that are earmarked for this are Colombo Hilton, Grand Orient Hotel, Lanka Hospitals, Hyatt Hotel and Waters Edge.
There has been some vocal opposition to this move, which is surprising. Should the state be involved in operating these businesses
This is a fundamental question on the role of the state in the economy. Opinions will differ, some will want it to deliver all basic services, others may argue that it should only provide the minimum, the market catering to the rest.
Whatever ones political persuasion it should be possible to agree one principle: that whatever activity the state engages in, the ultimate goal should be the improvement of public welfare. Keeping this in mind let us examine the impact that the sale of these entities may have on the public.
Of the entities that have been identified, two are hotels, one is a restaurant, one is a distributor of cooking gas and one is a hospital.
The oldest of these, the property of the Grand Oriental Hotel was acquired by the Bank of Ceylon in 1954. While the circumstances of this acquisition are not clear it is possible that the property was acquired in settlement of debts owed to the bank. The bank occupies a part of the building which it uses as an office while the hotel operates on the rest. Originally the hotel boasted 154 rooms but this was reduced to 54 when the bank occupied a part of the property. The hotel currently has 80 rooms.
New construction
The accounts of the Bank of Ceylon make no mention of the profitability of the hotel but the fact that the bank prefers to use a substantial part of the building as an office rather than run it as a hotel indicates that the hotel is not the banks priority, quite rightly so. Should it be the priority of the state
The hotel caters mainly to foreign tourists but provides restaurant and banqueting facilities that are utilised by citizens. There is no shortage of hotel rooms in Colombo, indeed with all the new construction taking place there are even fears of a glut of rooms in a couple of years. There are plenty of other hotels and restaurants that citizens can avail themselves of in the city so if they so desire.
Is there an essential public service that is being provided by the state owing and managing this hotel A small part of the population does utilise the hotel but relative to the overall population it is miniscule. As they do so on normal commercial terms and there are plenty of alternatives available transferring this to private hands will have no impact on public welfare.
Similar arguments apply to the Hilton Hotel, Waters Edge and the Hyatt.
The Hilton was expropriated in 2011 under a dubious piece of legislation, the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilised Assets Act. It continues to run as a hotel under state ownership.
Water Edge was a private project, built on state land sold under controversial circumstances and re-vested in the government by a court order. Originally set up as a golf club it now functions as a restaurant/reception hall.
The Hyatt Hotel is still under construction. This ended up in state hands as when the Ceylinco Group which owned it collapsed and was bailed out by the government.
Private ownership
A hospital is of greater public interest, in terms of welfare than a hotel.
Lanka Hospitals was a private hospital that was acquired by the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) when SLIC was in private hands. SLIC reverted to the state after the Supreme Court ruled against its privatisation in mid-2009, leaving Lanka Hospitals in state hands. Lanka Hospitals continues to function like a private hospital, charging fees and does not come under the purview of the Health Ministry (being run by the UDA). The state runs free healthcare services but state ownership of the commercially run Lanka Hospitals had no discernible impact either for good or ill on public health, therefore there can be no serious concerns in returning this to private ownership.
In terms of public impact, cooking gas is of the most significance. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of 2013 about 54.7% of urban households use gas for cooking (although islandwide only 18.5% of households do). How will the sale of Litro Gas affect the public interest
Fortunately we have a benchmark to assess the possible impact of privatisation since Litro Gas was previously in private hands. The government owned the gas distributor but it was sold to Shell in 1995. The period of private ownership saw an improvement in service. Frequent shortages of gas and the lack of cylinders which plagued the service disappeared.
In 2001 the government allowed a second private player to enter the industry which has improved service further: online ordering, home delivery, more convenient packaging and energy audits for industrial customers have materialised. All this would have been quite unthinkable under the old pre-1995 state monopoly. When Shell decided to pull out of Sri Lanka the Government bought it back. Since the renationalisation in 2010 the state has managed to maintain the standards set by Shell but there has been no visible improvement under state ownership.
The introduction of private players to the distribution of fuel (LIOC) and the commercialised distribution of electricity (through LECO) also resulted in improved customer service. Any industrial customer who has attempted obtain a transformer will testify to the ease with which it can be done with LECO, as opposed to the bureaucratic stonewalling that one faces with the CEB.
The lesson therefore is clear  service, therefore public welfare will increase when consumers are given a wider choice. When they have alternatives to turn to businesses are forced to improve services. The previous experience under Shell supports this case and the government should not hesitate to sell a 51% stake Litro Gas.
They should then follow through with selling the rest to the public and listing the entity on the stock market which will improve transparency and therefore accountability. The Government should also grant further licenses to allow other distributors of cooking gas to enter and improve consumer choice even further.

Quality Assurance Authority to assess private universities
The government hopes to set up a Quality Assurance Authority (QAA) to ensure that private institutes of higher education maintain the required standards.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said the draft bill on the Authority had been approved by the Attorney Generals Department and will be submitted for Parliamentary approval soon.
Addressing a media briefing on the subject of private medical universities at the Department of Government Information yesterday, he said the QAA is to be an independent body which will assess the standards of all private universities and have the authority to shut down those who do not conform.
As issues of standards and the privatisation of medical education were brought to the fold once again with the establishment of the South Asian Institute for Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the government has been grappled with the wider question of its policy on private higher education.
Perera said there had been confusion over what action needs to be taken as the governments policy on the matter.
We have now resolved the issue and made public our stance through a notice in all newspapers, he said.
If the government does not have its own resources to provide all qualified and suitable students with higher education, the government has to protect the students right to seek education elsewhere, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne said.
The government has proposed to take over the Dr Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and run it as a state hospital where all medical students can have access to its facilities, halt further intakes of students to SAITM until all recommendations are implemented and have students qualified from SAITM sit for a special exam decreed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council in order to be recognised as doctors.
Perera said there had been no opposition from Dr. Fernando over the proposal and he had agreed to hand over the hospital to the government at no cost .
Apart from this, the government has also taken steps to: legislate the minimum qualifications that are mandatory for pursuing medical education in any university; make it mandatory for all private medical universities registered in Sri Lanka to maintain high academic standards, administrative procedures and proper management practices and all requiring that all such university are governed by a Board of Governors and are listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange as to broad base public ownership through shares; involving the private sector to increase quality higher educational opportunities within Sri Lanka for students who qualify for University admission but cannot be accommodated in the state universities; advising private higher educational institutions to increase the number of scholarships provided to eligible and needy students and increasing the number of students admitted to existing medical faculties in the state universities and setting up a new medical faculties (Kuliyapitiya and Sabaragamuwa).
Deputy Minister Wickremaratne however noted that new legislation will have to be drafted before the private universities are put on the stock market.
UNP MP Mujibur Rahuman criticized the GMOA for their trade union action and the former alleged that the GMOA together with the Joint Opposition were trying to use this issue to topple the government, Neither the unions nor those with expired ideologies would be successful in their efforts, Rahuman said.

The new Nurses Faculty which can train 2,000 nurses at once will be established at Sri Jayawardenepura and the hostel will be constructed at Mulleriaya, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the International Nurses Day held in Colombo recently, he said for the first time, the proposal to offer a nursing degree was present in 2002. Until then no trade union declared it. The Doctors Association opposed the idea of offering a nursing degree to nurses, he said.
According to Minister Senaratne, young nurses do not know how the nursing profession in Sri Lanka reached the current status. They should be educated on the history of nursing. The trade unions should have a broad minded view on issues and they should be active. Name boards alone will not do anything, Senaratne said.
Regarding the accusation made by Public Service United Nurses Union President Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera about the Acting Director General of Health Services, Senaratne said he wanted to develop the nursing profession and requested the support of the Thera.

Researchers find possible North Korea link to massive cyberattack

It's unclear who is responsible for the global cyberattack that targeted around 300,000 machines in 150 countries. Businesses are still reeling from the fallout, and government agencies around the world are investigating.
Security researchers have documented similarities between the WannaCry code and malware created by Lazarus group, a hacking operation that has been linked to North Korea. The code similarities were discovered by Google researcher Neel Mehta on Monday. Google declined to comment.
The security firm Symantec also found links between Lazarus and WannaCry. It discovered early versions of WannaCry on systems that had been compromised by the Lazarus group's tools. These versions were different than the ransomware that spread on Friday. It is unclear whether the Lazarus group put the ransomware on those systems, or someone else did.
"We have not yet been able to confirm the Lazarus tools deployed WannaCry on these systems," a Symantec spokesperson said in a statement to CNNTech. "While these connections exist, they so far only represent weak connections. We are continuing to investigate for stronger connections."
Kaspersky Lab, a security company, has also published the similarities. The Lazarus group was linked to the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and attacks on banks around the world.
The latest observations are still a long way from determining whether North Korean hackers were behind the recent global cyberattack, but they demonstrate how researchers go about finding who is to blame. One way is to investigate the code and compare it to samples that known hackers have used in the past.
According to Amanda Rousseau, malware researcher at security firm Endgame, it's difficult to catch cybercriminals. Further, it will be hard to find patient zero, or the first victim that kicked off the spread of the virus.
The WannaCry ransomware took computers hostage by encrypting their files and requiring payment to unlock them. It leveraged a Windows vulnerability leaked in a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. The ransomware mostly affects businesses and large organizations that use a Windows tool that enables file-sharing.
Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March.
Rousseau says the malware code indicates there are at least two different parties responsible for it because there are two pieces of the attack that are coded differently. The ransomware itself was not hard to reverse engineer, she said, and indicates that a less experienced person wrote it.
Multiple government agencies are committed to tracking down the perpetrators.
Finding out who is responsible is called "attribution." And it is very hard to do. Researchers look for certain identifiable pieces of code or clues on how it was executed, such as text strings or site registrations. But there are tools that hackers use to throw investigators off their tracks. Often, malware code is publicly available, or it can be purchased on digital black markets.
According to Michael Flossman, researcher at security firm Lookout, examining the victims can help narrow down the perpetrators -- but in the case of WannaCry, hundreds of thousands of machines were affected and there weren't a ton of similarities in who was hit.
The hackers responsible have not received much in return for their efforts. While the ransomware took down hospitals and critical infrastructure, it's made less than $60,000 in ransom. Security researchers and government agencies have advised businesses not to pay the ransom.
Researchers are piecing together where WannaCry came from, and some insight into how hackers used the leaked Microsoft vulnerabilities could be found on the dark web.
The dark web is like a second layer of the internet beyond what average people use every day. It can only be accessed via the Tor browser, which gives users a cloak of anonymity and makes it impossible for anyone else to see their activity.
Cybersecurity firm CYR3CON collects information from dark web sites and uses it to understand cybersecurity threats. In mid-April, the firm identified a conversation on a popular Russian forum that discussed using the leaked NSA exploits to launch ransomware attacks against hospitals.
"The thing most interesting was a conversation that mentioned the specific Windows exploit," Paulo Shakarian, cofounder and CEO of CYR3CON, told CNNTech. "It mentioned there were tens of thousands of systems that could be targeted, and many of them were in the medical industry."
Though there were many dark web conversations around the tools after they were released in April, this specific thread talked about a ransomware attack strikingly similar to WannaCry.
It's impossible to know who posted it, and it is not evidence that people who participated in the thread were responsible. But law enforcement and researchers can use this information to see what future attacks might look like so companies and users can defend themselves against hacks.
"It can give insight into what malicious hackers are looking to target, what tools they will use, and what is the established expertise," Shakarian said.

Roundtable discussion on Blue Economy in New Delhi begins today
Pathfinder Foundation (PF), Sri Lanka, and Vivekananda International Foundation, India, to discuss bilateral cooperation on Blue Economy
The Centre for Indo-Lanka initiatives (CILI) of the Pathfinder Foundation (PF) will conduct a two-day round table discussion on the Blue Economy with the Vivekananda International Foundation, in New Delhi on May 16 and 17.
The focus of the discussion will be guided by the theme, Sustainable Exploitation of Marine Resources.
The panellists will examine aspects of sustainable exploitation of aquatic living resources like fish and other life forms in one session. Another session will be devoted to looking at ways and means of joint exploration of non-living resources of the seabed.
The focus of these efforts will be in line with the Sustainable Development Goal No. 14 of the UN to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. The final session will consider maritime security issues in the Indian Ocean region, which may impinge upon the quest for a Blue Economy.
The delegation representing the Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of the Pathfinder Foundation will comprise PF Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke, CILI Director Admiral (Rtd.) Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Ocean University Vice Chancellor Tilak Dharmaratne, Point Pedro Institute of Development Principal Researcher Dr. Muttukrishna Sarvananthan, and PF Project Manager Ameera Arooz.
Blue Economy is a relatively emerging concept, which is founded on the premise of sustainable development of the resources of oceans, which would yield benefits not only for coastal states but also for the world at large without damaging the marine environment.
While there is no overarching definition of this concept, it could be considered as an amalgamation of traditional maritime sectors of shipbuilding, shipping, port development, fisheries, aquaculture and more modern fields of marine tourism and marine leisure.
It could also be expanded to include more esoteric and technology-oriented sectors of seabed exploration, deep-sea mining, ocean energy, marine bio-prospecting and biotechnology and the like.
Development of a Blue Economy holds immense promise for the Indian Ocean region.
The Indian Ocean is central to the worlds trade and energy supply shipping lines. It also has a wealth of natural resources which are largely untapped.
The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) has been a keen supporter of development of the Blue Economy as demonstrated by adopting the theme as the top priority for generating employment and ensuring sustainability in business and economic models at the Council of Ministers Meeting held in October 2014 in Perth, Australia.

Now the political authorities are taking steps to fulfill the requirements pointed out by the SLMC in connection with SAITM.
In July 2015, the SLMC sent a team to SAITM for an inspection and the team stated that there are grave deficiencies in training given to the SAITM medical students, Prof Fonseka said.
The SAITM crisis is not a legal problem. If it is a legal problem, a legal solution can be given.
But the SAITM crisis is clearly an issue in the training of medical graduates, he said.

Senior citizens enjoy at HelpAge New Year festival
Unlike the elders in urban areas, in the olden days village elders were anxiously waiting for the dawn of the New Year. It was not because of anything else but because they wanted to take part in the traditional New Year games.
This situation has now changed and at present elders participating in traditional New Year games has become a common scene in the city of Colombo as well as in other urban areas. But, even in Colombo or other areas we rarely witness elders over 70 years take part in traditional games.
Last Thursday was an unforgettable day for about 40 male and female elders in H.P.Gooneratne Day Centre, Ratmalana. The Elders New Year festival was held at S.D.S Jayasinghe Ground, Dehiwala.
It was organized by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) as a part of their social service programs, conducted annually for the welfare of underprivileged senior citizens . The festival was also witnessed by several foreign nationals who were on their way to the Dehiwala Zoological gardens.
This was not the first occasion HelpAge organized such a program. Every year various social programs are conducted by HelpAge for elders in addition to their flagship program of performing free cataract surgeries for needy elders at HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatta (Opposite Savoy Cinema). Helpage also organizes free mobile Medical and Eye Camps islandwide for elders welfare.
The New Year festival commenced at 9 am and ended around 3 pm. All the elders were between the ages of 60 to 73 years. HelpAge staff members also encouraged them in the games.
They were engaged in games such as the musical chairs competition, scraping coconuts and weaving cadjan competitions, placing the eye on elephant, bursting the balloon competition and breaking the pot by a blindfolded person.
HelpAge, Chirman Deshabandu Tilak de Zoysa was the Chief Guest, while HelpAge Council Member Nishantha Gooneratne was the Guest of Honour. HelpAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge , Stores Executive Buddhika Nanayakkara , the officials and the staff of HelpAge were also present.

Sharapova wins opening match in Rome
Rome: Maria Sharapova broke seven times to win her opening match at the Rome Masters on Monday, with the Russian wild card advancing over American Christina McHale 6-4, 6-2.
The five-time Grand Slam champion, who is coming back onto the WTA after completing a 15-month doping ban, advanced to the second round at the sun-drenched Foro Italico as she beat McHale for a fifth time without defeat.
The former number one, whose ranking has recovered into the 200s after a Stuttgart semi-final and a second round last week in Madrid, overcame seven double-faults in victory on the clay in 90 minutes.
She came through a hiccup near the end, losing serve as she prepared to wrap it up while leading 5-1, but recovered in the next game to emerge the winner.
Sharapova is still waiting to hear if she will receive a wild card entry into Roland Garros starting a week from Sunday. AFP

Silence : Gut wrenchingly emotional and beautiful
I might not have experienced all of Martin Scorseses movies, but I always appreciate him as a brilliant director for obvious reasons. He's one of those directors who rarely ever has a mishap. Still to this day he has delivered classic level movies into his 70's.
Martin Scorsese doesn't make movies by the numbers. I love Steven Spielberg and his movies like The BFG is far more excellent than Scorseses work. When Scorsese gets his hands on a family or Children's movie he made Hugo which is Phenomenal. His directing style has been proved once again with Silence.
The celebrated director engages in a 28-year journey to bring Shusaku Endo's 1966 acclaimed novel to life. It tells the story of two Christian missionaries who have to face the ultimate test of faith when they venture onto Japan in search of their missing mentor at a time when Christianity was outlawed and their presence forbidden. There are some scenes in this movie that truly affected me in a deeper level.
Amazing performance
Andrew Garfield as father Sebastio Rodrigues and Adam Driver as father Francisco Garupe give the best performances of their career and even though Im aware that Garfields nomination for Hacksaw Ridge was well reversed I felt that his performance in Silence had so much to offer and it just blew me away. Adam Driver as you may probably know his biding to Star Wars including the latest in the franchise The last Jedi and his recent film Paterson, gives an amazing performance as father Francisco Garupe. Father Cristvo Ferreira (Academy Award nominee) Liam Neesons character plays more of a supporting role to the movie as his complexity changes the mission surrounding Fr. Rodrigues as his vulnerability reaches to the fullest where he begins to question his own faith upon God. Another great performance that needs to be mentioned is Ysuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro. His character seems to be of the Judas type who we think has slit humanity inside but doesnt. A big shout out to Issey Ogata. You folks remember Christoph Waltz from Inglorious Bustards. Thats who he reminded me of - a douche bag we all love to hate.
Confined environment
This film is gorgeous. The actions and scenes are captured by the same cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who helmed The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) with Scorsese and their pairing in Silence is a thing of beauty if you love examining the way the film has been shot. This is one of Martin Scorseses best looking films. The most remarkable part of this project is that he unfolds this tale in a very small confined environment. A major part of the film takes place where the characters are in captivity or going through rural areas or having to survive in a very small tiny hut. The amazing fact is that this film looks as good as it does in such surroundings and it is a testament to this director-cinematographer pairing.
Beliefs vs. humanity Believing in what you believe Silence taught me that ultimately it has to be yourself and you have to find that faith, that relationship with Jesus within yourself. Scorsese describes the struggle as it is stated in the novel as he quotes At first I didnt really immediately know all when I was reading the book how to realize it. Make it real... Stage it, because I didnt know the heart of it. I personally think he succeeded on what he had visualized. The message that approached me is the struggle of the very essence of faith, the pure weakness of humanity.
Its a story that in gut wrenching ways examines how a group of people were so brutality violated through their faith. They try to denounce the said faith in public. When the film ended I took a huge breath and I felt like I hadnt really taken a single breath that big throughout the entire the run time because I was so focused on every single shot.
This is an emotionally staggering film and one of Scorseses best.
Its incredibly difficult to make and it is a frustrating movie as well. But these are feelings I imagine one would go through when dealing with an extreme crisis of faith and that is a perfect reaction to one would possess after watching a film like Silence.

SLT Group reports Rs. 18.7 bn revenue during 1Q, 2017
Sri Lanka Telecom Group during the first quarter 2017 has reported Rs 18.7 billion revenue, a 1.4% year on year growth.
The tax changes made by the government had an adverse impact on the Groups revenue growth which has also had an impact in its profitability as well. The Groups operating expenditure increased by 2.7% to Rs. 13.1 billion from Rs 12.7 billion in line with business expansions and external factors.
The impact caused by foreign currency translation losses continued due to the depreciation of the rupee against the USD. During the quarter there was a foreign exchange loss of Rs. 364 million. Owing to the above reasons and increase of depreciation by 19.7% year on year to Rs. 3.9 billion, the profit before tax and profit for the period dipped to Rs. 1.8 billion and Rs. 1.5 billion respectively.
The operating revenue of the holding company increased by 3.6% to Rs. 11.2 billion despite the external challenges as explained above. However, due to the increase of depreciation to Rs. 2.5 billion by 30% year on year and increase of foreign currency translation losses to Rs. 257 million from Rs. 64 million of same period of the last year the profit before tax and profit for the period dipped to Rs. 627 million and Rs. 545 million respectively.
As a pioneer in the ICT industry and as part of a market that shifts very quickly, the SLT assemblage continuously strives to remain technologically innovative.

South Korean rising star Kim wins Players title
Miami, SUNDAY: South Korean Kim Si-Woo became the youngest winner in Players Championship history, firing a three-under par 69 on Sunday for a three-stroke US PGA Tour victory.
The 75th-ranked prodigy, who has played 120 professional tournaments worldwide, became only the second Asian winner of the event after South Koreas K.J. Choi in 2011.
The 21-year-old Kim eclipsed the Players age mark set by Adam Scott when the Australian won at age 23 in 2004 at the famed TPC Sawgrass layout in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
I still cant believe Im the champion and Im the youngest champion for this major tournament, Kim said through a translator. Im looking forward to working hard from now on.
Resolute and cool under pressure, Kim used a bogey-free final round to collect his biggest victory by finishing 72 holes on 10-under 278.
Kim, ranked 75th in the world, became only the second non-US player to win twice on the US PGA Tour before age 22, joining last months Masters winner, Spaniard Sergio Garcia.
Britains Ian Poulter and South African Louis Oosthuizen shared second on 281, Poulter after a closing 71 with Oosty firing a 73. American Kyle Stanley and Rafa Cabrera Bello of Spain shared fourth on 282. Kim, the US PGAs youngest player, won his first tour title last August at Greensboro, but hadnt managed a top-20 US PGA finish since last October and was in only his second Players, having shared 23rd in 2016.
Usually Im very nervous but last year I won one and I got a two-year extension, Kim said. So I can hit aggressively and I wasnt as nervous.
Now Kim has a five-year spot on the tour and assured spots into many of golfs top events. Stanley and countryman J.B. Holmes, who closed with an 84, were 54-hole co-leaders, but Holmes had bogeys on three of the first five holes and Stanley on two of the first four to stumble back.
Oosthuizen sank a four-foot birdie putt at the par-5 second to reach nine-under but found water at the fourth and made double bogey to fall back.
That left Poulter and Kim atop the leaderboard at eight-under, Poulter after a tap-in birdie at the second and five-foot birdie putt at the sixth and Kim after a 17-foot birdie on the opening hole.
Kim sank a 24-foot birdie putt at the par-4 seventh to seize the lead and sank an 18-foot birdie putt at the par-5 ninth to reach 10-under for a two-stroke advantage.
Then Kim parred his way through the back nine, his last putts no longer than four feet on any hole as he calmly ignored winds and tension to prevail.
Poulter could never catch him, reaching nine-under with a five-foot birdie putt at the par-5 11th but making bogey at 12, missing a five-foot par putt, and taking another bogey at 18 after shanking his approach 40 yards right into a bush but then smacking his fourth inches from the cup. It was one of the worst shots you will ever see to a pretty good one, Poulter said. I was nervous out there all day, being in a situation I hadnt been in for a while.
I felt good coming down the last few holes. Im pleased I played well. It has been a good week.
It was the second Players runner-up finish for Poulter after 2009. It came after he had thought his playing rights were lost before a recalculation of points showed he had done enough with a medical exemption to keep his tour spot. Stanley made his fourth birdie of the week at the par-3 17th island green, matching American Paul Azinger from 1987 as the only players to birdie the hole four times in one week. AFP

Sri Lanka needs Foreign Direct Investment: Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku
The second Sri Lanka investment summit in Asia, first ever in Hong Kong was held on March 16 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Kowloon, Hong Kong with the participation of over 200 investors. Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku, addressing the Summit in Hong Kong said Sri Lanka needs Foreign Direct Investment and access to Global Markets.
Following is the full text of the speech:
As the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Peoples Republic of China, I would like to warmly welcome all delegates to the Second Sri Lanka Investment Summit in Hong Kong. I believe Hong Kong is a rather apt choice as the location for this summit, as it played an important role through FDI when China opened its economy in 1979. As you are well aware, today Hong Kong is a part of the Peoples Republic of China although its economy and system of governance are different under the One Country Two Systems principle introduced by the late leader Deng Xioping, who guided Chinese economic reforms in the late 1970s under the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Even just a few days ago, on 55h March, during a presentation of a report on government work, the Prime Minister of the Peoples Republic of China, Li Keqiang, declared that the government would continue to follow the leadership of the party Central Committee, with comrade Xi Jinping as its core and Den Xiaopings theory as its guide.
Since this summit is being held in Hong Kong and I have lived in Beijing for the past one-and-a-half yeas, I have been able to experience and see the impact of development in Beijing, as well during several visits to Hong Kong, the adjoining Shenzhen, shanghai, Chongq1ing, and many other provincial cities during this period. I would also like to touch on my observances from with I was previously Sri Lankas Ambassador to Japan and South Korea, which enabled me to observe the Japanese miracle in the late 1980s and the South Korean miracle in the early 1990s. It was an unusual and rare opportunity to witness the positive impact of foreign investment in these two countries and learn about how these countries were later able to share their prosperity gained through export led foreign investment with the rest of the world, particularly many emerging Asian economies.
Today, in the United States and in several countries in Europe, anti-globalization sentiments have become a popular tool for political gain. Globalization broadly refers to the movement of trade, both goods and services, investment capital, human resources etc. Development requires a global path without constraints. Therefore, these attempts to obstruct this path in many countries for narrow political gains would deprive possible positive gains for many millions of the poor in less developed countries, particularly in Asia and Africa.
When we look a the gains of globalization in the three countries in which I have served as Ambassador and in many other countries in Asia such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam, my considered view is that a development path based on foreign investment and an export led growth strategy should not be restricted. When we compare the living standards in these countries now and fifty yeas ago, no one can deny the positive impact of foreign investment and globalization on the lives of millions and millions of poor Asians during this period. It is true that there are still also many millions who suffer from poverty, hunger, and unemployment, but rapid economic development with social justice remains as the solution, not any other magic formula.
Fortunately, most countries in Asia, their leaders, and majority of the people have understood this reality. The election result in the United States may have stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, but the 16 Asian partners, including Australia and New Zealand, are no preparing for a regional pro globalization drive through a Regional Comprehensive Economic partnership Agreement. While the largest South Asian Economy, India, is part of this partnership, Sri Lanka is unfortunately not part of this grouping, perhaps due to its GDP still being at around US$ 80 billion only.
Recently, the RCEP grouping has been referred to as the worlds major new mega FTA. The grouping has the backing of the Chinese Government, and in the same report I referred to earlier, Premier Li Keqiang declared that I quote Economic globalization is the fundamental interest of all countries. China will not shift in its commitment to promoting global economic cooperation, will uphold the multilateral trading regime as the main channel of international trade. China is ready to join hands to conclude talks as soon as possible for the RCEP agreement and to advance the development of the Free trade Area of the Asia Pacific. We will continue to negotiate investment and trade agreements with relevant countries and region unquote. President Xi Jinping expressed similar sentiments in Davos as the World Economic forum.
Therefore, I hope that, with the blessings of the major economies in Asia, such as China, Japan, and India, export-led investment in Asia will continue to prosper disregarding the sentiments being expressed in the US and Europe, However, I would like to emphasize that the export-let FDI strategy is not a panacea for all socio-economic problems in emerging economies. What emerging economies should do is to use the strategy as a tool to build strong national economies with the support of the FDI and the export markets. That is what Japan, South Korea, and Singapore have already done and what China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are doing presently.
Before I conclude, I would like to briefly touch one the role that Hong Kong has played in providing foreign direct investment to China when it opened up in 1979, as well as the pioneering role that Shenzhen which has a relevance to Sri Lanka played as the first Special Economic Zone According to a study done by Professor. Before I conclude, I would like to briefly touch on the role that Hong Kong has played in providing foreign direct investment to China when it opened up in 1979, as well as the pioneering role that Shenzhen which has a relevance to Sri Lanka played as the first Special Economic Zone. According to a study done by Professor Michael J. Enright  I will quote the result of this step-by-step approach to opening (of China) has been dramatic rise in inward foreign direct investment, which went from virtually zero in 1980 to exceed US$ 100 billion per year by 2008 and reach nearly US$ 1.6 trillion in cumulative inward foreign direct investment (FDI) by 2014 unquote. The massive flow of foreign direct investment resulted in 810,163 investment projects in China during this period. The total impact of this FDI on the Chinese economy has been in the order of 33 percent of Chinas GDP and 27 percent of Chinas employment.
Meanwhile, the experiment done with economic reforms at Shenzen, the first Specialized Economic Zonein China paved the way for remarkable success and has transformed the Chinese economy into the second-largest economy in the world today. The success of Shenzhen is a role model for the Sri Lankan governments effort to turn Hambantota, as our PM mentioned last year when he visited China. Hambantota is currently a rural region with several white elephant projects that are an enormous burden for tax payers and the Finance Minister who is here with us, intendes to transform it into a successful economic zone.
A remarkable fact with regards to the source of the FDI to China is that FDI originating from Hong Kong, the city where we have gathered, accounted for 478 percent of the total value of the FDI. The absolute figure was US$ 744.8 billion. Another 8.3 percent, or US$ 132.1 billion, came from the British Virgin Islands, which is considered as a tax haven for many Hong Kong based companies. Therefore, it would be correct to say that more than 50 percent of the FDI that came to China originated from Hong Kong. Four other miracle economies, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea-South, provided a respectively 6.2, 4.5, 3.8 and 3.8 percent of FDI to China during this period.
Hong Kong became a British territory in 1842 with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking between China and the UK after the opium wars. Before the Nanking Agreement. Hong Kong was offered to the UK under the Convention of Chunpee (in Canton) one year earlier, but both governments (China and the UK) were unhappy about the agreements made, resulting in the sacking of the signatories on both sides. The Chinese Emperor considered the island an important place and punished his Grand Secretary left Canton in chains, condemned to death. His wealth, which was estimated at 10 million, was also confiscated. Ultimately, the Grand Secretarys death penalty was revoked, but he was exiled to a frozen region, where he passed out of history.
The British Foreign Secretary at that time, Palmerston was also unhappy about his envoy Captain Charles Elliot accepting only Hong Kong, instead to other sea ports that the British were eyeing. He sacked the envoy writing to him. I quote you have obtained the cession of Hong Kong, a barren island with hardly a house upon it. Now it seems obvious that Hong Kong, a barren island with hardly a house upon it. Now it seems obvious that Hong Kong will not be a Mart of Trade, any more than Macao is so. However it is possible I may be mistaken in this matter - unquote. Charles Elliot was chased out from Canton.
However, only one year later, Hong Kong became a British territory and continued to be so for 150 years, Today, we can see that the British Foreign Secretary was very mistaken; Hong Kong has proved to be much more than a barren island. At the time of the handing over of Hong Kong to China, the Island had a prosperous economy. The blessing in disguise was the emergence of Hong Kong as the major source of the FDI when China opened its economy in 1979 for foreign investment. Hong Kong was a gift that kept giving to China continuously.
The last segment of my presentation is about Shenzhen, which was considered by Sri Lanka as a model for developing our southern development hub, Hambantota. Shenzhen was only a small fishing village of 30,000 residents in 1979, but now its population exceeds 10 million. During this period, the value of total foreign investment in Shenzhen has been US$ 65 billion. 52 percent of industrial output came from the FDI. Today Shenzhen is not only one of the richest municipalities in China with a GDP of US$ 283.8 billion, and it also accounts for 62 billionaries of Chinas 609 billionaires while Hong Kong with its GDP of US$ 387 billion has 71 billionaires.
Another coincidence with regard to Shenzhens remarkable development was the involvement of China Merchants Group, state-owned enterprise based in Hong Kong.
The first area under the Shenzhen Master Plan was Dhekou Industrial Zone, and it was developed by China Merchants Group, Which has relevance to Sri Lanka, constructed the infrastructure, utilities, and ports. Within a few years, Shekou attracted foreign investors, with the majority from Hong Kong, and transformed the fishing village into an energetic industrial city.
The Sri Lankan authorities too have now selected the same China Merchants Group, which is already successfully running one of the container terminals in Colombo Port, as the core investor for Sri Lankas Shenzhen, Hambantota. Our sincere hope is that with their coordination and investment, Sri Lanka would be able to convert its Hambantota fishing village into another industrial hub in the Indian Ocean.
I would like to conclude my speech by once again welcoming all the participants and extending my sincere thanks to both the organizers, Hay-market Media, and the sponsors. Just like many other Asian countries have transformed their economies with the backing of FDI, Sri Lanka too wishes to transform its economy with the support of the FDI into a strong economy in which all Sri Lankans are able to enjoy a high standard of living.

Surrey ride on peerless Sangakkara ton
LONDON, Sunday : Surrey stayed on course for a quarterfinal berth in the Royal London Cup as the peerless Kumar Sangakkara scored an unbeaten 124 to guide his side to a comfortable victory over Hampshire at the Oval. Sangakkara added 93 for the second wicket with Mark Stoneman (53 off 52) and then an unbeaten 128-run stand with Rory Burns (39 n.o. off 54) before rain hit the Oval. With no signs of the showers relenting, the game was awarded to Surrey, who were 66 runs ahead of the corresponding Duckworth-Lewis score.
Sangakkaras stylish effort was preceded by an equally ebullient effort from George Bailey, who struck an unbeaten 132-ball 145 to drag Hampshire from the depths of despair to a total of respectability. Ravi Rampauls opening burst and excellent follow-up acts from the Curran brother to reduce Hampshire to 89 for 7 before Kyle Abbott joined Bailey. The 152-run stand - a record for Hampshire for the eighth wicket - helped the visitors post 271 in the 50 overs before Hampshire were undone by another Sangakkara special.
At Leicester, Leicestershire bowlers, led by pacers Dieter Klein (3-46) and Gavin Griffiths (3-44), helped keep the teams slender hopes of making the quarterfinal alive, as they beat Derbyshire by five wickets. Alex Hughess unbeaten 96 went in vain as none of the other batsmen could make sizeable contributions and provide him with ample support as Derbyshire were bundled out for 219.
Samit Patel scored an unbeaten century and added a 181-run stand with Steven Mullaney to help Nottinghamnshire chase down Lancashires 260 and keep their campaign alive at Nottingham.
Bottom-placed Warwickshire upset the apple-cart with a surprising win over Yorkshire, whose chances of making a direct entry into the semis were dented. Jonathan Trott (70) and Ian Bell (98) nullified Joe Roots innings-setting 83 and a 116-run partnership with Tim Bresnan (65) and Matthew Waite (71) to take Warwickshire to a five-wicket win and hence, off the last spot in the points table.
John Hastings and Daryl Mitchell picked up three wickets each to defy Durham and take Worcestershire on the verge of a semifinal spot, despite a maiden List A century from Durham opener Graham Clark.

St. Sylvesters College pulled off a hard fougth 30 (1 goals, 4 tries and 1 penalty) to 15 (1 goal, 1 try and 1 penalty) win over Richmond College, Galle in their inter school Bowl trophy rugby match played at the Bogambara Stadium last evening. Both teams played an excellent game of rugby and with great difficulty Sylvestrians led 10-8 at half time. In the first half, Sylvestrians did not perform with their usual speedy game and depended on few individuals to grab points. Richmond forwards did well but were unable to maintain consistency in their teamwork to score points from the ball they won at line outs and scrums during the latter stage of the second phase.
After the turn over it was evident that the Galle boys were determined to pose a big challenge to Kandy lads which they did in style and in the last quarter they closed the gap to 15-18 at a stage. Soon Sylvestrians bounced back strongly with a fierce attack and had bulk of possession from their forward and back division play to increase their scoring and sealed the victory.

The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York organised this years Day of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on May 10. It was held in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution 54/115 recognising the day of Vesak internationally as the most significant day for the Buddhists all over the world.
Ambassador Rohan Perera, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Co-Chair of the event to mark the Vesak Day at the UN Headquarters, addressing the General Assembly, observed that the message of peace and compassion, taught by the Buddha is valid and relevant in the present day world, more than ever.
The Buddhas teachings are relevant because they provide us an ideal framework to view and analyse the reality of the world we live in, and to find solutions to our problems by looking at that reality with a right view,  Ambassador Perera said.
In our dealings at the United Nations, and in politics among nations in the present day, right view is a must. If we are to apply the Buddhas teachings on the right view to our dealings, root causes of mutual distrust, hatred, and tensions could be eliminated, saving millions of lives and easing human suffering. As United Nations, this is the message that we must seek to propagate, he said.
The celebrations commenced on May 10 with a mid-day dana offered to 53 Buddhist monks representing Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mongolia and Japan, at the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Rohan Perera, his Thai counterpart Ambassador Virachai Plasai, and Permanent Representatives of Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Cambodia, and Laos along with senior diplomats from Buddhist countries attended the ceremony and offered dana to the Maha Sangha.

WCrypt ransomware wreaks havoc across the globe
Over 57,000 users stranded across 74 countries unable to access their information. The Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL), the apex body for IT professionals in Sri Lanka wishes to alert the public about the newest ransomware to hit the cyberspace, WCrypt, which continues to infect computers across the globe.
The malwares name is WCry, but analysts were also using variants such as WannaCry, WanaCrypt0r, WannaCrypt, or Wana Decrypt0r.
Experts claim the fast-moving wave of cyber-attacks across the globe maybe the result of exploitation of a security flaw exposed in documents leaked from the US National Security Agency.
Ransomware is malicious software (malware) which locks a users files making them inaccessible unless a (usually large) payment is made to the hackers. Although exact figures are not known, the ransom demanded from each infected computer is estimated to range from USD 300 to USD 600.
Whilst the exact list of victims is not known, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, Spanish telecommunications service provider, Telefonica and Russias Interior Ministry have issued statements that they have been infected by the malware.
It has a hunter module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks, U.K.-based security architect Kevin Beaumont told CNN . So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.
The virus is estimated to be spreading at a rate of 5 million emails per hour, primarily targeting computers with Microsoft Windows operating systems. Microsoft has released an official statement informing users to ensure their operating systems have been updated with the Microsoft Patch MS17-010, specifically developed to address this attack. Latest reports claim that the spreading of the malware has been stopped, after a cyber-security analyst accidentally came across a solution. However, this should not be considered a green-light and users should continue to exhibit the same level of awareness and follow security best practices as before.
The Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) advices users to keep their operating systems and anti-virus software updated with the latest patches and definitions. Users should also refrain from opening suspicious emails, especially if they contain attachments as well as from clicking on unknown web links. Users are also strongly advised to take complete backups of their computers as it is the easiest method of recovering files in the unfortunate event that a computer is infected.

World braces for more cyberattacks as work week begins
UK: Governments and computer experts girded Monday for a possible worsening of the global cyberattack that has hit more than 150 countries, as Microsoft warned against stockpiling vulnerabilities like the one at the heart of the crisis.
European policing and security agencies said the fallout from a ransomware attack that has already crippled more than 200,000 computers around the world could deepen as people return for another work week.
The indiscriminate attack began Friday and struck banks, hospitals and government agencies, exploiting known vulnerabilities in older Microsoft computer operating systems.
US package delivery giant FedEx, European car factories, Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica, Britains health service and Germanys Deutsche Bahn rail network were among those hit.
In China, hundreds of thousands of computers at nearly 30,000 institutions and organisations were infected by late Saturday, internet firm 360 Security said.
Government agencies and universities were among those hit as well as petrol stations, ATMs and hospitals, said the firm, one of Chinas leading software security providers.
Europol executive director Rob Wainwright said the situation could worsen on Monday when workers return to their offices after the weekend and log on.
Weve never seen anything like this, the head of the European Unions policing agency told Britains ITV television Sunday, calling its reach unprecedented.
Wainwright described the cyberattack as an escalating threat.
Im worried about how the numbers will continue to grow when people go to work and turn on their machines on Monday, he said. The warning was echoed by Britains National Cyber Security Centre: As a new working week begins it is likely, in the UK and elsewhere, that further cases of ransomware may come to light, possibly at a significant scale.
Ooops message, $300 ransom
The attack looks like this: images appear on victims screens demanding payment of $300 (275 euros) in the virtual currency Bitcoin, saying: Ooops, your files have been encrypted! Payment is demanded within three days or the price is doubled, and if none is received within seven days the locked files will be deleted, according to the screen message.
Bitcoin, the worlds most-used virtual currency, allows anonymous transactions via heavily encrypted codes.
Experts and governments alike warn against ceding to the demands and Wainwright said few victims so far had been paying up.
Security firm Digital Shadows said on Sunday that transactions totalling $32,000 had taken place through Bitcoin addresses used by the ransomware.
The culprits used a digital code believed to have been developed by the US National Security Agency -- and subsequently leaked as part of a document dump, according to researchers at the Moscow-based computer security firm Kaspersky Lab.
A hacking group called Shadow Brokers released the malware in April, claiming to have discovered the flaw from the NSA, Kaspersky said.
Brad Smith, Microsofts president and chief legal officer, said in a blog post Sunday that it was in fact the NSA that developed the code being used in the attack.
He warned governments against stockpiling such vulnerabilities and said instead they should report them to manufacturers -- not sell, store or exploit them, lest they fall into the wrong hands.
An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen, Smith wrote.
The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake up call. The attack is unique, according to Europol, because it combines ransomware with a worm function, meaning once one machine is infected, the entire internal network is scanned and other vulnerable machines are infected.
The attack therefore spread faster than previous, smaller-scale ransomware attacks.
Banks, trains and automobiles
Symantec said the majority of organisations affected were in Europe.
Europols Wainwright said few banks in Europe had been affected, having learned through the painful experience of being the number one target of cyber crime the value of having the latest cyber security in place.
Russias interior ministry said some of its computers had been hit, while the countrys banking system was also attacked, although no problems were detected, as was the railway system.
French carmaker Renault was forced to stop production at sites in France, Slovenia and Romania, while FedEx said it was implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible.
Englands National Health Service said 47 organisations providing care had been hit and on Sunday afternoon seven hospitals were continuing to divert patients from the emergency room. - AFP

Zonal education offices would be increased up to 200: Akila Viraj
By abolishing the existing system of maintaining Divisional Education offices countrywide, only Zonal Education offices would continue functioning in the future. Accordingly, the number of zonal education offices would be increased up to 200. Presently, only 98 zonal education offices are now functioning countrywide, said Kurunegala district UNP parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
Since the expected services and goals are not achieved from divisional education offices, steps would be taken to do away with them, he said.
The minister was addressing the Kurunegala district Coordinating Committee Meeting held recently in Kurunegala.
