Dead girl returns home
A Bandaragama family was put to much anxiety after the daughter whose body they had identified, returned home last week.
The parents had mistakenly identified a body of another young woman as that of their daughter (the complainant), after which the body had been buried at a public cemetry in the Bandaragama area on April 17.
It transpires that Bulathsinhala Police had found the body of a young woman on April 10. The body was taken to the Nagoda Hospital for the inquest at which an elderly couple identified the body as that of their missing daughter.
An open verdict on the body was returned by the Inquirier into Sudden Deaths and the body released to the couple. The burial was at the Bandaragama public cemetery.
After a few days, their missing daughter returned. The parents took her to the Bulathsinhala Police where she made a statement that she had eloped with a young man and had spent few days at a hotel in Nuwara Eliya and returned home.
The police are continuing investigations to find out the identity of the body which had been buried at the Bandaragama cemetery.

Fragments and Figments of success
Fragments and Figments: A Collection of Cultural Essays, written by freelance critic Uditha Devapriya, was launched at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort on April 6. The launch ceremony was a resounding success, with the active participation of several distinguished members of Sri Lankas cultural and literary spheres. Malinda Seneviratne and Dr Dayan Jayatilleka, the Chief Guests of the event, delivered speeches revolving around the author and his work, while veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya delivered the welcome address.
Highlights of the event included the live performance of three popular and old songs, including two from films directed by Sumitra Peries, who was present at the ceremony. The two film songs included the nostalgically successful Ran Tikiri Sina, which marked 40 years since its first recording on March 31 and which was performed that night by its original vocalists, Victor Silva and Nirasha Perera.
Gehenu Lamayine from Periess debut Gehenu Lamayi was also sung, as was Paawe Wala, closing down the curtains on the event. Veteran media personality and announcer Thilaka Ranasinghe and renowned English announcer and artist Lithmal Jayawardhana were the compres for the night.
At the launch ceremony, Ravindra Randeniya highlighted the need to get Sri Lankas artistes and art forms, particularly from the cinema, out to the world in English, pointing out that he and other members of Sri Lankas film industry hoped that this would be the first of many steps to come. Uditha Devapriya in his speech contended that unless the field of criticism is nurtured and maintained well, theres no real way through which those art forms can be conveyed properly to the outside world, observing that the young are key stakeholders in the movement to propagate those art forms and artistes.

Spending Rs. 1 bn on Parliament, a national crime
Spending Rs. 1 billion for the renovation of Parliament, the amount of which is enough to construct 80 udagammana model villages consisting of 2,000 houses is a national crime, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The minister made this observation at the opening ceremony of the 57th model village - Mihindumgama in Kirigangkumbura, Ududumbara, under the governments project to open 2,500 model villages by 2020.
He also said that the people vote once every five years to elect politicians to govern the country on behalf of them.
They do so and elect members to get their issues addressed and not to get suppressed more and more, said Minister Premadasa. I learnt recently that Rs. 1 billion is to be spent for the renovation work of Parliament which seems to me a national crime.
Minister Premadasa said further that such an amount of money is sufficient construct 2,000 houses and that is 80 villages with 25 housing units each. The construction of houses for the poor should be at the top of the list of the development projects in the country and not the renovation of Parliament, Minister Premadasa said.
Such an amount of money at least could be utilised to feed those suffering from malnutrition, provide drinking water to deprived people, grant plots of lands to those who are deprived of land, or provide employment opportunities to the unemployed graduates. We have prepared the development plan by listening to the people.

200 CWealth entrepreneurs at Londons Sri Lanka breakfast meeting
Over 200 Commonwealth entrepreneurs converged to discuss trade and investment opportunities in Sri Lanka in London last week.
According to the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka (DoCSL), commonwealth entrepreneurs converged at Sri Lanka breakfast networking session of Commonwealth Enterprise and Economic Council held on the sides of CHOGM18. The session was jointly facilitated by the Department of Commerce, EDB and Londons Sri Lanka High Commission.
During the opening remarks Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishard Bathiudeen said: We have been provided with a conducive environment to advance greater cooperation among commonwealth countries, as the trade and investment promotion has taken a centre stage in our deliberations on creating a prosperous future for all, particularly with peace and stability in the country.
The declaration on the commonwealth connectivity agenda for trade and investment aims to expand investment and boost intra commonwealth trade through dialogue among commonwealth members in the clusters of physical connectivity digital connectivity regulatory connectivity business to business connectivity and supply side connectivity. The main feature of the breakfast meeting was that the national brand for the Sri Lanka ICT/BPM sector Island of Ingenuity was launched during the event.
Chairman of Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Ruwindhu Peiris, and SLASSCOM Executive Director Chrishan de Mel highlighted availability and access to top engineering talent, creativity, resourcefulness and a collaborative/partner mentality to co-innovate solutions to differentiate Sri Lanka from other locations. Presentations were also made by Rohan Masakorala on Maritime Industry and Boat Building.
The boat building industry is one which can transform the economic landscape of the country since it is linked to vital economic activities that will grow in importance in the decades to come such as fisheries, tourism, offshore oil and gas exploration and export of boats, ships and bunkering. Therefore Sri Lanka welcomes and facilitates investments in this vital area. 
President of the Gem and Jewellery Association of Sri Lanka Imthisham in his presentation highlighted the opportunities in this sector and invited commonwealth members to attend FACETS 2018.
During the Q&A session Ministers Rishard Bathuideen and Mangala Samaraweera spoke of the new investment flexibilities introduced to become a modern trading hub in the Indian Ocean.

The advent of one-day cricket
J.M. Kilburn in his book Overthrows states he was not a committed advocate of one day cricket for first class cricketers.He believed that this popular fancy of the present time to be a contradiction of purpose and inevitably self defeating in its object of attracting spectators to cricket. First class cricketers in his belief needed more than fifty or sixty overs or an hour or two in which to express themselves.
Cricketers of first-class quality needed more scope than the one-day match can offer them. Without scope they couldnt develop their potential or having developed, they cannot maintain the standards of which they are capable. Cricketers who have attained first class level by playing in first class cricket - which is, of course the only way to become first class - will be the most successful one day players; but should the one day form become dominant the first class player will not be developed and county cricket will not rise above club standards, noted Kilburn.
When one day cricket for the counties were first proposed he was lukewarm towards it, fearful of long term consequences of tradition. He saw in the Gillette Cup competition an attractive and useful variation in the summer program, to be ranked in status with the festivals or the old Gentleman v Players fixtures he welcomed it as a parallel to the seven-a-side tournaments in Rugby Union football.
With the institution of the Gillette Cup he hoped for modifications in the county championship program, but he believed then as he believed now, that three day cricket should preserve itself essentially through intrinsic attractions; that it should be first-class not only in name but in presentation.
Kilburn found the one- day form of cricket as offered by first class cricketers unsatisfying mainly because of the inevitable artificial limitations imposed. One day cricket was the appropriate cricket for most of them because it was the cricket of their capabilities and opportunity.Their technique and their temperament would not sustain long innings or long bowling spells. Blessed with advanced skills and discipline they should move into a wider range and given the opportunity they invariably do. The illogicality is moving back again. First class cricket is an extension and development by the gifted few of afternoon cricket attempted and enjoyed by the many, but the quality of the few had to be diminished or disguised in afternoon compression. One-day cricket cannot be a distillation of first class essence it must either be a restriction or a parody. The greater and more complicated the artificialities the more blatant the parody, added Kilburn.
In apparent paradox one-day cricket has provided fewer days to remember than single days of truly first class cricket. Few great innings had been played or could have been played simply because circumstances do not permit them. Even in the occasional big score sustained mastery is not required because the bowling challenge automatically diminishes. It is cricket nonsense to suppose that five bowlers will all be equally testing on one afternoon. It is a cricket contradiction of common sense that bowling authority establish or close upon establishment should have to be relinquished because of over limitation, stressed Kilburn.
The longer one day matches - or more strictly single innings matches - do of course provide occasional hours of rare splendor, occasional achievements to catch the breath in anxiety and admiration. Lancashire contrived such an hour in their famous victory over Gloucestershire at Old Trafford, and Yorkshire made magic in the Gillette Cup Final with Surrey in 1965.
Kilburn vividly recollects that on both those occasions the special quality of the day was influenced by the climatic conditions. Lancashire won when by normal assessment of light they could not see to win. Yorkshire won when all the probabilities were against any play at all.
Yorkshire travelled to London for their final in pouring Friday rain. Harder and harder the evening rain teemed down and arrival at Kings Cross found London awash.
Kilburn went on to add that Saturday brought fair weather and the start of the match was put back no more than an hour and a half.

Another majestic tusker dies
Missaka, the majestic tusker, died last week. So did the Galgamuwa cross tusker a few months ago, and more followed. It is almost hypocritical that we have to produce an article each when a tusker dies due to human actions. The environmentalists are almost tired of suggesting the same proposals and pointing out the same loopholes. Meanwhile the vicious cycle continues.
Missaka who roamed Yala National Park for 35 years, was found severely injured on Sunday, April 15. He had sustained injuries to his jaw and front left leg. According to sources, the tusker was suffering from these injuries for nearly two weeks when it was finally found near Bandu Wewa, close to Kataragama. The officers of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC), including Veterinarian Vijitha Perera and Veterinarian Ananda Dharmakirthi, provided Missaka with medical treatment continuously for four days. However the giant succumbed to sepsis yesterday. Missaka, who possessed three-foot long tusks, was an iconic figure at Yala National Park.
More attacks
Meanwhile, it was reported last Sunday that the young tusker Kuda Wewal Dalaya was shot near the Dambulla, Digampathaha area. The tuskers front leg has been injured by a gunshot. According to sources, five more elephants have been attacked in the same area. These elephants roam this habitat to consume the waste disposed in this area. Elephant conservationists raise concerns over the security of Minneriya Chief Tusker Wijayaba who dwells in the same area.
Environmentalists also renew their fears of an attack against the majestic tusker Mahasen who has been a continuous target of poachers. According to environmentalist Shashikalana Rathwaththa, Mahasen has returned from his absence from populated areas and has started his yearly travel this month. Rathwaththa said that they have continuously requested the DWC to map out the route taken by Mahasen for his yearly journey and provide necessary protection to the animal. He pointed out that Mahasen also needs medical treatment for numerous injuries on his body due to gunshots. However, Rathwaththa says, the Wildlife Department turns a deaf year to their request, as usual. Rathwaththa alleges that the DWC officials are trying to ignore the matter of Mahasens security by attempting to maintain a low profile on the return of Mahasen.
Repeated requests
Environmentalists and elephant conservation activists have repeatedly requested the authorities to set up a proper system to monitor tuskers for a prolonged period of time. Their main argument has been that when the tuskers get injured, the relevant authorities are not immediately notified about the attack. However, up to date there is no proper system applied to monitor the tuskers in the country.
Environmentalist Supun Jayaweera responding to the Daily News said that immediate changes should be introduced to existing elephant conservation policies in Sri Lanka, if the country is to safeguard its remaining tuskers. While pointing out the obvious disappointment in the lethargic attitude held by the authorities to solve the long-festering matter, Jayaweera said that amending the Fauna and Flora Ordinance is of much importance.
Wildlife conservation policies and the law in Sri Lanka need to be updated, Jayaweera said. Final amendment to the Fauna and Flora Ordinance came from Act No. 22 of 2009 and since then the law is yet to be amended. We think that the punishments prescribed by the said ordinance for killing elephants is not proportionate and an increase in the imprisonment period and an increase of prescribed penalty should be introduced. Stringent measures should be taken to conserve elephants and specially the tuskers. Rapid decline of these majestic creatures adversely affects eco-systems and therefore, wildlife protection policies should be drafted with central focus on elephant conservation.
Jayaweera also pointed out that the security provided to tuskers is completely insufficient. The majority of tuskers in SL roam outside of protected areas, he said. These tuskers migrate according to their ancestral corridors and therefore face grave dangers of being poached or killed by farmers. Although legal protection is afforded to these elephants, security measures on the field have not been implemented. We have been urging the authorities to utilise state-of-the-art technology which is available to track and monitor at least iconic tuskers. Since these creatures roam outside prescribed areas, tracking and monitoring is a necessity and ought to be implemented as soon as possible.
Jayaweera also pointed out the absence of progress in the suggestions made for the DWC to introduce radio collars and other hi-tech monitoring systems.
Cheaper and more advanced technology than radio collars exists, Jayaweera added. GPS collars are one such example. We have suggested that the DWC researches the possibilities of using WIPER - Wireless Anti-Poaching Technology, which is armed with ballistic shockwave sensors to identify and recognise gunshots. If we are to protect tuskers of this country, we need to utilise these technologies. Annually, the DWC and the government of Sri Lanka earn money from wildlife tourism and, if so, spending to protect the source from which they earn, should not be an issue if they do want to sustainably use these natural resources.
Jayaweera emphasised the need for efficiently utilising the allocations for wildlife conservation purposes. If we look at the newly drafted Blue - Green budget, the government has allocated a total sum of 245 million rupees for different conservation purposes. The allocated amount is not proportionate to the earnings from wildlife-based tourism. Yet, we do not request more, but the issue here is, do they really take an effort to properly channel these finances to be efficiently used Corruption within the department and ministry leads to a waste of these finances and therefore conservation goals cannot be achieved.
Speaking on the need to strengthen the DWC, Jayaweera said, At the DWC, from labourers to officers, everyone ought to be constantly updated about new threats to wildlife. If they take more time to adapt to such novel situations, there wont be any time left to save what is left of precious fauna and flora. Adaptation is the key for an efficient department. Last week when the second tusker from the Tabbowa sanctuary was shot dead, the acting director of the DWC wasnt aware of the incident until environmentalists informed about the said incident. This illustrates the lack of a well-oiled mechanism within the department. Officers should take the blame for this inefficiency and they should be proactive rather than playing passive roles.
DWC
Meanwhile, DWC Director General M.G.C. Sooriyabandara said that they have launched a special investigation into the death of Missaka. He further said that the evidence collected from the investigation will be produced before the court in the near future. Speaking further on the matter, Sooriyabandara said 50 percent of elephant deaths are caused by human action. Accordingly, he said, the DWCs main target is to deter purposeful killings of these animals. Sooriyabandara further said that a special operation will be launched by the DWC against the persons responsible for such killings. He also said that 200-300 officers will be recruited to the DWC to make the department more efficient. These officers will be given the power to implement the law against the culprits behind elephant killings.
Continuous attempts to contact the New Wildlife Minister Ravindra Samaraweera failed as he was unreachable via the telephone.

Avant Garde Operations Manager refused anticipatory bail
Galle Chief Magistrate A. Nishantha Peiris refused to grant anticipatory bail for Operations Manager of the vessel MV Avant Garde Vessel considering an application made for the purpose.
The ship MV Avant Garde was seized by Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015 for allegedly keeping a floating armoury on board and handed it over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for subsequent investigations. In his bail claim made to the Galle Magistrate Court on April 17, Millaniyage Sumudu Nilupul Costa, Operation Manager of MV Avant Garde had cited Director of Criminal Investigation Department and Attorney General as respondents.
In his submissions he had stated that he had received reliable information to the effect that the Criminal Investigation Department is looking for evidence for his apprehension and had reasonable doubt that he would be arrested and produced in courts with trumped up criminal charges on mere grounds that he was employed in the above capacity attached to the disputed ship.
The lawyers for the applicant further told court that that the claimant was an ex-major of Sri Lanka Army and had become incapacitated in the war and alleged that the Criminal Investigation Department was planning to act arbitrarily and with malicious intentions for political reasons.
Rakna Lanka Ltd which is alleged for maintaining a floating Arms Depot on MV Avant Garde is a state owned institution and it was operated on an agreement with the government and the firm was ready to further cooperate with the subsequent investigations, the applicants lawyers further argued.
The prosecution raising preliminary objections had contested that the charge of illegal possession and transportation of firearm was a criminal offence subject to life imprisonment and according to the Bail Act it was an offence bailable only by a High court.
The State Counsel who told the court that Criminal Investigation Department had made the corresponding submissions under the Firearms Ordinance and pleaded the court to consider over the possibility of granting bail on the matter at the Magistrate court and entreated an order regarding same.
Subsequently the magistrate retained the order for yesterday and pronouncing the same he declined to grant anticipatory bail for the applicant saying that the alleged charges were bailable offences only by a High Court.

Billions in Nepal quake aid misdirected, say experts
NEPAL: Billions of dollars poured into Nepal after a powerful earthquake devastated the country three years ago is being misdirected towards building unnecessary new homes where old ones could have been salvaged, experts warn.
Survivors of the 7.8-magnitude quake that killed nearly 9,000 people in April 2015 are being pushed to construct new buildings they do not need, casting doubt on the efficacy of the governments $9 billion reconstruction effort.
It is proposing the wrong solution for a lot of people, said Noll Tufani, Nepal country director for Build Change, a charity specialising in disaster-proofing.
Building quake-proof homes was a condition of the $4.1 billion pledged to Nepal by international donors under the tagline build back better.
The government identified 708,000 families whose homes had been damaged and set up a $3,000 cash subsidy programme to encourage them to construct homes that would withstand future seismic shocks.
Three years later, just 15 percent have been rebuilt under the $2.1 billion scheme.
The sluggish reconstruction effort has been hit by political infighting, bureaucracy and confusion among quake victims over how to obtain the subsidy.
Many felled their damaged homes to build smaller ones -- often at huge cost -- instead of quake-proofing their mud and brick dwellings by retrofitting them with reinforced beams. Build Change estimates that some 250,000 homes could be salvaged in this way, while another 150,000 rebuilt since the disaster would also need to be retrofitted. Sturdy wooden pillars secure Shekhar Prasad Timilsinas house in Dungkharka, a village 45 kilometres (28 miles) east of Kathmandu, as workers busily mix concrete and bend rods on his porch.
My house did not collapse but suffered cracks after the earthquake. Im glad I did not have to tear it down and could retrofit it, the 69-year-old told AFP.
The National Reconstruction Authority, the government agency overseeing the rebuilding effort, only approved retrofitting midway through last year.
We were unsure what to do earlier. With the grant we could have built only a small house, said Indra Lal Shrestha, a trained retrofitter.
He plans to retrofit his own family home rather than razing it.
We can live like we used to... and are not forced to take on large debts to rebuild, he said. Many villagers live in mud and stone houses two-and-a-half storeys high, with space to house animals and store grain as well as accommodate a large extended family.
But the cost of rebuilding with the money provided is beyond many families.
Meanwhile the government-approved designs for new homes are much smaller, forcing families to adjust farming practices that are the main source of income in rural, impoverished Nepal.
Yub Raj Bhusal, the head of the reconstruction authority, concedes more homes could have benefited from retrofitting.
Retrofitting is important, it should have started earlier, he told AFP.
But now that we have opened doors, we expect there might more people interested to retrofit and retain their original homes. The UK governments Department of International Development (DFID) has committed $7.6 million to a retrofitting project with Build Change.
So far around 50 homes have been completed. The government has earmarked around 25,000 homes for retrofitting but DFID and Build Change say more could be done.
Rebuilding has picked up. The government says it is on target to complete reconstruction by 2020, but faces an estimated $1 billion shortfall for rebuilding homes alone.- AFP

Blue  eyeshadow  is 2018s  boldest  beauty trend yet
While the colour blue has been there in the world of make-up for ages, it has now emerged as the boldest trend of 2018 Spring Summer season.
Despite being present in 2017 as well, it looks like the trend is here to stay, according to The Independent.
And here is the key to wear it with sass - forget blending, wear your shade in bold shapes for a graphic look.
The inspiration came from Spring/Summer shows, where veteran makeup artist Pat McGrath used graphic shapes of blue, Tom Pecheux added a flair of metallic blue on models lids for Chanel, House of Holland used cobalt shade of liquid eyeliner.
The best part of the trend is that it requires little to no skills. You can simply smear the colour on your lids. You can even experiment with blue mascara to have that perfect tint in your look.

BOC records Rs. 54 bn ATM/CDM transactions during Avurudu
Bank of Ceylon yet again set a record during Avurudu Season with over Rs. 54 billion worth transactions taking place in BOCs very own CDM and ATM terminals.
Having a fully operational ATM/CDM network with over 930 machines covering the entire country, BOC has provided customers utmost convenience and easy access to cash for their immediate cash requirements during Avurudu.
Through the Banks ATM network alone BOC has dispensed over Rs.36 Billion for 13 days period between to April 1 to 13 which is the highest amount dispensed through BOC ATM network. The Bank has installed over 160 Cash Deposit Machines (CDMs) covering every strategic point throughout the country enabling BOC customers to deposit money into their accounts on real time 24 hours a day.
These CDMs have accepted highest amount recorded at over Rs.18 billion in cash during the same period. The highest amount in transactions made on the ATM network was recorded on 10th and 11th April 2018 which was over Rs.4.8 billion and Rs.4.3 billion respectively.
During these period deposits that were made to banks CDM network was over Rs.2.0 billion and Rs.1.9 billion respectively. Total Number of ATM and CDM transactions were recorded as 3.6 million during 13 days period.
BOC ATM/CDM network of more than 930 machines covers every hotspot in the country and this has led to the increase in usage of these service points among general public. The Bank is currently in the process of expanding its digital customer touch points strategically.
So far the pilot BOC-DIGI in Kandy City Center has created quite a buzz within the City and records an impressive number of transactions every day which shows the customer confidence gained within the short period since its opening.
Apart from the benefit of the cash withdrawal facility from the ATM, through the CDM customers can instantly deposit cash straight into their BOC account that gets credited on real time without an additional charge. Unlike many cash deposit machines which require money to be fed into the machine note by note or be inserted into an envelope, this machine allows customers to place a total bundle of 200 notes in a mix of any denomination in a single transaction.
This machine also accepts cardless deposits made using ATM cards or fund transfers made by simply keying debit account and the credit account numbers as per instructions displayed on the CDMs graphic screen.
Stretching the convenience of 24 hour banking to every nook and corner of the country, as a part of digital transformation, the Bank of Ceylon has become the largest single network connected to Lankapay common ATM platform in the country with over 770 of BOCs own ATMs.

Catholic Church is totally against abortion - Malcom Cardinal Ranjith
Every unborn child has a potential to be a saint and the Catholic Church is totally against abortion under any circumstances," Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcom Cardinal Ranjith
The Archbishop gave these remarks at an awareness program in legalising abortion in Sri Lanka organised by the Sri Lanka Catholic Doctors Association.
"We cannot be diplomatic when it comes to the topic of abortion. The Catholic Church is firmly against it. We have to find ways to solve this issue and as I see it, adoption is the best alternative," the Cardinal said.
"Some media outlets advertise the adoption of animals and its a pity that we dont at least try to do the same for babies," he further said.
Rt.Rev.Dr.Emmanuel Fernando spoke on the christrian moral theology relating to abortion and Rev.Fr.Dilan Fernando linked abortion with the philosophical teachings of the Catholic Church.
Specialist doctor Dr.Maxie Fernandopulle and Specialist Gynaecologist Dr.Romanie Fernando also addressed the gathering held at Caritas Sri Lanka.
"Life begins at conception. Conception is the instance where the sperm reaches the fallopian tube of a woman and from that instance a new human beign comes into existence. Aborting it would be the same as murder," Dr.Fernandopulle said.
"Around 1,000 abortions are done in Sri Lanka per day," Dr.Fernandopulle said.
Dr.Romanie Fernando stressed the importance of Christian participation in voicing against abortion.
She further explained the recent developments of the field in an international scale.
Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith concluded the proceedings by quoting Psalms 139 from the Holy Bible.
"This passage shows the strong connection between a mother and an unborn child which is the ultimate relationship between any two individuals," the Cardinal added.

Champions Essex defeat Lancashire
LONDON, Sunday: Defending champions Essex claimed their first success of the new season by bowling out Lancashire for 288 to win by 31 runs on day three of the English County Championship match played at Chelmsford on Sunday.
Chasing a target of 320, the visitors lost openers Haseeb Hameed and Keaton Jennings with only 32 on the board.
Alex Davies (71) and Jordan Clark (59) batted well, but both were leg-before to pace bowler Jamie Porter. And he ended the game by removing Joe Mennie for 56 to finish with 4-54 and match figures of 9-80.
Somerset made a winning start to their County Championship campaign by beating Worcestershire by 83 runs at Taunton.
They failed to add to their overnight 255-9 as Ed Barnard (6-37) bowled Tim Groenewald, leaving James Hildreth unbeaten on 111.
Set 279 to win, Worcestershire lost early wickets and despite Tom Fells 41, they went into lunch on 85-6.
The tailenders added 74 for the last two wickets, with Barnard making 45 not out, but they were all out for 195.
A run-out ended the game with more than four sessions to spare as Barnard called Steve Magoffin for a second run and he was beaten by Matt Renshaws throw to the bowlers end.
Worcestershire have begun the summer with back-to-back defeats following promotion from Division Two last season.
Yorkshire impressed with the bat and ball to put themselves on course to beat Nottinghamshire at Headingley.
After rain wiped out much of the first session, Harry Gurney took three quick wickets, including Gary Ballance (82), as Yorkshire fell from 189-4 to 204-7.
But Tim Bresnan (68 not out) and Ben Coad (33) put on 77 for the final wicket to set a target of 403.
Coad (4-55) was the pick of Yorkshires bowlers as Nottinghamshire struggled to 181-8 at stumps.
Ollie Pope struck a wonderful 145 as Surrey pushed on to set Hampshire 472 runs to win on day three at the Oval.
Pope hit 18 fours and one six in his 191-ball innings as Surrey progressed from 217-4 to declare on 407-9.
The 20-year-old shared a 131-run stand with Ben Foakes (81) as the hosts piled on the runs before declaring when Pope was caught five runs shy of 150. Off-spinner Amar Virdi (2-26) took two wickets in an over as Hampshire closed on 116-4, still 355 runs behind.
Surrey will return on day four needing six wickets to wrap up a victory in their first Division One match of the season.

Australian pace bowler Ryan Sidebottom took 4-61 for match figures of 10-96 as the home side were bowled out for 218. It is the first time the 28-year-old has taken 10 wickets in a game in his relatively short first-class career.

Their total was the highest they have achieved in four Championship innings so far this summer, having been dismissed for only 71 and 142 by Middlesex last week.
Derbyshire closed on victory against Middlesex after a dominant performance with the bat on day three.
The hosts made easy progress after resuming on 118-0 against a Middlesex attack minus Toby Roland-Jones (sore back) and James Harris (side). Ben Slater was caught off Ollie Rayner for 99, but Luis Reeces unbeaten 157 helped his side declare on 333-3.

According to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted by the Census and Statistics Department in 2016, short stature and stunting which result from long-standing undernutrition in children under five years is only 17 percent, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said in a statement.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, when compared with the recent data from other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka has reported the lowest prevalence of short stature. According to WHO cut off levels, Sri Lanka is considered as a low prevalence country with regard to short stature since Sri Lanka's figure is less than 20 percent.
Dr. Jasinghe pointed out in his statement that according to the same survey, wasting, which results from acute undernutrition, is 15 percent in Sri Lanka. Undernutrition has already been recognized by the Health Ministry as a public health problem. The Health Ministry is currently focusing on further improving the coverage and the quality of several interventions in progress to address the issue.
Activities are underway in collaboration with other line Ministries in implementing related interventions which could help to improve the nutrition status.
The recent Food and Agriculture Organization Report is not a measure of malnutrition but a measuring of undernourishment, he stated.

Chulananda admits to issuing passport despite discrepancies
Giving evidence in connection with two cases filed against National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansas wife, Shashi Weerawansa, former Immigration and Emigration Controller Chulananda Perera admitted in court that he had decided to issue a diplomatic passport to Shashi Weerawansa without taking legal action against her for submitting false information to obtain a passport.
The CID had filed two charge sheets against Shashi Weerawansa, that she had fraudulently obtained two passports including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Department of Immigration and Emigration.
The witness, Chulananda Perera who is currently serving as a Southern Development State Ministry secretary, admitted in court that he gave his approval to issue the diplomatic passport without taking legal action against Weerawansa for obtaining a passport by submitting forged documents.
The evidence was led by Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris in the presence of Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
The witness said he received a telephone call from the then Cabinet Minister Wimal Weerawansa, that his wife would come to his office to discuss about obtaining a diplomatic passport. She told me she needed a diplomatic passport.
She said her previous passport had been issued in 2004, but there were issues with her birthday and name. She accepted that the facts presented regarding her previous passport, were incorrect. She said since her brother had involved in hurling a hand grenade in Parliament in 1987, she and her family had to face difficulties. I asked her to provide new documents, the witness said.
Responding to a query made by DSG Peiris, the witness said in her first application to obtain a general passport, Weerawansa had indicated that she was born in 1967. When she submitted an application to obtain a diplomatic passport in 2010, she indicated that she was born in 1971.
DSG: Why did you issue a diplomatic passport despite the presence of discrepancies between the two passport applications
Witness: I decided to issue it on humanitarian grounds, taking her confession into consideration.DSG Peiris: Did your department attach her previous passport to the diplomatic passport
Witness: No. DSG Peiris: Why
Witness: The first one had been issued on false information.
DSG Peiris: Do you not consider it an offence
Witness: Yes, legally, it is an offence. I should have complained to the CID for an inquiry, but I did not take any action.
The case was fixed for further trial on June 8. The witness is to be cross-examined on the next trial date.
On a previous occasion, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had filed a charge sheet against Shashi Weerawansa under two counts.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested on February, 2015, over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passports illegally. She had allegedly submitted a birth certificate with forged names and dates of birth in order to obtain the said passports. She is currently out on bail. Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appeared for the prosecution. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appeared for the accused.

The 9 As, a real indicator of intelligence
The recently released G.C.E (O/L) results, countrywide, made everyone happy. Surprisingly, according to a recent news report almost 14,000 students, from the leading schools of all the parts of Sri Lanka, obtained 9 A passes, which made every student and parent euphoric. The question is whether this achievement is the result of real intelligence or mere information gathering. Earlier days, in 80s, getting eight distinctions was a Himalayan task and a rare happening. Only a handful of students got all the subjects distinction island-wide.
Afraid to say, at present, whether the standard of evaluation has come down or the rate of rote learning by heart has escalated or the standard of real learning has gone up. If the first two are the reasons, seriously, our students overestimate themselves and have overconfidence in their ability once they have achieved 9 As. This leads them to choose the A/L stream in which they are not capable enough or not interested in and continue to be low and passive in the A/L education. Consequently, but disappointingly, many of them failed to score such good results in their A/L examination and even fail to get minimum eligibility to enter the university because of their superciliousness and indecisiveness.
Further, our students and parents have the illusion that when you get 9 As only, you can become doctors and engineers. One of my friends, from an average middle-class family, studied in her mother tongue Sinhala got 5 Ds and 3Cs and entered the University of Moratuwa at the first attempt and has class in electrical and electronic engineering. She got a scholarship to a recognized University in London for her PhD in robotics. Now, she is a leading academic and a researcher at the leading University in the UK. However, she is really worried that though her nephew got 9As, he depends on his parents for carrying out the routine activities he is supposed to perform on his own at his age. She opines that our teens always need their parents to fulfil their complementary needs such as preparing a cup of tea or making an omelette. So, no matter what the students results in his/ her O/L, he or she should have to have the knowledge and intelligence to compete and fit into the 21st century in a pragmatic sense.
Personally, I feel students run from pillar to post to the tuition without a break. This results in losing or neglecting their health. Sadly, the students have got A grade for English without the practical ability for reading a piece of article and composing a creative writing in their own. They are not able to communicate confidently with people successfully. Students should be trained to survive independently in real life, whereas, students of the Western countries do so.
Therefore, it is mandatory to revise the syllabus to include more student-centred learning activities and outcome-based education and evaluate and allocate marks for these activities of practical applications. Finally, my message is not to discourage the students with 9As but to encourage the students with average results who can also do wonders in the A/L and at the universities, no doubt at all.

Court permits Public Trustee to open 252 last wills
The Colombo District Court yesterday permitted the Public Trustees Department to open 252 last wills pertaining to the colossal amount of wealth which were under the Public Trustees supervision. The documents pertaining to concerned last wills were yesterday produced before court by the Public Trustee. Colombo Additional District Judge Chamath Madanayaka made this order pursuant to a request made by incumbent Public Trustee Sanath Weeratne.
In his application, the Public Trustee informed court that persons who bequeathed their last wills in the custody of the Public Trustee between 1932 and 1992 have to be opened to fulfill their wishes.
The plaintiff stated that former public trustees have not taken action regarding these last wills. He requested that they be opened under District Court supervision.
Presidents Counsel Ikram Mohammed appearing for Weeratne had informed court that the amount of wealth in possession of those last wills could exceed one billion rupees.
The last will is a document by which a living person states the manner in which his property should be handled and by whom such property should be inherited after his death.
Further court inquiry fixed for April 28.

The Buddhasasna Ministry and the Buddhist Affairs Department had jointly decided to enforce special rules on dansel organisers countrywide.
Accordingly, Buddhasana Minister and Kurunegala District United National Party Parliamentarian Gamini Jayawickrama Perera had instructed ministry officials to introduce six new guidelines.
Certain individuals posing as office-bearers of leading Buddhist organisations, had been discovered collecting funds from the public to organise dansel and other Buddhist welfare activities.
According to the new rules, all dansel organisers mus obtain the approval of the incumbent of their respective Buddhist temple and the Grama Niladhari of their respective towns.
They are also prohibited from using loud music or loudspeakers, Minister Jayawickrama Perera told the Daily News at a media conference that was held yesterday at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya, where the state Vesak festival is to be held on April 29.
The Buddhist flag should not be used to halt passers-by and invite them to partake in dansel. Dansel organisers are to refrain from liquor consumption and smoking at all times, he added.

It was a huge ad in the newspaper, not just a page, but two; it showed pictures and prices of scores of items that were going at a discount. There were beard trimmers going at two hundred and forty nine bucks, vegetable cutting machines for less than five hundred, air-conditioners going dirt cheap, they said, T-shirts at one ninety nine, and cricket bats starting at two fifty!
Spectacular I thought to myself! Its a real deal, said my greedy, bargaining mind.
Youve got every one of them! whispered my common sense.
Yes, I had all of them, most in working condition, except the beard trimmer which needed a new set of batteries, and what I didnt have I didnt need!
I mean I dont think Id be able to do much more to my face with the face massager offered at two hundred and fifty, and how many more almonds would I be able to eat, even if they were from California, as the ad said, before I would hear my wife grumble I ate too much between meals, and thats why I was so skinny!
Yet, I stared at the ad again and again, wondering why I shouldnt take part in the lucrative deals, deals and deals offered.
The other day Id seen a neighbor placing some sofas and dining chairs on his terrace. They seem good! I said. The wifes fed up with them! he said. Are they broken I asked. Theyre out of fashion! he said.

I looked at the poor chairs as they stared back at me, Thrown out because of a bonus! they seemed to cry.
A few years ago, I was at an American museum where I read a document by Benjamin Franklin in which he called on the American people to build a nation, using hard work and thrift!

I remember walking into the house of an old couple, whos son in the US was an eminent doctor, and whod asked me to visit his parents in Sri Lanka. You live a very spartan existence! I said looking round their sitting room in surprise.
Were more than happy! said the father, And maybe the money weve saved on the unnecessary helped us fund our sons studies! He or we, have no loans to repay!
I turn away from the beard trimmer and vegetable grinding machine seductively glancing at me; quite a bargain what But I know will destroy my peace of mind, later!

A decade after the war, Sri Lanka dives into luxury
In 2004, businessman Malik Fernando bought Castlereagh, a decrepit bungalow in the terraced, emerald hills of Sri Lankas sprawling tea country. The structure had no roof. It was in absolute shambles, he recalls. There were cattle roaming through the whole house.
But it had one irresistible asset: It was what was available, he says, shrugging and welcoming me to the neat, gingerbread-style mansion on a clear, 80F winter day. That was enough to make it the perfect place for the areas first luxury hotel.
When Fernando closed 13 years ago on Castlereagh, the government was in a ceasefire with the LTTE, and optimism was in the air. He saw an opportunity to cater to fans of his familys burgeoning tea farms, who were flocking here from around the world. It took him a year to update the colonial ruin, named after a long-ago tea picker who lived there, into a parquet-floored paradise with five bedrooms and a fleet of butlers in sarongs servicing a hillside pool. Over the next year, he did the same thing with three more bungalows, giving each a different style, its own restaurant, and rooms facing the tea plantations. Then the ceasefire ended.
Standing with Fernando in front of Castlereagh, with its lakefront views and blooming purple gardens, its hard to reconcile that it was just a decade ago that Sri Lankans hid for cover from daily bomb threats. But locals remember it like it was yesterday.
Fernando harbours memories of bomb warnings arriving during dinner, planes getting blown up at airports, and a constant current of fear for his wife and children. Serving jasmine-scented gin and tonics to tourists was a bit beside the point.
But he was among the lucky few business owners who could afford to hang on until better days, thanks to his familys tea empire, Dilmah. So he welcomed a trickle of visitors to what is now a 27-room resort complex he calls Ceylon Tea Trails - and waited for change.
'Resplendent Ceylon'
Today, Fernandos hotel company, Resplendent Ceylon, stretches from inland tea country to the palm-fringed beaches on the islands southwestern shore. Castlereagh remains the heart of it all: a place where lazy lunches can consist of finger-size prawns and single-estate silver-tip tea that sells for $1,000 per kilo, and where the perpetually sold-out hotel rooms start at $675 a night.
Excess isnt the intention. Rewriting Sri Lankas narrative and casting a global spotlight on the countrys assets - cultural, natural, and agricultural - is. There is a tremendous upside in doing so: countrywide, the number of visitors has jumped from fewer than 450,000 in 2009 to more than 2 million in 2016. But with the luxury hotel industry in its infancy, the bulk of tourists traditionally have been backpackers at surf shacks. Sri Lanka is poised to welcome a wider audience.
Fernando, 52, had picked up my sister Jenifer and me in a seaplane in Colombo. When we land in tea country, he escorts us through what he jokingly calls the CIA: Castlereagh International Airport, whose runway is a reservoir. Staffers wait at the end of a wooden pier to gather our luggage.
The unevenly paved, single-lane road to the resort passes packed terraces of Camellia sinensis bushes, crumbling 19th century colonial buildings, and rickety tuk-tuks that grant our van right of way. The road surveys the land that made Fernandos family famous: His father, Merrill, created Sri Lankas first fair-trade tea company in 1988. Today, Dilmah sells in more than 100 countries worldwide. Its mission, then and now, has been to grow and package pure Ceylon tea at the source. (The company dramatically prunes the 140-year-old plants every few years, then manually harvests individual leaves every five to seven days.) Rather than blend small amounts of Ceylon with cheaper varieties from other countries, as its competitors do, Dilmah works only with Sri Lankas prized crop. That means its talent and profits are fully retained within the country.
During the war, tea exports held steady, and to this day the industry remains a critical part of the economy, directly employing 1 million Sri Lankans (25,000 work for Dilmah alone). From a GDP perspective, though, tea isnt as important as it used to be, Fernando says. Tea has accounted for 2 percent of the countrys gross domestic product for years; as of 2017, tourism claims 5 percent. In other words, tea allowed the country to survive, but tourism is helping it thrive.
Tea, sea, and safari
Halfway up the road to Tientsin Bungalow, a squad of grinning young townsmen bursts from around a bend in the road, some dressed in plaid button-downs and some in sarongs, singing and hoisting a float covered in a rainbow of flowers, tinsel, and embroidery. Inside is a gilded figurine of Surya, the Hindu sun god. Behind the men, more people spill out, singing and dancing for the Pongal harvest festival. We wait for them to pass. You cant rush things here, Fernando tells us. You just have to slow down and enjoy the ride.
Fernando has just brought his hotel companys head count to 450 with his latest endeavour, Wild Coast Tented Lodge, on Sri Lankas southeastern tip. It opened in November with 28 spaceship-like suites on stilts, set between Yala National Park, a haven for endangered leopards, and towering sand dunes that frame the Indian Ocean. After Tea Trails and a beach resort near Galle, Wild Coast is Resplendent Ceylons third property; taken together, the circuit gets a jingle-ready tag line: Tea, sea, and safari.
Although its resorts share the same attention to detail as the best properties in the world, what distinguishes Resplendent Ceylon from, say, the Aman resorts on Sri Lankas beaches is a commitment to giving back: Fernandos operation is set up to funnel profits to MJF Charitable Foundation and Dilmah Conservation, his familys nonprofits. Together, they support more than 120 conservation and community projects across the island.
MJF itself is the largest private foundation in Sri Lanka. It contributes to entrepreneur mentorships, sustainable agriculture programmes, and a culinary school for disadvantaged youth - initiatives that earned Fernandos father the prestigious Business for Peace Award, an annual prize granted by previous Nobel laureates. By 2020, MJF estimates it will have had an impact on 200,000 lives across the country.
Much of that is thanks to Fernando himself, who acts as a trustee at MJF and imbues his hotels with its ethos. Near Tea Trails, MJF operates a childrens day care and a wellness clinic; its nature-focused counterpart, Dilmah Conservation, is creating a wildlife research station at Wild Coast where Sri Lankan scientists can compare findings and produce policy papers to inform future legislation.
Guests may not even realize that 10 percent of Resplendent Ceylons profits go back into Fernandos initiatives. But that philanthropy is one thing that appeals to Philippe Gombert, president of Relais & Chteaux, the independent hotel group to which Fernandos resorts belong. A commitment to the local community is one of the stronger pillars of the Relais & Chteaux brand, he says. Fernandos engagement, he adds, is among the best hes seen.
The next day we hop on a seaplane for a half-hours flight down to the safari-style Wild Coast Lodge and watch the rippling landscape flatten along the way. Upon arrival, were ushered into a dramatic, arching pavilion made from thatched bamboo that opens to the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean. Our villa is a futuristic bubble, stitched in undulating waves from PVC-coated polyester and featuring oversize portholes that overlook the jungle. Outside, theres a private plunge pool. That night, we dine on Sri Lankan shrimp curry, stewed okra, and lentil dal at a moonlit table in the sand.
On 2,000 acres between the property and nearby Yala, Fernando wants to establish his most ambitious initiative: a private wilderness reserve, like those dotting Africa. Its set to open next year and would help reduce congestion in the national park - which can see jungle jams of 50 Jeeps swiveling madly toward a single animal - while giving wildlife more protected room to roam.
Yala may be one of the worlds best places to see leopards, but because of overcrowding, the staff at Wild Coast varies the expeditions. Along with a chef we go to a market in the tiny town of Kirinda on a muddy dock where fishermen unload king mackerel, marlin, and enormous jackfish from colorful boats. Locals - mostly men, with a smattering of women and children - shout prices at the vendors before swapping cash and loading up motorbikes. We choose a moderate-size halibut for lunch and throw it onto an ancient scale. It costs about $2, and the chef serves it steamed in a banana leaf with a dizzying array of local salads a few hours later.
When we finally head to Yala, its with Chandika Jayaratne, an environmental lawyer who switched careers when luxury tourism made guiding a sufficiently lucrative career path. Job creation is one of the biggest benefits of tourism growth in Sri Lanka, says Tiffany Misrahi, who focuses on travel and tourism at the World Economic Forum. According to her research, it takes only 30 first-time visitors to the country to create one job for a local. This can slow the trend of young adults leaving their hometown for Colombo or Dubai.
Jayaratne adeptly picks out the page-flipping sound of peacocks mating, identifies birdlife -jungle fowl, bee eaters, striped painted storks - and schools us on the areas quirky geology, including massive boulders with evocative names such as Darth Vader Rock (it looks like its wearing a helmet).
My success is my country
To avoid gridlock in the bush, he takes us to a relatively quiet part of the park an hour away from the lodge. Within moments of arriving, I hear a squawk and an angry series of snorts. Jayaratne floors the gas pedal to lurch the car forward through a dense, tangled forest.
As we swerve down the narrow dirt road, a herd of buffalo charges loudly in our direction, angrily frothing up a shallow pond. From their midst, a leopard darts out, leaping into a bristly bush. I see only the flash of her spotted hide, and then its nothing but gnarled horns smashing into the greenery. This is an apex predator with plenty to lose. Estimates indicate that there are only 250 leopards in all of Yala, and theyre a main draw for tourists to the entire region.
Please get out, please get out, please get out, Jayaratne whispers to the cat, until finally she catapults herself out of the bush and onto a tree in a streak of spots. Eventually a lightly injured buffalo calf emerges from within the pack, and we piece together the drama. They were both lucky to get out alive, he says.
By the time I plan my next trip to Sri Lanka - and I will definitely return - its likely that Fernando will have brought his circuit to five hotels or more. Up next is a property he wants to build on pylons in the shadow of Sigiriya. That will be followed by a Robinson Crusoe-inspired beach resort in Trincomalee. He estimates that within three years, Resplendent Ceylon will employ 800 Sri Lankans. Thats nowhere near the size of Dilmahs workforce, but its certainly significant.
Were flying the flag for Sri Lanka the same way my family has at Dilmah over the years, Fernando says. In tourism as in tea, its all about the positioning, the packaging, and the pricing. My success is my country, he says, and its time to stop underselling it.

Duchess of Cambridge gives birth to baby boy

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, the wife ofPrince William, gave birth to the couple's third child on Monday, a son who becomes the fifth in line to the British throne.
The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth, at 11 a.m. local time at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, Kensington Palace said.
Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge depart the Lindo Wing with their newborn son.
The newest arrival to the royal family weighs 8lbs 7oz (3.8 kilograms), and both mother and baby are "doing well," according to the Palace.
"The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news," Kensington Palace said in a statement on Twitter.
William, dressed in a navy suit and pale blue shirt, drove his family home, with Catherine sitting in the back with the baby.
Prince William had left the hospital for a short time Monday afternoon, before returning with his other children George, 4, and Charlotte, 2. As the three royals entered the hospital, Charlotte waved over her shoulder at the reporters gathered on the other side of the street.
In a statement, Kensington Palace said: "Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank all staff at the hospital for the care and treatment they have received," read the statement.
The statement continued: "They would also like to thank everyone for their warm wishes."
A golden easel bearing a framed notice announcing the birth was placed on display in front of Buckingham Palace on Monday afternoon. The bulletin will be on display for approximately 24 hours.
The practice of posting a bulletin on the occasion of a royal birth goes back to at least 1837, when Buckingham Palace became the British monarch's official residence.
The royal baby is fifth in line to the British throne, after grandfather Prince Charles, father Prince William and two siblings.
The newest addition to the royal family is a younger brother to Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, and the Queen Elizabeth II's sixth great-grandchild.
Prince George was born at the Lindo Wing in 2013, and Princess Charlotte in 2015. Their father William was also born at the same facility.
The Duchess' pregnancy was announced in September. At the time, she was said to be suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy. The Duchess was affected by the same condition during her two previous pregnancies.
As her symptoms eased she returned to public engagements, making appearances alongside William, Harry and his fiancee, Meghan Markle.
The birth comes justweeks before the wedding ofHarry and Markleat St. George's Chapel in Windsor on May 19.
William and Kate will mark their own seventh wedding anniversary on April 29.
The news of a royal birth is traditionally announced on a gilded easel placed outside Buckingham Palace. Large crowds gathered outside in July 2013 to see the announcement of the arrival ofWilliam and Kate's first child.
The couple announced his name,George Alexander Louis, and that of their daughter,Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, a couple of days after each was born.
Amongbookmakers' favored namesfor the couple's third child are Arthur, Albert and Frederick.
The new baby was not the only royal child to make history Monday.
The birth of the new prince was also a significant moment for Charlotte, the first princess who will not be overtaken in the line of succession by her younger brother.
Before the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the newborn prince would have jumped above his older sister in the line for the throne.
But the act means that a female's claim to the royal throne can no longer be diminished by a younger brother.

DUTCHESS GIVES BIRTH TO BABY BOY
Kate, the wife of Prince William, gave birth to a baby son on Monday, the couple's third child who is fifth in line to the British throne.
The boy, weighing eight pounds and seven ounces (3.8 kilogrammes), was born at 11:01am (1001 GMT), Kensington Palace announced.
Mother and baby are both doing well, the palace said, and William, the Duke of Cambridge, was present for the birth.
The baby is the couple's third child, after Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
Queen Elizabeth II, William's father Prince Charles, and his brother Prince Harry were said to be delighted with the news. Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son at 11:01 hours, the palace announced in its brief statement.
Kate, 36, was admitted early Monday to the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in central London, where four-year-old George, and Charlotte, aged two, were born.
Royal fanatics, who had been camped outside the hospital wing for several days in anticipation, jumped for joy and popped open champagne.
We're going to celebrate with fish and chips! said John Loughrey, who was wearing a Union Jack hat and clutching a plastic doll with a crown.
Maria Scott, 46, a housewife from Newcastle in northeast England, has been in place for 15 days.
It's really important to show support because they need to know how much they are loved by the people, she told AFP.
We're very proud of our monarchy. Tony Appleton, a town-crier dressed in a flamboyant red uniform, announced the news from the steps of the hospital's Lindo Wing to a crowd of supporters and media.
The baby was born on St. George's Day, England's national day.
The baby boy is a sixth great-grandchild for Queen Elizabeth, who turned 92 on Saturday, and her husband Prince Philip.
It will hold the title of prince after Queen Elizabeth changed the rules in 2012 to ensure that all of William's children would be entitled to the style, not just his eldest son.
As with their two previous children, the royal couple did not know whether the baby was going to be a boy or a girl.
Bookmakers have Arthur, Albert, Frederick, James and Philip as their favourites for the young prince's name.
The boy does not overtake Charlotte in the line of succession due to new laws agreed across the 16 Commonwealth realms where Queen Elizabeth is the head of state, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Under the law, designed to end male primogeniture for William's children, boys born after October 28, 2011 cannot overtake their elder sisters.
A night at the Lindo Wing costs 7,500 ($10,500, 8,550 euros), including a delivery package and two-room suite, excluding consultants' fees.
The birth was overseen by consultant obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who is the surgeon gynaecologist to the royal household, and consultant gynaecologist Alan Farthing, the Queen's surgeon-gynaecologist.
They were part of the trusted team who also delivered George and Charlotte. The duchess suffered severe morning sickness during all three pregnancies. - AFP

The Jungle Bunch
Fairly tame!
At first glance the theme of the movie feels quite familiar. The coming of age of the protagonist who beats the odds to emerge as the underdog has been a popular theme in many animated movies of recent times. However what keeps David Alauxs The Jungle Bunch apart from the rest is its odd combination of characters.
This unusual mixture of roles is probably the only interesting aspect in the film. The story focuses on Maurice, a penguin who has been raised by a fierce tigress, Natasha. Trying hard to follow his surrogate mothers footsteps Maurice put together a team who call themselves The Jungle Bunch with the goal of maintaining the law and order of the jungle. Enter Igor, an evil koala, who intends to destroy the jungle. With his army of clumsy baboons and a crab for a sidekick, Igor develops some mushroom boms which will set the place ablaze. He captures Natasha and her comrade a rhinoceros named Goliath and holds them prisoners. Now it is up to Murice and his gang to save the day and out a stop to Igor and his plans.
The film is an adaptation from the popular kids TV series.
Though many animation characters capture the hearts of viewers for their visual cuteness this is not the case in Alauxs production. Even the animated works annoy rather then allure the beholders as the characters seem overconfident in their actions when they make lame attempts at trying to become saviours of the jungle.
No doubt this storyline reminds animation film enthusiasts of works like Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda.
The viewers sense of imagination is rather limited too because everything is cut and dried and handed out on a platter.
There is hardly any suspense in the manner that the story flows.
Slightly confusing, silly and lame, The Jungle Bunch is best suited for tiny tots. However for the older and mature audience this will surely be a bore.
The Jungle Bunch is screening at Majestic Cineplex, Colombo.

Fashion piece that never goes out of style
As far as versatility goes, there arent many clothing items that can contest with a good denim jacket. From cowboys in the early 20th century to urban commuters and Hollywood stars, the denim jacket makes for a durable yet a timelessly fashionable companion for everyone.
And as far as denims go, Levis has forged a cult like image among consumers. Being the pioneer of the modern age copper-riveted jeans, the German immigrant-Levi Strauss founded company has been in the business since 1853.
One of the most timeless of all denim jackets is the Levis Trucker Jacket, which has been an indispensible wardrobe essential for stars and fashion-heads alike for years. Just look at Emily Ratajkowskis casual airport appearance, or Lily Aldridges recent denim jacket-styled look, as recorded by People, the jacket has been like an eternal go-to for the glam girls, fit for any occasion.
This is Us star, Milo Ventimiglia rocked his trucker jacket with a chambray shirt and navy pants, totaling in a neat look, proving that the denim jacket isnt restricted to be rocked by just the women of Hollywood.

Former motor sports champ and veteran journalist Reggie Fernando dies at 90
Former Sri Lanka motor cycling champion and veteran journalist P Reginald Reggie Fernando passed away after a brief illness yesterday morning at Delmon Hospital, Wellawatte aged 90.
Reggie as he was popularly known in the motor sports world raced with the champions and won many laurels in the field of motor sports during the fifties and sixties.
One of his contemporary riders was the ever popular champion Rajah Sinnathuray who raced with him on many occasions.
I knew Reggie as a fellow rider he used to ride a Tiger 100 motorbike at the races conducted by Ceylon Motor Cycle Club. He raced with the likes of the Deen brothers Rally and Zacky and was a member of the Ceylon Motor Cycle Club. He worked at Ceylon Insurance before migrating to the UK where he made a successful career, said Sinnathuray.
While still racing Reggie commenced his career in journalism in 1953 writing for the Lake House publications Evening Observer and the Sunday Observer. In 1960 he was dispatched to the UK as the London Correspondent.
He was the first working journalist to be appointed to a diplomatic post when he took over the Press Attach's seat at the Sri Lanka Embassy in Sweden (Stockholm) overlooking Denmark, Finland and Norway in the 1980s.
He was also the only journalist to represent Sri Lanka at the United Nations (UN) as a member of the Sri Lanka delegation (only six delegates) to the 37th Annual sessions.
Once settled in the UK Reggie continued in the field of journalism by commencing a daily paper of his own named Newslanka that brought to Lankan expatriates in the UK a daily update of all the news happening back at home. It became a very popular paper and was distributed free the profits being made through advertisers.
Reggie ran the newspapers for over fifty years before he finally retired and returned to Sri Lanka where he built a house in Nuwara Eliya and lived with his second wife Janet before moving to Colombo where he spent the rest of his life living in a luxury apartment in Wellawatte. His first wife a nurse Thilaka passed away a long time ago and they have a son Chin Fernando who is resident in the UK and has continued publishing the paper.
Reggie had panache for being smartly dressed and loved vintage cars he drove an old Mercedes Benz from Nuwara Eliya to Colombo and back and was proud to display it to his many friends.
Reggie was the president of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party UK and Europe branch during the time of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. He was also an All-Island Justice of the Peace.
His remains will lie at Mahinda Florists funeral parlour, Mt Lavinia from 10 am today. The funeral takes place on Wednesday at 1.30 pm for cremation at Mt Lavinia cemetery. - ST

Lalith Athulathmudali  a personal recollection
Frontiersman of Lankas economic renaissance
The trick is to isolate the manageable issues; the manageable issues, he repeated emphatically, a gleam in his eye as he drove his point home. His well attuned business leaders audience took his point well. They were listening well not simply because they knew they were on the threshold of new economic era of opportunity and challenge but, also, because they had the utmost respect for the speaker, for his political office as well as his personal stature.
I was part of that audience, too, being the principal economic reporter for The Sun and Weekend newspapers at the time. The speaker was Lalith Athulathmudali, then Minister of Trade in the first J. R. Jayewardene cabinet and the event was one of many of the Ministers I had reported on in the 1978-80 period which were my formative years as a young journalist.
In 1977, then newly elected Prime Minister J. R. Jayewardene, launched what was intended to be, and indeed, became, a kind of small revolution in post-colonial Sri Lanka: the open economy of liberalised imports, liberalised financial and business practices, a focus on export oriented manufacturing and agriculture. (I say small revolution because, as a socialist myself, a real revolution would be a complete transformation of the political-economy  which I doubt will occur in my lifetime.)
Compared with the entire previous post-colonial period, this policy platform was indeed a drastic change in perspective as well as political practice. Perhaps the voting citizenry was getting impatient with the failure of the traditional politics of social welfare, nationalist protectionism and a state-dominated economy to deliver the high expectations of nation-building of those first post-colonial generations.
Presidential system
In that sense, J. R. Jayewardene and his colleagues of the UNP were seizing on an opportune moment in the journey of the nation to make this drastic change. The open economy policy advent of 1977 was followed methodically by the second Republican Constitution in 1978 which, again, was revolutionary in that it discarded the parliament-centric political system in favour of a highly centralised executive presidency. Today, this presidential system is much maligned but, at the time, it was pioneering and visionary.
I, myself, have been an ardent and long-standing critic of this Gaullist style system but that was more due to my ideological bias and not so much because I could (at the time) envisage a concrete alternative that would creatively take the country out of the bind of the Westminster framework. Even today, I am not completely hostile to the executive presidency although I certainly wish to see a major revamp of a whole range of authoritarian institutional mechanisms that currently engender all kinds of autocracy, corruption and, consequent gross inefficiency and crudity in political and economic management.
The early Jayewardene era, then was certainly a pioneering one and Lalith Athulathmudali played a key role in it, being in charge of one of the most important planks of the open economy, namely Trade, and later, Shipping as well. As a young professional starting off on a career (in journalism) I appreciated this sense of adventure in setting off on an exploratory journey  building a whole nation at that  and could identify myself with the creativity and bravery of Athulathmudali.
Another such key actor of that regime at the time was Gamini Dissanayake who took on another subject immensely vital for this intended economic revolution, namely Lands and Land Development and the Accelerated Mahaweli programme. Having already been bred in school, myself, on the gigantic Mahaweli project, I could not fail to be impressed by the brilliance and daring of this project to narrow down this grandiose Senanayake-Bandaranaike scheme to several core headwork projects that could be then speeded up and provide a vital infra-structural foundation for the overall new economic strategy.
Early Jayewardene regime
All of the above is to contextualise the arrival of Athulathmudali on the stage of national politics and, more importantly, national leadership in those pioneering years of the early Jayewardene regime. Today, I do not know anyone  even among my socialist activist colleagues  who would not appreciate the significant change and, its equally significant societal impact, engineered by the first Jayewardene regime.
There are certainly huge negative impacts no doubt, in the political and social spheres. We know, today, of the way in which the Sri Lankan presidential system has  mainly in later years - encouraged crony capitalism, extreme ethno-politics as a means of circumventing social pressures, consequent racism and pogroms resulting in ethnic war. Indeed, many in the social-critical circles, could see the way these tendencies were evolving even at the time.
But, largely, what has happened in the political and social spheres was a result of the mediocrity of subsequent Sri Lankan politics post JR, in which subsequent regimes simply did not have those same capacities of intellect nor of political commitment to policy and strategic goals over and above personal power ambitions and social opportunism. As someone who has reported national affairs (and national tragedies) since 1978, covering the entire range of national governance as well as anti-state political struggle, and also as a social activist, that is my broad perception.
It is possible that that JR regime was the last post-colonial national leadership to have the calibre of genuine political leadership in which national and societal political goals  including social class goals (whether or not one endorses the classes benefitting)  were foremost. Lalith Athulathmudali, in my view, was among an even smaller number in that regime for whom those national-social goals were the sole driver.
The scene today is such a stark contrast: it is difficult to find more than a handful of professional politicians (not political activists), leave aside political parties, who have any such defined national and societal goals at all. We now have successive generations of politicians well bred in utterly selfish, opportunistic politics in which personal aggrandisement, power and immediate constituency  sometime just family  prosperity are not just their primary career objectives but their sole purpose in getting elected.
In contrast, Lalith Athulathmudali, with his intellectual interest and zeal in achieving the open economy and, steering trade and exports for this purpose, stands as a giant in the true tradition of national leadership at the tail end of those early post-colonial generations of politicians of similar bent. While, ideologically, I may not agree with the economic philosophy and philosophy of governance of the JR regime, in terms of significance of impact on society and sheer leadership capacity, JR and Athulathmudali and several others in that regime, are easily comparable to those greats of earlier regimes, such as the Bandaranaikes, Colvin R. de Silva, N. M. Perera et al (the list is long).
New economic policy
If the political aspects of the JR regime are somewhat questionable, the economic dimension is where that regime has no peer in post-colonial Sri Lankan history. There is no question, in my view (I do not claim expertise) that the current Sri Lankan economy would not be in the position it is in today, as a rising (lower) middle-income country if not for that new economic policy launched by JR in which Athulathmudali was a major player.
All successive regimes post JR have been merely taking forward  even blunderingly so  the economic policies so ably launched and managed by Lalith Athulathmudali  with the political backing of J. R. Jayewardene. In that sense, Athulathmudali was certainly a frontiersman in the good American sense of being at the frontiers of new country, exploring, daringly pushing forward.
I began this reflective essay with a recollection of one of Athulathmudalis favourite axioms (manageable issues), because I have heard him employ this and related axioms in speeches he made to certain types of audiences  business leaderships and political and social leaderships.
I think that, as a lawyer, Athulathmudali relished the negotiation dimension of having to push through an economic vision and policy that, to Sri Lankans, were new-fangled. He had a lot of negotiations to do not only with various socio-economic and business sectors but also with the then powerful trade unions.
It is noteworthy that Athulathmudali thought less of coercion and more of negotiation when it came to his area of political management. It is true that even that first JR regime had its quota of thug-type politicians and repressive tools were indeed deployed, but none of that occurred on a scale that seriously undermined the whole system  certainly not in the way some succeeding regimes have gone about governance, or, mis-governance.
As a man well brought up through our social system, who possessed an intellect and social breeding that enabled him to value that system, Athulathmudali was not the person to rock the boat.
This is why it is possible to argue that he was one of the more creative politicians in our modern history.

Govt introduces social registry
As per an initiative taken by the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry in 2015, the Department of Project Management and Monitoring (DPMM) has taken steps to develop a social registry, which is a Management Information System (MIS) on social welfare programmes implemented under the Government of Sri Lanka.
This MIS has been developed by the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) with the coordination and support from DPMM and the Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office.
Currently the system contains information related to beneficiaries of 24 welfare programmes funded by the government, under 12 government institutions. All the district-level demographic information of the beneficiaries are available for access by the public at http://socialregistry.gov.lk/. Steps are being taken to eliminate the duplicated data entered in the system.
This system will be beneficial to policymakers in developing evidence-based policies for social empowerment and also in designing better welfare programmes for the vulnerable groups in the society. Further, it is expected that this system will reduce the welfare cost of the government by eliminating the duplication of beneficiaries.
Also, it is expected to utilise the information collected under the social registry to further develop Sri Lankas social protection programme under the Social Safety Nets Project (SSNP) funded by the World Bank under the Finance Ministry.

The industrial committee of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka will soon carry out a study with regard to industrial safety and hazard rules and regulations in factories.
They will also provide recommendations to the government to avert possible tragedies, similar to the recent Horana rubber factory ammonia gas incident. Speaking to Daily News Business, President National Chamber of Commerce Sujeewa Samaraweera, stressed the need for the government to impose stringent rules and regulations in relation to industrial safely at least to control any possible events of this nature.
Samaraweera also noted that Sri Lankan industrialists should take moral responsibility towards workers as well as the environment when they conduct business operations at factories. This is not a matter of rules or regulations; this is about their moral responsibilities towards workers and environment.
Noting that Sri Lanka has seen a rapid increase in industrial hazards in the recent past, Samaraweera pointed out that its a common scenario most of the time that both employees and employers in factories are reluctant to follow given safety instructions in Sri Lanka.
It is the responsibility of employers as well as the employees to adhere to certain safety rules and regulations, when it comes to performing their tasks at factories, he noted.

Inflation falls further in March
Headline Inflation, as measured by the change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), which is compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), continued to follow the declining trend exhibited since November 2017.
As such, the year-on-year NCPI headline inflation decreased to 2.8 per cent in March 2018, lowest since April 2016, from 3.2 per cent in February 2018. The monthly decline in Food prices in March 2018 supported by the favorable supply conditions attributed to this sharp decline in year-on-year inflation in March 2018.
The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis decreased from 7.2 per cent in February 2018 to 6.7 per cent in March 2018.
When monthly change is considered, the NCPI declined from 123.7 index points in February 2018 to 122.8 index points in March 2018 mainly due to the decline in prices of the items in the Food category, particularly that of vegetables, big onions, rice and red onions.
Meanwhile, marginal price increases were observed in Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Transport and Miscellaneous Goods and Services sub-categories.
The NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, continued its declining trend observed since September 2017 and decreased to 1.9 per cent in March 2018 from 2.0 per cent in February 2018 on year-on-year basis. Annual average NCPI Core inflation declined to 3.6 per cent in March 2018 from 4.1 per cent in February 2018.

It was risky to make Beyond the Clouds in India
Oscar-nominated Iranian director Majid Majidi who has made his latest movie Beyond the Clouds in India has said that it was very risky for him to make the movie in the country.
I had proposals from several Indian producers to make a film in their country, but I viewed them as highly risky since I knew very little about Indian culture, Majidi said during a workshop organized at the 36th Fajr International Film Festival on Saturday.
I feel a strong affinity between Indian and Iranian cultures but I had to increase my knowledge of the Indian culture in order to make my films story believable, he added.
He said he hired all members of his cast and crew except his assistant from India. The Bollywood cinema has its unique rules and we must follow their rules if we want our film to do very well at the box office, he added.
According to Majid, exterior scenes in many Indian films are shot at large studios that they have. However, he chose to film the exterior scenes of his movie outdoors in Mumbai.
He described Mumbai as a very crowded city where horns are blaring constantly. I wanted to make my film in a real place consequently shooting lasted for over seven months on location in the heart of Mumbai, he said.
Starring Ishaan Khattar, Malavika Mohanan and Sharada, Beyond the Clouds tells the story a young boy, Amir, and his sister, Tara, in Mumbai.

President Maithripala Sirisena said the late Lalith Athulathmudali will be remembered as one of the most distinguished Sri Lankan politicians, a pragmatic leader, a visionary thinker and an exemplary human being.
In a message on the 25th death anniversary of Lalith Athulathmudali, the President said the late politician is still remembered as a colossus in politics and his contribution which is diverse will be remembered in the annals of history.
The Message:
The late Lalith Athulathmudali who left us 25 years ago was an intelligent, erudite, visionary and a rare politician whom the country was fortunate to have had.
Athulathmudali came from a political family and this helped him to sharpen his political acumen at an early age.
His deep interest in education and the quality of education he had, later helped him to be Sri Lankas most visionary Education Minister. After studying at Royal College he chose one of the worlds most prestigious universities, Oxford, to pursue his higher studies.
Athulathmudalis father passed away when he was studying at Oxford. After that the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike offered a Scholarship to Athulathmudali to continue his studies at Oxford. At an early age Bandaranaike identified Laliths talent and his capacity.
At that time he had told his Cabinet of Ministers that Athulathmudali will one day become the countrys Prime Minister.
If not for his untimely demise, Athulathmudali certainly could have become the leader of the country.
The late Athulathmudali is a politician who never failed.
Whatever task given he did it to perfection without allowing room for criticism. In all the Ministries he worked he left lasting impressions and a trail of achievements which are unmatched.
When given a ministerial portfolio, first he used to deeply study the subject area and as such those who worked under him could not challenge his knowledge and the understanding of the subject.
I dont have big concepts, I only have small ideas. When these ideas merge with peoples thinking it creates something new he used to say often. This showed that he was a pragmatic politician who always felt the peoples pulse. He always thought large and productive innovations can be created with small ideas and concepts.
I was elected as a Member of Parliament on March 15, 1989. I took oaths as a MP on March 19, 1989.
"At the time, Lalith Athulathmudali served as Minsiter of Education in President Ranasinghe Premadasas Government. At the time there were several ministers who were outstanding leaders in the Government, including Lalith, Gamini Dissanayake, Ranjan Wijeratne and several others.
"These ministers interacted more closely with opposition MPs than with Government members. Lalith was special even among them. They were great orators who imparted knowlege and proved to be brilliant examples for new MPs. Lalith served his country in a multitude of ways.
"His legacy includes the Mahapola Scholarship Scheme for university students, the establishment of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and a vision for the expansion of the Colombo Port and the strengthening of national security mechanisms. In all of these things, Lalith proved to be a visionary. He will always be one of Sri Lankas immortal leaders. It is said that many times, then Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yu begged Lalith to take citizenship in Singapore and serve that country. But to Lalith, there was no higher calling than serving his own nation.
"That he was not allowed to live out his full potential for national leadership is not just his loss. It is the greatest misfortune of this country.

Let them go
The SLFP rebels were adamant that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe be replaced and told President Sirisena that they would quit the government if he did not take action in this regard. This is despite the SLFP coming a distant third at the LG polls, behind the pohottuwa and the UNP. Giving no answer to this, the rebels started foisting the blame for the SLFP's electoral debacle to the economic policies pursued by the Prime Minister. Having not succeeded in their bid they pounced on the opportunity presented by the Joint Opposition which sponsored a No Confidence Motion against the Premier and voted with the JO to oust their bete noire cocksure that they would see the Motion through with the support of the remainder in the SLFP group and some rebels within the UNP.
When this did not come to pass (even two of the signatories to the NCM abstained from voting) they demanded that they would be quitting the government if the SLFP did not sever connections with the UNP and sit in the Opposition, though not being part of the Joint Opposition. The 16 members of the SLFP who voted for the NCM have now declared that they would cross the floor on May 8 when parliament will be commencing its new session.
Now comes the news report that the rebels are demanding a change in the office bearers of the SLFP, read General Secretary (SLFP) Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera (UPFA), failing which they have threatened to boycott the SLFP May Day rally and go it alone. The former Ministers in the SLFP who quit the government is reported to have said that the party would have no future if such individuals were retained.
It is natural that the rebels are still smarting by the defeat of the NCM and are openly blaming the two General Secretaries for scuttling the bid. Hence, it is only natural that they want the duo removed.
But they are hardly in a position to take up cudgels on behalf of the SLFP after some of its members were seen openly consorting with the Joint Opposition only moments after they walked out of the Government jointly formed by the UNP and the SLFP with the President's blessings. There was Dilan Pererea and Dayasiri Jayasekera, dutifully present at the Fort Magistrates court premises, to wrap their arms around Mahindananda Aluthgamage who was released on bail in the case involving the alleged misuse of public funds to the tune of Rs. 39 million to purchase sports goods, during the Presidential Election, for distribution among Sports Clubs. Not only that, a beaming Dayasiri Jayasekera went on to exonerated the JO stalwart from blame, although as a lawyer, himself, he ought to have kept his counsel on a proceeding matter.
In any event this was hardly the kind of conduct that constitutes loyalty towards the SLFP, which the rebels openly profess and for which they claim they have the best interest at heart in calling for the removal of the two General Secretaries by which they hope to cleanse the party.
It was no secret that the likes of Dayasiri Jayasekera, Dilan Perera and Susil Premajayantha were playing footsies with the JO all along and only a moron will believe that their loyalties still remain with the SLFP. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the other day, stated that the group of 16 who voted for the NCM was part of the conspiracy hatched by Mahinda Rajapaksa to break up the government and cause divisions between the President and the Prime Minister, for the last three years.
Both, the President and PM, have reiterated that the unity government will run its full course, and the swearing-in of the new Cabinet is due before the opening of the new parliament session. Hence, the deal is already sealed and the SLFP rebels are therefore welcome to go their merry way with holding their May Day rally on their own, or, jointly with the JO.
The likes of Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekera have demonstrated umpteen times by their speeches and actions as to where their loyalties lay, even without the open welcome by Jayasekera of his JO colleague Aluthgamage, at the Fort Magistrate's court premises, the other day, as proof. While in government, holding important ministerial posts, and, enjoying the perks of office, the duo were always talking at cross purposes and trying to trip the President and the PM, at every turn.
Their conduct during the recent oil distribution fiasco too left much to be desired, at a time when all ministers in the government were expected to unite in resolving a crisis. They constantly failed to live by the accepted tenets of collective Cabinet responsibility. Their remaining in the SLFP can only further foul up the atmosphere and be nothing but an impediment to the progress of the unity government. Hence, they should not muddy the waters further by continuing to remain within the SLFP, even as a separate Opposition group, but join the political formation they are more comfortable with.

LOLC Micro Credit and LOLC Finance merge
LOLC Group merged its micro credit company, LOLC Micro Credit Ltd (LOMC), with its finance company, LOLC Finance PLC (LOFC).
Earlier this year, the Group sought approval from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to merge these two entities and on receiving the necessary approval, concluded the merger on March 28, leaving LOFC as the remaining entity.
This strategic merger propels LOFC to the forefront of the industry as the largest Non-Bank Financial Institution (NBFI) in the country with a total assets base of Rs. 212 billion and a lending book of Rs. 152 billion.
The joint profitability of the two entities considered as one as at December 2017 was Rs. 3.3 billion.(PBT)
The diversity in the merged entity with its product and service offering as well as the strong financial support of its parent company and the large number of funding partners, empowers LOFC to reach an industry leading level of stability.
The high yielding micro portfolio of LOMC aptly complements the SME book of LOFC while LOFCs ability to raise public deposits enables LOMCs clientele to access the savings and FD products with the company.
Furthermore, this strategic merger provides a successful model for CBSLs financial services sector consolidation plan.
The companys wide customer base is poised to enjoy many benefits as a result of the merger.

The Lotus revolution
Devdath is in love with Yasodhara. When Yasodharas husband, Siddhartha, leaves the worldly life, Devdath enters her life for sexual advantage. Yasodhara kills herself with a dagger. Fear not, for it is highly unlikely that a story with such an interpretation will take root in this land. It was a subplot of a Japanese movie based on the Buddhas life. Yasodhara, the first ever film on the eponymous lady venerable, directed by Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, takes you elsewhere on the path leading to the Vulture Peak (Gijjhakuta Pabbata) where the Buddha awaits the arrival of his Sansara-long partner.
Produced with a colossal budget  with Sarasavi Sineru Chief Premasiri Haputanthris input of Rs 70,000,000 - Yasodhara will enter 85 cinema halls (the biggest number of the simultaneous screening) on April 26.
Revered subject
The Daily News discourse with Professor Sunil Ariyaratne leads to numerous creative barricades that any artiste will face when dealing with subjects of reverence.
Yasodhara Director Professor
Sunil Ariyaratne
Yasodhara is not an attempt to offer new interpretations. But we tried to dramatise what is already laid down in the ancient classics woven around the characters of Siddhartha and Yasodhara. Offering new interpretations may hurt the Sinhalese Buddhist community of this country.
Yes, offering new interpretations to a revered subject is a daring feat. Yet, Ariyaratne has taken a few liberties.
The legend has it that Siddhartha comes across the four omens (diseased, aged, corpse and a robed figure) one after another as isolated encounters. In Ariyaratnes script, these individuals burgeon into an extensive platform. The diseased and the aged are quarantined in separate quarters to which Siddhartha runs into by accident. The death occurs to the father of his close associate, Channa. And then his travelling partner, Kantaka, leads him to a robed figure. Struck by these heavy incidents (filmed to the effect of Mark Herman of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas fame), Siddhartha comes home to his wife. They have a symposium-like conversation about his findings.
Ariyaratne does not believe that Siddhartha fled the palace. The sources do not narrate such a story, he justifies.
Yasodhara was conscious of the spiritual revolution brewing within Siddhartha. They discussed these issues as a husband and wife. Even King Suddhodana knew that Siddhartha would renounce sooner or later. You cannot call that an escapade or a fleeing.
The script tries to establish that argument. Yasodhara was not only aware of the changes happening in Siddhartha but she also encouraged him to tread the path of liberation. That particular feature is unique to Yasodhara who had been with Siddhartha for numerous births since the time of Deepankara Buddha.
Grappling with dilemma
Yasodhara feels Siddharthas arrival in the room on that fateful day. She feigns asleep, with her hand gently covering Rahula the newborn. Siddhartha would not be able to welcome his son and bid farewell to his wife. If he manages to do either, Yasodhara knew it would make things tough for Siddhartha. Grappling with the dilemma, Siddharthas journey may get delayed. That should not be the case.
Its a kind of a razors edge. These are much-revered characters in the Sinhalese Buddhist circles. So we had to be extra careful not to stain the characters. Instead, we chose to make them more glorious, Ariyaratne notes.
In addition to Yasodharas own narration, en route to the Vulture Peak to take her farewell from the Buddha, a poet or a jongleur is also present to feed us with a description of what took place then. Such poets or jongleurs used to be common in northern India at the time, according to Ariyaratne. If not for this character, he defends the introduction of another narrator beside Yasodhara herself, the film duration will be even longer. In Lady of the Lotus, a singular novel based on Yasodhara, William Edmund Barrett describes this profession: Any wandering minstrel, jester, puppeteer or teller of tales who came to Koli gave a command performance at the palace. They told, or they sang, and they acted, the stories of Kings and of ladies fair, of warriors and gods.
We had qualms until we organised a special screening for the approval from the Maha Sangha. Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera was instrumental in trimming the script. If not for him, the plot would have had more of Devdath.
Tough task
Scripting was the toughest task owing to the lack of sources available on Yasodhara. More sources are available on other lady figures such as Ambapali, Visakha and Patachara.
Except for Pujavaliya, you dont find much information related to Yasodhara. Only a handful like the folk poem Yasodharawatha and the biography of Yasodhara by Venerable Ganegama Saranankara Thera are available. The Thera makes reference to Lady of the Lotus by William Edmund Barrett. I personally feel that Barretts work would have been more elegant if he had an opportunity to read the Pujavaliya chapter on Yasodhara. That chapter is written with such a deep affection towards Yasodhara.
According to the Pujavaliya, the Buddha has spent the whole night in the funeral. Then he gathered the relics and erected a chaitya to pay homage to her.
I must also mention about Narasiha Gatha. In the oriental literature, you will find many eulogies written for females. But a eulogy on a male is quite rare. So narasiha verses fill that void by praising an ancient male figure.
When Rahula laments that he could not identify his father among the many robed figures, resembling the ehela flowers, Yasodhara opts to paint a portrait of the Buddha. For Sunil Ariyaratne this is the accomplishment of two objectives.
First we could introduce this verse to the cinema. Second, we could overcome a common challenge. No actor in Sri Lanka is supposed to play the Buddhas character. Although there are many international performers who have played the Buddhas role and the local television channels have broadcast them as well, we face that challenge. So we make Yasodhara paint a portrait, reciting the narasiha verses.
Supporting characters
After Enlightenment, the Buddha enters Yasodharas abode in many symbolic gestures.
Despite being titled Yasodhara, a major portion of the movie deals with the supporting characters of Siddhartha and Devadatta. Yasodharas character blooms into life after Siddhartha attains Enlightenment.
How many films have been made on the Buddha Quite a lot. And how many films have been made on Yasodhara None. This is because of lack of sources. So we had to develop Yasodharas character with the assistance of other characters.
Professor Asanga Tilakaratne maintains that the Buddhahood is not possible without a partner like Yasodhara. Enlightenment cannot be achieved alone. You need moral support to renounce and seek Enlightenment. If not for Yasodhara, Siddhartha would have had to wait for a few more births until Enlightenment as Buddhist literature indicates.
Devadatta also gains a new lease of life. Contrary to the common attitude thrown at him, he turns out to be an affectionate brother to Yasodhara. He respects Siddhartha only on the grounds that the latter takes care of Yasodhara well.
What brother would like his sister to be married off to a man destined to renounce What if her husband dies The wife will have to perform sati puja. She will be forced to have meals without salt. She had to be satisfied with plain clothing. If her husbands dead body is found, the widow will have to sacrifice herself to the pyre.
Brainstormed
Running for two and half hours (which is more than the average movie duration), Yasodhara is an offshoot of well brainstormed script with the scholars of the calibre of Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana, Venerable Professor Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera, Venerable Nawalapitiya Sudammika Therini, Professor Asanga Tilakaratne, Professor Chandima Wijebandara and Venerable Professor Agalakada Sirisumana Thera.
And finally, Yasodharas looming legacy grows. She may well be able to stir a spiritual renaissance.

Though private sector credit growth had eased last year, data suggested it was on track to reach a targeted 16% in 2018, said Michael Todemann, Oxford Business Group (OBGs) editorial manager in Sri Lanka.
A national drive is under way to support smaller enterprises and encourage FDI is steering the country towards the next phase of its economic development, with new measures aimed at enhancing the business climate expected to provide a further boost, he said.
A new report by Oxford Business Group (OBG) on Sri Lankas economy highlighted efforts under way to encourage the larger, State-owned banks to list on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Sri Lanka in 2018 will track the measures put in place to facilitate the listing of major lenders, which forms part of a broader, national bid to generate capital and boost the exchanges value.
OBGs publication will also provides a wide-ranging analysis of the other segments that are expected to play a key role in the development of Sri Lankas capital markets.

Nimble  footwork and jaw-dropping leaps
A classical ballet presentation by reputed foreign artistes is a rare occurrence in Colombo. It was a treat to watch the Natalia Permyakova Russian Chamber Ballet Troupe perform at the Nelum Pokuna (courtesy of the Russian Center) with beautiful digital images forming a panoramic backdrop. Though tickets were terribly expensive the hall was packed, which goes to show that ballet aficionados will pay any price to watch a good show. And they certainly got their moneys worth.
There were some lovely excerpts from well-known ballets such as Swan Lake, Giselle, Don Quixote, Raymonda, and Chopiniana (otherwise known as Les Sylphides). Careful thought had gone into the selection of these pieces as there was a fine mix of solos, pas de deux, and ensemble dances. The judicious blend of adagios and allegros too was deeply satisfying. In terms of balance, variety (classical, modern, folk), and visual impact (enhanced by skillful lighting), the performance overall was impressive. The music too (by renowned composers such as Tchaikovsky, Minkus, Glazunov, Chopin, Weber and Adam) had enormous depth and range. The Director, Natalia Permyakova (Professor in Pedagogical Sciences), should be commended for the expert manner in which she wove the different elements into a stylish and cohesive production. The choreography on the whole (which included some original items created for the ensemble) was world-class. The costumes were tastefully designed and blended harmoniously with the mood and tenor of each dance.
The ensemble consisted of twelve dancers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky. It is interesting to note that the oldest performer, Elena Pankova (born in 1974), was a prima ballerina of the Mariinsky. The foundation for most Russian ballet dancers is the Vaganova method which is unique to Russia. Although superficially it is similar to other methods, such as French and Cecchetti, there are subtle differences in respect of basic positions such as tendu, attitude, arabesque, retir, port de bras, and epaulement, not to mention that floating quality called ballon associated with athletic jumps. Indeed, in both the classical and character dances we saw jaw-dropping leaps by gifted male dancers where they seemed to hover in the air. In respect of quiet power, athleticism and physicality, the male dancers outshone their female counterparts, but when it came to grace and fluidity of movement, the females had the edge.
It is only when professional Russian ballet dancers come to town that we get an opportunity to appreciate the subtleties and nuances of the Vaganova method. Sadly, this happens only once in a blue moon. Be that as it may, what the twelve artistes showed us is that in order to become an accomplished dancer you need to demonstrate sound technique, which entails several hours of training every day for several years with reputed teachers who are experts not only in dance but in injury prevention as well. Correct technique and injury prevention go hand in hand.
The dancers were extremely supple and demonstrated robust technique combined with fluency of movement. They all had superb posture and carriage and exhibited mastery of turn-out, hip rotation and placement. Their eyes were focused, their lines pure, and footwork, precise and nimble. They were also spot on (most of the time) in respect of poise, balance and control and performed difficult movements (including precision lifts) with consummate ease. The few minor blemishes that did occur could perhaps be attributed to a slippery floor.
The two standout items, in my view, were Le Spectre de la Rose  an august pas de deux choreographed by the iconic Mikhail Fokin and performed with aplomb to Webers celebrated Invitation to the Dance (the scratchy sound notwithstanding) and Grand Pas  a lively and longish ensemble dance from the ballet Don Quixote involving complex choreography by Alexander Gorsky, who restaged many of Petipas ballets, including Don Quixote. The dancing was airy and vibrant and the music by Minkus, unforgettable.
Though the dancers had great poise and strong technique, their capacity for emotional and artistic expression was a touch limited, which perhaps explains why they did not connect intimately with the audience, judging from the muted applause at the end of each item. For instance: (a) the pas de deux from Giselle that occurs after the tragic heroine has become an elusive Wili is meant to be deeply moving, but the poignant aspects of this dance did not come through although it was neatly performed; (b) though the soloist who executed the Gipsy Dance from Don Quixote was very nimble and stylish, she lacked the power and sensuality of, say, an Irina Zibrova; (c) Waltz No. 7 from Chopiniana was charming but not enchanting enough to hold the audience spellbound; (d) though the solo Californian Poppy dance (first performed by the legendary Anna Pavlova) was engaging, it did not quite encapsulate the profoundly haunting quality of the music by Tchaikovsky (Melody No. 3, Op. 42).
The eclectic finale, on the other hand, performed by the ensemble to the music of Minkus, was studded with glittering cameos and drew a warm applause from the audience. The concert ended on a high note with the audience clapping to the pulsating beat of the spectacular curtain call.
In sum, this was a quality performance by the Russian Chamber Ballet Troupe. The dancing was technically sound and enriched with some luminous moments that will linger in our minds for some time. If there is a lesson to be learnt from this show, it is that there are no short cuts to becoming a top-notch professional dancer. People in this country who dream of getting into a professional dance company overseas have to train as hard as Olympic athletes to realize their goals.

No interference in SLs internal affairs: Envoy
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan, responding to recent accusations on the alleged Chinese militarization at Hambantota Port, pointed out that there is no military purpose for China in conducting friendly and pragmatic cooperation with Sri Lanka.
He said so when he called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last Friday to exchange views on the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Hambantota Port, stated the Embassy of China in a press release.
China never interferes in Sri Lankas internal affairs and is willing to work with the Sri Lankan side to push forward the latters economic and social development by promoting a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice, win-win cooperation, the Ambassador said.
Ambassador Cheng briefed him on Chinese President Xi Jinpings keynote speech at the recently-concluded Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference and reaffirmed that China firmly upholds and supports economic globalization.
China attaches great importance to the relations with Sri Lanka, and wishes to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries to actively push forward the practical cooperation under the framework of BRI, so as to bring tangible benefits to the two countries and peoples, the Ambassador said.
Premier Wickremesinghe highlighted that Sri Lanka as well as he personally had always been strongly supportive of the BRI, the release stated.
Sri Lanka attaches great importance to mega-projects cooperation with China, especially the projects such as Hambantota Port and Industrial Park, Colombo Financial City (or Port City).
The Sri Lankan government hopes to work with the Chinese side to accelerate the implementation of the ongoing projects and attract more Chinese investment in order to promote economic and social development, the Prime Minister said, according to the release.
He stressed that there is no issue of Chinese militarization of the Hambantota Port and that the Sri Lankan Navy is the sole military force responsible for the security of the Port.
Some foreign media irresponsibly hyped the question of militarization of Hambantota Port for their own hidden agenda. Time will eventually prove that Hambantota Port is destined to embrace a prosperous and bright future in business, he said, according to the press release of the Chinese Embassy.

This 30-year old Parliamentary complex is a public property and like every other establishment this building too needs maintenance, the Speaker said.

Ready for country musics girl power revolution
Miranda Lambert is convinced country music is on the verge of a girl power revolution, despite the fact that all the Entertainer of the Year nominees at the ACM Awards on Sunday (15Apr18) were men.
The Mama's Broken Heart singer picked up three prizes at the ceremony, which turned out to big night for the ladies, and now she believes women could take over the country awards shows for the remainder of the year and beyond.
Like many country fans, Miranda admits she was surprised when she learned there would be no woman fighting for the ACMs' top prize, which was won by Jason Aldean, stating, "Carries (Underwood) kicking a**, and Im trying to kick a** as much as I can on the road, so I dont understand whats going on with that, but I know that theres gonna be a change.
"I know that if we just keep ploughing ahead it will get recognised and have its moment for sure." Miranda's three new awards make her the most awarded artist in ACM history, but she's trying to stay humble as fans rave about her feat.
"I just always try to live in the moment Im in. And then make myself better. I try to reinvent, and try to be a better writer, and a better singer, and a better performer. And just a better person all around, I guess," Lambert tells Taste of Music.
"Standing here knowing that, its really a lot of pressure. But I know that its so important that I keep that attitude because its why Im standing here right now. Im here because of the women who have stood here before me." One of Lambert's ACM Awards highlights was watching pal Underwood's return to the stage after a horrific fall at her home in Nashville, Tennessee last November left the Before He Cheats singer needing stitches in her face.
"Ive been really worried, and interested in making sure she was OK," Miranda explains. "Seeing her stand up there and be so beautiful and be one of the greatest singers of all time in any genre of music... she can sing me under the table... Im just proud of her, and I know how strong she is and how hard shes worked to be here for a long time, and to be here carrying torches.
"What I love about her is no matter what, she always represents country music in the most classy, incredible way. Ive never seen her waver or ever have a bad performance or hit a bad note. Im thrilled to call her a friend."

Avant Garde case
Rtd. Army Colonel further remanded until May 3
The Galle Chief Magistrate, rejecting a bail application submitted on behalf of retired Army Colonel Don Thomas Albert Wijethunga who was being held in remand custody in connection with the Avant Garde case, ordered him to be further remanded until May 3.
The suspect was allegedly the former storekeeper of the floating armoury on board the vessel MV Avant Garde.
The ship MV Avant Garde was seized by the Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015, for allegedly keeping a firearms depository on board and handed it over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for subsequent investigations.
The defense pointed out that in the B report, the submissions were made under the Public Property Act and subsequently, further suggestions were tendered regarding the origin of the firearms.
The Defense attorney further argued that although it was announced that a letter issued by the Defense Ministry regarding the details of the firearms was discovered at the time of the raid, no such details were reported to courts.
In response to the defense's submissions, the State Counselor representing the Attorney General stated that the Criminal Investigation Department had acted on fair grounds and that according to the Government Analysis Department, all armaments were automatic firearms. He added that charges against the suspects were criminal offences punishable with life-imprisonment and it was not a bailable offence at a Magistrate's Court.
Consequently, the magistrate rejected the application and further remanded the suspect until May 3.
Attorney-at-Law Harith Hettiarachchi appeared for the suspect, while the Criminal Investigation Department was represented by IP Lasantha Rathnayake and State Counsel Janaka Bandara represented the Attorney General.

Set your soul on fire!
Soulful is an appropriate term to describe gifted singer Natasha Rathnayake. Anyone who meets her for the first time, will realize that Natasha Rathnayake is very special and possesses great insights into life. Melodies features this unique singer who is at once spiritual, genuine and extremely ambitious and definitely a leader in life.
Talking about my beginnings, it was an extremely humble one, full of struggles and tears. Id like to think that, singing is my way of releasing all my pent up emotions growing up as a child. This was my outlet of release and healing. My childhood was never a pleasant one. So I found it in my strength to channel all those emotions to music and song. You could say, a cry from my deeper soul. Hence the power of singing, I presume, explains Rathnayake.
Once Rathnayake took to singing there was no stopping her. She just fell in love with it and now she has an incredibly successful career. Singing has given her wings and made people fall in love with her.
I was singing since I was seven. I was the youngest chorister in the church choir. I couldnt even read at that age. It was as if I was pushed in to the deep end and was asked to sing with all the big akkies and because I was the youngest of them all, I was called Baby Natty. Singing was probably never my dream at that point but once I got into singing there was no stopping me. Not only did it become my dream, but my obsession! I couldnt imagine my life doing anything else, said Rathnayake.
She has always been fascinated by powerhouse, soulful African American voices. She grew up listening to Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight and the list goes on. In addition to being famous and influential she is also very spiritual.
I have no doubt that my talent is from my creator (My higher self). We all have hidden talents that we discover later on in our lives, and this was mine. Singing is the one thing that truly makes me happy. It is the one thing that helps me be present with myself. I believe, singing is an inbuilt human instrument that can only be tapped by people who truly love music, pointed out Rathnayake.
Her lyrics truly portray the passion within her. They truly portray her innermost self.
I mostly write and I co-write, and yet other times, I pick a talented lyricist who can capture the essence of my story better. It really depends on my situation and circumstance in that time and space. Sometimes I like to speak about a particular pressing subject, and yet other times I end up writing feel good lyrics that transcends all boundaries and barriers, focusing on enjoying the moment, said Rathnayake
She could have done anything else in the world but she says that she chose the field of music because it simply makes her happy. When you heed your calling in life and do what you love doing happiness follows.
True I could have done anything else in life. I could have, but that wouldnt have made me happy. Im an extremely creative person and I believe this was what I was destined to do and the universe did the rest. Ill sing as long as I have the passion to do so. Theres many things I still have to learn and conquer about myself, before I conquer the world.
I am fascinated with the human psyche, yoga, the amazing benefits it holds for all of us, intuitive natural medicine, health and nutrition, conspiracies of the world. In other words, Im a student of life, always searching and hungry for the truth, explains Rathnayake
Rathnayake is so talented that she has even got international airplay in addition to being really huge in Sri Lanka. Her first album was a gospel album which was about 10 years ago. There after she has released many singles that have continued to get international airplay and most of them going in to international radio chart shows.
The title of my first album is My Obsession. Runaway, Get up on my feet, Let it go, More than free, Worship my body, play for the game, Karma, Gammadda, Takin it off, Shake that, Set you free are some of the popular songs that got international airplay. I appreciate all of them as every song is significant to me in its own right and a reflection of my growth as an artiste.
There are so many long term and short term goals, dreams, ambitions! Considering I am a Sri Lankan living in this part of the world and believing that I still have the potential, winning a Grammy seems like a long shot but the dream still exists or has been for a while. Then theres the short term goals like being the best version of myself in the very thing I choose to give my attention to. Choose a career thats your passion, and you will never work a day in your life, ever again, pointed out Rathnayake
Doing things that set your soul on fire is what she says we should all do. She does not believe in pruning the youth and making them copies of what adults want. Individuality and being unique are things she values greatly.
The best advice I can possibly give to young people is to do the things that make them happy. Things that set their soul on fire! Not what others think they should do but what they truly see themselves doing. Most parents try to live their dreams through their childrens lives and I see a lot of that happening in Sri Lanka, which I think is horribly unfair and selfish.
The children need to find themselves without being influenced by anyone. It should be solely their decision. Its okay to make mistakes. Rome wasnt built in a day. Mistakes are a part of learning. Protecting is a whole different thing to stifling their own childrens growth and god given talents. Whats important is that they have a shot at expressing their individuality, added Rathnayake.
Some of the artistes she admires are Chaka Khan, Steve Wonder, Gladys Knight, Erykah Badu, India Arie, Alicia Keys, Bruno Mars, Arantha Franklin.
All these artistes possess dynamic individuality and soulfulness in their voice quality. They don't let the world, nor any record label define their music. It is they that determine what or how they should sound like, and thats a powerful statement to make to big corporations that literally run the world.
As a kid, I have always been fascinated by powerhouse, soulful, African American voices. There are artistes that are singers, and then there are artists that can tell a story through their voice and music, and the above artistes do just that, emphasized Rathnayake
Rathnayake has a powerful support system in her life. What sustains her in life is her higher self and core beliefs. This includes everything she has learned over the years without the interferences from cultural, religious and social conditioning.
My inner circle know me for who I am and not for what Ive become. I want to thank my higher self, my late grandma for loving me for the way she did and for teaching me the finer things in life, my husband for always supporting me and pushing me to be the best version of myself, my parents for giving me a chance at life, and for every single person who has taken time off from their busy schedules to hate and put me down - those who thought I was never good enough, because of you, Im a better person today who has achieved great things in life!, said Rathnayake
Rathnayake is one of those people who have a lot to share with the world. She also believes that you should treat others in life the way you want to be treated.
I want to use all my talents and gifts to the best of my ability to first make myself happy, before sharing it with the world. Only by making myself happy will I know how to make another happy. To me health is wealth. No riches in the world would mean a thing, if I ended up sick. I live life on my terms. Not worrying about what people think or say about me. Knowing that theres only one of me in this whole wide world is rather humbling. I have always been a leader, never a follower, summed up Rathnayake.

Sheeran in talks for Danny Boyle movie
Ed Sheeran is reportedly in talks to star in Danny Boyle's upcoming music-themed movie.
The Slumdog Millionaire director is teaming up with Love Actually screenwriter and director Richard Curtis for a new comedy, and the plot is being largely kept under wraps. However, The Mail on Sunday reports that it will be about the music of The Beatles, and the Shape of You singer is in discussions to appear in the project and potentially write new music for it.
"Everything Ed touches turns to gold," a source close to Working Title, the studio making the film, told the publication. "He is the biggest hit-maker on the planet. If anyone can make a film about The Beatles songs even better musically, it's him." The new comedy, which is tentatively titled All You Need Is Love, is reportedly about a man who wakes up one day to find he is only person who can remember the songs of the Fab Four.
Ed is no stranger to cameo on-screen appearances, with previous acting credits including Bridget Jones's Baby and TV shows Game of Thrones, The Bastard Executioner, Undateable, and Australian soap opera Home and Away. He also starred as himself in the documentary Songwriter, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February (18). The film will reportedly go into production in London and Norfolk, England over the summer, and star Cinderella actress Lily James and actor Himesh Patel, who is best known for playing Tamwar Masood in British soap EastEnders. Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon is in talks to join the production.
The film is being backed by Universal, and will be produced by Working Titles Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner as well as Curtis and Boyle, who recently confirmed he is writing the script for the next James Bond outing.

Soldier-sailor rivalry with a charming touch of chivalry
Now as most people know both Army and Navy personnel try to portray a mutual respect for each others branches. Yet they both want to show that their outfit is better, smarter, faster, braver and more brilliant than their counterpart.
This was amply demonstrated by my good friend Godfrey a pukkah sahib Army officer. True, most soldiers and sailors outwardly display a brothers-in-arms bonhomie towards their forces counterparts. But beneath that veneer of reciprocal respect there has always been an underlying sense of unmitigated rivalry between the two camps. And more so with Godfrey because he always tried to conceal an ancient blood feud with a mutual Naval officer friend of ours named Oscar.
Both Godfrey and Oscar were dashing young commissioned officers at the time. Godfrey joined the Army as a Second Lieutenant while Oscar at the time was a Naval Acting Sub-Lieutenant. They were both pugilists and entered the Clifford Cup Boxing Championships in the Flyweight Division. Boxing being a man-to-man game was immensely popular at the time and drew not only huge crowds but also a considerable number of eager competitors.
By some stroke of fate the two were pitted against each other in the finals. Service supporters of all ranks from both the Army and Navy created a huge tumult as the duo faced each other in the ring. It was a ding-dong bruising battle with neither of them giving quarter. The two childhood friends who had been clinking glasses and exchanging Christmas gifts only a week before were now exchanging punishing toe-to-toe punches.
The crowd roared its approval as both antagonists fought on gamely. They were both battered, bruised and bloody when the referee stopped the fight. The judges verdict was Even-Stephen as they call a tie in pugilist jargon and they had to share the championship trophy.
Oscar had gifted his opponent with a broken nose which he carries around with him to this day. Godfrey had reciprocated with as violent a compound interest marring his rivals comeliness by bestowing him with a sort of hair-lip. But they were great buddies. Godfrey later married and chose Oscar, who remained a bachelor, as his Best-man. Oscar evaded matrimony with the side-stepping agility of a tango dancer until he was finally lassoed and entangled in the nuptial knots when he was in his mid fifties.
Family legend has it that years ago Godfreys youngest daughter Lily had fallen in love with a handsome and courteous young Naval officer. That was a time when all officers of the armed forces were gentlemen and only gentlemen were recruited as officers.
Whenever the young man was off duty he would dress up in all his civilian finery and in the refined etiquette of a suitor of the times would come calling on the young maiden of his dreams. The story goes that a rather fierce-looking Godfrey had entered the sitting room around 10.30 at night where the young Naval buck was courting his daughter.
Godfrey, they say had his watch in his hand and inquired from the young suitor: Young man do you know what the time is The alarmed courter stuttered: Y-y-yes-yes Sir, I was just about to leave! After he had scrambled Godfrey had turned to his piqued daughter in mock astonishment and said: What was the matter with your fellow My watch has stopped running and I simply wanted to know the time."
Now, Godfrey is not a habitual churchgoer although his family never fails to regularly attend Sunday services. So on Fathers Day he was virtually frog-marched to church by his battalion of grandchildren. His littlest grand-daughter handed him a bouquet of roses which he was supposed to hand over to the pastor at the offering.
Godfrey handed the blooms over to his wife Eva and in his finest parade ground tone thundered : No self-respecting commanding officer will lead the Army of the Lord with a bunch of flowers in his hand. I have a better idea. Your grandmother will carry the bouquet. He then proceeded to his mini bar and extracted a bottle of gift-wrapped premium wine. And I shall carry the Magnum for the Lord.
Both Godfrey and Oscar retired after distinguished service careers. Godfrey as Major General and Oscar as Rear Admiral. They both possess a superb sense of humour and are brimming with mischievous intellect. Wherever they are together they always make the location a veritable duelling ground. The flash and ring of wordplay flies like sparks from fencing foils as the two good-naturedly hurl witty invective at each other.
Usually at parties when family and guests gather round the piano Godfrey with his pleasant bass voice launches into one of his own compositions: I am a sailor sailing on the sea.
I love the ladies, but the ladies dont love me. Now never trust a sailor an inch above your knee! And Oscar would counter in his baritone: Forward Godfreys army, marching without fear, With our old commander, safely in the rear. And thinks he's very brave, But the men who really did the job are dead and in their grave.
Godfreys daughter Lily and the young Naval officer married eventually. The emotional father marched ramrod straight down the church aisle with the bride on his arm.
Just as he was about to hand the bride to his future-son-in-law he trampled her long flowing veil tripping her and almost sending her sprawling to the floor. Disaster was averted as the groom lurched forward and grabbed his falling betrothed.
Later during the reception Oscar proposing the toast to the newlyweds quipped: You all did see the General giving the bride away which is a traditional custom. But I am certain that when the lovely lass Lily tripped it was the first time in history that a bride would have wanted to give her father away!
But Godfrey got his own back when his friend Oscar married his widowed childhood sweetheart. As the elderly bride and groom entered the reception hall Godfrey walked on to the bandstand. Grabbing the microphone he snapped his fingers in a pre-arranged cue to the bandleader. There was no mistaking the mischievous delight in the Generals booming bass voice as he belted out the old- time Sinhala favourite of the fifties: Seeya manamalaya naaki illandhariya

Sri Lanka set to benefit greatly from Mahindras success
The shares of the Anand Mahindra led, Mumbai headquartered Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) surged more than 2% to hit an all-time high, thus steering the automaker to join the club of Rs 1 lakh crore market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Sri Lanka can only but benefit as M & M will soon be setting up their automotive assembly plant as a result of the joint venture entered into with Ideal Motors Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of the Ideal Group, to assemble automotive vehicles in Sri Lanka, said Founder Chairman of the Ideal Group, Nalin Welgama.
Welgama reiterated the fact that the spin off benefits as a result of M & Ms achievement in India will greatly benefit Sri Lanka, providing an impetus to the local automotive industry as well as serving to position Sri Lanka as a venue for many more automotive giants to open plants in the country.
Interestingly, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd is now bigger than the Tata groups carmaker Tata Motors, in terms of market capitalisation. The heavyweight shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd were among the top six gainers on BSE Sensex and the fifth-largest contributor in uplifting the benchmark index on Tuesday.
Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd rose as high as 2.23% to a lifetime peak of Rs 819.1 on Tuesday.
With the breaching of the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in the market capitalisation, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd went above Tata Motors in market capitalisation. Notably, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd became Indias second-largest automaker in terms of market capitalisation on Tuesday and was only behind Maruti Suzuki, as far as the automakers are concerned.
Mahindra will hold a 35% stake in the JV, while Ideal Motors will have a 65% stake. Ideal Motors has been a trusted Mahindra distributor for the last 9 years, and with this joint venture Mahindra will strengthen its presence in the country. The plant will be developed over the next one year under the expertise of the Mahindra team, and will incorporate global technologies, said Welgama. Sri Lanka is one of Mahindras top three export markets, and the new facility will not only contribute to human capital development, but will also enable collective development of local automotive components manufacturers to international standards under the global expertise of Mahindra. This is a leap forward for the Industry, adding value to the meaning of Made in Sri Lanka and opening broader opportunities for national growth.
M & Ms phenomenal achievement represents a quantum leap for both our companies, building the foundation for newer opportunities for both of us and setting the sky as our only limit, said Welgama.

Expressing his concern, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam instructed education officials to establish teacher pools, zonal wise.
Accordingly, a teacher pool will be established in each education zone.
The teachers of the pool will be deployed to relevant schools to cover duties of the teachers, who are on leave for long periods.

From crisis to sustenance - Part 24:
Treat your employees the way you wish to be treated
Over two decades ago, the concept of heart-centred leadership was met with scepticism. The concept of a leader who champions traits such as empathy, transparency and self-care was intriguing to some people who found themselves questioning the status quo.
Today, leaders are beginning to recognize the value of a heart-centred approach. Business owners who genuinely lead with their heart - not just their head - are more equipped to connect with the emotional needs of employees. They understand that people want to be valued, respected, listened to and involved. Leaders who consistently show their employees that they are appreciated possess the wisdom and capacity to run thriving, profitable businesses.
People like to be recognized in different ways high fives, thank you notes, certificates, free movie tickets and so many others. It is great to figure out what makes people tick and what really makes them feel valued. At the very least though, say thank you and acknowledge the good things people are doing. It will make a difference. Show people with both words and actions that you appreciate them.
Techniques
Following are some techniques to assist leaders who wish to implement a heart-centred approach.
1. Solving, not just selling
Stop selling your employees about why they need to perform better. Explain why their contributions help solve problems and contribute to the companys advancement. Employees are more inclined to step up their performance when they know their work can add-value to the healthier whole.
For example, I would always show my team the outcome of their collected efforts. We would go to the demo room and watch on screen new product on the production line or to the stores to see new label designs on the shelves. Inspire performance by connecting the dots of your employees efforts.
It is not only about what you are trying to sell, but also what the team is able to solve along the way.
2. Purpose, not just profit
Employees are inspired by knowing that their hard work makes a difference beyond profitability. Employees want leaders who see beyond the obvious and look to create wider reaching impact that extends into the community and influences social causes.
Look at IKEA, a Swedish-founded Dutch-based multinational group, that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories. It is the worlds largest furniture retailer.
Since 2003 IKEA has been raising funds annually for UNICEF and Save the Children through sales of IKEA soft toys. The project supporting 40 projects in 20 countries is designed to fight for childrens rights to a healthy and secure childhood with access to qualityeducation.
Together we can re-write the future for children all over the world.Thousands of children with disabilities, from poor rural areas or ethnic minorities have been given access to education thanks to the donations from IKEA Social Initiative, President IKEA said.
3. Know the ingredients, not just the recipe
The secret recipe to inspiring employees is to know the ingredients of the people you are inspiring. People want to know that their leaders understand their tendencies, attitudes and behaviours well-enough to best work with and motivate them. The best leaders and coaches always do.
When you spend time with your employees, make it matter. Dont just expect your time and title to inspire them. Employees want a leader that pays attention and genuinely cares about them.
Great leaders take the time to know the ingredients before they can create the best recipe for success. Employees are most inspired when a leader takes the time to know them and show that they have their best interests at heart.
Leaders that know how to prepare thousands of recipes are those who continually make the ingredients better  and keep them from spoiling.
4. Learning, not just lecturing
Employees are tired of being told what to do. They are eager to learn and remain relevant. But they find it difficult to be inspired by leaders who only inflict fear. In todays fast-paced world, people dont have time for lectures; they want continuous coaching and leaders that are paying attention. Eager to grow, they want objective feedback.
Simplify the process. Dont exhaust your employees through complexity and buzz-words. People seek direction that is to the point. Remember, most people have mastered the art of execution. Let your employee do their jobs well by providing the right tools and support to make them better at carrying out their roles and responsibilities. Be a great teacher, but quickly shift into facilitator mode. People are inspired when given the opportunity to learn how to do new things. Stop lecturing and start teaching.
5. Innovation, not just ideation
Employees want to create impact. Allow them to be part of the innovation-based projects in your company by letting them get their hands dirty. Ideation is important but being part of implementing the ideas that come to life can be a more exciting and meaningful growth opportunity for your employees that will inspire them to perform.
Additionally, provide your employees the resources to be innovative in their work. Stay close enough to your employees activities to know the 2 or 3 tools and/or resources that each would require to take their performance to the next level.
When given the right tools and resources, the best employees will instinctively challenge themselves to be more innovative in their work  and will perform better. That is why incentives inspire performance  but remember that money alone is not the sustainable answer. Focus on giving your employees the opportunities to elevate their individual value while serving the needs of the company.Allow innovation to inspire performance.
6. Significance, not just success
Helping your employees to be successful is important, but not inspiring enough in itself. People want much more out of their leaders and if you can activate the natural talents of your employees in ways that make them feel more responsible about their jobs, you will be inspiring something that is more significant  and has longer lasting impact.
The next time you conduct an employee performance review, evaluate each performance in two areas: success and significance. Lets say that sales is a performance category  and your employee has performed at 90% of plan. Thats good. After you discuss what is required to reach 100% of plan, measure the significance of the sales generated. For example, perhaps reaching 90% of plan generated enough revenue to hire five more people or contributed to a particular community outreach plan as a result of a local market push. You never know the significance of someones performance until you measure it and when you do, its an effective way to inspire even greater performance.
7. Ownership, not just accountability
Enforcing accountability is a key component to sustaining performance momentum. However, when you can give your employees ownership in the process of defining how accountability is enforced  you inspire trust and a desire to go above and beyond the call of duty.
Giving your employees ownership means that you have shared and entrust them with your authority. You are now allowing your employees to call the shots based on what they believe is in the best interest of the team and the organization. For example, create a special project and allow an employee to take ownership of it. Outline your expectations for the end-result but allow him or her to take charge of the project.
Agree to meet once-a-week and observe the change in attitude and desire to perform. Use the results and what you learned along the way about the employee as a means to customize your approach to best inspire that employees performance long-term.
8. Respect, not just recognition
Beyond appreciation and praise, show your respect and admiration for the work of your employees. While people want to know they are respected, you must establish the ground rules for how respect is earned.
There are too many recognition addicts in the workplace. In a world of fierce competition, we have come to believe we are our own best allies. We believe we must rely only on ourselves. We believe we can sell ourselves better than anyone else. But this attitude puts our long-term careers in danger.
Unfortunately, too many people want recognition because they forgot the significantly greater value of earning respect. Re-train your employees about the importance of respect and lead them in how to earn it. When they see the greater impact respect delivers, they will be inspired by your example.
9. Personal growth, not just responsibility
Historically, leaders have used increased responsibility to inspire performance. While this approach may still have merit, it is when a leader can help foster the professional growth and development of their employees that performance most flourishes. Leaders must take more time to mentor and / or guide their employees development and growth.
Encourage networking opportunities and performance development forums. If the budget gets cut,  put your money where your mouth is. For example, purchase copies of a book that you believe will help your employees advance and grow in their work. Or even a video or CD.
10. Trust, not just transparency
Ultimately, it is a relationship based on trust that inspires employees to perform. When you are mindful of managing and concurrently implementing points #1 - #9 this will certainly jump-start your ability to earn trust with your employees and inspire their performance. When you trust someone, you believe in them. People are inspired when they know that their leaders believe in their capabilities to deliver.

Water dwindles in Anuradhapura tanks
Water levels of tanks in the district continue to decline. The Nuwara Wewa, Tissa Wewa and Thuruwila Wewa are some of the affected reservoirs. They cater to a population of 300,000 in the Anuradhapura district, providing around 40,000 cubic metres of water per day.
Meanwhile, a tug-of-war continues between the Irrigation Department and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWDSB) of the North Central Province (NCP) on whether top priority should be given to drinking water or irrigation water.
An NCP NWDSB spokesman told the Daily News that the present water capacity of the Nuwara, Tissa and Thuruwila tanks, were only adequate to supply water for about 60 days; a pressing matter considering that nearly one million devotees are expected to visit Anuradhapura during the state Poson festival during the final week of June.
We have requested the Mahaweli Authority and the Mahaweli Water Management Committee, to provide 15,000 acre-feet of additional Mahaweli water to the aforementioned tanks in order to avoid any water crisis during the next three months, the spokesman said, adding that the Irrigation Department had decided to provide water from the said tanks for the 2018 Yala season activities that in turn, could jeopardise the supply of drinking water.
A senior irrigation engineer, referring to the issue, said farmers were instructed to commence the cultivation of lands by utilising the limited rainwater available without depending on tank water alone.
It was also learnt that it had been planned to cultivate 75,000 hectares of land with paddy during the upcoming Yala season in the Anuradhapura district, provided that there would be satisfactory rainfall.
