6.2 million on alert Sathyagraha campaign held in Matara
Lets make use of this most opportune moment at which the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party have formed a consensus government to finalize and adopt a new constitution for Sri Lanka as we do not know who will be elected as Executive President in the future, said Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera addressing all who participated in a silent protest to reaffirm public support for the intended reforms to the constitution.
The third of the Sathyagraha campaign named as 6.2 million on alert being carried out island wide was held opposite the Sacred Bo Tree in Matara last Friday (24th) evening. TNA Member of Parliament M. A. Sumanthiran, Ven. Dambara Amila Thera, Leader of the NSSP Wickremabahu Karunarathne together with members of the clergy and activists who supported National Movement for a Just Society attended the event.
By Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe being subject to cross examination by the Attorney General when he was summoned before the Commission appointed by His Excellency the President to investigate the Central Bank Bond issue this government of good governance has proved that no one is above the law. the Minister said.
Power should be devolved to an extent where every citizen can live amicably as one family and refer to Sri Lanka as our nation said Tamil National Alliance Member of Parliament M. A. Sumanthiran addressing those present in Sinhala. He related a story of a family comprising of three girls and boy who decided where they were to spend their school vacations. Every time a vote was taken the girls had the majority vote until such time that the boy was forced to revolt against the democratic process which in this instance was unfair.
Ven. Dambara Amila Thera said Former Minister N. M. Perera forecasted that the executive powers vested by the new constitution promulgated by the National Assembly in 1978 would someday have a disastrous effect on day to day life.
Leader of the NSSP Dr. Wickremabahu Karunarathne said that Member of Parliament M. A. Sumanthiran was in Matara to address the people of the South in their own language because he had trust in the present government. In the past, northern politicians who addressed the people of the South in Sinhala were assassinated by northern extremists. Sumanthiran has ignored this threat as this may be the last opportunity to adopt a new constitution, said the NSSP Leader.

Crop cultivation plan to suit soil in Apura
A program for lining up the farmers to cultivate crops adhering to the native of the soil in respective cultivation zones is being launched in Anuradhapura district.
Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Service Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa told Daily News that as a major component of this program, 43 soil testing laboratories are formed in each agrarian services development centre in the district at a cost of Rs. 12 million. It is launched on the instructions of Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake for supporting to hoist the recently declared national food crops cultivation battle meant for gaining food security and self-sufficiency in the country.
"At these soil testing units, the soil samples in each landscape in the particular agrarian services development division is tested and the data entered regularly in the food crops cultivation note book kept in the custody of the farmers. This process prevent the farmers from applying fertilizer and agro chemicals without any discipline cultivating food crops at their own choice thus making the soil unfertile and poisonous, The food crop varieties most suitable to cultivate in the season will be recommended according to the nature and the conduct of the soil, as soil is being tested mainly to ascertain the response or the reaction of the soil to water and the percentage of chemicals. This move is very important in the exercise for creating an entrepreneur farmer society", said Somawansa. He also said that 43 officers have been trained in the maintenance of soil labs at Gannoruwa Agriculture Department.
He said that it has been found that due to applying fertilizer and agro chemicals 10 fold more than what is actually required to the soil hoping to get extravagant harvest, the soil in the district in many parts have become unfertile and poisonous.
Hence the farmers themselves shall understand as to how to comfort the irritable soil to revive the lost fertility in it, and cultivate according to the guidelines through soil testing, the Assistant Commissioner pointed out. He said that 600 Agriculture Production and Research Assistants that are under the supervision of the Divisional Agrarian Officers coordinate the soil testing program.

Interim Order effective until December 6:
Gota's petition upheld: AG objects
The Court of Appeal (CA) yesterday upheld the petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, with an Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act.
The Interim Order will be effective until December 6.
The CA issued this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on a Magistrates court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
The Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by a two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The Court upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations. Additional Solicitor General Dilrukshi Dias Wickremasinghe stated that the Attorney General is expecting to file limited objections against the Interim Order.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
Rajapaksa maintained that the offences against the Public Property Act contains a provision in section 8(1) as amended where, upon the certification by a Police Officer that the value of the matter exceeds Rs. 25,000, it will not be competent for the magistrates court unless in exceptional circumstances to release such a person on bail after recording reasons.
Rajapaksa stated that one such method was to say that there was a criminal offence committed by Rajapaksa regarding monies belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Board (SLLRDC).
Rajapaksa stated that recently he was informed that he is to be arrested. He further said that originally the proceedings reflect a possible charge of money laundering. He stated that there is no offence whatever in respect of the said matter.
He states that the D.A Rajapaksa Foundation, a statutory body, entered into a contract with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Department for the construction of a monument at Madamulana in Weerakatiya. Rajapaksa states that there was no written contract.
He stated that, at all times the petitioner, the foundation and SLLRDC acted on the basis that there was a contract between the SLLRDC and the foundation and that the foundation would pay to the SLLRDC lawfully due for the construction of the monument.
He states that the monument was unveiled on or about November 6, 2014 though not complete because that was the death anniversary of the late D.A. Rajapakse.
The petitioner states that the government changed in January 2015 and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Board came under the Megalopolis Ministry, under Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka.
In August of 2015, the Foundation received a request for a part payment which the foundation paid. The petitioner pleads that thereafter he received a letter of demand. The petitioner states that the said Attorney, who sent the letter has on several occasions acted for and on behalf of the Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka.
The petitioner states that at no time has the foundation denied the liability to pay the money but has only queried the quantum. When the Petitioners statement was recorded by the FCID Petitioner requested for a government valuation to be obtained.
The Petitioner said the Government Valuer has in fact valued the construction at Rs. 33 million but the Foundation has not been provided a copy of the Government valuation. The Petitioner pleads that at all times the SLLRDC accepted the said monies as payments made in terms of the contract between the foundation and SLLRDC.
The Petitioner said he was informed upon the government valuation had been made known to the foundation; the foundation had on or about July 13, 2017 paid the balance sum of Rs. 33 million and thus paid SLLRDC the entire sum of government valuation.
Rajapaksa states that the foundation will be agreeable to have an arbitration to cause a fresh valuation of the construction if the SLLRDC is not agreeable to act upon the government valuation already obtained. The petitioner states he is aware that the Foundation would contest the action contemplated in the said letter of demand only to the extent of determining the actual value due.
Rajapaksa states that a court of competent jurisdiction will inquire into the said matter and will determine the cost of construction and the balance payment due which the Foundation will have to pay. The petitioner states that, in terms of the papers filed in the magistrate court, ex-facie there is no offence disclosed under and in terms of the imperative provisions of Offences Against Public Property Act.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Ali Sabry PC, counsel Sugath Caldera and Ruwantha Cooray under the instruction of counsel Sanath Wijewardane appeared for the petitioner.

Mulan: Disney casts Chinese actress Liu Yifei in lead role

Disney has picked Chinese actor Liu Yifei to play Mulan in an upcoming film, following accusations against Hollywood of 'whitewashing'.
The live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated movie will tell the tale of the famed Chinese heroine Hua Mulan.
Several Hollywood films have faced criticism in recent months for featuring white actors in Asian roles.
Thousands took part in an online campaign calling for an Asian actress to be cast as Mulan.
Recent films accused of whitewashing include the Hollywood remake of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell, which hadScarlett Johansson in the main role which was originally Japanese, and Chinese epic The Great Wallwhich starred Matt Damon as its lead character.
Liu, nicknamed "Fairy Sister" for her delicate looks and previous roles in fantasy dramas, is well-known as an actress, model and singer in China.
The 30-year-old is said to be fluent in English, having grown up partly in New York.The Hollywood Reporter saidshe was picked out of nearly 1,000 candidates for the film.
Mulan tells the story of the legend of warrior Hua Mulan who disguises herself as a man to fight in the army to spare her weak father from conscription.
Disney'sannouncement on its blog about Liu's castingwas met with delight on Twitter as well as on Sina Weibo, China's microblogging network.
Many online celebrated it as a win for diversity in Disney films.
Chinese-American actress Ming-Na Wen, who voiced Mulan in the original animated movie, also gave her stamp of approval.
Chinese netizens congratulated Liu, with many praising Disney's choice. "She completely fits the role," said one commenter, while another said: "Needs to know martial arts, can also speak English, has star quality - it definitely should be Liu Yifei."
The film has been under intense scrutiny since it was announced that Disney intended to remake Mulan as a live-action film.
An online petitioncalling for an Asian actress in the role attracted more than 100,000 signatures before it was shut on Thursday, claiming success in its campaign with Liu's casting.
Earlier this year, British actor Ed Skrein who was cast as an Asian character in the upcoming Hellboy rebootpulled out of the filmso that the role could be "cast appropriately". It thenwent to Korean-American actor Daniel Dae Kim.

The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) said it welcomes the enactment of a new constitution.
Acknowledging the valued importance of the 'Constitution' in the affairs our land, The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) wishes to place the following for consideration as a 'way forward' in this whole exercise.
Noting the varied amendments to the existing constitution in the past and given the plurality of our nation, the 'Council' believes that the present Constitution needs to be revised in order to permanently resolve the crisis that has divided our nation on lines of ethnicity, language, religion and regions.
The space created by the conclusion of violence and war that plagued and engulfed our blessed land for nearly three decades, needs to be constructively employed towards lasting solutions through a process of collaboration, cooperation and consensus as far as possible.
The 'Council' has always stood for a 'secular state', not meaning a 'non-religious entity', but recognizing the strong religious spirituality of our people which guides and girds the nation.
In terms of the place of 'religion', we have no issue in the retaining of the present status-quo in our Constitution, to the extent that all religious communities are assured of equality before the 'law' and their rights enshrined for the protection and progress of the respective religions.
We need to recognize that the 'proposed constitution' is still at consultative stage, open for dialogue and debate.
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) remains committed to be in dialogue with all religious leaders and other stake-holders in this whole process towards building a united and inclusive nation, the NCCSL said in a statement.

North Korea: US urges all nations to cut ties with Pyongyang
The US has urged "all nations" to cut diplomatic and trade ties with North Korea after the country's latest ballistic missile test.
Speaking at the UN Security Council, US envoy Nikki Haley said President Trump had asked his Chinese counterpart to cut off oil supplies to Pyongyang.
She said the US did not seek conflict but that North Korea's regime would be "utterly destroyed" if war broke out.
The warning came after Pyongyang tested its first missile in two months.
North Korea said the missile fired on Wednesday, which it said reached an altitude of about 4,475km (2,780 miles) - more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station - held a warhead capable of re-entering the earth's atmosphere.
The claim was not proven and experts have cast doubt on the country's ability to master such technology.
However North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un called the launch "impeccable" and a "breakthrough".
The test - one of several this year - has been condemned by the international community and the UN Security Council called an emergency meeting.
Haley warned that "continued acts of aggression" were only serving to further destabilise the region.
Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Pyongyang should stop its missile and nuclear tests but also called on Washington to cancel military exercises with South Korea planned for December as it would "inflame an already explosive situation".
China also suggested the North should stop the tests in return for a halt to US military exercises - a proposal Washington rejected in the past.
"We need China to do more," Haley said. "President Trump called President Xi this morning and told him that we've come to the point where China must cut off the oil for North Korea."
China is North Korea's biggest ally as well as most important trading partner and Pyongyang is thought to be dependent on China for much of its oil supplies.
Earlier on Wednesday, the White House said that Trump spoke to Xi Jinping by telephone, urging him to "use all available levers to convince North Korea to end its provocations and return to the path of denuclearisation".
Speaking in Missouri about tax reform, the US leader derided Kim, describing him as a "sick puppy" and "little rocket man".
Xi responded by telling Trump it was Beijing's "unswerving goal to maintain peace and stability in north-east Asia and denuclearise the Korean peninsula," Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
Experts say the height reached by the inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) indicates Washington could be within range, although North Korea is yet to prove it has reached its aim of miniaturising a nuclear warhead.
The Hwasong-15 missile, described as North Korea's "most powerful", was launched in darkness early on Wednesday.
It landed in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other missile the North had previously tested.

PPP UNIT UNVEILS NEW FORMULA
A senior government official discouraged investors from adopting ad-hoc ways in approaching line ministries to get their public private partnerships off the ground.
Finance and Mass Media Ministrys National Agency for Public Private Partnership (PPP) Chairman and acting CEO Thilan Wijesinghe said the main objective was to build institutional capacity so there was no uncertainty from the point of the investor and it would provide a transparent process for the investor and line ministry to follow.
Investors need to focus on the process. Once a credible process is established, it would be far easier to bring to bear PPP proposals, he said addressing a session of the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Conclave at the Kingsbury hotel yesterday.
The intension, Wijesinghe added was to provide a transparent framework, so these proposals could be channelled through a proper negotiated structure and process and not fall on the way side.
As PPPs become the new mantra of the government, he explained that the government was in the process of developing a robust project pipeline of PPPs for the next three to four years.
They were mainly looking at the real estate sector and transport in addition to power, housing and information technology.
The PPP unit according to Wijesinghe was staffed by individuals from the private sector, banking, finance and private equity in additional to capable lawyers with international experience to structure complex agreements.
The Conclave organised by the Colombo Chamber of Commerce, Indian Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Industry and Commerce of China exchanged knowledge and experience in investing in Sri Lanka and the opportunities available for foreign investors to invest in the country.

Strong winds, rains cause property damage
Gusty winds and over 100 mm rainfall from several areas in the Southern, Western Provinces and upcountry areas caused extensive damage to public property and obstructed traffic on several main roads and railwaylines, Disaster Management Centre (DMC) sources said.
DMC Assistant Director Pradeep Kodippili said property damage has been reported from the Galle, Matara, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts due to strong winds.
He requested the residents in the upcountry areas to stand vigilant if the rainfall gets heavier as there may be landslides.
Meteorology Department sources predicted more showers and strong winds over most parts of the island today as well.
The low pressure area in the vicinity of Sri Lanka has developed in to a depression and it is expected to develop further and move away from the island along the southern coast. Hence, heavy rains, strong winds and rough seas can be expected further in the deep and shallow sea areas around the island and heavy rains and strong winds (about 60) kmph over the island, Met. Department sources said.
Very heavy fall (above 150 mm) can be expected at some places in the Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Western Province.
Heavy rainfall (above 100 mm) can be expected at some places elsewhere.
There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers. The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity.
Meanwhile, the Galle Road from Ambalangoda onwards was temporarily closed last evening due to the road being blocked by falling trees. Train services too came to a temporarily halt on the Southern railway line and the upcountry railway line in the evening due to inclement weather.
Meanwhile, Ceylon Electricity Board sources said they had disconnected power to several areas in the Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Badulla and Colombo districts due to heavy winds and rain.
The Police had been instructed to be on high alert to assist the public if necessary, Government sources said.

Two lowest  points in  Deepikas  life
Deepika Padukone, who recently completed 10 years in Bollywood, has been at the receiving end of controversies surrounding her upcoming film Padmavati. The quintessential actress has kept her cool and expressed her concern over the grave state of affairs the films team has to deal with.
In a recent interview with Filmfare, the XXX: Return of Xander Cage opened up about the lowest points in her life. She was quoted saying, A broken relationship and depression. Those were the two very low points of my life.
Deepika even revealed how her family and friends helped her stay grounded and deal with her issues. Well, time and a lot of work on myself helped me overcome it. It came with an amazing support system, my friends and family. My friends and family keep me grounded.
They keep me rooted. They anchor me. Also, today my work is everything. My work is me. I have created it. I am responsible for my success and failure. No one else can take that away from me. Thats on what I have focussed all my energies and efforts. Its my baby.
Now that was surely an inspirational message from the actress who will soon be seen essaying the character of Rani Padmini in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Padmavati which also stars Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh. TNN
