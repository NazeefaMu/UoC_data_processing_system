Delimitation report
Discussions on draft with party representatives were denied
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said no one could point their fingers at him with regard to the delimitation report, and that as per Provincials Councils Act Section 3A, he was statutorily bound to table the report in Parliament within two weeks of receiving it.
Minister Musthapha said that taking into consideration the in adequate time provided by the committee to submit the views and concerns of political parties, he made a request to the committee chairman to provide an opportunity to discuss the draft delimitation report with party representatives prior to handing over the report.
But the chairman of the committee turned down my request, citing that there was no such provision in the Act for such a process, he said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry, he said that with the introduction of the Provincial Council Election (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017 to the electoral system, the definition of electorate had become one of the prime necessities to conduct the Provincial Council Election. In keeping with that requirement, a provision had been included in the Act itself, to appoint a delimitation committee comprising five members by the President.
Minister Musthapha added that in the event of failure to adopt the report by Parliament with a 2/3 majority, a committee appointed by the Speaker and headed by the Prime Minister, would look into the grievances of the public and party leaders pertaining to the report.
I would say that the parliamentary debate on this delimitation report was the only opportunity available for me to express my views and objections on this report, he said.
The minister added that without any acceptable and reasonable justification, the committee had overlooked the opportunity provided to it by the Act No. 17 of 2017, to create multi-member electorates to ensure representations of minority groups.
I was compelled to table this report in Parliament as required by the law, although neither my ministry or I was involved at any stage of its finalisation, the minister said.
However, at the debate, I had to fulfil my statutory obligation as a member of Parliament, by clearly expressing my objections to the report, he added.
Minister Musthapha said that the government was ready to conduct an election, adding that it was not an attempt to postpone it.

Enterprise Sri Lanka, Gamperaliya to create 100,000 entrepreneurs by 2020
The government hopes to create 100,000 entrepreneurs by 2020, with the launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka and the Gamperaliya accelerated rural development programmes.
Addressing a gathering at the BMICH, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera spoke on the theme of reviving the countrys ancient trading culture, Today we are here to revive those genetically inherent skills through Enterprise Sri Lanka.
Under Enterprise Sri Lanka, the government will be offering 15 loan schemes under the categories of; interest subsidy loan schemes,donor funded refinance loan schemes and financial and non-financial support programmes.They will address each section of business sector and society from agrarian based loans to women and youth. The government he said will take on the payment of a significant proportion of the loans, with Rs 15 billion already being allocated for such payments.
All state banks and branches he further explained would set up a special desk and relationship manager to handle Enterprise Sri Lanka loans.The Minister hoped that even private banks would soon join the venture.
The Gamperaliya programme in the meantime has had Rs 80 billion allocated for it and would work together with the Presidents Grama Shakthi programme. Each electorate is to be given Rs 50 million for the next two years for the development of water tanks, anicuts, green parks, to set up free-wifi, rehabilitate small religious places, village roads, to provide sanitary facilities to schools and to develop village schools.
Work will begin on July 1 in the Moneragala district with the building of toilets for 25,000 families who have no toilets in the district. Rs 500 million has been allocated for this.
Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister, Lakshman Kiriella who came out strongly against the banks said reports showed that most commercial banks had 50 percent of their loans given to people who had mortgaged their gold, Only 10 percent had been given as agrarian loans. So the banks are basically making profit out of the interest from gold loans, he said.
We have to ask ourselves, are banks actually serving their intended purposes Are they saving the people from loan sharks I dont think so. Banks need a new direction, he said.
He hoped that the newly appointed relationship managers would help serve the people better with the new loans and fulfill the original purpose of the bank.

My Dream Emirates Destination winners awarded
Emirates has given wings to the travel dream of a young Sri Lankan, presenting him with two return air tickets to a destination in Europe at the conclusion of a competition on Facebook.
Ramitha Bandara was the winner of the My Dream Emirates Destination competition conducted by the airline exclusively for fans in Sri Lanka for two weeks in July. The competition invited Sri Lankans to write, in 50 words or less, what their dream destinations are and why.
The competition was intended to generate wider awareness about the virtually unlimited travel options Emirates offers Sri Lankans by connecting the island to a global network of more than 155 destinations on six continents.
Venice, Paris and London were recurring favourites among those who participated, but the winners choice was Budapest, which is served by Emirates with a daily flight. Five others who participated in the My Dream Emirates Destination competition on Facebook received gifts of attractive Emirates-branded merchandise for their trouble.
Emirates commenced operations to Sri Lanka in April 1986.

President at 4th Asian Electoral Stakeholders Forum says
19th AMENDMENT HAS STRENGTHENED DEMOCRACY
President Maithipala Sirisena yesterday said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has strengthened the countrys democracy and the present government will stay to fulfill the mandate it received by ensuring democracy and holding free, fair, and independent elections.
The President was delivering the keynote speech at the inauguration of the 4th Asian Electoral Stakeholders Forum (AESF-IV) held yesterday at Hotel Galadari Colombo.
The present government has been able to lay the foundation to hold free and fair elections by changing the corrupt electoral process that prevailed in the country before January 8, 2015 through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, President Sirisena said.
Sri Lanka is a country with a strong democratic foundation and the present government has also strengthened the independence of the judiciary. A recent survey on independence of the judiciary shows that Sri Lanka is ranked amongst the highest among Asian countries, the President said.
During the past three years, the government had taken all possible measures to strengthen democracy and human rights in the country, President Sirisena said.
The President recalled that Parliament was weakened due to the excessive powers vested with the Executive Presidency under the 1978 Constitution.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution reduced those excessive powers enjoyed by previous Presidents of the country, the President said.
Though the 19th Amendment, we were able to bring back the Independent Commissions to secure the impartiality of public institutions.
The President said the lack of democracy and transparency of elections in most countries is the reason for holding this type of fora.

Agriculture losses Rs.18 bn annually: Experts
The annual losses incurred by Sri Lanka during cultivation, harvest and post-harvest amounted to Rs. 18 billion, research done by a team of Chinese specialists revealed.
Crop damage caused by animals, loss during harvesting, and neglect of crops due to lack of marketing facilities contributed to this colossal loss, according to the report submitted by the team appointed by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a Ministry release said.
The report also included recommendations made by the team to overcome this loss. The report said that 30 percent of the crops were damaged by wild animals and birds, which included monkeys, wild boar, porcupine, peacocks and elephants.
Another 30 percent crop loss was incurred due to post-harvest losses and drought conditions, resulting in only about 40 percent of crops being utilised for consumption.
The team told the Minister that losses could be overcome by utilising new technology, modern harvesting methods, and educating farmers about these techniques.
The Minister also thanked the Chinese team for submitting the report containing the recommendations.

The art of small things
Four old musketeers are lounged around outside the stores entrance. Their lightest vehicle  yes, it is the good old bicycle  is parked just alongside. So attentive to their pal in the middle, the quartet seems to share some misadventures of a bygone lifetime. And then it suddenly it is Fathija Mosque, one of the most sacred sites for Muslims in Bihac that comes to view. A few metres away it is the Sacred Heart Cathedral, the centre of Catholic worship in Sarajevo. Meandering between mosques and churches, you will be greeted by the vast swathes of striking space of a faraway land.
Bosnia to Sri Lanka is what Jaffna to Colombo. A conflict-ridden country striving for some kind of reconciliation is the painting that media has managed to offer on the country. Yet, the recent exhibition held in the Colombo Swimming Club opened doors to a different experience. The experience was almost surreal transporting the connoisseurs to a hitherto unearthed stratosphere.
Pune-based Prakash Bangs dreamlike captures of Bosnia and Herzegovina reached the Sri Lankan cultural circle thanks to Bosnia and Herzegovina Ambassador Dr Sabit Subasic and Honorary Consul for Sri Lanka Jitendra Warnakulasuriya who hosted the photography exhibition. Titled Splendours of Bosnia, the exhibition featured 19 odd photos by Bang.
A marketing strategist by profession, Bang has taken to photography as a hobby. The very hobby keeps him stimulated to explore the world inside out. His profession demands to him to be a constant globetrotter. The world is his physical space where his business exists and his passion prevails. His business feeds his camera to capture the world.
Prakash obtained an Honours Degree in physics and went on to study Master in Business Administration (Marketing). His relationship with science ended as he took over the business administration. Living in Pune about half the time, he is clueless where he would spend the rest. For the last 45 years, and counting, Prakash earned my bread by working as an advertising & marketing professional.
Photography was always a very serious hobby for me. It all started when my dad gifted me his Rolleiflex camera when I was 14. It was an expensive hobby then. Films, developing, printing and then keeping the fingers crossed with the hope that it all will turn out well! Now, in the digital era, things are becoming a bit cheaper and one can afford to experiment a lot. Landscapes and street photography is what I love the most, Prakash notes.
With a business on sound footing and his sons on the job, over the last decade or so Prakash began spending more time with his camera. Since he has been associated with the travel and tourism industry it presented him ample opportunity to travel around the world. Instead of returning home on weekends or hanging out in front of the TV, Prakash fell in love with this newfound hobby of exploring and shooting.
I consider myself lucky to have catalogued over 500 destinations across 65 countries and tagging over 13,000 relevant images.
Incidentally, Prakashs cousin Suhas Mantri, Consul for Bosnia & Herzegovina for Maharashtra and Goa, India, insisted that he takes on the responsibility of developing tourism from India to BiH. He had faith in Prakash. Suhas Mantri was confident that Prakashs experience and hobby should do the trick. Thats how it all started.
I made a trip to Bosnia to understand the country and take pictures. The trip was an eye-opener. The country had everything that a tourist would desire... beautiful landscapes, culture, architecture, history, cuisine and the warmth of people. Unfortunately, very people knew about Bosnia and its charms. I wanted to hold an exhibition and invite travellers and travel agents.
The first exhibition was held at Pune, India. It went off really well with thousands visiting the show. The next exhibition was held at Mumbai which also had excellent footfalls. It was then repeated in Kolkata (which also has a Hon. Consulate) with good results. Then it occurred to Dr Sabit Subasic, Ambassador for BiH that it would be prudent to hold exhibitions in Dhaka, Kathmandu and Colombo, Sri Lanka.
I take this opportunity to thank the Consulates in Dhaka, Kathmandu and Colombo for their whole-hearted support, without which these exhibitions would not have been possible. I do believe that these exhibitions will encourage tourists to visit Bosnia. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words... and an actual visit, much more!
Dr Sabit Subasic had one major objective in holding the exhibition. He had the intention to promote awareness about the importance of sustainability. Four years ago, Dr Subasic initiated the establishment of the Centre of Multi-Ethnic and Multi-Religious Tolerance and Understanding, an NGO which has a purpose to promote better relations and understanding among different ethnic and religious groups and societies in the Balkan region.

Belt and Road Initiative five years on - Vigorous progress underway
When the 2018 Smart China Expo opened in Chongqing last week, over 30 foreign politicians and high-ranking officials attended the event, working to extend bilateral cooperation in various fields in this critical city along the Belt and Road routes.
Uruguay in Latin America is one of the many countries that sought more cooperation opportunities at the event.
We are surprised to see that Uruguayan goods and services exported to China are becoming increasingly diversified and look forward to seeing this trend continue, said Rodolfo Nin Novoa, Foreign Minister of Uruguay, at a promotion event held on August 23 during the expo.
He proposed that China and Uruguay can strengthen cooperation in various fields, including infrastructure, animal husbandry, logistics, design, information and communication technology, company service, education, tourism and even football.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Uruguay. And just days ago, the two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Beijing.
According to Rodolfo Nin Novoa, China and Uruguay have maintained stable relations in the past 30 years, and all Uruguayan governments have recognized the strategic significance of China in the economic and social development of Uruguay.
He said that some Chongqing companies have set up shops in Uruguay, like Lifan Group, which assembles automobiles in San Jose, Uruguay.
Mou Gang, President of Lifan Group, said it is the only company in Uruguay that has its own plants for automobile assembly and engine building, which elevated the whole automobile industry of Uruguay.
According to him, the company exports motors and cars to over 120 countries and regions and ranks among the top three in the export volume of Chinas automobiles. In Uruguay, the Lifan 620 car model is a star among local taxis with its sales volume accounting for 23 percent of the total sales volume of taxis in the Uruguayan capital.
Due to the huge influence of Lifan, the locals can pronounce the Chinese phonetic alphabet li fan, and even use it as hello to greet others, Mou said.
Highlighting that Uruguay is an extraordinary logistics point for the BRI and an important and secure platform for Chinese companies to enter Latin American markets, the minister said he believes more Chinese companies will settle down in Uruguay.
Right now and in the future, Uruguay and China have endless potential to complement each others advantages, which will help to effectively upgrade bilateral ties, he added.
Rafael Pino-Pinto, governor of Panama province in Panama, was also present at the expo, as a representative of a friendly city of Chongqing.
China and Panama established diplomatic relations in June last year. Five months later, during Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelas visit to China, Panama and China signed a memorandum to jointly promote the BRI.
With a friendly cities agreement signed during the expo, Rafael Pino-Pinto said in a round table meeting that he expects more cooperation and exchanges between the two sides in intelligence, trade, culture and other areas.
The BRI connects the world and every country and every person can achieve economic benefits from the initiative, the governor said.
He introduced the advantages of his country, saying that the Republic of Panama connects Central America and Caribbean countries, allowing a country with only 400,000 people to open up to a market with 600 million people. He also said that China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal.
For bilateral cooperation, he said China can learn about logistics from Panama, and that since artificial intelligence research in Panama just started, there are many things that Panama can learn from China in this field. He added that the expo came at exactly the right time, especially when the world is transforming from the information era to the intelligent era.
As the guest of honor of the expo, Singapore in Southeast Asia sent a delegation of over 40 companies to Chongqing, the largest ever delegation to China led by the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA), according to Tan Kiat How, CEO of IMDA, at a press release event held on August 22.
At the event, Singaporean and Chongqing companies signed a number of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), covering products and services supported by blockchain, cloud technology and intelligent logistics.
This is another firm step for the cooperation between the two sides, Tan said, adding that the expo is another excellent chance for Chinese and Singaporean companies and even the whole South Asia, to reshape the ecosystem of information and communication technology.
China is now the largest e-commerce market in the world with over 40 per cent of global transaction volume in this field and one of the dominant forces across the world in the digital economy. Meanwhile, Singapore is a global centre for scientific and technological innovation.
Citing these statistics, Tan highlighted that companies across the world can see that Singapore and Chongqing have lots of room for cooperation, and Singaporean companies can draw on precious experience from companies in China and the world.
Tan also expressed his expectations for enhancing partnership between Singaporean companies and Chinese ones at the event to further carry forward the third inter connectivity project between Chinese and Singaporean governments.
The project was officially announced during the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Singapore in November 2015.
On January 8, 2016, Chinas South Western City of Chongqing became the operation centre of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity to pilot cooperation in fields ranging from financial services, aviation, transportation and logistics to information communications technology.
According to Li Qian, Deputy Secretary General of the Chongqing Municipal Government, over the past three years, the two sides have made various explorations in these four areas and expanded their cooperation under this project into other fields like education and tourism.
Years later, the two sides have signed 118 cooperative projects involving a total of US$21.4 billion in trade and investment. With the joint efforts of the two sides, nearly 60 innovative policies have been implemented so far, he added.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 41:
Benchmarking, an essential element for entrepreneurial survival
How does your business compare to the competition Are you more or less efficient Do you have higher costs
These are important questions because they are directly linked to how profitable your company is and how healthy it will be over the long term. But surprisingly few entrepreneurs have the answers.
The solution is to measure your performance in key areas and benchmark it against other companies in your industry. Benchmarking is a simple and effective way to get a snapshot of how youre doing in terms of productivity, cost control and other areas. Once you know where your business stands, you can start improving and reaping the benefits on the bottom line.
Benchmarking involves choosing performance measures you can use to compare yourself against other companies. Some will be specific to your industry. For example, a restaurant might track revenues per table. A warehousing business could follow costs per square foot.
Other measures are more general, such as sales per employee or productivity per hour worked.
Benchmarking is a starting point
Benchmarking also has other benefits. It may help to show potential gains if the entrepreneurs were to invest in operational improvements. Benchmarking isnt an end in itself: Its a starting point to target processes or activities that dont add value for your company.
The entrepreneurs are advised to use benchmarking data to carefully assess their operations and identify wasted efforts. Examples can include idle machines, overproduction, unnecessary operations or work, excess inventory, inefficient workspace layout and inadequate employee training.
Not a one-shot exercise
The general pattern is that you get used to doing things in a certain way and its not easy to see activities that dont add value. Thats why benchmarking is so important. Its also not just a one-shot exercise. Businesses should regularly review their performance data and adopt a continuous improvement culture.
The relevant tools help keep you on track. What you need to do is to regularly look at the indicators and think about how you can improve. If you do it with a sense of commitment. It will lead to a cultural change in our company.
Earn profits
The main aim of a business is to earn profits. Thus, a company has to attract and retain those customers who are profitable. This is known as profitability analysis or customer profitability analysis (CPA). In simple terms  An analysis of cost and revenue of the firm which determines whether or not the firm is profiting is known as profitability analysis.
The age-old 20-80 marketing principle (or the Pareto principle) says that 80% of the profits arrive from 20% of customers. This principle recently received a modification. According to modification the principle can be modified as 20-80-30, wherein 80% of the profits come from 20% of the customers and 30% of this profit is spent in managing the unprofitable customers!
It is not necessary that the top 20% will contribute 80% profits because they too have a cost consideration. A lot of the profits are spent in giving service to the top 20%. Furthermore, the top 20% also receive the most discounts.
The smaller customers on the other hand do not require too much service, they do not get much discounts and they pay in full.
Thus, we find out that both the repeat customers and one-time customers are equally important for a company. That is why saturated industries generally go after new customer acquisition rather than just concentrating on existing customers.
That is also the reason why industrial product manufacturers generally stick with their small customer group rather than going all out for new customer acquisition.
Now the question crops up - what makes a profitable customer A profitable customer is a person, or company that over time yields a revenue stream that exceeds by an acceptable amount the companys cost stream of attracting, selling, and servicing that customer.
Profitability analysis
Profitability analysis mainly has a focus on four criteria:
* Customer profitability analysis (CPA)  Which calculates revenue coming from customers less all costs
* Customer product profitability analysis  This equation helps calculate the profitability per product and per customer.
* Increasing company profitability (ICP)  which increases the competitive advantage of a company
* Implementing Total Quality Management (TQM) which increases the total quality
Let us analyse these criteria in detail
Customer Profitability analysis (CPA)
CPA is based on activity-based-costing and helps in calculating the revenue coming from customers while at the same time removing all costs from it thereby calculating the actual profitability per customer. The CPA is a very important tool for profitability analysis and is frequently used.
Customer product profitability analysis (CPPA)
Some companies have a wide variety of product portfolio. So what would be their benefit per customer per product To calculate this, the CPPA can be used. This profitability analysis method can be used to find out both  profitable customer as well as profitable products.
Increasing company profitability(ICP)
Companies dont need to produce products with high value itself, but also products which are competitive in the market because of their pricing. Cost leadership is one of the leading sustainable competitive advantages a company can have. Thus a company has to take care of its cost which will subsequently bring its profitability. Furthermore, any advantage the firm has, should be seen as a customer advantage. Developing on customer advantages will result in increasing the overall company profitability.
Total Quality Management (TQM)
Profitability of the firm also depends on its ability to continuously improve its products and processes. TQM involves everyone and the concept believes that with involvement of the top management, the workforce, suppliers and even customers, the overall output of the firm can be increased and thus the firm will always meet customers expectations thereby thoroughly satisfying them and therefore increasing the overall profitability of the firm.
Thus, profitability analysis leads to the company discovering the areas where it is profitable and where it is not. It can help the company decide where it can lower the cost and where it can increase value. As we said in the beginning, the motive of a business is to earn profits and profitability analysis helps the firm achieve the same aim
Efficiency control
If the profitability analysis reveals that the company is earning poor profits in connection with certain products, territories or markets, the question is whether there are more efficient ways to manage the sales force, advertising, sales promotion and distribution in connection with these poor performing entities.
Most important out of those four factors, is the Sales force efficiency. A good sales force structure is adaptive, efficient, and effective. If the sales force structure is adaptive, the company can react quickly to product and market changes without a major structural over haul. A structure is viewed as adaptive if a selling process change resulting from product or market fluctuations can be accommodated within the existing sales force structure.
The money a company invests in its sales force is used to employ sales people and managers who generate calls and interact face to face with customers and prospects. The sales calls are directed at a marketplace, and the marketplace responds to the calls by buying the products and services of the firm. Efficiency reflects the rate at which the sales force converts its money investment into calls.
A highly efficient sales force has a high level of call activity for its investment. Effectiveness represents the buyers response to the calling level of the selling organization. A highly effective sales force has high impact per call; it generates high levels of sales for the call investment.
A sales force structure could be geographic or specialized.
Companies using the geographic structure assign their salespeople to sales territories made up of a list of accounts or a group of contiguous geographic units. Each salesperson sells the companys entire product line to all of the accounts and prospects in his or her territory. The salesperson is responsible for all selling activity in his territory.
Specialized structures
The geographic structure may not be suitable for certain companies. Market, product, and activity heterogeneity and complexity provide an answer
Some companys market typically has many participants. Some are customers; others are prospects. Some are large; others are small. It is unrealistic to expect them all to be similar. In fact, most markets are heterogeneous; the participants have different needs and requirements. Some customers are price-sensitive, while others desire customization. Some need immediate delivery; others need ninety-day dating. Some need vast amounts of information, while others just want expeditious order processing using the Internet.
Some provide high sales and profit opportunity, while others provide marginal opportunity, perhaps not even enough to pay for the sales force effort. The non-uniformity of customer needs requires a sales force structure designed to accommodate heterogeneity.
In addition to being heterogeneous, some markets are very complicated. They may have many buyers with different needs. For example, when Boeing Company talks to a probable customer for selling a modern aircraft, they have to deal with several influencers.
The financial people need low-cost financing; the operations people need easy maintenance, high reliability, and interchangeable parts; the marketing people want comfortable seating. Airline needs are also highly technical, requiring state of the art engineering. Like Boeing, many products can be highly complex as well.
Salespeople in some industries, such as medical imaging and specialty chemicals, require six- to eighteen-month training programs before they can represent their products effectively.

Biebers Despacito remix sets Guinness World Record
Justin Bieber has broken his own Guinness World Record as his Despacito (Remix) with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee has become the most-streamed song across the globe.
The revamped version of the catchy Latin tune, which featured Justin singing a few lines in Spanish for the first time, has been streamed almost five billion times since its release in April, 2017, surpassing the 4.3 billion hits Bieber had previously earned for his 2015 hit Sorry.
The news earns the collaborators a mention in the upcoming 2019 Guinness World Records book, documenting records set by May, 2018, but they arent the only pop stars to feature.
Ed Sheerans Shape of You single has been named the best-selling digital track to date, shifting 26 million units worldwide, and the most-streamed track on Spotify, with more than 1.65 billion listens, while his third studio release,  (Divide), has been declared the biggest-selling album across the globe.
There was recognition for Eds pal Taylor Swift, too - her Look What You Made Me Do promo has gone down in history as the most-watched music video in a 24-hour period after racking up 43 million views online last year (17), and rockers Maroon 5 now boast the most-viewed group music channel on YouTube with more than nine billion video views.
Meanwhile, Guinness World Record officials are also keeping watch on social media - Selena Gomez is noted as having the most followers on Instagram with over 120 million, and One Direction, who are currently on hiatus, still hold the title for most Instagram followers for a music group, with 17.2 million.
Katy Perry is the first Twitter user to reach 100 million followers, and dance star David Guetta has the most micro-blogging fans for a DJ with 22.2 million.
And K-pop stars BTS have reason to celebrate as well - they beat One Directions Harry Styles to score the highest tally of average retweets, earning on average more than 300,000 reposts, compared to the Sign of the Times hitmakers 147,000 on the same date, according to Guinness World Record officials.

Born to run
A dog dubbed the "Usain Bolt of pugs" was crowned the fastest of her breed after running a 50-meter race in just six seconds.
Emma is a four year old pup who just loves to zoom. She was one of 60 dogs who competed in the International Pug Race, held in Berlin on August 18, where pups and their owners from around the world gathered to celebrate the speediest pugs. Emma completed the 50 meter dash in less than six seconds, making her the clear winner.
Pugs arent generally famed for their athletic abilities, being bred neither as working dogs nor watchdogs. Theyve got adorably chunky, loaf-like little bods and short, stubby legs  not to mention the squashy face and (less cute) breathing problems which can accompany it.
Most pugs wont be invited to the doggy Olympics anytime soon and the average speed of a pug (depending on age and health) is between three and five miles per hour.
However, Emmas need for speed set her apart from the other contestants. Although some pugs struggled to compete the 50 meters in under 40 seconds and others got adorably distracted and ran the wrong way, Emma flew across the finishing line.
Her little eyes were aflame with the impending glory of winning first place and with unadulterated love for the pure act of zooming.
Her time meant that she was running at an approximate speed of 18.6 miles per hour, well above the average for ordinary puggos.
This was the ninth annual International Pug Meeting, and it remains to be seen whether Emma will defend her title for the fourth year running in 2019.

Capitalising on Colombos health
Following a global trend to be more healthy, Colombos clothing and food industries are capitalising on a calorie conscious and fitness frenzied elite. Health food restaurants and stores have popped up around the city, along with scores of air conditioned gyms, which allow their members to sweat comfortably. ODEL, Sri Lankas premiere department store, is no exception.
This year ODEL launched its first Fitness Week: a promotional feature offering 20 percent discounts on all sports items, 10 percent discounts on wellness teas, and integrating some healthful options into the promenade food court.
On Thursday, ODEL succeeded in promoting healthy ideas about fitness during a scintillating discussion, in the companys words, on the importance of fitness, well-being and looking good, all of which are the cornerstones of ODELs ethos. A number of interesting panellists were chosen, including Johann Peiris, a Sri Lankan who climbed Mount Everest, a nutritionist named Ronali from RAW, Omalka Guneratne, a burgeoning rugby star, and former international supermodel Jackie Mae.
A discussion on health
Johann Pederis discussed two of the most important elements of fitness while explaining his workout regime, as he prepared to scale Everest, The whole journey was a long term plan, fitness wise and planning wise. There was a five year process that we had to go through, and the most important thing about it was-we had to remain consistent. Youve got to be committed be committed at what you do. I couldnt make excuses, there was no one to push me to be fit or keep fit. I think youve got to be consistent, and youve got to commit yourself to it.
In addition to that, Pederis said that making the commitment to be fit, Its a mental transformation that you need most of all. And then of course, like I said earlier, you need to be committed to it. Everybody cant follow the same routine. You have to do whats right for you and what you suits you.
It was refreshing to hear people at the event discuss the importance of making fitness work for the individual. Pederis sentiment was echoed several times by different panelists.
For example, Romali, the RAW nutritionist, offered a number of different healthful snacks someone could eat depending on how long it was before they worked out: If youre looking at starting your fitness regime in 30 to 45 minutes, before you should have a banana. If you are starting your fitness regime in one and a half to two hours, before have a protein smoothie with raw eggs, or overnight oats with fruit.
Romali also analysed the well-known adage, You are what you eat, saying, I think you are what you eat is actually quite accurate. She expanded it to, You are what you eat, so dont be fast, easy, cheap, or fake. Make sure that you dont put fast food into your body. Make sure that its not fake food, and make sure that its quality food. The longer the shelf-life the shorter your life. The fresher it is, obviously organic plays a big role as well. I have seen it in my life how it has affected me.
The rising rugby star, Omalka Guneratne, talked about balance in his health regime.
I balance everything, he said, I balance my training sessions, while maintaining a clean diet. So, you must focus on your diet, and you must make sure you get the right nutrition intake. When it comes to vitamins and supplements, you must make sure that you consume the right intake, not too much, or not too less. Basically, rugby evolves everyday, so we must evolve with it. You have to keep out fast food and carbonated drinks.
Along with balance and maintaining a healthy diet, Guneratne offered some general advice: Make sure that you are hitting the gym. Make sure that your trainer is giving you cardio and strength training both. Make sure that you research about [a nutrition plan], because its good for your own health.
Some of the speakers, like beauty guru, Ramini Fernando, talked about the intersection of beauty and health, visiting a salon in relation to looking good or working out and fitnessI think they are one and the same. Salons may seem quite cosmetic, [while] working out is for your body and your mind and your well-being, but both are important for a good life. Regular exercise is one of the key factors to great skin, to healthy skin. So I feel that by exercising your blood circulation increases, your stress levels are controlled. most of your skin problems are due to stress, acne, eczema, even hair fall. Apart from the exterior benefits of exercise that Fernando mentioned, she also discussed the psychological benefits. Everything, you could manage, if you have a good exercise regime, she said. Fernando also offered an important perspective that, Its never too late to start working out. I started working out in my early 50s I think. After I started working out, Im a different person now. I think exercise helps overall.
Model, Jackie Mae agreed with Fernando, saying, When youre working out, it builds your confidence, it clears your head, it boosts your immune system. It does everything for you. And working out for Mae is a addictive, she said, Once you start you dont want to stop, because you feel good, you look good, your heads clear the best thing is to be fit, eat good food, sleep well, have a good clear head, and if you cant do that-go to the gym and work it out.
One of the healthiest perspectives on fitness came from Dhanu, the Sri Lankan media personality, who talked about his experience losing and gaining weight, I used to be not what I am right now. I used to not fit into a door. Then I got this inspiration to become a model and I lost a lot of weight. Before I started going to the gym I was missing seeing my toes. And when you dont see your toes, you dont see a lot of other things as well, and I was like, bloody hell.
Dhanu said he went through periods of losing and gaining weight, a refreshing admission amongst the polished personalities on the panel. He said that most recently, he lost an astonishing eight and a half kilograms in five weeks, while doing high octane training. My motivation every time, said Dhanu, is to get into a clothing. Im so glad that ODEL is doing this. This has pushed me.
Dhanu also mentioned the concept of having a cheat meal.
Being fit, you have to have a treat day for yourself, said Dhanu. If you want to be a child, be a child. But that is your cheat meal, you deserve it. Its all about balancing.
The reason for having fitness week, said a spokesperson for ODEL, is that fitness is virtually a lifestyle today. [It] is no longer the prerogative of the young, but people of all ages have embraced the lifestyle of being fit.
Desiree Karunaratne, Group Director Marketing, Softlogic Holdings PLC expanded this point, saying, This has been something that weve been wanting to do at ODEL for quite sometime. We realised the importance of really looking at fitness for something as important as it is.
Karunaratna talked about ODELs mission to, Create more awareness of fitness, and why one should stay fit. If this fitness week goes well, she said, I hope that we are able to make it an annual event.

Court re-issues arrest warrant against Jaliya Wickramasuriya
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday re-issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, neither the suspect nor the sureties of the suspect were present in Court.
At a previous occasion the Court was informed through the defence counsel that Jaliya Wickramasuriya has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before due date. Defence counsel said his client is still receiving treatments at a hospital in USA.
Accordingly, the Magistrate yesterday re-issued warrants for the arrest of two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya for their failure to appear before court.
The Magistrate announced that the court would issue an appropriate order regarding the issue that sureties would be liable for confiscation of bail amount since they failed to appear in court.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan Embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for October 3.

Cyrus tackles anxiety and depression battle on new album
Noah Cyrus is opening up about her battle with depression and anxiety on her new album. Miley Cyrus little sister released the project earlier this month and now explains she wanted to get candid about her struggles to help fans who are suffering from the same issues.
This EP is mostly just about how my emotions have been, and about my anxiety, and about how Ive been struggling with depression, and how its OK to feel those feelings, she tells LOfficiel USA magazine.
A lot of people like to judge you, and make fun of you on the Internet, and people make you feel crazy whenever youre in a depression or having anxiety or having a panic attack. Its (album tracks) about that and being sad and having your emotions and not being able to ignore the feelings youre having.
Earlier this year, Billy Ray Cyrus daughter revealed she initially didnt want to go into the family business, because she suffered from self-esteem problems as a child - as trolls and critics picked on her online due to her sisters fame.
I would have been 12 when I started on Instagram, and then people were just so terrible and there was just so much cyberbullying going on, she told Britains NME magazine in February. The words that they thought were OK to say to a 12-year-old girl made me think, OK, this is alarming.
At the time, I thought that all my validation comes from social media, she added. As a 12-year-old girl, I thought that I was only pretty if the people on social media told me that I was pretty - and they werent telling me I was pretty. So, I didnt think I was pretty and I was really down on myself and I really was sad with myself. Music News

Dial to stop drug dealing, a success
In just five days since the launch of a comprehensive anti-narcotics drive in the Western Province with the opening of three drug reporting hotlines for the first time, 189 calls were received, out of which 48 resulted in heroin hauls.
The response has been remarkable. We are confident this initiative, which involves the community, will go a long way in ensuring that theres a free flow of information on crimes and criminals, said Deputy Inspector General of Police for the Western Province (North), Deshabandu Tennakoon. By highlighting the gravity of the situation, this project has overcome two key elements which inhibit community involvement: fear and apathy.
Based on the information collated, 189 calls have been received by the three toll-free drug reporting hotlines for Kelaniya, Gampaha and Negombo. Two teams comprising 24 officers have been appointed to work round the clock specifically for the task. The police also count on the support of over 10,468 grassroots-level communities, which were set up for the massive anti-narcotics drive.
Other calls have led to raids on kassipu (moonshine) and even cannabis, both locally grown CSL and the Kerala variety. The majority of the calls on drugs are to do with heroin, an official overseeing the project told the Daily News. We have received the most number of calls from Gampaha, which has seen increased detections during the last few weeks, followed by Kelaniya and Negombo.
Informers, mostly men, had initially showed reluctance to pass on information with some of them asking for the numbers of higher-ups in the police to report incidents directly. In some instances, while people were forthcoming, they werent specific about the whereabouts of these criminals. However, each complaint was investigated and followed up.
The purpose of the recently launched pilot project is to provide people with a safe and confidential means to pass on information on drug dealing. Using the toll-free numbers,, members of the public can anonymously report drug-dealing activity. It was revealed that nearly 75 percent of crimes committed in the Western Province were drug related.
Officials also told the Daily News that the hotline staff received several calls from individuals threatening them with dire consequences if they did not halt the project. We have every reason to believe that we may be on to something and we will not stop with just this month or the next, this will be a continuous programme, said DIG Tennakoon. He spoke of plans to incentivise the project by rewarding informers and securing a greater participation from the rural committees in spreading awareness.
Speaking at an event in Divulapitiya which saw the launch of the initiative, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara said that it was evident that drug abuse was connected to most crimes in the country, ranging from robbery to terrorism. The enforcement of the law alone is insufficient to curb the menace, he said, adding that the support or citizens was vital in executing a successful programme. He noted that 492 police divisions and 14,068 community police committees in 14,022 grama seva divisions were actively working on the fight against drugs.
Meanwhile DIG of the Police Narcotic Range DIG Sajeewa Medawatte, speaking to the Daily News, said that the police were actively working on several fronts which include prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and finally, rehabilitation. Speaking at the event last week, he cited an incident at a leading Colombo school, where a parent was doling out nearly Rs.30 000 weekly to feed the childs drug addiction.
Director of the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB), SSP T.C.A. Dhanapala, speaking to the Daily News,said that the frequency of detections has increased over the last few weeks, with the most number of detection being in Gampaha, Kelaniya and Nugegoda.
We have found Peliyagoda to be a high-risk area, where most of the detections have been of heroin. There seem to be more users there and the proximity to the harbour and container yards seem to be making this a lucrative area, he said.
SSP Dhanapala referred to a move by the Education Ministry to clamp down on drug abuse among schoolchildren, where the PNB renders its support. There was a circular by the Education Secretary calling for the setting up of school-level committees for drug abuse awareness, he said. All provincial directors have been asked to set up the committee starting this week, which will also include a member of the police as well as public health inspectors.
The committees, which will be headed by principals or deputy principals, have been tasked with a multitude of programmes aimed at creating awareness among schoolchildren. Over the last few weeks, there have been several arrests and detections where young adults were found to be using substances such as ICE (methamphetamine) and tablets like Tramadol.

Diyawara Neyo Stage II, III in the works
Referring to Diyawara Neyo and other development projects being implemented by the Irrigation Department, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake told the Daily News that Diyawara Neyos second and the third stages would be implemented soon in the Padaviya and Inginimitiya schemes.
The project would cover 75 major irrigation schemes in the country.
Sediment disposal at the Rajanagaya tank and renovation of its distribution canal systems, farmer-training programmes, bank loan facilities, crop insurance and road repairs were executed with the assistance of Rajangane farmers, while the Irrigation Department provided the necessary funds and machinery.
The minister said that until the execution of Diyawara Neyo programme, no apprehensive or systematic work related to the Rajangane scheme had been implemented, leaving issues concerning water-management, cultivation, income-generation, and training unattended.
He added that nearly 25,000 farmer families lived in the Rajangane scheme, while 25 lands came under the left and south banks.
Speaking on irrigation promotion ventures, Minister Dissanayake said that World Bank loans had been planned to be used to prevent floods.
Studies regarding the construction of side walls, as well as other precautionary steps for flood-control at 11 rivers, had been completed. Such projects were being planned for the Gin, Mahaweli, Kelani, Kalu, and Nilwala rivers, as well as the Ma, Atthanagalu, Deduru, and Mundeni Aru oyas. The minister said that 40 major and 40 medium-scale tanks each, were to be renovated and a sum of Rs.500 million had been provided for the purpose.
He said that special attention was drawn to the eradication of invasive aquatic plants spreading in water sources, covering an area of 750,000 acres, adding that a species of insect would also be introduced to destroy such plants.

Dramatic new bridal hair trend
It's no secret that a bride wants to look her best on her big day. A wedding day is one of the most important days of a person's life, and because of this all eyes will be on the happy couple - so they will want to get all dolled up and stand out from the crowd.
To ensure they are wowing guests, some brides are now taking drastic action during their wedding day to remain the centre of attention. And it involves changing up their hair halfway through the wedding.
A new bridal trend is emerging, which sees the bride start the day with long, luscious locks that flow down her back and end it with a much shorter style.
According to Refinery29, various women are now choosing to get their hair cut on their wedding day, during the small amount of time between the wedding ceremony and the reception.
It must be done quickly as according to traditional wedding etiquette , it is considered rude for a bride to be away from the celebrations for longer than 15 minutes.
One brave bride, named Kayla, opted to chop off her long blonde hair at her wedding into a long bob - right after the best man's speech and just before her first dance.
Her sister AJ Palace, a trained hairdresser dry cut her hair in about 10 minutes in a small back room, allowing Kayla to make a second grand entrance - and even her husband Griffin didn't know what was going on.
As she headed out for the first dance, AJ said her new brother-in-law was shocked by his wife's transformation, but "loved it so much".
AJ also noted that the change in her appearance gave Kayla a "new energy" and made her sister much more confident.
She added, "More than half my brides cut off their hair immediately after their wedding. If you're planning on cutting your hair after the wedding - why not just do it at the wedding, and make it the coolest second-look reveal"

Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative receives overwhelming response
Sri Lankan governments most ambitious, Rs. 60 billion Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative, an ideal platform to create an enabling environment with fair and equal opportunities for the budding local entrepreneurs to contribute to the countrys development has received an overwhelming response from aspiring entrepreneurs across the country since its launch in last month.
Having understood the need of a new breed of young entrepreneurs, the government has put in place the necessary financial framework to support them by introducing16 concessionary loans which include11 interest subsidy loan schemes, three refinancing loan schemes inclusive of two financial and non-financial schemes.

Plenty of ideas for budding entrepreneurs
The program has been implemented by the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media in association with the state and private sector banks, foreign financial institutions and the other participatory institutes.
The primary objective of the project is to create a minimum of 100,000 entrepreneurs by 2020 through these concessional loan schemes. The especial feature of the project is that the government has focused on empowering female entrepreneurs by providing additional incentives and with that, the government expects a transformational change in the economy in years ahead.
Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera recently said that as per the governments 2025 Vision plan, the government believes that engaging with aspiring entrepreneurs to provide better access to market information, necessary skills and a conducive environment for new enterprises is the best way forward to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.
Our responsibility is to identify the persons who have entrepreneurial skills, support them in developing their entrepreneurial skills thus providing them with the ability to positively contribute towards the economy. The Enterprise Sri Lanka program is all about that, the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera also said that the government has already allocated a sum of Rs 5.25 billion to this end.
Meanwhile, Senior Deputy General Manager (Business Banking) at Peoples Bank Rasitha Gunawardana said that Peoples bank has given Rs 3.5 billion in funding for 2,000 selected applicants since last year.
Another 500 selected applications are pending for loan approval. The bank is active in 12 loan schemes at the moment. Gunawardana said.
This particular project was introduced in last year budget. Soon after the budget, we started this loan scheme. By this time, we have worked on this for almost one year. The government thought the banking sector progress its own is not satisfactory. So, the government wanted to give proper publicity to this project by launching it in July, this year.
The bank has already established a separate window for Enterprise Sri Lanka program at its all the branches across the country and is handled by an employee who has the knowledge of the loan system. Gunawardana said.
The government believes that the private sector is the engine of the growth and entrepreneurship skills are critical to create the jobs of the future, he said.
The basic idea is to give a helping hand to up and coming entrepreneurs by providing necessary funding for their projects. The government recently came up with the idea that 60 % of our funding should be given to new entrepreneurs while only 40 should be given to established entrepreneurs in the country for their enhancement.
In the meantime, National Savings Bank sources told Daily News Business that it has received 11,000 loan applications under the Sonduru Piyasa loan scheme, of which 11,000 applications, the bank has given over Rs 275 million in funding for 1,400 applicants so far.
In addition, it has received close to 100 loan applications so far for Rivi Bala Savi loan scheme.
The bank is currently conducting a series of programs to create awareness among the general public on the Enterprise Sri Lanka program particularly in Ratnapura, Galle, Kandy, Kurunagala, Jaffna, Matara and Hambantota and etc.
Regional Development Bank (RDB), another partnering bank of the project said that its Ran Aswenna loan scheme has received the highest number of applications, followed by Govi Nawoda scheme.
Accordingly, RDB has disbursed over Rs 810 million in funding under Ran Aswenna and Rs 77 million for 200 selected applicants under Govi Nawoda program so far.
Furthermore, RDB is currently looking at the possibility of introducing Arambuma, Riya Shakthi and Maadya Aruna loan schemes in the near future.
To take the message of Enterprise Sri Lanka program, particularly to the rural masses, RDB has established a separate window at its all the branches, across the country.
State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne speaking on Enterprise Sri Lanka program said that total entrepreneurs accounts for mere 2% or 230,000 of the working population in Sri Lanka where as total entrepreneurs in Thailand and China accounts for 20% and 7.5% respectively, in comparison to their total population.
Entrepreneurship is in our DNA. Its a well known fact that we had such a strong entrepreneurship culture in Sri Lanka. During the pre and post colonial period, Sri Lankas had maintained robust global trade and entrepreneurial engagement with the rest of the world. But it is really disappointing that things have changed drastically due to various circumstances.
He said, We believe that development activities should not be implemented on the pretext of achieving petty political mileage. The development has no colour or party politics.

Esala perahera carries message of our unique values - President
Every country possesses items unique to its culture. The Kandy Esala Pageant is one such item which carries the message about our cultural system, virtues of discipline, customs and traditions to future generations, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing the gathering after receiving the Sannasa bearing the successful conclusion of the Kandy Esala Perahera, from Diyawadane Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela, at Presidents House in Kandy, on Sunday.
Earlier the Diyawadane Nilame accompanied by the Basnayake Nilames of the Four Main Devalayas and Pitisara Devalayas came in procession to hand over the Sannasa to the President.
The President said that history recorded that the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Meghavanna. Ever since, it has remained as our highest and lasting object of reverence. The Kandy Esala Pageant is held in keeping with customs and traditions bequeathed to us from the time of the ancient kings.
More than being a mere spectacle, the Kandy Esala Pageant portrayed a moral and spiritual background. The large number of elephants, drummers, dancers and other artistes participating in it gave an important message to the world, in addition to dedication and competence. The pageant also encompassed several sectors, including religious and cultural sectors. Buddhism was the greatest and most valuable gift we could give to the outside world, President Sirisena said.
He said a massive historic religious and cultural festival of this nature could not be planned single-handed. A large number of people had made dedicated efforts to make it a success under the patronage and guidance of the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters and the Mahanayake Theras of the three Nikayas.
President Sirisena, who said that it was the fourth time since 2015 that he was attending the perahera, said he personally felt that this years perahera was more organised and colourful than the three previous peraheras he attended.
The President said on behalf the government and the people, he wished to thank one and all who assisted to make this years perahera a success.
The President said this year, they were able to rehabilitate the Ranviyana of the Sri Dalada Maligawa for the second time and offer it to the Sacred Tooth Relic. He wished to thank the State Engineering Corporation and all others who helped to accomplish that task.
During the last four years, they had been able to gift the baby elephant Pulathisi Raja donated by the government of Myanmar to the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
The President said when he was handing over awards to the perahera artistes this year, he received one complaint. The complaint was that certain sections of the pehahera did not receive justice and fairplay in making the awards.
Therefore the Government Agent, Divisional Secretary and the Diyawadana Nilame should pay attention to it and try to rectify shortcomings, if there were any. The government on its part was committed to helping this event in every possible way, President Sirisena said.

From Estimation to Evaluation
Present development projects in Sri Lanka begin from an estimation, which looks at a project from a financial perspective. However, the global development commences with a systematic and impartial evaluation. In the fields of politics, administration, and social studies across the globe evaluation gets vital importance. I believe Sri Lanka should be heading in this direction. As Parliamentarians are joining the evaluation community of Sri Lanka, and we are committed to bringing evaluation as a policy to Sri Lankan economics to promote good governance and accountability.
The process of evaluation analyses a project providing credible information, improving transparency and accountability. This will give all involved persons a full picture of a project's risks and rewards helping them make calculated decisions throughout the process of the project.
Through the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation (SLPFE), we are working hard to standardise the use of evaluation processes throughout development activities in Sri Lankan economy. There are about 16 members of Parliament backbenchers, we came forward voluntarily to bring the policy on evaluation. Starting from the district level, we have trained government officials in twelve districts who are in decision making positions, and hope to extend further in the future.
We also propose an all-party member parliamentary committee on evaluation to participate in evaluating the development proposals before projects initiate rather than its completion as a postmortem.
We hope the EvalColombo2018, global event for Parliamentarians will bring more ideas on evaluation to Sri Lanka. We will move forward from the estimation to evaluation, and it is going to be a revolution for sure.

Exports earnings from merchandise up to US$ 1.02 bn in June
Sri Lankas external sector displayed a mixed performance in June 2018. Even though the lowest trade deficit so far during the year in absolute terms was recorded in the month of June, the trade deficit widened significantly in comparison to June 2017 as the growth in import expenditure outpaced the increase in export earnings.
Exports earnings from merchandise exports surpassed US dollars 1 billion for the second time during the year to US dollars 1,024 million in June 2018, mainly driven by industrial exports.
Earnings from tourism increased notably in June 2018 continuing the growth momentum observed since the beginning of the year, although workers remittances declined during the month in comparison to June 2017.
The financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) was supported by the fifth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF-EFF) and the third tranche of the divestiture of the Hambantota Port, however, outflows of foreign investment from the government securities market and the secondary market of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) exerted some pressure on the BOP. Reflecting developments in the domestic and global foreign exchange markets, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 3.4 per cent against the US dollar by end June 2018 and by 5.0 per cent during the year up to 27 August 2018. The countrys gross official reserves as at end June 2018 were US dollars 9.3 billion.
The deficit in the trade account continued to expand in June 2018 in comparison to June 2017, driven by the higher growth in imports. On a cumulative basis, the trade deficit expanded significantly during the first half of 2018 in comparison to the first half of 2017.
Under industrial exports, earnings from textiles and garment exports increased significantly due to the higher demand from the EU and the USA while exports to non - traditional markets also increased.
Export earnings from petroleum products increased significantly in June 2018 due to the combined effect of higher export prices
and volumes of bunker and aviation fuel. Export earnings from rubber products increased mainly due to higher earnings from tyre exports.
Earnings from exports of machinery and mechanical appliances.
Also increased notably during the month owing to the increase in earnings from electrical machinery and equipment and electronic equipment exports.
Mean while, export of base metals and articles increased due to higher exports of iron and steel articles and aluminium articles. However, earnings from transport equipment exports declined significantly mainly due to the effect of higher earnings recorded in June 2017 following the export of two ships.
In addition, food, beverages and tobacco and leather, travel goods and footwear exports also declined notably in June 2018. In comparison to June 2017. Meanwhile, earnings from agricultural exports declined in June 2018 due to the poor performance in almost all categories except seafood,
unmanufactured tobacco and rubber exports. Export earnings from tea declined as both prices and volumes exported reduced in June 2018 . In addition, export earnings from spices declined marginally in June 2018 as the growth in cinnamon and nutmeg and mace was outperformed by the decline in pepper, cloves and other spices.
However, benefiting from the positive impact of the removal
of the ban on fisheries exports to the EU and the restoration of GSP+ facility , earnings from seafood exports increased significantly during the month due to higher prices and volumes of seafood exported.
Leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka in June 2018 were the USA, the UK, India, Italy and Germany, which accounted for about 48 per cent of total exports.

FLORIDA SHOOTING
US: Three people were killed and 11 others wounded Sunday when a video game tournament competitor went on a shooting rampage before turning the gun on himself in the northern Florida city of Jacksonville, local police said.
Sheriff Mike Williams named the suspect of the shooting at a Madden 19 American football eSports tournament as 24-year-old David Katz from Baltimore, Maryland.
There were three deceased individuals at the scene, one of those being the suspect, who took his own life, Williams told reporters.
He said local fire and rescue transported nine victims -- seven of whom had gunshot wounds -- to local hospitals, while another two people who were shot took their own transportation to hospital.
Williams said Katz was a competitor in the eSports tournament and used at least one handgun to carry out the shooting.
Madden is a hugely popular multi-player video game based on the National Football League, which in a statement said it was shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific tragedy. The tournament at The Landing entertainment and shopping complex -- a regional qualifier for finals in Las Vegas with a $25,000 prize -- took place at the GLHF Game Bar.
Sheriff Williams said the shooting occurred inside the Chicago Pizza restaurant in the complex around 1:30 pm (1730 GMT).
Earlier on Twitter, the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office had urged people hiding in locked areas of The Landing to stay in place and call 911 to make their location known.
In disturbing footage apparently captured as part of a livestream on video gaming website Twitch, several gunshots could be heard in the background, before the stream disconnected.
Twitch removed the video, but it remained available on social media. Police said they were in possession of footage capturing the incident.
This is a horrible situation, and our deepest sympathies go out to all involved, Maddens creator, EA Sports, said in a statement.
CompLexity Gaming, one of the gaming teams, said its player Drini Gjoka was grazed on the hand.
Were obviously shocked and saddened by this afternoons events. Our player, Drini, was hit in the thumb but is going to be fine.
He managed to escape and run down the street to a nearby gym, director Jason Lake told AFP.
Gjoka tweeted: I will never take anything for granted ever again. Life can be cut short in a second. Another player, DubDotDUBBY, said a bullet had grazed his head.
I feel fine, just a scratch on my head. Traumatized and devastated, he tweeted.
Germany-based SK Gaming also confirmed their player known by the handle JoelCP_ was safe.
Our thoughts are with everyone that had to be part of such a horrendous event, it said.
The professional gamer known as oLARRY2K, of Bucks Gaming, was said to have been shot in the chest, according to several social media users, including one describing herself as his mother. Survivors of Februarys high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, expressed sorrow at news of another mass shooting in the state.
Once again, my heart hurts and all of me is so angry. We cannot accept this as our reality, said Delaney Tarr, one of the organizers of the student-led March for Our Lives movement.
Florida has suffered multiple shootings in recent years: 49 were killed in a June 2016 attack on a gay nightclub, while 17 were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School earlier this year.
Florida Senator Marco Rubio said that the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating Sundays shooting. Florida Governor Rick Scott said he had offered state support in the aftermath, and that President Donald Trump had offered any federal resources needed.  - AFP

## Title: Freedom of Expression under the Sri Lankan Constitution
## Supertitle:

Freedom of Expression under the Sri Lankan Constitution
Freedom of expression is one of the essential foundations of a civilized and truly democratic society. It is also one of the conditions essential for the development of the human personality. The freedom of expression serves four broad social purposes: (a). it helps an individual to attain self  fulfillment; (b) it assists in the discovery of truth; (c) its strengthen the capacity of an individual in participating in decision making and (d) it provides a mechanism by which it would be possible to establish a reasonable balance between stability and social change. Ideas and experiences may be communicated in many forms. These include dialogue, publication and distribution of written materials such as newspapers, leaflets, books, pictures and cartoons, instantaneous diffusion of the spoken word and visual image by the electronic media and also of art forms such as paintings, music, sculpture and the cinema.
Case Law
* The Denial of Equal Treatment or Political Discrimination as an Aspect of Freedom of Speech, Expression and Publication.
Among the cases that stand out in this respect, Sunanada Deshapriya v Municipal Council of N Eliya may be considered. In Sunanda Deshapriya, 450 copies of an opposition Newspaper- Yukthiya  were seized on the orders of a Mayor of a provincial city Nuwara Eliya. It was established that the seized newspaper was a fervent critic of the Government of Sri Lanka. The action was brought in for the violation of the freedom of speech, expression and publication. The Supreme Court allowed the action, and awarded damages which were ordered to be paid personally by the Lady Major of N Eliya. It was under her orders that the copies of the newspaper were seized.
Article 12 of the Constitution, to which the judgment refers, declares in its (2nd) paragraph, that No citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or anyone of such grounds. What the Court did in Sunanda Deshapriya was to forge a nexus between that sub-section and the freedom of expression Article. In doing so, the Court has expanded the ambit of the freedom of expression in Article 14(1)(a) to include denial of equal treatment or discrimination because of political opinion. There is therefore no reason why in another situation the Court cannot find discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex or place of birth amounting to a violation of freedom of speech, expression and publication.
* A violation of the Right to Legitimate Political Protect as an Aspect of a Violation of the Freedom of Speech and Express including Publication
Legitimate political protest may take several forms.
In Amaratunga v Sirimal, the Sri Lankan Freedom Party, then in the Opposition, organized a rather unusual political protest against the Premadasa government, on 1st July 1992. On that date, people who opposed the Government were called out to perform what was called in the vernacular a Jana Ghosha  a peoples vocal protest  by in concert with others causing terrible dim and dramming. The Respondents arrested the Petitioner. The Supreme Court held that the Respondents had violated the fundamental rights to speech, expression and publications, found in Article 14(1) (a) of the Constitution. Justice Mark Fernando observed:
Speech and expression extend to forms of expression other than oral or verbal placards, picketing, the wearing of black arm bands, the burning of draft cards, the display of flags, badges, banners or devices, the wearing of a jacket bearing a statement etc
* The Right to Organize, Hold and Conduct Meetings as an Aspect of the Freedom of Speech and Expression, including Publication.
The right to hold meetings has been linked to the set of three rights recognized in Article 14 (1)(a) of the Constitution. Namely, free speech, expression and the right to publish. In Joseph Perera v Attorney-General, the Petitioner and three others, who were members of the Revolutionary Communist League organised a meeting to discuss Popular Fronts and Free Education. Two days prior to the meeting a leaflet was issued pertaining to the meeting. In that leaflet the organisers accused the governing United National Party. The Police arrested the Petitioner and his principal organisers, stopped the meeting and dispersed those who had come to attend it. The Court held that the initial arrest was justified. The Court found that the further detention of the Petitioners was a violation of Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. Sharvananda CJ, wrote:
Freedom of speech and expression means the right to express ones convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, pictures or by any other mode. It includes the expressing of ones ideas through banners, posters, signs etc. It includes the freedom of discussion and dissemination of knowledge. It includes the freedom of the press and the Propagation of ideas; this freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation. The right of the people to hear is within the concept of freedom of speech. There must be untrammeled publication of news and views and of the opinions of political parties which are critical of the actions of the Government and expose its weaknesses. Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and widely open and that may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes sharp attacks on Government. Such debate is not calculated and does not brig the Government into hatred and contempt..
This passage of the learned Chief Justice has been quoted in subsequent decisions as the locus classicus when considering the thin line between legitimate criticism and legitimate concerted action against the policies of a government on the one hand and subversion on the other.
* The Right to Publish is inherent in the Freedom of Speech and Expression
Freedom of thought enshrined in Article 10 of the Constitution is meaningless unless there is the fullest support in the Constitution to the freedoms of speech and expression. These two freedoms, become a reality through the freedom to publish. These freedoms therefore are inter linked and do provide the underpinnings for the other freedoms that provide the origio et fons for a democratic society. In Re The Constitutionality of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Bill, the Petitioners raised the issue before the Supreme Court as to whether the Bill in its present form violated, among others, Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. The facts revealed that the government broadcaster was subject to a less strict standard of accountability than the private broadcaster. The Court held that there was a violation of the equality provisions of the Constitution and a violation of Article 14(1) (a), the freedom of publishing.
* Right to Receive Information as an Aspect of the Right to Free Speech, Expression and Publication.
The right to receive news is intertwined with the right of free speech, expression and publication. These together underpin education. In Wimal Frenando v the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, the Petitioner alleged that the government controlled Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation terminated its non-formal Education Program and by doing so the Corporation violated his fundamental rights to freedom of speech and expression. The program dealt with a wide range of subjects, namely: human rights, ethnicity, sociology, legal and medical issues. The Supreme Court unanimously held that his right to receive and impart his views, which the program provided was an aspect of his fundamental right to free speech, expression and publication and therefore its withdrawal constituted a violation of Article 14(1) (a) of the Constitution. The petitioner in Environmental Foundation Ltd v Urban Development Authority challenged the handing over of the management and control Galle Face Green, a 14 acre seaside promenade in Colombo, to E.A.P. Ltd. the request by the Petitioner to deliver to it copies of the Order vesting the Green in the UDA, lease agreement with the EAP group and approved plan was rejected by the UDA.
The Supreme Court held that although the freedom of information was not specifically guaranteed in the Constitution, for the freedom of speech and expression including publication to be meaningful and effective, it should carry within its scope and implicit right of a person to secure relevant information from a public authority in respect of a matter that should be in the public domain. The bare denial of access to official information amounted to a violation of petitioners right under article 14(1) (a).
* A Right to Vote at Elections as an Aspect of the Freedom of Expression
The right to vote is central to the whole process of government, and the Courts have interpreted the right to vote as an aspect of the freedom of expression which is a fundamental human right under the Constitution.
In Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna v AG and Five Others, the Supreme Court held among other grounds, that the provisions of the Provincial Councils Elections (Special Provisions) Bill violated Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the right to vote was an aspect of the right of free speech and of expression. Franchise was not limited to voting. It includes the right to stand for elections, and indeed the whole process stretching from the right to be nominated to the declaration of the person elected at the end of the process.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said the rural community will receive more money through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes.
These programmes will pave the way for strengthening the rural economy since villagers will receive more money through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes, he said.
The Prime Minister made these remarks at the inaugural ceremony to launch the Gamperaliya programme on the Madatta Tank bund at Nikaweratiya yesterday. In line with the inaugural programme, the renovation work of the Madatta tank will also commence under the patronage of the Prime Minister.
Bank loans under Enterprise Sri Lanka programme will be issued to beneficiaries in the Nikaweratiya area by the Peoples Bank and Bank of Ceylon branches that was opened by the Prime Minister in the Nikaweratiya town yesterday. He handed over loans to those who had applied for funds for their enterprises.
The Prime Minister said under the Gamperaliya programme, the rural community will be strengthened economically since rural community will undertake most of the development and infrastructure development activities in the area such as road construction, irrigation systems development and maintenance. The PM Wickremesinghe said that the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes are not limited to Nikaweratiya but will spread throughout the country and all rural communities will be benefitted. Every village will reap the dividends of this programme.
Through the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme, rural entrepreneurs can obtain loans from state banks to develop their enterprises. Anyone can obtain a loan to begin an enterprise or develop a existing business.
Transactions in the village will drastically go up when the rural community receives more money through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes. Besides, the rural economy will be strengthened by these programmes, the Prime Minister said.
He further added that unlike in the past, no one will be allowed to loot the resources of the village under the guise of development activities. He pointed out that certain businessmen lute the resources of tanks when they were renovated. But under the Gamperaliya programme, farmers society of the village will receive resources of the tank such as sand when renovating. It has been planned to bring new laws for this, the Prime Minister said.

Giant water lilies
In Tawains capital city Taipei, tourists and guests can head to the Shuangxi Park if they want an Insta-worthy pic of themselves floating on a giant water lily.
Taipei Citys Parks and Street Lights Office put on an annual event to promote this rare species and educate the public. Most impressive is the The Victoria Water Lily leaf which can take on a maximum of 65kg. Smaller adults and children can hop aboard and pose away.
To protect the plant surface from being damaged, visitors are required to sit on a plastic wrap and only have 60 seconds before they have to get off. Originally native to the tropical regions of South America, giant water lilies were introduced to Taiwan and are now cultivated in Tainan and Taoyuan.
Although they draw in crowds and are impressive to look at, they are difficult to grow. Pests and high temperatures make it hard to let them grow into full-sized plants.
Parks and City Lights Officer Lin Chao-Chin said, Currently, the challenge in maintaining the giant Victoria water lilies here at Shuangxi Park is that there are many snails and that we have to fight off pests, for example cutworms. This means that cutworms and snails will eat the plants. If we dont fight them, the leaves would be cut off while they are still small. There would be many tiny holes in the leaves, rendering them unable to grow.
Visitors have described sitting on the huge leaves as the same as being on a boat thats floating away. Now in its fourth year, the show is expected to become bigger and better.

In his address, McKinnon said, Our economic links have advanced considerably, and are now driven very much by the private sector. In nearly the year that I have been in this extraordinary country, I have seen the exciting opportunities that are emerging in Sri Lanka and the growing appetite of Canadian companies to do business here. We want to expand these links further, to the benefit of Canadians and Sri Lankans. Sri Lanka that is inclusive and open to the world, Sri Lanka that will be sustainably prosperous in a way that befits your human capital and other resources, including your favourable geographic position.
President of the Council, Jayasuriya expressed his view saying, Sri Lanka is yet to exploit its full potential to benefit from the growing economy of Canada. With the renewed development agenda between our two countries, council will have to play a pivotal role by lobbying our government to create an enabling environment to speed up Canadian Investors in Sri Lanka as well as create the required awareness of the market opportunities that exist for Sri Lankan firms. Understanding the demanding customers and adapting our products and services to exploit the opportunities, require a different mindset and your council will endeavour to facilitate this process to the best of our ability.

Health Minister denounces canard about bill
The bill issued by the Colombo South Teaching Hospital (Kalubowila Hospital) is only an indication to the public of the expenses borne by the government on their behalf and people do not need to pay any money towards it, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, some websites had distorted facts and reported this incident inaccurately in order to mislead the public. No money will be charged from any patient and the health service is completely free, as it was.
The system of issuing a bill (receipt) for the patients who obtain medical treatment from the Colombo South Teaching Hospital was introduced by a consultant of the same hospital to raise awareness among the public of the large amount of money spent on them by the government in order to offer them the free health service, the Minister said.
The system was launched by me during another ceremony held at the hospital. But some websites use their service to mislead the public. Everything should not be looked at through a political angle. Healthcare is a service to the people, the Minister added.

Income-tax scrutiny set to go electronic in India
Indian Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has mandated e-proceeding for all income-tax scrutiny in 2018-19.
It has also specified seven situations where e-proceeding will not be mandatory this year. These include search cases, cases where returns were filed in paper mode and the assessee does not have an e-filing account and geographical areas with limited bandwith.
E-proceeding refers to the communication of data and documents between the Income-Tax Department and assessees through electronic mode, and where the assessments are done electronically.
In 2015, the CBDT had undertaken  on a voluntary basis  a pilot project of email-based assessment in five metros. This was extended to two more in 2016.
With the latest CBDT instruction, assessees will be required to produce their response/evidence to any notice issued by the Assessing Officer electronically, through their accounts on the e-filing portal. The CBDT has also listed down four situations where personal hearing/attendance may take place, despite assessment proceedings being carried out electronically. Commenting on the CBDT move, Aseem Chawla, Managing Partner, ASC Legal, told BusinessLine it reaffirms the resolve of enhancing transparency in tax policy.
It is high time the legacy of uncertainty and element of unpredictability are done away with. The given directives are a step in the right direction, he said.
Amit Maheshwari, Partner at Ashok Maheshwary and Associates LLP, said this will substantially reduce the administrative work for tax professionals as well as the I-T Department. However, the success will depend on how glitch-free the e-assessment facility is, he added.
Greater transparency
Amit Agarwal, Partner, Nangia Advisors LLP, said the CBDT move will provide a significant boost to the transparency and objectivity of tax assessments. It is widely perceived that the conduct of e-proceedings could significantly reduce the arbitrary approach of tax officers in framing assessments, he added.
Manual selection
In another separate instruction to its field formations, the CBDT has come up with guidelines for manual selection of returns for complete scrutiny in 2018-19. The guidelines specify six parameters for manual selection.
The guidelines will address taxpayers apprehensions over the conversion of their limited scrutiny cases (issue-based scrutiny) to full scrutiny cases (comprehensive scrutiny), said Agarwal.
This assuages taxpayers fears about the handling of their assessments by overzealous tax officers, he added. (thehindubusinessline.com)

Indian rupee fall : no macro worry, was long overdue
Indias macroeconomic management is sound and there was no reason to worry
Former Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya has opined that rupee depreciation was long overdue, saying appreciated currency had hurt the countrys exports.
Panagariya further said Indias macroeconomic management is sound and there was no reason to worry. The main news recently in the macro story is depreciation of the rupee. But this had been long overdue. The real exchange rate has seen large appreciation in recent years and this has hurt our exports, he told PTI in an interview.
The rupee on August 16 slumped to a life-time low of 70.32 to the US dollar on strong demand for the greenback. The rupee on Friday staged a good recovery to end higher by 20 paise at 69.91 against the US currency. Panagariya who is currently a professor of economics at Columbia University further said, I am personally very pleased the RBI has used our foreign exchange reserves prudently in managing the exchange rate.
Replying to a question, the former Niti Aayog Vice Chairman said that he expects Indias growth rate to cross the 8 per cent mark by the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2018-19. I am confident that in less than ten years we will cross the UK, Germany and Japan to become the third largest economy in the world, he predicted.
On the possibilities of populist measures being announced by the Modi government ahead of 2019 general elections, Panagariya said that the risk is omnipresent but I do not see this happening. The government, he said, has more or less announced its revenue and expenditure trajectories. I also firmly believe that Prime Minister Modi worked hard to place the nations finances on a firm footing and he will not risk the nations future to gain a small political advantage on the margin, Panagariya insisted.
He also pointed out that FDI in India in 2017-18 has been slightly higher than in 2016-17 and 70 per cent higher than in 2013-14. Stating that inflation in July at 4.2 per cent was lower than 4.9 per cent in June, Panagariya said, In my view, inflation in the neighbourhood of 5 per cent for a rapidly growing developing country is about right since it allows relative prices to adjust and provide the necessary signals to investors.

Online players seek offline presence to expand business
Over a dozen brands that started off as pure-play e-commerce businesses have an offline presence now, opening brick-and-mortar outlets in a bid to chase profitability and build trust among consumers.
Online players such as Clovia, Craftsvilla, Pretty Secrets, Zivame, Urban Ladder, Nykaa, Myntra, Caratlane, Lenskart, Pepperfry, Creyate and Teabox have chalked out a strategy to focus on the offline channel by opening standalone stores or shop-in-shops (small touch-points at multi-brand retail shops). The strategy, the players feel, is paying off as the sales have improved significantly in the physical stores vis-a-vis online e-commerce websites.
Clovia, a lingerie brand that started off as an online player six years ago, started focusing on the offline mode last year after realizing that only 5 per cent of customers bought lingerie products online; the rest wanted to feel and try the product before buying. Besides, offline has helped pump up sales for Clovia by more than 15 per cent in the last one year. The company is also close to break-even, said Neha Kant, who founded Clovia along with Pankaj Vermani.
We opened our first store in August last year and in the third month, we had recovered all our costs, including rent. This gave us a lot of confidence to open more stores. Offline is still a very large market and cant be ignored, Kant said, adding that while online has helped create the brand, offline will help it grow.
More outlets coming
The company, which sells 5,00,000 units of lingerie a month, already has presence in 100 shop-in-shops and 25 standalone stores and each of these stores are profitable, Kant said. Clovia plans to be present in 150 more touch-points by end FY19 and open 15 more exclusive stores. The company is also looking at international markets having similarities with the Indian market. It has launched in Nepal and is planning to in Indonesia and Malaysia soon.
Similarly, Craftsvilla, which started as an online ethnic-wear marketplace, has also figured out that offline is an effective channel to grow the bottomline as it helps cut drastically two major costs  marketing and logistics . Craftsvilla, which also pivoted from a marketplace to a vertical player with focus on private labels recently, opened its first store in November last year.
From a break-even perspective, while it takes online companies forever to turn profitable, physical stores take 6-12 months to turn EBIDTA positive at the store level. Besides, compared to online, offline doesnt have to burn cash to acquire every incremental customer, said Manoj Gupta, founder of Craftsvila.
The offline strategy coupled with the high gross margins of over 50 per cent from private labels will help the company turn profitable next year, Gupta added. The company has 15 shop-in-shops, besides five company-owned stores which it plans to scale up to 25 in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Hyderabad by next year.
Another important aspect of offline is a deep customer connect, Gupta said, adding that while online is highly scalable, customers will shift their loyalty towards portals that give better discounts, which is not the case with offline.
Flipkarts fashion portal Myntra has also opened its physical stores for its private label Roadster besides planning to open stores for two of its other private labels  All About You and HRX  over the next year or two.
Myntra tried virtual reality to give its users the experience of touch and feel but that did not take off well. Experts feel that 90 per cent of the consumers shopping for apparels, accessories, shoes or furniture still prefer to buy after trying the products and hence the conversion is 50 per cent higher in offline vis-a-vis online.

POWER STRUGGLE BEHIND CORRIDORS OF POWER!
A live debate is vibrating within the corridors of power, to ascertain whether the former two Presidents are entitled to enter the next presidential race once again, for the third time.
It was the considered view till recently that the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who has served two terms earlier is NOT ELIGIBLE for contesting for the third term in accordance with the clauses of Article (30) of the present Constitution. In simple term, it says that No person who has been twice elected to the office of the President shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people.
However, the new position that the former two Presidents can make a presidential bid again, for the third time, has come up mainly due to a legal interpretation analyzed by Prof. G.L. Peiris who himself is a Professor of Law and also a Minister of Constitutional Affairs in the Chandrika Bandaranaike Government. Before making this statement, it is believed that Prof. G. L. Peiris and Joint Opposition stalwarts have even consulted some legal eagles on this issue. Professor of Law, G.L. Peiris is of the opinion that the said 19th Amendment, which came into the statute book under the present government, does not impose a bar for re-election on the former two Presidents who have completed two terms.
WHAT IS PROSPECTIVE
His argument is based on the fact that the 19th Amendment is prospective and NOT a Retrospective piece of legislation. It means, that the restrictions implied by the 19th Amendment cover only to the present incumbent of the office and to those to be elected thereafter. In fact, it was reported in the print media that John Seneviratne, formerly Labour Minister and Senior Attorney-at-Law, has also endorsed this view.
A law is said to be prospective (as opposed to retrospective) when it is applicable only to cases which shall arise after its enactment. Another shade of opinion, strengthening this argument says that a new law ought to be prospective and not retrospective in its operation. The meaning of the word perspective with reference to statues shows that it is concerned with or applying the laws in future or at least from the date of commencement of the statute.
WHAT IS RETROSPECTIVE
The word retrospective is derived from Latin retrospectare, it means looking back. In short, it is a look back at events that have taken place earlier or works that were produced in the past. The Oxford Dictionary of Law defines retrospective or retroactive legislation as legislation that operates on matters taking place before its enactment, e.g. by penalizing conduct that was lawful when it occurred.
This word is usually applied to those acts of the legislature, which are enacted to operate upon some subject, contract or crime which existed before the passage of new legislation. These laws are also coming under the definition EX PAST FACTO LAWS.
USA: In the United States of America, Congress is banned from passing or giving authority for ex past facto laws by clause 3 of Article 01, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. This prohibition is not restricted to the Congress alone; it has been extended to the states also.
This prohibition is endorsed in clause 1 of Article 1, Section-10. Thomas Jefferson condemned them as equally unjust in civil as in criminal matters.
Constitutional authorities in the United States and elsewhere hold the view that this is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution has made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the enactment of the 14th Amendment. The history of constitutional law in the US refers to several decided cases on this matter, giving several shades of opinion.
Further Article 25 of the American Declaration of the Rights & Duties of Man also says that No person may be deprived of his liberty except in the cases and according to the procedures established by pre-existing laws. THE RIGHT TO BE TRIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PRE-EXISTING LAWS IS REITERATED IN ARTICLE 26.
European Convention on Human Rights: For all practical purposes, almost all European States (Except Belarus), including European Union and European Economic Area States, are strictly bound by the European Convention on Human Rights.
United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom, the situation is different. Here, ex past facto laws are frowned upon but are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. When you go through the historical developments in the UK, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were ex post facto legislation. However, it is pointed out that this situation was rectified by the Act of Parliament (Commencement) Act of 1793.
The War Crimes Act of 1991, enacted an ex post facto jurisdiction over war crimes committed during the 2nd World War, due to public opinion. Another significant example of a case which highlights the doctrine of parliamentary superiority in action is Burmah Oil Company Ltd v Lord Advocate, which retrospectively amended the law on compensation resulting from scorched earth actions in Burma during the war. Here, in this particular instance, the War Damage Act of 1965, with retrospective effect surpassed the decision of the courts. Further, more recently the Police Detention and Bail Act of 2011 was brought forward to overrode a sensational court judgement, resulting from an error in the drafting of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984, that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions.
To validate another ex post facto law, the House of Commons gave consent to another act, known as the Criminal Justice Act of 2003. According to this piece of legislation people who have been acquitted earlier can be retried again if there is new, compelling, and substantial evidence to prove that the acquitted was guilty. However, there had been continuous criticisms against this piece of legislation. However, retrospective criminal laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory.
South Africa: Section 35(3) of the South African Bill of Rights Prohibits ex-post facto laws. Further, it also prohibits retroactive increases of criminal punishments.
Norway: Norway has also taken the same position. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution has affirmed this freedom.
India: Indian Constitution, has underlined the following principle through Article (20-1), although it has not used the expression-ex post facto.
Article 20-1 says that No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, NOR be subjected to a penalty greater than that which have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence.
Russia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Finland, France, Pakistan and several other countries have separated from applying ex post facto legislation.
The conclusion that we can derive from all these lessons and examples is that normally legislations are enacted for the future and not for the past.
However, as two shades of opinion have come up regarding this issue based on the above two definitions, the final determination can be given only by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, in the absence of a Constitutional Court in this country.

RCOM sells fiber assets to RJIO for INR 3000 crore
RCom plans to reduce its debt by INR 25000 crore or 60% by monetisation of its telco and spectrum assets.
Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications Limited (RCom) on Monday sold its fiber and related infrastructure assets to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJio) for INR 3,000 crore.
With the successful completion of the fiber monetisation transaction, 178,000 km of fiber stand transferred to RJio, said a company statement.
Last week, RCom sold its Media Convergence Nodes (MCNs) and related infrastructure assets, worth INR 2,000 crore, to Jio. On Friday, RCom secured the approval of its overseas bondholders to ease the companys debt burden, a move that will help the debt-laden firm avert bankruptcy.
RCom had defaulted on $300 million bonds last year and the vote was crucial for the telecom major as settling the matter was a precondition for the company to reorganise its larger local debt of more than INR 42,000 crore.
In February, the Reserve Bank of India mandated banks to identify projects with even a days default as stressed assets and conclude the resolution proceedings in 180 days. The circular came into effect on March 1 and the 180-day deadline concludes on August 27.
The company has to reach an agreement with all its creditors by August 27 or face insolvency proceedings.
It plans to reduce its debt by INR 25,000 crore or 60% by monetisation of its telco and spectrum assets. RCom shares on BSE were trading marginally down at 19.07 in a firm Mumbai market on Monday.

Officials in Rmeileh said the mankoushe, which weighed in at about 330 pounds, measured 144 feet long and about 20 inches wide.
The dish, a flatbread topped with olive oil and zaatar, a mixture of olive oil and pounded thyme, was found to exceed the previous Guinness World Record holder for largest mankoushe, which measured 105 feet long and was made in 2015 in the city of Choueifat, Lebanon.
The mankoushe was dressed with tomato, cucumbers and olives arranged in the shape of the Lebanese flag.
The record attempt was organized by the Mar Antonios NGO as part of Rmeileh's annual festival.

Religion to lead youth on right path: Ruwan
Youths ties with religion should be strengthened through Sunday Schools, to protect society from all immoral and illegal activities, as they are increasing at an alarming rate, State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said on Sunday. He was addressing a foundation stone-laying ceremony for the construction of a three-storeyed dharma shalawa at the Galagane Purana Viharasthanaya in Molagoda, Kegalle.
Today, more youths are getting addicted to drugs and engaging in other crimes, State Minister Wijewardene said, adding that the government, with assistance from the police, had taken measures to control the situation. The state minister said that the issue could be controlled if youth were to attend Sunday School at a young age, instead of going to tuition classes.
Sunday School is the place where a child is made a righteous and a virtuous citizen, State Minister Wijewarden said. Tuition classes would impart knowledge on children, but they are not enough to build a righteous and law-abiding society. He added that the Central Cultural Fund would provide Rs.500,000 for the construction of the building, while an additional sum of Rs.1 million would be provided for the Gamperaliya programme, under the direction of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Galagane Purana Viharasthanaya in Molagoda, is the temple where the 20x15 square-foot Hathara Korale flag which was offered by King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, was placed for protection.
Galagane Purana Viharasthanaya Chief Incumbent and Sabaragamuwa Palath Pradana Adikarana Sanganayake Ven. Hettimulle Siddaratha Thera presided over the ceremony. Kegalle District Parliamentarian Sandith Samarasinghe participated as well.

Sharp drop in coconut prices
Coconut prices had dropped recently, with a fruit being sold at Rs.25. A coconut was previously priced at Rs.65.
It had been a result of the excessive coconut kernel imports, Kurunegala Coconut Estates Owners Association President J.M. Jayasooriya said, adding that if it were to continue, the countrys coconut industry would collapse.
He was addressing a meeting of coconut planters held at the Bingiriya Youth Training Centre in Kurunegala, last Sunday. We appeal to top government authorities in the plantation sector, to take immediate measures to help coconut growers, he said.

Singing a different tune
Youre only given a little spark of madness. You mustnt lose it  Robin Williams
World dominance is their ambition, says Chathuranga Pitigala and Sasith Gamage. And who better to conquer the world than two talented scientists! Mad Scientist is the newest group to join the fray with their unique music. Melodies talks to Pitigala and Gamage on this new experiment in music!
Mad Scientist is actually a name that was coined by our band mates from Constellation. We thought it was a cool name and then it stuck. Right now it is just two of us, said Sasith Gamage.
Mad Scientist is a group that have an exciting array of music to offer. Their fans can expect something very different from the normal mainstream music. It is a totally new experience for the two band members as well. They feel the kind of music they have to offer can really put you in an excellent mood regardless of how your day has been.
Our prime genres are drum and bass and angry electronic music. We have plans to touch on Avante Garde metal as well, with glitch, drum and bass, break-beat and garage influences, stated Sasith Gamage.
Gamage stresses that they are the FIRST live drum and bass project from Sri Lanka. Mad Scientist are in their element performing live. They are in their territory when playing live! These two energetic musicians feed off the excitement and enjoyment of the crowd when playing live!
Its just two of us for starters in the group. We play the drums, bass patches and synths live, while effects, bass, guitars and certain synth elements are played via a backing track. Basically, 70 percent to 80 percent of what we play are performed live. Besides, we are the first live drum and bass project from Sri Lanka. We are a duo who are serious about the craft we make, and have fun at it the same time, explained Gamage
The artistes they love include artists such as Pendulum, Joe Ford, Icicle, Destroid, KJ Sawka, Excision, Igorr, and a ton of metal bands ranging from Progressive to Death and Black Metal.
Pitigala described the duo as two young guys ready to take on the world. They have set their sights on gaining the world. And they are going to do this by the power of their music but first they are going to take our island nation by storm!
Our ambition is Global Dominance. Where we will be in 10 years from now is a truly profound question, and truth be told we dont know! Where were hoping to see us would be touring the world as a renowned act. That would be great, explained Pitigala.
Both Pitigala and Gamage complement each other. Pitigala works hand in glove with Gamage. They understand and respect each other and the road has not been easy for the two of them. But right now they are doing what they both enjoy which is making music. They are answering their calling in life.
I always knew Sasith to be an extremely disciplined and capable musician, and I know he feels the same about me. Individually, however we have both gone through a lot of hardship to be able to do what we have to do. Being a musician in Sri Lanka isnt the easiest of passions, especially if it involves composing original music outside of the very saturated popular genres. It takes a lot of conviction, integrity and focus, pointed out Pitigala.
Their performances speak for themselves. They have been well received by their audience and this is very encouraging for these two young men. They have tasted their fame and now they just want to build on this. They have a bright future.
We use technology for the most part, and we also use backing tracks and metronomes to make sure that we provide a unique experience, said Pitigala.
Pitigala commented that they really want to grow as a band. They are just waiting for the right musicians to appear at the right time. They are positive when thinking about the growth of the band. Both he and Gamage are the pillars of the band and new blood will only take their dreams further.
Although Sasith and myself are the core at the moment, we are definitely very enthusiastic about collaborating with the right individuals, said Pitigala.
They love their fans as much as their fans love them. They will always be true to their fans never compromising on standard, originality and authenticity. Their fans are always in their thoughts and it is relationship that will sustain and strengthen both Pitigala and Gamage. They can achieve their dreams because they have the talent and the determination. Making music is sweet!
We want to say to our fans - be true to yourself, never give in to ignorance, and always strive for excellence. Wed also like to say we love you all very much, summed up Pitigala.

Swift breaks own record for highest-earning US tour by a woman
Taylor Swift has broken her own record for the highest-grossing US tour by a female artist. The Look What You Made Me Do singer has been trekking across the US and other nations since May on her epic Reputation Stadium Tour.
Her US gigs alone have now made an incredible $191.1 million (148 million), according to Billboard.com, meaning that with 11 American dates still to play she has surpassed the gross earnings of the previous record holder, her 1989 World Tour - which made $181.5 million (140.5 million) in 2015.
During the tour, she has averaged earnings of more than $7 million (5.4 million) per show - with all 27 of her completed dates sold out. The pop princess is having a brief break from the road after performing at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on August19.
After the gig, she praised hometown girl Camila Cabello - who has supported her alongside British singer-songwriter Charli XCX throughout the tour.
MIAMI I LOVE YOU!! You were so loud and FUN, she wrote on her Tumblr page. Shout out to Camila for killing it in her hometown and being just the greatest most precious magical human possible.
In addition to her US gigs, Taylor has also performed in the UK, Ireland and Canada, with the latter concerts having grossed $11.1 million (8.5 million). Figures for her British and Irish dates are yet to come in, and unlike in the US, not all of these shows sold out.
She will conclude the tour in Australia, New Zealand and Japan - meaning the worldwide takings from the Reputation Stadium Tour should easily surpass the $250 million (193 million) her 1989 live dates made globally - and may come close to beating the $408 million (316 million) Madonnas Sticky & Sweet Tour made in 2008 and 2009, the most earned globally by a female artist.

Brad Cooper, commander, Amphibious Force U.S. 7th Fleet. We are proud of the tremendous work that American Sailors and Marines are doing alongside their Sri Lankan teammates.
Capt. Dennis Jacko, commanding officer of Anchorage, said Sailors and Marines are focused on completing a successful mission and representing America in Sri Lanka.
These ship visits help demonstrate the value of the growing U.S.-Sri Lanka partnership, said Jacko. The goal with Anchorage is to not only enhance security cooperation, but to build understanding of the HADR (humanitarian assistance, disaster relief) capability that contributes to disaster response, along with sharing of best practices and enabling more efficient joint relief efforts in the event of a future disaster.
Approximately 300 Sri Lankan naval academy midshipmen and 40 distinguished visitors, will tour Anchorage to learn about the ships amphibious capabilities. Additionally, Sailors and Marines will conduct training in visit, board, search and seizure, security force reaction techniques with the Sri Lankan Navy and Marines.

Wanted new policies, new politics
Politics in Sri Lanka has become a degenerated, corrupt and anachronistic affair. Beyond the rhetoric there is no public good derived from it. Politicians are not interested in the existentialist problems of the people. They are embroiled in controversies over trivial matters and are both ignorant and uninterested in grave issues facing the country. That is why so far no major national policies are found on any subject of concern, be it education, health etc. They indulge in opulence and enjoy comforts at public expense.
Under the executive presidential system certain features of monarchial rule are also being preserved, nurtured and continued. Such perhaps are the Vap Manguls, Aluth Sahal Mangalayas etc. with the participation of the Head of State. Late President J R Jayewardene was particular in adding his name to the list of kings that ruled the country. He also wanted to continue the tradition of Kings of yore by addressing the nation from the octagon in the Temple of Tooth, Kandy. During the last regime also an attempt was made to revive this.
Personality cults
Success or failure in politics of the country has been attributed to leaders and the responsibility of the collective leadership is never recognized. Except in the case of Marxist-oriented parties, political party members often stand in a relation of subservience to the party leader. Personality cults of the principal leader is encouraged and fostered at public expense. His or her birthday is celebrated at State expense.
Seventy years after political independence we have been unable to forge a Sri Lankan identity. We have not only witnessed communal strife and war but are today being exposed to the danger of a possible escalation of religious tensions. National unity eludes us still. We have messed up ethnic relations that it has become easy for outside powers to interfere in our internal affairs. We have ourselves created the conditions for such interference and are now complaining of foreign conspiracies. For example, if not for the July 1983 pogrom against the Tamils, India would not have openly interfered in our internal affairs though the same could not be told about covert action.
We also went through periods of grave human rights violations and curtailment of democratic rights of the people. Law and order has broken down as a result. The situation still persists despite a few positive steps at the commencement of the Yahapalana Government. Independence of the judiciary has been not yet registered in the mass consciousness.
Administration is so inefficient and corrupt that it has to be written off as useless. Its weakness could be seen from such trivial matters as the failure to ensure a ticket for passengers travelling in privately owned omnibuses.
Our education is in a mess. Admitting children to Grade One has become a nightmare for parents. Class and racial bias exist in the state school system while private fee levying schools are mushrooming and functioning without any regulatory control. Pre-school education comprising the most delicate formative years of a child's upbringing is completely in the hands of incompetent and mercenary private interests.
Major political parties
Almost all major political parties follow the neo-liberal economic model which has been historically outdated and globally proved a failure. The tragedy is that the rulers are either ignorant or are so attached to its dogmas that they cannot see the reality. It is suffice to say that all countries that have advanced rapidly in Asia or elsewhere have been revising the neo-liberal prescriptions considerably. For example, they did not dismantle state economic enterprises en masse as per the IMF and World Bank prescriptions. China and Malaysia are two noteworthy examples.
The cumulative result of these economic policies have been that the rich got richer and the poor poorer. National income is getting concentrated in the hands of the top decile of the population at the expense of the lower five deciles. Malnutrition is prevalent especially among under five children and many are dying from curable diseases due to poverty.
Unplanned and often sporadic development has in turn given rise to a situation that has caused frequent natural disasters. Long-term disaster prevention measures are compromised for short-term ad hoc solutions with an eye on election prospects of ruling politicos.
Despite the claims of politicians the above policies proved to be anti-people, anti-poor. The ratio of direct to indirect taxes stand at 20 to 80. That means robbing the poor to feed the rich. The transfer of wealth not alleviates but increases disparities and inequity.
These policies should go. We need new policies which favour the poor, which help to alleviate poverty and reduce injustice.
Pro-people, pro-poor policies
The new policy should plan for immediate amelioration of rural poverty by invigorating the rural economy. At the present juncture in which the country is facing an acute economic crisis, it is the rural economy that has the potential of revival. Despite the uncertainty of the weather rice production this season is reported to be a bumper crop. Contribution of the agricultural production could also be enhanced by reducing post-harvest loses in storage and transport which amount to about 30 percent.
Finally it should be stressed that unless new political forces emerge and takeover, this new policy cannot be entrusted to the existing comedians on the political stage. It is the task of the civil society to forge new forces that could deliver the needed new pro-people, pro-poor policies.
