Govt.not decided to appoint SF as Tri-Forces operations Head
The Cabinet has not decided to appoint Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as the Head of operations of the Tri-Forces, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Premier also said that the Cabinet only discussed about the operation of Essential Services. He also said that he is bound by principle of collective responsibility on the matters at the cabinet. He added that he could only reveal the decisions reached at the Cabinet on April 25.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations in response to a question raised by JVP MP Vijitha Herath during the Questions Round from the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister also said that the Commander-in-Chief is the President by the Constitution.
Appointment of a person as the Head the operations of the Tri-Forces has to be done in accordance with the existing law the Premier said.
The Cabinet of Ministers asked the President and me to appoint a special top level committee to ensure the continuance of essential services in the face of any emergency. Now,further discussions are being continued with regard to the appointment of the committee. If there is a decision coming from these discussions to assign a role to Minister Fonseka in that committee, we could do so, the Prime Minister said.
MP Herath said that Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne stated at the Cabinet press briefing that the President proposed the name of Fonseka for the post of head of Tri-Forces operations. He also questioned if it was true to which the Premier said that he could not reveal who said what at the Cabinet meeting.
At this stage MP Herath said several other ministers had made contradictory statements on Minister Senaratnes statement. He questioned if prime minister was correct was Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne wrong. I cannot say so Premier said. Minister Rajitha is not in the country. Some media carry news distorting the statements.
The Premier also said that President Maithripala Sirisena on several occasions praised the talents of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. In 2010, we all thought that Fonseka would be suitable for that post, the Premier said. So both you and I got into the stage during a past Presidential election and asked people to vote for him. But,the campaign was not successful. Later, we selected Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate,the Prime Minister said.

Steering Committee Interim report proposals detrimental
Formulation of new Constitution:
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday that proposals in the Interim report of the Steering Committee for formulating a new Constitution is detrimental and is aimed at weakening the strength and power of the people and the country.
According to this interim report, Sri Lanka will be turned into a Federal states. We will raise awareness on this issue among Parliamentarians and also among the public and urge them to oppose a federal solution outlined in the interim report.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday,Weerawansa said there is a another attempt to weaken the structure of the Sri Lankan government through the Geneva resolution. There is an attempt to punish the Security Forces from the lower ranker to the Commander in Chief for defeating LTTE terrorists thorough this resolution.
"While that operation is going on, there will be another death trap of formulating a new Constitution. The interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly does not contain any benefited proposal for Sri Lanka and it
contains only harmful proposals,which if implemented would weaken Parliament," he said.
"Although at present, Provincial Councils can only formulate ordinance, these proposals will give them the ability to formulate laws. Sri Lanka with these proposals will become a federal stat in the future,Weerawansa added.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila said "We have always said that various attempts are being made from time to time to bring a federal Constitution.According to the draft proposals,the word unitary means one and not undivided or indivisible.It is not mentioned anywhere that the country can not be divided," he said.
"One of the clauses in these proposals suggested that the TNAs demand for a merger of the North and East should also be reconsidered, Gammanpila said.

The actor said the split with Jolie had been a "huge generator for change".
"I can't remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn't boozing or had a spliff, or something," he said.
"I'm really, really happy to be done with all of that. I mean I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family.
"But even this last year, you know - things I wasn't dealing with. I was boozing too much."
Pitt said he loved wine, adding "truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good."
The actor said he has now replaced alcohol with cranberry juice and fizzy water.
Regarding the divorce, Pitt said he and Jolie had decided to abandon the path of "vitriolic hatred" and work together to sort out their issues, adding they were committed to resolving matters amicably and privately.
Pitt also said he was finding solace in working creatively with his hands: "I'm making everything. I'm working with clay, plaster, rebar, wood."
Speaking more widely about his career, he said: "I don't really think of myself much as an actor anymore. It takes up so little of my year and my focus.
"Film feels like a cheap pass for me, as a way to get at those hard feelings. It doesn't work anymore, especially being a dad."

They had instead asked that the present Act be amended with unnecessary concessions removed.
The Cabinet this week also approved revisions to the Import Cess Levy which would be gazetted and presented to Parliament soon.
Amendments to the Nation Building Tax (NBT) Act No 9 of 2009 was also approved by the Cabinet in line with the 2017 Budget proposals. The Budget had removed the exemptions given to many items relevant to the NBT.

Cager legends  they were   Cosmas and Percy
Basketball admittedly is one of the fastest games on earth and enjoyed its best years in our country in the 1960s and 70s. Those were years when there was a hive of activity with several schools and clubs tipping it out for supremacy. It evoked tremendous interest and spectator participation.
Most schools and clubs played the game with zest. There were inter-school competitions followed by several club tournaments, foreign teams visiting here and the interest was at fever pitch with the schools and clubs churning out some top notch cagers who did proud to their schools and country and could have played in many Asian teams.
Two legends to emerge during that period were the " Perera Duo"--- COSMAS and PERCY. They were no relations, but dear friends who hunted together and helped their school St. Benedicts College, Kotahena to win many school tournaments and the Old Bens many club tournaments and dominate the game when they reigned supreme. Personal achievements  sub head Before going on reel out their personal achievements in the game, the writer who covered the game when it was at its best for the Times of Ceylon, cannot but pay tribute to another Legend--their coach--who made the duo reach the pinnacle: RAM SUNTHERALINGAM who joined the green, white and green school as teacher, bringing his expertise after being a top sportsman for Jaffna Central when sport in Jaffna was tops. SUNTHERALINGAM who sported national colours was quick to spot the natural and tremendous talent in the two Pereras. What he then did was to lick them into shape, by speaking situations to them and showing them the finer points in shooting and defending which they were quick to grab and this enabled them to go places in the school, club and national scene. They made waves with their high standard of play and were the envy of basketball players of that golden era. The duo were like beavers on the court.
They were full of energy and intensity and there was no letting up as they piled on the agony on their opponents. COSMAS was an all court player and PERCY was a dazzler with his bulls eye shooting especially from the right flank. Made it to the big league  sub head COSMAS after being deputy to another player who could have made it to the big league Vijaya Silva, was awarded the captaincy of the school team and he adorned it with great respect and dedication. He led by example and from the front with his stubborn defence, dazzling dribbling and shooting from whatever angle or position served notice of making it to the national team and also sporting the crown the dream of any sportsman  to lead the country.
He also did his school proud by being the first Benedictine to captain the national team in 1962 and led the country to the Asian Game in Bangkok. He was felicitated by the school for this achievement. In that era there was a team of basket ballers from America the home of basketball who called themselves PEACE CORP. They had some stunning players and one name I remember was a guy called Fennel. He was astounded with COSMAS' all court play that he predicted that had CoOSMAS been in the US he could have played for any team in the NBA. Great compliment indeed.
In 1957 was formed the Old Bens Basketball Club by two loyal Old Bens, that man for all seasons Premnath Moraes a man of many parts and J.E.Benedict a left arm leg spinner who played for the college in late 1940s. Playing in the first ever club tournament COSMAS led the club to win the Exter Shield and thereafter many trophies and shields adorned the club shelves.
PERCY  Asias Best Shooter
Playing alongside COSMAS and helping the school, the club and the country was PERCY PERERA. Pencil slim but he was a bundle of energy. He was like the will o the wisp here there and everywhere. But it was on the right flank that he excelled with his hook shots and sharp cutting in to plonk the baskets that had the opposing defenders helpless.
It was in the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1962 that PERCY reached his peak. Although Sri Lanka as a team did not make much of an impression, PERCY was a sensation. His shooting jolted not only the opposing players, but officials and spectators were held spellbound with his magical shooting and he brought pride and credit to the school, club and country when he was unanimously voted as the BEST SHOOTER IN ASIA.
That achievement was great considering that never before had a Sri Lankan ever got to basketballss Mount Everest. Pity that these two Benedictines, both record breakers COSMAS and PERCY have not been recognized or rewarded by the school that they performed for with great pride and distinction have gone unrecognized.After much urging by this writer, there was a tournament conducted in memory of PERCY by his old school. But considering his great feat one expected this tournament to be an annual affair.
But sadly it has not been so. PERCY passed away in Australia a few years back. When basketball was at its best  sub head Yes, it was in the 1960s and 70s that basketball was at its best. Men who made this possible were the first Minister of Sports V.A. Sugathadasa, James Sarangapany, the President of the national Federation. Both were Old Benedctines and soccerites of repute. Sugathadasa played for the school and one of his opponents was his Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake who sported Thomian colours. Sarangapany was of Saunders fame.
Also helping the game progress were Colonel Wilfred Saverimuttu and Cyril Ranatunge. Some of the Bens who played with COSMAS and PERCY were  Vijaya Silva, Milroy de Silva, Edward Sumanasekera, Shelton Pietersz, Herbert Senadhipathy, Winston Wijenaike to mention a few and other excellent exponents were C.Thurairaja, Jesudhasan, Rasalingam, Ponnambalam, Wilson, Royden de Silva, Maharoof, Daluwatte, Amaradasa, George, Randiligama and Wilson.
The PERERA Duo distinguished themselves in may ways on and off the court--they were superb players; exemplary in their behavior; they had winning genes and devout in their commitment to the game and to their old school--St. Benedict's College where they learnt how to play the game and be Gentlemen.

Capital agrees new charters for three ships
Greek shipping company Capital Product Partners L.P. has secured additional work for two of its 8,266 TEU ships, MV Archimidis and MV Agamemnon, as the company signed time charter extensions for the vessels with Singapore-based carrier Pacific International Lines (PIL).
Under the agreements, the 108,892 dwt containerships, which were built in 2006 and 2007, respectively, will for for PIL for an additional year at similar levels to their previous employment.
The new charters were agreed early in the first quarter of 2017 in direct continuation of the vessels present charters.
MV Archimidis commenced its new charter in April 2017 and the MV Agamemnon is expected to start the new charter in May 2017, according to Capital Product Partners.
Additionally, the companys 149,993 dwt crude oil tanker Amoureux has secured one year employment with Capital Maritime at a gross daily rate of USD 22,000. The new charter commenced in April 2017. The vessel was previously earning USD 29,000 gross per day under a two-year charter with Stena Bulk AB.
Capital Product Partners said that, as a result of the new charters, the companys charter coverage for 2017 and 2018 has increased to 85% and 50%, respectively.
The new contracts were unveiled as part of the companys financial report for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, in which Capital Product Partners informed that its net income for the quarter stood at USD 12.3 million compared with USD 12.1 million seen in the first quarter of 2016.
Total revenues for the first quarter of 2017 reached USD 60.3 million, representing an increase of 4% compared to USD 58 million reported in the same three-month period a year earlier. The increase in total revenues was primarily a result of the expansion of the companys fleet and the lower number of off-hire days during the first quarter of 2017, partly offset by the lower charter rates earned by certain vessels compared to the first quarter of 2016.
We are pleased to see another quarter with strong common unit distribution coverage after the quarterly allocation of USD 14.6 million to the capital reserve, which is intended to fully provide for the debt repayments coming due under our credit facilities (other than the 2015 credit facility) through the end of 2018, Jerry Kalogiratos, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Partnerships General Partner, said.
The Partnerships objective remains to further increase the long term distributable cash flow of the Partnership by pursuing additional accretive transactions going forward and by refinancing our debt, Kalogiratos said.

CB calls for flexible fuel pricing system
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has notified the government of the need to introduce a flexible fuel pricing system that would allow the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to increase fuel prices if the global market prices for petroleum rise, Deputy Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said.
Flexible fuel pricing is needed if global fuel prices go up. If that happens, the prices here should reflect those of the market so that the CPC does not make losses, the Deputy Governor said.
He did caution, however, that the government should not take any action right now.
Theres no need for the government to do anything about fuel pricing at the moment, since the CPC prices are below international prices. But if the international prices go up in the future, there needs to be a transparent fuel pricing formula to account for the cost increases, he said.
The CPC benefitted from falling fuel prices in 2016 and made Rs. 69.6 billion during the year. This was a nice rebound from a trying 2015 where the CPC lost Rs. 19.9 billion.

Certain politicians trying to sabotage any SLFP, JO rapprochement: Amaraweera
I tried my best to unite the SLFP and the Joint Opposition (JO) with the blessings of President Sirisena, but a few cocky politicians are trying to sabotaged it, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the SLFP wants to win the 2020 election and would be wonderful if the two groups join and work together. Discussions were held even at 2.00 am but a few who are having links to certain politicians sabotaged it. "But,it now seems that the SLFP can win the 2020 election on its own. It was amply proved after this year's May Day rally. I myself brought 6,442 persons to the SLFP May Day rally from the Hambantota district. Every year I obtain a list of names of participants and send a letter thanking each and every participant thanking them for taking part in the rally. But, I did not take them to the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens nor did I provide them with liquor as stated on Facebook. This was done with the intention of slinging mud at me,"he said.
"We did not remove any of the SLFP organizers who worked hard for the SLFP. We just appointed new organizers to organize the SLFP. We had to do so because some of them were busy with organising their electorates. Eventhough President Sirisena has the power, he did not act like former Presidents and removed organisers overnight. A total of 500,000 people took part in all May Day rallies held by political parties,"he said.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the SLFP commenced a clean journey on May 1 this year with May Day celebration and hope President Sirisena will launch a programme to further strengthen the party. Over 375 buses with loads of people came to the SLFP May Day rally from the Kurunegala district alone.
Finance (State) Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the SLFP got rid of its racist face and a large number of Tamil and Muslim people took part in the SLFP May Day rally this year. Youth, women and all sections of society took part in large numbers. All organisers took part in it. The SLFP held a very successful May Day rally along with other sister political parties,"he said.

An exemplary statesman
Another May Day has dawned, existed and vanished into oblivion. We shall not hear anything related to that historical day in another 360-odd days. Such is the fate when we have set days for important events.
The May Day of 2017, however, remains iconic.
It is completely owing to another benevolent act of President Maithripala Sirisena. Needless to state, President Sirisenas august assembly at Getambe was well attended. The whole crowd attended the function. That crowd included no one who came to enjoy the holiday munching chickpeas.
On the day that followed May Day, President Sirisena ordered the premises to be cleaned. By that benevolent act, President Sirisena has proven the true statesman he is.
The game of politics is about favours and special interests, money exchanging hands, deals being made, sometimes under the table and other times in plain sight. Powerful people have always had an advantage in influencing the process. But when it comes to politics, people claim to not want competition; rather they demand fairness, equality, and virtue.
The primary reason people want money out of politics is a desire for each vote to be equally valuable. That makes sense. No average voter wants to have to compete against the political persuasion of wealthy constituents. But will removing money from politics provide that outcome Sorry, but no. That is exactly why President Sirisena deserves applause from the common man. He performs what he promises.

Designing Emotions!
Over the centuries, the builder has been partnering with the client to create something uniquely fitted to the lifestyle of the client. However there is much more to architecture. It affects the lives of other users as well. Arch World features Archt. Priyan Hettipathirana who revealed that it is indeed multi- dimensional.
Architects should address issues of global warming. As we know construction industry contributes more than 50% of the CO2 emission in the world. This happens during the construction and then by the energy consumed in running buildings. So this shows that correct design decisions can help reduce energy wastage. This same thing applies to rapid urbanization. Urbanization demands new architecturally designed buildings and therefore the architect has a main role to play, explained Hettipathirana.
Messenger of hope
Indeed the builder is in many ways a messenger of hope.
There was a project which involved designing 12 schools for the tsunami affected children island-wide. Most of these schools had to be re-built from scratch and the architectural designs had to be finalized for the schools to be started for construction within a short span of time as the children did not have a place to study and they were housed in temporary arrangements. The schools were spread over 8 districts and a few were located in the east in the war affected areas at that time. I visited all of these schools with my project team and spoke to each and every school with the teachers, students, local people and the education authorities before designing what I felt is best suited for them.
Even though Sri Lanka is a small country we have diversity in culture, religion and ethnicity. It was interesting to deal with a wide range of diversity in one project and design to make each school unique, said Hettipathirana
Architecture is a creative process. A creative process always makes you see things in a completely different way, in a new form or understanding. The outcome can be unique which you may want to refer to as out of the box.
Wide subject
There is a lot to learn in architecture. It is a very wide subject being one of the oldest professions. One of the most valuable lessons I have learnt in the field of architecture is to understand that there has to be a certain composition, balance and proportion for things to ideally fit in place. This is a qualitative aspect which I try to apply in a design at different levels. These levels can be at urban scale, group of buildings, individual building or even at building element level, pointed out Hettipathirana.
Sri Lanka has been called - Pearl of the Orient and pearl it is!
Sri Lanka is a tropical country and also an island. We have abundant sunshine right through out. We also have monsoon wind patterns which are seasonal. Architectural designs have to respond to both sun and wind in order to provide an environment that is comfortable. A good design can handle sun light and wind inside and outside the building, concentrating on the positive aspects and protect against the negative aspects. This can be done by adding different elements to a design that can also modify or shape it, stated Hettipathirana.
Memorable experience
An architectural design can use a wall and even the color of the wall to give the user a memorable experience when they are using a space.
In a tropical country for example a wall as a design element can act as a protective element against sun or wind by being solid and thick, or be more friendly by way of having openings that permit it. The color of the wall can also help by giving your eye some comfort by cutting glare.
Trees are very important to the environment. We must try to protect and grow trees where ever possible. When we plan an architectural design we must try to work around the trees and at the same time do the design in such way it will allow growing of more trees, added Hettipathirana.
Students in architecture must always be observant about the man made and the natural environment. There is always a lot to learn from both.
Every individual person or place has an identity. The identity is gained through their association with art, sculpture, culture, religion, career but architecture is what glorifies them. That is why the history or heritage of a place, is showcased through its tangible heritage out of which one is architecture, informed Hettipathirana As humans, we address deeper human needs, such as the need for rest, relaxation, belonging, identity and security. But we can also pursue prestigious images and symbols of a consumerist culture.
Architecture is not always cheap. It is about quality and a value addition to life. It makes places better and allow for social development. But it can also be simple and bold giving comfort and a wonderful experience for those who are using it, shared Hettipathirana.
Every architectural creation has a life span. This can apply to both the architecturally designed building and also the purpose for it was built. Both of these can be regenerated or conserved for future generations. If not it can give life for the new creation and activity.
Every architectural creation deals with emotions of the user. One of the basic things people are sensitive is to protection -essentially from the external elements of sun, wind and rain. That how shelter began and it developed into architecture. There are more things like security and privacy, that a person would be sensitive to, and architecturally these things are addressed to make the designs more functional, pointed out Hettipathirana.
Balance
An architect needs to balance so many factors. He must address - how you create a work of timeless beauty, making it timeless while making it a joy to live in and while satisfying the clients requirements and at the same time being practical and logical and also keeping to regulations. Architectural designs with correct proportion, balance and composition, will remain timeless in its beauty. A good architectural design should be functional as it is designed for human use based on their activity needs. There are also regulations and standards followed in an architectural design process to make it function better, explained Hettipathirana
I follow a style which is modern and that suits the tropical. In a tropical environment we need a combination of indoor and outdoor spaces. These spaces are comfortable to live and spend time. Open verandahs and court yards and long eves and tiled roofs are mainly suitable for our environments. Yet the way we approach a design also will depend on the site we are given and the challenges we face accordingly. Each site is a different exercise.
Sri Lanka has a heritage and culture second to none.
I think social development is a main outcome of good architecture. Spiritual development is also part of social development. Spiritual development takes place in religious buildings.
There are many examples in our great heritage. There is a lot of importance given to these religious places in the past and I feel that this same importance has to be there and continued in the same way suiting todays context, summed up Hettipathirana.

Digital marketing takes centrestage at LBR LBO brand summit
LBR LBO brand summit 2017 held yesterday at Cinnamon Grand brought into discussion the new trends of marketing away from the traditional idea of marketing. The summit consisted of five sessions with marketing specialists discussing the evolution of marketing and its affects on the consumer.
PickMe CEO Jiffry Zulfer said the company was able to record 10 million rides from across the country in the last financial year. Zulfer said that Pick me currently has 10,000 vehicles registered.
A key note speaker at the LBR LBO brand summit, he said their biggest competition was with personal vehicle uses. PickMe, according to Zulfer is catering to the mobility industry.
We arent just a taxi company, our aim is to reduce the amount of vehicles in the road by providing people with a more cost effective option. So they can move from location A to B with ease, Zulfer said speaking to Dailly News.
He said that PickMe, with the introduction of one new vehicle, takes three personal vehicles off the road. He said that the way to increase this is through, individualisation. PickMe is currently one of the few profit making companies in the region and they were positively affected by the entering of Uber into the market.
The discussion of the panels was dominated by discussions on the digital. The discussion was diverted into the concept of Marketing in the digital age as opposed to Digital Marketing. It was discussed that marketing in the digital arena is consumer centric; running on the specialised data of individuals.
The necessity of Hyper-individualization was discussed in length. It was also mentioned that though it is a popular belief that technology is cantered around the western province, modern data states that the technology shift is moving towards less urban locations. People today are moving to digital in all aspects, even banking, travelling and shopping.
Digital marketing is not complete without proper content to support it. The summit discussed the importance of syncing multiscreen through content to form discussions with the consumers.

Efforts were taken to unite the SLFP and the Joint Opposition with the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena, but a few persons having links with the UNP sabotaged it, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the SLFP plans to win the 2020 election. The best option is to work together, he said.
Amaraweera said the SLFP can win 2020 election alone. It was proved after the May Day rally.
"We did not remove SLFP organisers who worked hard for the party. We appointed new organisers to the party," he said.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the SLFP commenced a clean journey on May 1. President Sirisena will launch a programme to further strengthen the party, he said.
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the SLFP got rid of its racist face. A large number of Tamil and Muslim people took part in the SLFP May Day rally this year, he said.

Forests skinned alive
Landslides inevitable due to deforestation:
Aranayake has changed much in the last 10-15 years and for many residents in the area, these changes are quite visible. It was these changes to its landscape that resulted in many of them being killed and buried alive by last years landslide. The landslide was made more potent, as many of the trees which could have minimized harm, had been cleared for tea cultivation and other development purposes over the years.
A year since the landslide and disaster that wreaked havoc in the lives of the people in the area, residents allege that deforestation in the vulnerable areas continue. They continue unabated as officials responsible for the environment turn a blind eye towards illegal logging and felling in the surrounding forests.
Trees cut down en masse
Aranayake is surrounded by mountains and it is the home to both wealthy estate owners and the most vulnerable group; plantation workers and day labourers.
The environment has changed much as more people moved into the mountains. Many trees were cut down to make way for human settlements in these places. People do not want to protect the environment any more and they are much concerned about their own business, said K. Jayawardena, a resident living in Aranayake.
Jayawardene claimed that trees were being cut down from both forest lands as well as private lands.
Divisional Secretary of Aranayake Z.A.M. Faizal, however, denied the allegations that trees are being chopped down.
We have taken initiatives to reduce the number of permits issued. Earlier, we used to give 50 permits every month and now we have reduced it to 30, he said.
He said that the Divisional Secretariat was taking all possible initiatives to preserve nature and the environment.
Divisional Forest Officer, Kegalle K. G. Sepala assured that trees in environmentally protected areas were not being cut down by the people.
I can assure you that the trees are not cut down in Forest lands but we cannot do anything if people cut trees in their private lands, he said.
He further said that the people needed to get permission from the Divisional Secretariat to sell any felled trees and such permission was not granted easily.
Sepala noted that there were also lands that belonged to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (LRDC) in the Aranayake area and added that they were managed by the LRDC and not the Forest Department.
Despite several attempts made to contact Chairman of LDRC Asela Iddawela, he was not available for a comment.
Despite the confusion in various jurisdictions, the environmental disaster triggered by human settlements now threatens their very existence. Large sections of lands in Aranayake have now been declared as high risk areas and residents have been asked not to return home.
M.P. Kamalavathi has had many areas close to her house declared as landslide prone areas.
The residents of that area were sent to camps. But the people still visit their houses and lands. Some have got into the habit of cutting down the trees in their garden. They do not have any problems as they are not going to live in those houses any more. The government has promised to give them houses somewhere else, she said.
Kamalavathi feared that such irresponsible behaviour would trigger other problems.
How can we just let these people cut down trees If I go tell them not to do it, it would turn into a fight. Therefore I keep quiet, she said.
She said the logging was mainly taking place in the areas of Naththakanda and Beravila in Aranayake.
D. Ranjani, a university student in the meantime, complained that she woke up to the sound of a chain saw cutting down trees and logs every morning.
We were also asked to leave at first as they said this was a landslide prone area but later they said it was a possible vulnerable area. The NBRO gave us permission to return to our homes, she said.
Ranjani claimed that the relevant officials had failed to take action against the loggers.
Forests converted to tea cultivations
An expert team from the NBRO which conducted a geological investigation in the areas where the landslide occurred, has recommended that the entire region subjected to the landslide should be declared as a restricted zone and no human activity should be tolerated there for any reason.
They said that the entire slope region on either side of the landslide area was not suitable for settlement and should only be used for agricultural purposes.
Residents like R. Ramanayake, 70 had stopped attending to his cultivation there after the landslide washed his lands away. He said his children also did not want him to restart the cultivation,
The trees in Samarasa Kanda were cut down a few years ago and tea was planted instead. Thats a great destruction. People dont realize it though, he said.
Residents complained that deforestation was the main reason for the landslide but despite all the destruction it caused to the village, some people still continued to cut trees.
Ramanayake said Beravila, Paithalawa, Naththakanda, Ambalakanda and Gantuna were few areas where forest areas have been converted to tea cultivation purposes.
Head of the Department of Geology, University of Peradeniya Dr. Jagath Gunathilake said the areas where the landslide had occurred were the areas which had been cultivated for minor crop exports such as tea and there was no danger in Forest areas where there were bigger trees.
He said deep rooted plantations were important for the stability of soil slopes and there were many unstable slopes in these mountains.
Root systems of tea plants are not capable of providing such protection. It was observed that the area where this landslide has been triggered is mostly covered by tea plantation, which may have been a contributing factor to the landslide, he said.
Dr. Gunathilake explained that due to improper land use methods employed in tea cultivation on the upper regions of the slope or the hills, rainwater had quickly infiltrated into the soil slope.
An official attached to the District Secretariat, Kegalle who wished to remain anonymous said any construction activities, cultivations, change in land use pattern leading to slope instability could not be done without prior approval from the NBRO.
Local government authorities have been instructed by the NBRO not to grant approval for such activities without their approval by the circular number 2011/1/NBRO issued by the Ministry of Disaster Management, he said. Meanwhile, he emphasized that it was essential to implement programmes to necessitate the planning of existing land use patterns and construction techniques, considering the natural slope and geology in the mountainous regions of the country.

Incidentally, another Sri Lankan badminton player Upendra Jayawardena also won the silver medal in the Mens Singles 45+ A category.
Im very happy with this achievement. Coaching in the UAE has helped me extend my career and also maintain my fitness, said the 50-year-old who won the last of her five national singles titles nearly two decades ago.
Since making UAE her home five years ago, Deepika has been active not only as a coach but also competing in local tournaments to lead by example.
A regular member of the Sri Lanka team for 15 years during her heyday, Deepika never officially retired as a player competing in the World Seniors badminton tournaments in Canada, Turkey and Sweden.
Her success in New Zealand has rekindled her determination and ambition to continue her mastery in the court.

Geetha has 42 days to appeal
UPFA MP Geetha Kumarasinghe who was disqualified from holding a seat in Parliament by the Court of Appeal yesterday, has 42 days to appeal against the decision in the Supreme Court.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya speaking to Daily News said she would have to apply for Special Leave in the Supreme Court or for Leave from the Court of Appeal before she can take her appeal to the Supreme Court.
Special Leave petitions dont usually take long unless they prolong it. It is usually disposed of in 3-4 weeks, said Jayasuriya.
If Kumarasinghe is granted Special Leave to Appeal the decision, she can sit in Parliament until the appeal in the Supreme Courts is determined . As of now however, she has been suspended from Parliament with immediate effect.
Secretary General of Parliament, Dhammika Dassanayake in the meantime said the Speaker was yet to be informed of the Court of Appeal decision but they would abide by the Courts ruling.
We will have to wait and see if she would appeal the decision and we will consult the Attorney Generals Department as to what we can do, he said.
He added that this was not a common occurrence but they had not come across such an incident in recent history.
In September 2015, five residents from Galle petitioned the courts stating that Kumarasinghe was a holder of dual citizenship - in Sri Lanka and Switzerland - and at the time of nominations, she had not divulged her citizenship status in Switzerland. Kumarasinghe was elected to Parliament at the 2015 Parliamentary elections from the Galle district. Section 20 of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 91(1)(d)(xiii), the petitioners pointed out clearly stated that those who hold dual citizenship cannot be qualified to be elected as Members of Parliament.

Geetha unseated: Expenses caused to the state by Geetha K
The Court of Appeal yesterday issued an order in the nature of a writ of Quo Warranto declaring that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament. The two-Judge-Bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena observed that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii), the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds duel citizenship of both Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal directed the Attorney General to take necessary steps to formulate a mechanism to recover the expenses caused to the state by Geetha Kumarasinghe while she was functioning as a Parliamentarian to sit and vote in Parliament, in accordance with the Parliament Election Act.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka the qualifications of a Parliamentarian had been challenged through a writ petition over a dual citizenship issue.
The Court of Appeal made this judgment pursuant to a writ petition filed by five residents of the Galle district challenging the constitutionality of electing popular actress Geetha Kumarasinghe as a Member of Parliament since she holds duel citizenship.
The Court of Appeal maintained that a report submitted by the Department of Immigration and Emigration had confirmed that the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe was holding dual citizenship.
Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal disagreed with several arguments put forwarded by the first respondent. Geetha Kumarasinghe claiming through her counsel that the Court of Appeal does not have the jurisdiction to hear the petition and the five voters do not have locus standi to invoke the Courts jurisdiction. She further argued that her parliamentary privileges cannot be challenged in a writ petition. The Court disagreed with these arguments and declared that Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament.
The petitioners N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K.Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L. Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle maintained that Kumarasinghe is a holder of duel citizenship, namely of Sri Lanka and Switzerland, who had contested the 2015 Parliament Election and had not divulged her duel citizenship at the time of submission nominations.
The petitioners had sought an order of writ of Quo Warranto declaring that MP Geethah Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioners had cited Geetha Sanammali Kumarasinghe, M.N. Ranasinghe Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, Prof. Vishwa Warnapala the Secretary of the UPFA, Dhammika Dasanayake the Secretary General of Parliament as respondents. They stated that by virtue of the constitution, in particular section 20 of the 19th amendment to the constitution, Article 91(1)(d)(xiii), she is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament. The relevant provision stated that a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country shall not be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament.
The petitioners stated that due to public interviews of the first respondent published in the media, they were of the reasonable apprehension that she was a holder of a duel citizenship and that she was a citizen of Switzerland.
The Attorney General had earlier informed Court that there is no evidence even up to now to prove that Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe has abandoned her Switzerland citizenship.
Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna with counsel Pulasthi Hewamana and Sulakshana Senanayake appeared for the petitioners. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Geetha Kumarasinghe. Deputy Solicitor General Janak de Silva appeared for the Attorney General.

Giving green shades
Dig in a shovel, plant a sapling and pose for a photograph. For go green campaigners who pride themselves on planting saplings on special occasions, it would do well to remember that the act is not the end. It is the beginning of an environmental effort which needs to be continued to create a better living for all beings.
Planting a sapling is no accomplishment. However a group of youth has taken this factor to new heights by consistently engaging in tree planting sprees across the island. Titled Reforest Sri Lanka, the project was initiated in 2015 when Reforest Sri Lanka president Achala Meddegama was reading for his MBA in IT at Moratuwa University. He had to do a CSR project as a part of his degree. Achala decided on engaging in a reforesting campaign due to his passion for going green.
I have seen that the Hanthana forest range catches fire easily most nights. This causes a lot of environmental damages. Eight of us got together and worked towards planting saplings as well as tending and nurturing them into trees, said Achala tracing the roots of Reforest Sri Lanka.
Though the course work ended the team decided to continue with their good work because they realized that no one is tackling the issue properly. Even government bodies like the Forest Department have refused to touch upon this topic giving the excuse that it is a difficult task.
We took a different and more intimate approach and appealed to the citizens for help. We put up notices on our website and on Facebook asking for volunteers to join us. In the early days we had about three or four meetings without anyone turning up! The awareness process was slow but we were gradually able to kindle their interest, Achala explained.
Reforest Sri Lanka has planted around 27, 000 saplings in 11 months and gotten around 2, 500 people involved in their projects. Achala adds that their initial target was to plant 84, 000 trees a year. They aimed to plant 2000 saplings in Kottawa Forest Reserve in Galle in their first project. However the team could only to plant 1000 saplings in two days.
Planting the saplings took much more time than we expected. The plants are very fragile so they have to be handled with care. Our aim is not to reforest the entire country. That is impossible against the destruction that is being caused daily. Around 400, 000 trees have been cut down at Wilpattu National Park. We plant about a 1000 trees per hectare. The number we have planted so far seem insignificant compared with this amount but when we embark on such projects around the country we have noticed that the government mechanisms too have started to take note and are motivated to perform their duties more efficiently, Achala said adding that while awareness on sapling plantation is high, the know-how on doing it the right way is lacking.
A two-year study, published in Nature in 2015, found that the Earth has three trillion trees - seven times the number of previous estimates. The study found that the number of trees on the planet since the dawn of agriculture 12,000 years ago has fallen by almost half - and that about 10 billion trees are lost every year.
Planting 1000 saplings at Basawakkulama
Anyone who is acting against the environment has a hard time answering to us when we go and question them about matters. Those who wish to enforce the law to stop destruction too are motivated to tackle issues. We have gotten school children involved as well to nurture future leaders to take the projects forward. It is a time consuming, mammoth task which demands a lot of effort but we are determined to achieve our goal, he said adding that they take pride in the social awareness and positive outlook they have generated so far.
In a bid to increase green cover they have planted many saplings around schools in areas like Anuradhapura and the Western province. They will be having a project at Christ Church College, Matale, to coincide with the World Environment Day on June 5. They have donated saplings to the Ruhunu Universitys Management Faculty recently.
Kottawa Forest Reserve project
Speaking about the methods that they have used to get the public engaged, Anuradhapura and Colombo Regional Coordinator Madhura Somaweera said that they have made plans to donate a text book for every two plants that children will be handing over to them.
They can raise a plant at home by planting them in something like a milk packet and hand them over to us. This would be especially beneficial for low income families. These book covers and inner pages will include customized information about the environment and planting trees, said Madhura.
Achala notes that the plants that they recommend to rear saplings need to be endemic to the country. Mee, Kumbuk, Gammalu, Karanda, Kaluwara, Kalumediriya, Veera, Hora, Madam etc are the types that they recommend for reforestation.
Planting 500 and donating 500 Jak saplings in Welioya with the Sri Lankan Army
We have also planted about 3000 Jak trees. Around 2000 of them were donated at Padaviya, he said adding that many renowned cooperate sponsors have joined hands with them on their projects.
Anshulam Kumarage, Nilushi Weerakoon, Nishantha Bandara, Madhura Rasanjaya, Malintha Nanayakka and Vinod Khanna are some of the members who are actively involved in their projects.
Achala says that there are many campaigns launched to plant trees and to preserve mother nature. However he and his team are skeptical about such projects. They know how difficult it is to plant a sapling as well as preserve it from destruction through experience.
Though we are all employed we set aside our weekends for this work. All our members are volunteers so they do everything wholeheartedly. We never ask for the ownership of the plants or land. We offer our labour, support and the plants free of charge. We only plant on state owned lands, temples, schools and reservations, he said.
He notes that the team keeps tabs on the plants they plant through a mobile app that has been developed by the students of Moratuwa University. They also visit the locations at least once a year. They expect at least 50 percent of the saplings that they have planted to survive after caring for them for at least three years.
We also target the rainy seasons around the country to plant saplings especially if it is an area which is difficult to monitor. We are hoping to plant saplings in Mahamevnawa Park in Anuradhapura soon. We are planning to put water bottles with holes on the side so that the water will slowly irrigate the plants during this scorching weather. One significant thing about the Reforest Sri Lanka campaign is that whenever we plant saplings, it always rains within the next few days, he added with a smile.
The team has planted some of the smaller trees in Viharamaha Devi Park, Colombo, as well. They have donated 131 Mee and Kumbuk trees on the Vesak period of 2016. All these projects are funded by nature lovers who have donated funds to an account at Sampath Bank. A plant costs between Rs 25 to Rs 75. On average the cost is less than Rs 50. They buy the saplings from the Forest Department nurseries as well as from the lowest cost highest quality private suppliers. They are already aiding people to maintain home nurseries. One factor they need to consider is the type of plant that is suitable for the area that they are hoping to plant them in.
Dont think you can live in this planet alone. We need every plant and animal to maintain the cycle of living. We plan to keep on planting trees whenever we can. We feel good about ourselves and feel that we are doing our bit as responsible citizens to protect mother earth, Achala said adding that cultivating empathy with the environment is what human beings can capitalize on to save the planet.

Youll have a better chance of negotiating successfully with builders if you know about breaker boxes, water pressure tanks, load-bearing walls, and other such construction anatomy. A good way to learn is to get a book on construction and trace your electrical, plumbing, and other utility lines from where they enter the building to their points of use. Also, when on a construction site, wear a hard hat and work boots. Aside from being safer youll get to see more of the work, and youll be treated like an overseer and not an intruder.

2.Light bulbs
Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are not better than incandescent lights when its less than 60 degrees outdoors, when theyre turned on and off a lot, or when theyre on less than 15 minutes. Also, their light is worse and the energy they save is tiny compared toonly one examplethe energy that your house throws out its windows at night (better to stack your chips on lowering this). But heres a light that uses no energy at all: luminous escape route trim. Use photo luminescent tape to your baseboards and youll always know where you are in the dark.

3.Solar panels anyone
On a sunny day around 9:30 a.m. climb onto your roof and see if the sun shines on it. Repeat this around 3:30 p.m. Does the sun still shine on the shingles Did it do so every hour in between If you cannot remove the trees or nearby buildings or hills that obstruct the sun during these hours, do not install solar panels. Exception: south facades or terrain close by that receives lots of sun during the day.

4.Buy a backup generator
Why pay $950 for a cubic yard of materials that ravaged the environment in its making, requires more money and extreme care to install (people get killed when they dont do this right), and needs monthly testing Cheaper, simpler, and safer: For those rare occasions when the power fails create a power-outage kit that includes a dozen candles with holders, half a dozen flashlights with extra batteries, and several large buckets (when the power fails fill them at the nearest creek or lake, cistern the water in your bathtub, and use it for flushing toilets and rinsing)then go camping with the kids and canned foods before your fireplace.

5.Fireplaces
A fire in a conventional fireplace is only 20 per cent efficient. Worse, when its hearth is cold lots of fossil fuel heat sucks up the flue unless you reach way under the mantle and close the sooty damper. Better: A fireplace insert that can burn logs and paper trash, has intake and outflow vents at the bottom and top (you shouldnt need a circulating blower), has an easily operable damper, and sports large glass doors so you can enjoy the dancing flames. A fireplace insert is 5075 per cent efficient and easier to operate.

6.Drainage
Whether your house stands on level or sloping terrain, the ground extending from its foundation should be graded at least 1/2 inch per foot downhill for 10 feet in every direction. This contouringeven if it takes dynamite and backhoesis not money spent but money saved. Tip of the day: always locate a house on convex, not concave, terrain.

7.Mould
If mold appears inside your exterior walls or on your exterior siding, you may be suffering from the biggest mistake made in wood construction today: airtight envelopes. Airtight vapour barriers keep moisture-laden air from migrating through the wood framing, then the trapped moisture rots the wood. Contrary to what many experts say today, the solution is NOT tighter constructionbecause you can NEVER get rid of all the moisture and wood needs to breathe to keep from rotting. The only way out of this dilemma is radical surgery: Choice #1: Strip the siding, replace the Tyvek with tarpaper that allows air to infiltrate between its seams, and install new siding. Choice #2: While doing choice #1, thicken the exterior walls, either from the inside or outside, with more insulated construction. Save your house first and worry about your energy bills later.
8.Mould
Furnitecture  This is efficient furnitureitems like bureaubeds, shoulder-high walls, and long desk counters with lots of shelves above and drawers below. Replacing the usual fat furniture with these compact items not only will make less indoor space more useful, it can create enough room around the inside of your exterior walls to add a second wall of insulation. This is the real secret to making your home or workplace more energy-efficient in the future.
9.Efficient indoor spaces
By removing useless corners, unused crannies, gun barrel hallways, seas of circulation around islands of furniture, and other chubby cubic footage indoors, not only will you be more comfortable in less space, you may have enough room in your home to install an office, have an exercise area (instead of driving to a dues-paying health club), and store more belongings (rather than rent a storage unit miles away). One of many clever ploys: Convert the usual wasted space between a row of studs into a hallway library or similar shelving. This can be done almost anywhere indoors.
10.Fire safety
When a fire erupts indoors a hot region exists at the flamesthe fire zoneand areas nearby fill with toxic gasesthe smoke zone. Both are deadly. Along with installing smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and fire exit signs, fit one sink faucet on each floor with spigot threads so you can screw a hose onto it. Outdoors, on two opposite facades mount spigots with frost proof sill cocks (the water in them wont freeze in cold weather) and beside them mount hose racks with 75 feet of hose -www.smartcitiesdive.com

Heat wave hits Apura
The high temperature of 37 to 38 degrees Celsius during daytime caused by the bright hot sun has caused great inconvenience to the people in the Anuradhapura city and its suburbs. Animals and domestic pets too havebeen affected by the hot conditions.
The occasional evening thunder showers experienced in the region had not helped to overcome the effects of the heat wave.
A CEB spokesman said the electricity demand in the area had reached an all time high due to excessive use of fans and air conditioners and other appliances by the people to beat the heat. Demand for water too had registered an increase over the issue, a spokesman for the Water Board said.
Doctors have warned people, especially farmers against direct exposure to the sun as it would cause skin eruptions, dehydration and even death. A farmer in Galenbindunuwewa died of exhaustion recently after tilling his land in the sun.

Helping cricketers overcome disappointments
South African cricket legend Allan Donald uses WC setbacks:
South Africas fast bowling legend Allan Donald played in four cricket World Cups since his countrys readmittance to international cricket in 1992 and ranks the last two he played in England in 1999 and in Africa in 2003 as the worst disappointment.
Although South Africa possessed one of the best bowling attacks in world cricket in the likes of Donald, Shaun Pollock, Steve Ellworthy, Lance Klusener, Jacques Kallis, Nicky Boje and Makhaya Ntini they have yet to reach a World Cup final.
The two years that Donald singled out are ones that South Africa was on course to qualify for a place in the final if not for their own undoing.
2003 WORLD CUP FIASCO
South Africa had their best chance when they hosted the world event in 2003 with Kenya and Zimbabwe.
It wasnt very happy memories. My form in the 2003 World Cup was not the best, recalled Donald.
Coming into the World Cup I had a very good ODI series against Pakistan. Sometimes things just dont click and then having to be left out against Sri Lanka was a big kick in the teeth, and then obviously getting the Duckworth/Lewis wrong. It wasnt a great way to go out of your home World Cup, it really hurt. It was a challenging time in my life the 2003 World Cup, he said.
It was South Africas final Group B match against Sri Lanka and it ended in a tie when rain stopped play with five overs remaining at Durban.
South Africa who started the tournament as second favourites behind defending champions Australia needed to win to reach the Super Six. They were 229-6 after 45 overs in reply to Sri Lankas 268-9 when rain which had been falling for more than ten minutes drove the players off the field.
According to the Duckworth/Lewis method the par score was 229 which meant the honours and the points were shared.
Amazingly, Mark Boucher was wrongly told that 229 runs would be enough to win, it was revealed after the dramatic tie. South Africa captain Shaun Pollock said a message had been sent out to the wicketkeeper at the crease as the falling rain threatened to wash out the game.
As the rain began to pour down, Boucher hit a six off Muthiah Muralitharans next delivery, flat-batting the ball over mid-wicket to take the score to 229 for six. Boucher blocked the next ball - a single would have been enough for victory - before the players were ordered off.
Thanks to South Africas blunder Sri Lanka went through to the Super Six stage and reached the semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Australia.
That World Cup ended Donalds international career as a cricketer.
1999 WORLD CUP FIASCO
The 2003 incident was an uncanny repeat of the 1999 World Cup when South Africas semi-final against Australia in Birmingham ended in a tie and Australia went through because they had been higher on the Super Six log table.
The match reached an exciting climax, as South Africa took the game to the final over with a wicket to spare, thanks to Lance Klusener going hammer and tongs against the Australian bowlers.
In the final over, with nine needed, Klusener smashed the first two balls for four. With just one required off four balls, the final seemed to be South Africas destination.
The third ball of the over was a dot ball. But calamity struck on the fourth when Klusener was involved in an unfortunate mix up with last man Allan Donald, resulting in the latters run-out, which allowed Australia to tie a sensational game and progress to the final.
This was because Australia had won their game against South Africa in the league stages. The match remains a missed opportunity for South Africa in their World Cup history, and still raises questions as to what may have been if it were not for Donalds unfortunate run out.
It was a horrible time for South African cricket but thats sport. Ive been through a number of disappointments but the 1999 World Cup is the worst disappointment I will remember. You dont have to ask me again, said Donald.
Those are the lessons that Ive embraced in life the lessons I can convert to other cricketers to get over their disappointments, he said.

A history never too cold
In 1969 Colombo Cold Stores celebrated its Diamond Jubilee by bringing out a small book (155 Pages) on the history of Ceylon from 1894 to 1969. Naturally, Cold Stores being a business entity, the booklet is focused heavily on the then business leaders and commercial developments that took place during the period. The references, particularly as to the early years are predominantly from European sources; the idea of keeping notes, records and diaries being unfamiliar to the native population.
Nevertheless, the book can be read with interest for its historical perspective. Most histories are about kings and their courts. Ceylon from 1894-1969 on the other hand, endeavours to give the reader a more vivid picture of the times, of various personalities and events, opinions and attitudes, that would not generally make into a standard history book. It gives him an insight into a part of our not so distant history, the then prevailing realities, of which we have very little memory now.
One of the factors that swung official opinion in favour of Colombo instead of Galle as the premier commercial port was the existence of the Colombo-Kandy railway (opened in 1867). Until the railway came to Ceylon, transport of commercial products was by coolies or bullock carts. Mr. Alexander Brown told young members of the Planters Association of the days we had to transport our coffee on coolie heads for 30 miles on endThe coolies were wonderful carriers and generally travelled through clumps of forest so that their heads were protected.. Transport from Kandy to Colombo was by bullock cart which travelled in convoys at night. The transport of coffee from the estate stores to Colombo was often a business of many weeks, sometimes even months. The railways revolutionized life in Ceylon, not only by providing cheap transport for commercial products, but in making good things available to the planter up-country. RWJ in his memoirs of Ceylon recalled how Old Wood, a planter, had labored on an estate in Uva for 30 years without once coming to Colombo.
Road construction
The Europeans soon adjusted to, or perhaps came to even enjoy, the life and rhythm of the East. They found plenty of ceremonious courtiers and abject minders now happy to serve the new masters; infinitely more advanced, resourceful and powerful than the former kings.
Ceylons first Governor Frederic North had a big entourage on his first tour of Ceylon. It included 160 palanquin bearers, 400 coolies, 2 elephants, 6 horses and 50 lascars. The enormous entourage was necessitated by the almost complete absence of roads.
But however powerful the Kings representative in the colony was, the Governor was not beyond accountability. A later Governor, Viscount Torrington, is on record pleading with the Colonial Secretary not to turn down his travel claims because To move I am obliged to take everything, kitchen, cooks, beds, servants, and often I may say-house.
The 1840s saw considerable progress in road construction-in the metalling of existing roads and in the construction of bridges. Many roads required iron bridges and Skinner acted on his own initiative while on leave in the UK (in 1856) in ordering a dozen.
Governor Ward found that the state of most rest-houses was disgraceful and sanctioned extra expenditure. He also introduced a tariff of charges and stopped the practice of government officials staying free of charge at rest-houses - let everyone who uses a rest-house pay, from the Governor downwards he decreed.
Death took a heavy toll in the pioneering days. Skinner in his Fifty Years in Ceylon refers to dysentery as the disease of the country. Persons suspected of having contracted cholera were simply left to die. Skinner contracted jungle fever (probably malaria) and the treatment was as follows my doctor bled me till there was scarcely a drop of blood left in my body. He then gave me 40 grains of calomel and in the evening as the fever was still raging he ordered me to be taken out to the yard of my quarters , laid on a bare rattan couch and buckets of cold water thrown over me for about 20 minutes. To make matters worse, Skinner heard the melancholy call of an owl, named by the natives as the devils bird, because its cry is a precursor of death. Skinner survived the water treatment and the devil bird!
The latter years of the 19th Century saw the gradual withdrawal of the horse carriage. Moreover, the ill-treated coach horse, and rigid, badly built and uncomfortable coach would soon disappear. Ceylon is not a horse breeding country and in consequence the natives know nothing of horses or how to treat them, hence a miserable life for the horse once he becomes the property of a local coach contractor.
Medical assistance for staff
If the introduction of (push) cycles in 1896 aroused a certain amount of cynical amusement, the advent of motor cycles and cars soon after caused consternation. To Mr. C. Harn of Messrs. Bohringer belongs the distinction of importing the first motor cycle into Ceylon (early 20 Century). His experience was not a happy one, lack of petrol was his grievance. Mr. Money imported the first car, a loco-mobile. Soon car followed car. The writer goes on to list 21 cars but only two Ceylonese names, Mr. E.L. F. De Soysa and Mr. N.D. B. Silva figure among car owners.
The birth of the Ceylon mercantile community can be traced to the eighteen forties which saw the establishment of Mackwoods (1841), George Steuarts (1844), Cargills (1844), JM Robertsons (1845) and Brodies (1846). Mackwoods was founded by the brothers William and Francis who were officers on a ship that called at Galle. The eighteen fifties saw a number of new firms entering the business scene. They were Delmage Forsythe (1850) Volkarts (1851), Lee hedges (1852) Walkers (1854) the Mercantile Bank (1854), Carsons (1857) and Millers (1858).
Walker, Sons and Co began business in Kandy, then the heart of the coffee industry. Its founder John Walker was a man a century ahead of the time in the treatment of his employees. He was the first Ceylonese employer to introduce a provident fund, profit sharing and medical assistance for his staff.
Ceylonese and Indians were among those who initiated firms in the eighteen sixties; Don Carolis (1860), Moosajees (1861), John and Co (1865).
V. A. Julius, the founder of the law firm Julius and Creasy, who shunned the limelight, was yet a man of many accomplishments. As a relaxation from legal problems he studied nature and wild life and became an authority in the area. Julius was also a member of the Ceylon rowing team that defeated Calcutta in 1882. Henry Creasy, the co-founder of the firm, was a member of the Legislative Council for a number of years. He was the son of Sir Edward Creasy, a former Chief Justice of Ceylon and author of the book Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World. Tommy Lipton, who began life as a grocers boy in Glasgow, blossomed in manhood into an empire builder. On his first visit to Ceylon he is reported to have said we could grow tea here. Lipton made Ceylon and tea synonymous.
The production of ice on a commercial scale began with the formation of the Colombo Ice Company in 1866 (it became New Colombo Ice Company in 1894 and then Ceylon Cold stores in 1941). Its premises in Glenie Street became known as the Ice Kompaniya. The name lingered, now the entire district has officially become Kompaniveediya.
The location of the firm on the banks of Beira Lake (in 1866) was influenced by the fact that the lake was then a vital link in communications in Colombo. It had a total of 22 employees. A German engineer, Arthur Von Possner was the manager. Glenie was the Archdeacon of Colombo but like most top men of his era had the coffee mania. He was even reprimanded by the Secretary of State for the colonies for making too many visits to his plantations. He owned as much as 1926 acres of land in Neliya alone.
Von Possner lived an epicurean life in the days when there was no income tax. He used to take a short ferry ride from Glenie House to the Galle Face Hotel across the lake, for a few drinks stronger than the aerated waters he manufactured. On one occasion instead of walking towards the ferry, he walked towards the sea and spotting a boat shouted Yakko Boattuwa Geneng. Someone kindly put him on the correct track.
In Kew Cottage, lived the famous milliner and dressmaker Laura Andree. The police station and the barracks were where they are now. Where the slave island roundabout is (was) and where six roads converged stood a large banyan tree under whose spreading branches a Salvation Army preacher pleaded for simple souls. At the end of Lily Street were two gateways, one leading to Mr. Wardrops bungalow belonging to the Commercial Company and the other to Dr. C.W. Van Geyzels spacious house, called the Grange.
The war years (WW2) also saw the introduction of tractors from Australia, which was to revolutionize paddy cultivation as it had existed from the earliest times. At first there was a shortage of personnel to operate the tractors, which were unfamiliar to the Ceylonese. The employment of Italian prisoners of war filled this lacuna.
As recent as 1940, B.R. Shenoy in an economic survey of the Kurunagala District observed that the keynote of the economy is poverty, and its foundation is the low return from the land.
Foreign managers
Even today Sri Lanka has a low industrial base, operating at a basic level, mainly in low income areas like the garment industry. In 1948, Sir Ivor Jennings the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Ceylon posed the question Where and what can Ceylon industries sell He further argued, The industrialization of Ceylon would require the transfer of large number of village labourers, accustomed to primitive sanitary conditions, to the towns. It is not pleasant to contemplate what would be the standards if large numbers of present villagers were collected in tenement blocks, especially if the sanitary arrangements of the towns were inadequate as they are at present.
We ought to be grateful that a commercial firm like the Colombo Cold Stores decided to mark its diamond jubilee by publishing a history of this era. This was not a profit making exercise. The task would have required long hours of research and collation. In a country where record keeping is scanty, at best, such an undertaking demands painstaking effort. By getting this book together the Company has ensured that at least a small part of this history is on record.
By 1969, the Ceylonese had almost completely replaced the European management of the Colombo Cold stores. That a project of this nature was undertaken is to the credit of the Ceylonese management that immediately followed the foreign managers of the company. Today, nearly fifty years later, it is difficult to conceive of a commercial firm having the intellectual inclination or the academic interest for a similar venture.
Such is the poverty of spirit today.

Presidential Commission into the Treasury Bond issue:
The Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday requested JVP Provincial Council member Wasantha Samarasinghe to submit details on the sources of information depending on which he submitted a report to the Commission.
The request was made when Samarasinghe said the report he submitted to the Commission, received information from media, social forums and other Primary Dealers as well.
The Commission assured that the information on these sources will remain confidential.
Samarasinghe was also advised by the Commission not to use allegations such as 'bond scam' and 'theft', when testifying before the Commission to which Samarasinghe said "I am taught to call a thief 'a thief'. But, I will refrain from using the words out of the respect to the Commission."
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva and Nihal Fernando PC questioned Smarasinghe yesterday at the Commission.
Both lawyers suggested the report submitted by Samarasinghe is prepared based on wrong data.
Chanaka de Silva complained that it seems the witness believe all economic problems in Sri Lanka has arisen due to the Treasury bond issue, to which Samarasinghe said it indeed is one main reason.
Adding humour to the situation Commissioner P. Jayawardena said "Even my hair is turning grey because of this problem."

Kandy schools rugby second round
What a weekend it was in the top Cup competition when unbeaten Trinity suffered their first defeat of the season when they were tamed by St. Peters at Bambalapitiya. In the other matches involving Kandy schools, Dharmaraja beat their arch rivals Kingswood in a Plate game, St. Anthonys beat Vidyartha, St.Sylvesters beat Piliyandala Central and Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St.Pauls) beat St.Thomas Matale in a Shield game.
TRINITY
Trinity which is a very exciting side and has some knowledgeable players, were very successful in winning all their first round matches and were the only school from Kandy to qualify for the Cup competition. But in their last outing they suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of St.Peters. They have a wealth of talent in their forwards and the back division too comprises some exciting players, but with all this they failed to do well due to a very poor display.
The side that played better rugby won. Trinity failed due to their own mistakes, the leadership had no control and lacked support, the three quarters combination of Boyagoda and Lashan failed to click and within 15 minutes of play Lashan was removed and replaced with another.
The Trinitians were over confident and did everything negative and this was capitalised by the Peterites. The rugby that was put on show by the Trinitians was not at all that enterprising. So, the four-year old Dennis Perera trophy was once again housed at Bambalapitiya which makes it three in a row for the Peterites. The rugby what the Peterites played in the second half was not a patch of the rugby that was shown in the first half. These two schools first met in 1933 and from 1943 to 1947 there was no fixture. This trophy was introduced in 2014.
DHARMARAJAH
Dharmarajah has a well balanced side and were able to beat their arch rivals Kingswood in the first second round match. The rugby that was played by the two schools in the first half was interesting. But in the second half the Kingswoodians were not that enterprising, they forgot the game. The Rajans halves combination made use of the good ball their forwards gave them and ran their three-quarters to earn tries.
Much was expected from Kingswood, but they failed to pocket the game. Kingswood, who were relegated last year were hoping to hit the top this season. For the Kingswoodians the result of this game was of utmost importance and they are expected to make every effort to win and gain promotion. Both teams played good rugby that was appreciated by the crowd. However after the final whistle some of the losing sides supporters behavior was uncalled for.
ST. ANTHONYS
St. Anthonys with the schoolboy talent in their ranks beat Vidyartha in the second round Plate game. They did well in the first half and gave a dissapointing performance in the second half to their die hard supporters. They have the potential to perform well, but some hoodoo seems to be prevailing over them. It is time they settled down to some solid rugby to recapture the past.

Kim Jong Un : a Survivor, Not a Madman
Everyone loves thinking of North Korea as crazy. It threatens to consume the United States in nuclear fire on a semi-weekly basis, its leader brutally executes his own generals and had his brother murdered and it wastes huge amounts of money on nuclear weapons, while sticking to a failed economic model. Tales of North Korean lunacy is never far from the front pages.
The problem is its not just the media that delights in depicting Pyongyang and Kim Jong Un as irrationalU.S. policymakers indulge in the same behaviour. In April, U.S. Congressman Bradley Burne (R-Ala.) said, I dont believe the leadership in North Korea is rational. How do you deal with someone that is irrational He echoed to prior remarks by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who said, We are not dealing with a rational person, since, she claimed, Kim is a person who has not had rational acts, who is not thinking clearly.As a guide for understanding North Korea, this analysis is just plain wrong. As a guide for crafting policy toward Pyongyang, it may be catastrophic. North Koreas system might look bizarre to us from the outside, but the Kims are the ultimate political survivors, hard-edged rationalists whose actions have always had a clear purpose: keeping the family in power. Seeing them as madmen is not only wrong, but also dangerous; any successful policy should be based on understanding the logic of the opposite side, not on discarding it as irrational. Seeing the Kim family as lunatics with nukes makes them more threatening, and raises the risk of war, but it can also promote unrealistic expectations of compromiseif only the North comes to its senses.
Back in the 1980s, the Kim family was laughed at even inside the Eastern Bloc as an embodiment of Stalinist irrationality. They were mocked for clinging to their outdated personality cult and failed economics and it was suggested that they should follow the dynamic leaders of Eastern Europe, like the reformist communist leader Karoly Grosz of Hungary. Today, these leaders are in the waste bin of historyoverthrown, disgraced, and forgottenwhile the Kim family still enjoys not only power, but the luxury that goes with it and remains in full control of their country.
To be sure, the last 25 years havent been easy. The Kim regime has had to survive massive famine that afflicted the public, the loss of every international ally bar an increasingly reluctant China and confrontation with the worlds only superpower. But the fact that the Kims have managed this feat should be treated as a sign of their rational and ruthless commitment.
Today, Kim Jong Un is in control and he has the same long-term task as his father and grandfather: to ensure the survival of the regime under the control of himself and his eventual familial successor. There are three major threats to thatobstacles which, judging by Kims policies, he has not only identified but is methodically working to neutralize.
The first threat is foreign attack, something that clearly keeps Kim, like his father, up at night. This might seem paranoid. But its not paranoia when they really are out to get you. Look at the fate of Saddam Hussein, or the Taliban leaders of Afghanistan, once frequently bracketed together with Pyongyang by U.S. officials. But its the sorry fate of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi that taught the Kim family its firmest lesson. In 2003, the Libyan strongman agreed to surrender his nuclear weapons development programme in exchange for generous economic benefits promised by the Westthe first time such a deal had been publicly struck by a state formerly hostile to the United States.
But when revolution broke out in Libya in 2011, it was the NATO no-fly zone that doomed Qaddafis regime. That story ended with Qaddafis violated body strung across a car bonnet. A decade ago, U.S. diplomats and journalists, then full of enthusiasm about Libyan nuclear disarmament deal, used to say that North Korean leaders should learn the lessons of Libya. And theres no doubt that they have, even if theyve drawn very different conclusions.
Kim Jong Un sees the nuclear programme as purely defensive. Conquering the South would be nice in theory, but this task is completely beyond his reach, both due to the U.S. commitment to protecting South Korea and Seouls own huge advantage in economic and technological power. He knows that any unprovoked North Korean attack against South Korea or the United States will end badly, perhaps in his death, and he is certainly not suicidal. However, he also presumes that no great power would risk attacking a nuclear state or sticking a hand into its internal strifeespecially if it has delivery systems and a second-strike capability.
And so, North Korean leaders are determined to stick to their nuclear development and see nuclear weapons as the major guarantee of their security. There is no form of pressure that can convince them to budge on this, no promise that will seduce them into compliance; they believe that without nuclear weapons, they are as good as dead. Thats a disaster for the region, but a perfectly logical choice by the Kim family.While North Koreas nuclear program is defensive, it still makes sense to remind the world about its existence and use what President Richard Nixon once described as madman strategy, that is, to appear to ones opponents to be irrational, volatile and willing to disregard costs. Thats why North Korean propaganda uses such fiercely colorful language. When North Korean TV promises to make Seoul into a sea of fire, or threatens to nuke Canberra, or shows Kim Jong Un in front of a map of the United States with cities marked as targets of nuclear strikes, they are delivering the same message: We are here, we are volatile, and will stop at nothing if our opponents do something threatening.
Without their own nuclear weapons, the Kims would fear a direct U.S. attackbut they also fear American, or Chinese, interference into an internal Korean uprising. They saw what happened in Libya when foreign powers introduced a no-fly zone and ensured the insurgents victory. They remember that back in 1956, China, together with Russia, supported a failed conspiracy aimed at removing Kim Il Sung, the current supreme leaders grandfather, from power.
Kims other ostensibly irrational policies should also be seen as defensive in nature. Nuclear weapons after all, are not sufficient to protect the regime. They may prevent international aggression, for example, but they dont remove the considerable danger of a domestic military coup. Kim Jong Un is young and has good reasons to suspect that his generals harbour ill feelings about him, given his embarrassingly young age and inexperience. (He was made successor a mere year before his fathers sudden death, being a complete unknown at the time.) Kim is also no doubt aware that coups in non-democratic regimes are fairly common and fairly successful; according to a recent study, 227 of the 457 coups worldwide between 1950-2010 succeeded. Two of those successful coups took place in the country Pyongyang watches most: South Korea.
Kim seems to believe that the most reliable coup-prevention technique is terror. His rule has been marked by the unprecedented purges in the military and police. Prominent generals have been disappearing one after another, and some top commanders, including a chief of the general staff, as well as a minister of defense, have been executed.
The recent assassination of Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Ils half-brother, also fits the pattern of this selective terror. Kim Jong Un is determined to destroy anybody who could become a focus of elite discontent. Kim Jong Nam, outspoken and living behind Kim Jong Uns control, constituted a threat. As a Kim, Kim Jong Nam was likely to become a figurehead of some conspiracy, since he embodied some of the familys perceived legitimacy and magical aura in the eyes of many North Koreans. It did not help that he was protected by Chinaa country Kim Jong Un does not trust and sees as a potential sponsor of the elite discontent.
The point is that Kim isnt overseeing an irrational reign of terror. There are no signs the average North Korean now faces increasing chances of being arrested for a political crime. The number of political prisoners remains exceptionally high, but it has not changed much under Kim Jong Unand it is significantly lower than it once was in the days of his grandfather. Remarkably, the purges target only military and security commanderspeople with gunswhile the top managers of the economy so far have remained safe.
In other words, Kim Jong Un has unleashed terror targeting the group which might have both reasons and means to replace him. It might be excessive, and it is definitely brutal, but there is nothing irrational about thisespecially given that in the case of a successful coup, Kim Jong Un himself, would be first up against the wall.
But it might not be the generals that bring Kim down. The third threat is a popular uprising. North Koreas biggest single problem is its stagnant economy. In the 1940s, North Korea was the most advanced industrial area in East Asia outside Japan, but decades of mismanagement have made it into a basket case. The per capita income gap between North and South Koreas is larger than between any two other countries which share a land border; the ratio is somewhere between 1:14 and 1:40. The gap between East and West Germany, in contrast, was between 1:2 and 1:3.
This huge gap creates a great political obstacle for any attempt at sweeping Chinese-style economic reforms. Chinas regime has been lucky, since it does not face a large and prosperous capitalist twin in the region that is also democratic; Taiwan is too small to pose any threat of subversion. In North Korea, the attempt at emulating Chinas reforms and openness policy is likely to make the populace, currently isolated at least somewhat from the outside world, acutely aware of South Koreas unbelievable affluence and less fearful of the authorities. Common people are likely to blame the Kim family for decades of gross economic mismanagement and start dreaming about a speedy unification with South Korea led by Seoul as a way to solve all their problems overnight. As a result, in North Korea, any attempted transition to capitalism is likely not to bring a Chinese-style economic boom, but rather provoke an East German-style political collapse, followed by the absorption of the state by the victorious South (and the complete marginalization of the current elite at best, if they even survive).
The late Kim Jong Il, the present rulers father, was well aware of this threat and studiously avoided reforms even though the old Stalinist system was collapsing, yet the countrys market economy began to grow nonetheless. By the end of his rule, the private businessestechnically illegal but usually toleratedwere estimated to produce between 25 percent and 40 percent of the countrys GDP. Kim Jong Un, perhaps fearing that in the long run a spontaneous capitalism from below will undermine his rule, has taken a different tack. From 2012 to 2014, he began to introduce incremental policies that look remarkably like what China did in the early 1980s.
Agriculture has been largely switched to the family-based system, with farmers being allowed to keep most of the harvest after in-kind tax (no more than 35 percent) has been paid. Industrial managers have been given greater entrepreneurial freedom, including the right to buy and sell at market prices, and to hire and fire personnel. Private entrepreneurs and black market operators, some of whom have amassed fortunes counted in hundreds of thousands and even millions of the U.S. dollars, are no longer harassed, but encouraged to invest, often in cooperation with state agencies.
This policy has led to the economic revival: While there are some disagreements, most experts believe that North Koreas annual GDP growth in recent years has been around 3 percent or even higher.
The era of famine is over, and living standards are growing fast across the entire countrynot just in Pyongyang, as some claim. The private money is fueling a construction boom, while shops and restaurants are crowded with the new richand traffic, once barely visible in the capital, is now sometimes a real problem.
But these market-oriented reforms have not been accompanied by political liberalization. In culture and ideology, the nationalized Stalinism reigns supreme, and the country has by far the worlds highest rate of incarceration for political crimessome 80,000 political prisoners among a population of just 25 million. Kim Jong Un assumes that some combination of economic growth with harsh surveillance will keep his population docile.
This might be an ultimately false assumption, but its a reasonable one; after all, nearly all founders of East Asias developmental dictatorshipsfrom Deng Xiaoping and Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan to Lee Kuan Yew of Singaporedied in their beds, admired by many of their compatriots.
Will Kim Jong Uns policy, rational, if sometimes brutal, eventually succeed in keeping the regime stable in the long run Most of his policies are inherently risky; the nuclear arms race can provoke U.S. preemptive strikes, the harsh treatment of generals might make them more, not less, inclined to start a conspiracy, and the economic reforms can unleash social forces beyond Kims control. But risky is not irrational. So far these policies have worked and, given the situation North Korean leaders find themselves in, any alternative would be even riskier. These polices might even work, which would mean the world will have to live with the Kim family regime for a long time to come. The clan has always known how to survive, and they might keep doing so.
What does it mean for the rest of us Firstly, it is time to realize that theres no quick solution at hand. North Koreas denuclearization is impossible, but it is possible to manage the nuclear program and put some cap on its further development, provided the Kim family still feels it has the deterrent value it needs. (Of course, North Koreans will expect generous concessions for any freeze, and might not stick to it even then).
The outside world can and should encourage the positive changes, such as economic growth, which are happening now in North Korea.
Above all, they should seek to expand the sources of information available to the North Korean public.
The most hopeful future for North Korea is one of change pushed from below, by a people aware of life outside their countrys borders, regardless of whether that comes because the regime feels the need to make popular concessions to survive, or through outright overthrow of the Kim regime. The Kim family might be rational, but so are the North Koreans themselves.

The Laugfs LPG Import and Export Terminal in Hambantota, the first phase with a 30,000 MT capacity is progressing on schedule to be commissioned by first half of 2018 financial year as planned.
Built with an investment of US$ 80 million, the Laugfs Terminal is set to be one of the largest LPG Import and Export Terminals in its class in South Asia. It was the first and the largest investment in Sri Lankas Hambantota Port, which is known for its strategic nautical location in the Indian Ocean.
The new LPG terminal will reinforce our energy presence within the region by tapping the energy requirements of some of the largest emerging LPG markets, including India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
The Hambantota Port provides a strategic advantage to further strengthen this position given its location amidst some of the worlds largest nautical/shipping routes. Combined with these strategic advantages, we believe our own Laugfs Terminal will help position Sri Lanka as a break-bulking hub of the region, yielding tremendous economic benefits to the country, Laugfs Group Chairman, W.K.H.Wegapitiya said.
Laugfs Group Managing Director Thilak De Silva said it will create many direct and indirect employment opportunities and will be a lucrative foreign exchange generation avenue for the country.

May Day in retrospect
Joint Opposition stalwarts are all gung-ho about the crowd attendance at their May Day rally at Galle Face. The adrenaline is certainly flowing for people like Wimal Weerawansa, who, dazzled by the crowds, has called for the hoisting of black flags during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's forthcoming visit to the country to attend International Vesak Day celebrations. Another JO stalwart, Udaya Gammanpila, went onto comment that it was their leader Mahinda Rajapaksa's happiest day since his ouster on January 8. Obviously, in the same exultant mood as colleague Weerawansa, he is calling for a day of hartal to demand the holding of a General Election. An election is also badly wanted by Mahinda Rajapaksa purely on the strength of the crowd attendance.
While the JO members could preen themselves on the Galle Face crowd, this, as they well know, is no yardstick for success at a national election. It was a fait accompli for the JO to muster the crowds that they eventually did if it were not to lose face, after bragging that they will fill up the esplanade with the crowds. One recalls the crowd attendance at MR's rallies during the Presidential Election campaign. They were indeed monumental and dwarfed the attendance at the rallies of the Common Candidate, who sometimes had to make do with wayside plots of land following the last minute denial of the official venue. In Polonnaruwa, the home turf of the Maithripala Sirisena, Rajapaksa boasted that it was the largest ever crowd ever to descend on the electorate in the Rajarata, at his rally. The result, the Common Candidate romped home by a majority of over 30,000 votes. It was the same method of mustering the crowds, as witnessed at Galle Face, on May Day, the loot accumulated during the Rajapaksa ten year rule put to good use.
Crowds hardly tell a tale. The UNP for instance was never known to muster sufficient crowds for its election rallies and always fell behind the SLFP and JVP. But this did not mean that it lost the election. In 1982, Hector Kobbekaduwa drew massive crowds to his rallies, with Vijaya Kumaratunga being the star attraction. But JRJ won by over a million votes when the ballots were counted. There is a plausible explanation for this phenomenon. The UNP does not have the sort of voter base that can make it draw its supporters to election rallies. It counts among the bulk of its supporters the business class, the upper middle class and middle class conservative types who are not those who can be bothered about attending election meetings. But come election day they vote en bloc for the Grand Old Party. On the other hand, the SLFP (or the Joint Opposition) commands a different support base where radicals, nationalists and the lumpen types form the bulk of it voters. To such types election rallies and events such as May Day are a welcome diversion from their drudgery and mundane lives. With the JVP it is different. As a cadre based party attendance of all comrades are mandatory and what was witnessed at the BRC grounds on Monday is the sum total of support for the Rathu Sahodarayas.
Be that as it may, the UNP may have even surprised itself by the massive turn up at Campbell Park. Ditto for the SLFP at Getambe. One has to remember that this May Day was held amidst the backdrop of many unpopular measures forced on the public by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government such as the increase in the VAT, the high price of rice, coconuts and certain essential items. There was also the other issues that were created by Pro-Rajapaksa elements such as SAITM, the spate of doctors strikes, ETCA, to name a few. To cap it all, there was the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage mountain, burying alive dozens of people and rendering hundreds of families homeless, for which the government was unfairly blamed although the problem even predated Rajapaksa rule.
For all that, the people, by and large, have remained faithful to the UNP and President Sirisena led SLFP, of the current Unity Government, given the crowd participation at both rallies, when one would have expected a backlash by the public in the form of diminished attendance. Their combined strength would have easily outstripped the attendance at Galle Face. It is a clear indication that the people are willing to give a chance to the present government to place the country on the right footing and implement the development programmes it has embarked on, the current difficulties and hardships notwithstanding.
Be that as it may, the government should be watchful and not allow the breakdown of law order that may be planned by elements in the JO, emboldened as they are, by the crowd attendance at the May Day rally. Prime Minister Modi will be here as a guest of the government to participate in a noble event. Nobody should be allowed to act in a manner that would mar the occasion.

MBSL and Finance ranked among top 10 financial services providers
The Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) has emerged as one of the top 10 brands in Sri Lankas financial services industry.
LMD and Brand Finance Lanka, in the latest Brands Annual 2017, which ranks the countrys top 100 corporate brands of listed and unlisted companies, has ranked the MBSL brand among the 10 most valuable consumer finance services brands in Sri Lanka.
This independent external ranking has affirmed MBSLs market position as one of the fastest growing brands in the financial services sector in the country.
This is indeed an encouraging sign of MBSLs brand recognition and mind share among the public. The 2017 ranking puts MBSL at number 7 among financial services providers, placing us within the top 10 leading brands in the financial services industry, from the 8th position in 2016. It is noteworthy that this improvement in brand value has been achieved within just two years of extensive internal restructuring and rapid changes to our business model, following the merger process. This demonstrates the value of the MBSL brand and is indicative of MBSL potential as we continue to expand and strengthen our brand presence, said the Chairman of MBSL, Dr Sujeewa Lokuhewa.
The upward movement in MBSLs brand ranking reflects the improvements not only in how the brand is perceived but also the improvements to internal businesses processes and our service delivery. We have continually invested in building customer relationships, augmenting our customer care and enhancing the quality of our employees. Our employees are the most prominent brand ambassadors of MBSL, demonstrating MBSLs business ethics and quality of products and services to external stakeholders.
I am confident we shall continue to see further improvements to our market position and brand equity in future, said the CEO of MBSL, Mr T Mutugala.
In addition to MBSLs ranking among financial services providers in the country,MBSLs overall brand ranking among the top 100 listed and unlisted companies,in the 2017 Brands Annual, has also improved significantly within one year. In 2017, MBSL came in at the 58th position among the top 100 brands with a brand value of Rs 774 million.
This is an upward climb of 18 points from the 2016 ranking at number 76 and a brand value of Rs 475 million. The improved brand ranking follows MBSLs improved financial performance in the 2016-17 financial year and the stronger market presence through customer growth, portfolio growth and brand recognition. The company has also focused more on brand building and enhancing brand equity through ongoing marketing and customer relationship building programmes.
MBSL has also made its mark through other non-financial accolades. MBSL was named one of the Best Employer Brands in Sri Lanka in 2016, by the World Human Resource Development Congress and was recognised as the Emerging Bank of the Year at the Middle East Asia Leadership Summit Awards 2017, in Dubai.These accolades reflect overall improvements to the company and has contributed towards building the MBSL brand image.

National Trade Policy needed before FTAs are inked - NCCSL
National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) President Sujeewa Samaraweera said the government needs to hold honest and truthful discussions with the private sector concerning the upcoming free trade agreements.
This is particularly with regard to China and Singapore rather than conducting discussions to satisfy the private sector,he said.
Samaraweera speaking to Daily News Business said that it is an absolute necessity to have a national trade policy for Sri Lanka which will govern and provide directions to any trade agreements to be signed by Sri Lanka with any other country.
The overall aspects of FTAs could be looked at through the National Trade Policy for Sri Lanka once it is drafted, Samaraweera noted. When drafting an FTA, he noted that comparative advantages have to be properly looked at.
We at National Chamber are not discouraging the governments efforts in mulling FTAs with other countries.What we emphasise is that there should be a collective effort and a proper dialogue between the public and the private sector prior to drafting any kind of trade agreement.
According to Samaraweera, the ultimate motive of these agreements would be to boost exports and promote entrepreneurship in the country.
Samaraweera also noted that with the background of Sri Lanka entering into the free trade agreements with very strong economies in the near future, it is also vital to implement anti-dumping regulations in Sri Lanka.
In other words a common mechanism to protect our domestic industries from unfair trade practices is an absolute necessity.
The Chamber will also continue to work on SMEs by facilitating their business interaction by creating a virtual marketplace at the chamber to create synergies.

New Panama Canal locks welcome first cruise ship
The Expanded Panama Canal welcomed its first cruise ship, the Disney Cruise Lines Disney Wonder, through the new locks on April 29, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).
The milestone signals the further diversification of traffic through the Expanded Canal and with it, introduces new re-positioning opportunities for the cruise industry, the ACP said.
said Panama Canal Deputy Administrator Manuel Benitez. Todays historic transit marks the beginning of cruise lines being able to include the new locks as part of their itineraries, opening up additional transit options and allowing cruise passengers to witness first-hand this feat of modern engineering.
The Disney Wonder transited the Expanded Canal in a southbound direction from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The Disney Wonders Panama Canal crossing is part of a 14-night voyage from Port Canaveral, Florida, to San Diego, where the ship will sail cruises to Baja, Mexico, before a summer season from Vancouver to Alaska.
The 2,713-passenger ship was transformed in late 2016, expanding its length to 299.92 meters.
The Disney Wonder is one of several cruise ships to have transited the canal during the 2016-2017 cruise season that ends in May. However, the transit on April 29 marked the first time a passenger vessel utilized the new locks of the Expanded Canal. Other lines such as Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line all sent passenger vessels through the original locks.
By the close of the 2017 fiscal year, which ends September 30, the total number of passenger ships is expected to reach 233, representing a total 237,298 passengers to have transited both the original and new locks.
On April 1, the Panama Canal began accepting booking requests for passenger vessels in the new locks. So far, 18 reservations have already been made for passenger vessels to transit the Expanded Canal for the 2017-2018 season, a number which is expected to increase in the coming months, ACP informed.

No TU can hold the country to ransom: MP
UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said that no one or no trade union can be allowed to destabilise the country by various unethical and unjustifiable trade union actions.
He said that the government is duty bond to protect the citizens from these unjustifiable trade union actions and to ensure the smooth functions of the country.
The forward march of the country should not be obstructed. The country should move forward. But, certain persons are trying to create an anarchic situation through trade union actions, he noted.
He said that the China Bay oil tanks were in a state of decay for over five decades. But, no trade union uttered a single word about this resource until this government took measures to utilize it.
'Similarly, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) wants to crfeate anarchy in the country," Bandara said.
He alleged that the GMOA works to the hidden political agenda of Dr.Padeniya, who intended to contest at the 2015 General Election with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from the Kurunegala district.
The GMOA is dancing to the tune of Padeniya under the guise of the SAITM agitation, Bandara added.

The Premier however said Indian Road Transport and Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari was of the opinion that a bridge connecting Sri Lanka and India was a good plan in the long term. We did not speak on it. His opinions and ours can have differences. However, we proposed connecting the Northern road network to our expressways either from Dambulla or Kurunegala. Let us proceed and get our work done in this way. The future expectations of both parties can be discussed later the Premier said. The Prime Minister made this reply to a supplementary question raised by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila.

was presented to Parliament and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on April 7.
Absence on May 5:
Disciplinary action against Docs who produce fake MCs
Disciplinary action should be taken against doctors who produce fake medical certificates for their absence to duty on May 5, Power and Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said.
The Deputy Minister made this observation, joining in the Parliamentary debate yesterday.
If any doctor issues a medical certificate for an individual who does not attend work due to trade union action, then obviously it becomes a fake document. It is a serious offence and against ethics. The medical certificates of those who go on sick leave on should be checked and if proven false, disciplinary action should be taken against such individuals, he said.
The Deputy Minister made these comments in view of the islandwide strike led by the GMOA scheduled .
The Deputy Minister also pointed out some TUs mentioned in the leaflet published by the GMOA as joining in the strike, denied their involvement when contacted. The Public Service Trade Union Federation, Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya of the CEB and Jathika Adyapana Sewaka Sangamaya (National Education Workers Association) denied their involvement in TU action though their names were mentioned in the leaflet.
He said would be the day the highest number of Principals and Teachers attend schools, adding that no disruption to school work would take place due to TU action.
Certain public officials obstructing govts progress: Finance Minister
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday in Parliament, complained that certain public officials are dragging the Government by its feet and obstructing its progress.
The minister was moving ten Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act, two Resolutions under the Customs Ordinance, three Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, Order under the Ports and Airports Development Levy Act and Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Bill to give effect to Budgetary proposals made last year.
Even though the Government had changed, public officials remain unchanged. While some have made up their minds to support the Governments endeavour, still there are a few who try to create problems. I ask them to work or resign. We will implement the peoples mandate. We have created seven star democracy in the country and are flexible in our work, but that doesnt mean we are weak. We will never hesitate to take disciplinary action against any official, he warned.
The minister also expressed his satisfaction on the Supreme Court ruling over the Foreign Exchange Bill, adding that the SC has upheld that the Central Bank is not an autonomous institution, but an agent of the Government and that the Government could regulate the activities of the agent through the directions of the minister.
The minister quoting the SC determination, said the CB could not act on their own, but subject to Government regulations and accountable to the Executive and Parliament. This is what I always said. What is the use of a Government, if the tail can wag the head Some went to courts seeking to make the CB independent, but they did not utter a word when President Mahinda Rajapaksa held the Finance Ministerial portfolio. They, who meekly approved all Cabinet papers by the former President, were now trying to show off their powers, he said.

The government has taken steps to grant concessional loans to those students who follow vocational training, including technical courses in order to enhance export oriented and job oriented skills, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The Premier made these observations yesterday in Parliament in response to a query made by Gnanamuttu Srinason during the round of questions to ask the Prime Minister. Srinason said that a large number of graduates in the North and East are jobless due to the lack of knowledge of technology and English. He asked if the government would change the education system to a job oriented education system and what steps would the government take in connection with those unemployed graduates.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the matter would be taken before the Parliament Oversight Committees by the relevant ministers.
This issue is common in all South Asian countries, Premier Wickremesinghe said. If there is an education system with English and technology and vocational training, the youth would get employment opportunities in Europe and Middle East countries and other countries with commendable payments.
He also said that government would take measures to address all these issues without delay.

Welu Kumar stated that the process of reforming the estate sector is in progress. He added that however a section is facing an issue as there is no relevant circular issued on the policy of granting plots of lands to the employees of the estate sector.
"Some of the estates are earning profits, while the rest are in a pathetic situation," said Premier Wickremesinghe. "I am told that the report on the profit earning and those of loss incurring estates is completed. We would take a decision once the report is received by us."
He also said that however, the decisions would be reached after discussions with Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, trade unions of the estates, parliamentarians in the areas where the estate is located, etc.
"The grant of the seven perch plot of land to the estate sector employees is a government policy and it has informed to Parliament, the Premier said. "So nobody could say that there was no document. Lets see the development of the programme until July and discuss with the Janatha Estate Development Board, Estate Plantations Corporation and the Elkaduwa Estate."
The Premier also said that private sector estates would also have to grant plots of lands to their employees. The Premier also said that private sector estates too would have to grant the plots of lands to their employees.
For abusing privileges:
Action needed against diplomatic officials
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake yesterday in Parliament, requested the Government to take action against the diplomatic officers who had been engaged in human smuggling and abusing their privileges to take persons abroad as Personal Service Assistants.
Parliament was told that 100 Personal Service Assistants who were accompanied by the Diplomatic Officers and who were given appointments from January 2005 to January 2015, have not returned to the country when their Officials returned.

MP Rathnayake pointed out that some diplomatic officers had made human smuggling a business during their tenure in office and asked for action to be taken against those officials.
The Minister said that he would bring the issue to the notice of the Foreign Minister.

Pathfinder confab on enhancing Indo-Lanka connectivity
The Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of The Pathfinder Foundation, Carnegie India together with Vivekananda International Foundation in India conducted a conference in Colombo with the participation of leading academics, professionals, subject Matter Experts and scholars from both the countries seek to discuss six major areas of concept of connectivity.
Sectorial experts of the Indo Sri Lanka meet at the Colombo discussed opportunities and challenges for the better connectivity benefit for the communities.
Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonatilleke said that target this conference is to focus on three broad themes including past connectivity and the sources of decay, identifying the current possibilities and assessing the enduring obstacles and exploring ways to overcome them.
At the second stage of the project, specific sectors could be taken up for more detailed examination he adds.
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Collomboge, Director, Center for Indo Lanka initiative of Pathfinder Foundation brief in presentation, any effort to promote connectivity between the two countries must be understood by the ease of movement across the frontiers in the past and its deterioration in the second half of the 20th century due to the armed conflict and changing political dynamics.
Six major sectors covered with six sessions in this one day conference its included coastal shipping in the Bay of Bengal framework, multimodal surface and air links between Sri Lanka and Peninsular India, developing and promoting religious tourism, power grid connectivity and finally energy security through the strategic storage of hydrocarbons; resilient international telecom connectivity in the context of UN ESCAPs vision of an Asia Pacific Information Superhighway. After the presentation participants comment with their views and experience how to do handle the issues better than in history.
Enhancing connectivity, which has been a subject of discussion in the SAARC and BIMSTEC context, has also been a major national priority for both India and Sri Lanka. Promoting internal, trans-border and regional connectivity have become an urgent imperative for both nations, as they seek to sustain their rapid economic growth into the coming decades.
Both Delhi and Colombo have rediscovered their geographic advantages and are determined to leverage these.
India is now acutely conscious of its geo-economics location at the cross-roads of Asia and the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Sri Lanka has begun to emphasize its Indian Ocean identity and wants to leverage its position as the maritime fulcrum of the trade routes in the Indo-Pacific littoral.
While past policies of self-reliance and the dynamic of local conflict devalued connectivity between the two nations, two and a half decades of economic liberalisation have compelled Delhi and Colombo to focus on privileging their physical proximity. Trade volumes have rapidly grown in recent years, and so have mutual investments.
The growing infrastructure linkages between the two countries are reflected in the fact that Colombo has become the second largest port (after Mumbai) for the movement of goods in and out of India.
Dr. C. Raja Maoha, director Carnegi, India who expert of foreign policy analysis said in his presentation Sri Lankan President three times and Prime Minister twice visited India.
Delhi and Colombo have signaled the political will to build on this interdependence and deepen connectivity between the two nations. Captain Suren Ratwatte CEO, Sri Lankan Airlines said that air connectivity has excellent potential Indian travellers will be triple within two decades.
With current infrastructure facility of Katunayake airport Sri Lankan can meet the challenge, we have understood there is potential market for both country he brief in his presentation.
Representative form think thank and important institution for concept of connectivity including Arindam Bagchi, Deputy High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, High Commission of India, Darshana M. Baruah, Research Analyst, Carnegie India, Dr. Nalin Mehta, Senior Fellow, Indian Foundation Development, Ambassador D.P. Srivastava, Vivekananda International Foundation, India, Damitha Kumarasinghe, Director General, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, Rohan Masakorala, CEO, Shippers Academy Colombo, Professor Rohan Samarajiva, Founder Chair, Lirneasia, Dr Suranga Silva, Senior Lecturer, University of Colombo participated the conference.

PMs foreign visits brought rewards to the country: Nalin Bandara
The country receives immense benefits from the state visits of Prime Minister Ranil Wikremesinghe unlike that of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could bring several benefits to the country from these state visits, including paving the way for receiving the GSP Plus concession, opening the doors for a significant number of investment opportunities and moreover to build the image of the country and its wide acceptance from the world, he said.
The parliamentarian addressing the media at the UNP headquarters Sirikotha yesterday said that the Prime Minister participated in 50 percent of state visits on invitations he received from the state leaders of those countries.
Of the state visits of the Prime Minister, the visit to Brussels in Belgium to participate in the World Economic Forum was significant. Besides, the sanctions imposed on fish products exportation could be lifted as a result of the Premiers visit, the MP said.
Unlike the foreign visits of Mahinda Rajapaksa, only a few officials accompanied the Prime Ministeron these visits . But during the last regime, it was reported that around 200 persons took part on a single visit of the former President.
Rajapaksas entourage included family members, henchmen, yes-men. Besides almost 90 per cent of the counties he visited were not developed countries. Sri Lanka received noting from these state visits he said.
The MP said Wasantha Samarasinghe of the JVP leveled allegations that the country did not receive anything from the Prime Ministers visits.
He is behaving like a frog in the well. Even though these narrow sighted elements level baseless allegations, the people of the country know the truth. I invited Samarasinghe to participate in a state visit of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe the next time to know the truth he said.
He said that JVP cannot form a government even by 2040 and even if they do they will not be able to rule the country for two months because the people will rally against them and come forward to drive e them away.
Nalin Bandara further added that Prof. G.L. Peiris in his capacity as the then Foreign Minister visited 48 countries but the country received nothing.
Disregard his 48 visits, it was about to impose various sanctions on the country. The fish ban had already been enforced then he said.
The parliamentarian said that it will take more than two years to receive the outcome and the benefits of the fruitful moves made by the government. People received the benefits of the 1977 government after three years in 1980 and thereafter .
Speaking on the May Day rallies, MP Nalin Bandara said it was noted that all rallies attracted much crowds than the previous years. According to his estimates, the largest volume of people estimated around 300,000 flocked to the UNP rally while around 200,000 attended each of the other major rallies.
Unlike previous years, participants focused on environmental cleanliness after holding their May Day rallies.
Showing concern towards cleanliness is an outcome of good governance as the god governance government cultivated an environment friendly attitude among the people.
He said May Day was the day which brought devastation to the Sri Lanka Transport Board during the last regime. But under this government not a single SLCTB bus was deployed for May Day transportation unless the the due amount was paid.
A salary hike was not a slogan in any of the May Day rallies this time since the government has increased salaries of both state and private sector employees significantly MP Bandara said.
He said that Dullas Alahapperuma who made a big noise against the Indian ambulance service, has thanked to the government for deploying ambulances for the May Day rally of the Joint Opposition.
Bandara said that the SLFP has split into two now with the holding of two May Day rallies. Mahinda Rakjapaksa is responsible for splitting the party into two.
He said that the Unity Government will continue until 2020 and then the UNP will form a UNP led government.
The UNP is never afraid of elections as the party is in a position to win any election,he said.

## Title: The right to protest

## Date: Thursday, May 4, 2017 - 01:00
The right to protest
The right to strike has been developed at international level by the International Labour Office (ILO) supervisory bodies but is not mentioned explicitly in ILO conventions or recommendations.
While there is consensus that the right to strike is an indispensable instrument for the exercise of workers economic and social rights, there is an ongoing debate about the need to strike a balance between the protection of these rights and the need to guarantee essential public services in order to safeguard citizens and their well-being in Sri Lanka. This piece presents practices in Europe.
Legal recognition of the right to strike
The term strike has been defined as Any concerted stoppage of work by employees (including a stoppage by reason of the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement) and any concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by employees.
A first feature is that unions in countries with relatively few disputes tend to be large, as in Germany, where the unions are particularly well integrated into the bargaining process. Here a culture of a quest for social harmony prevails and strikes have to be preceded by negotiations, during which only warning stoppages are possible. If discussions fail, an arbitration process is necessary before a strike can be called. Strikes which take place despite all these attempts at conciliation must obey three basic principles: social order, proportionality and fairness. In addition, civil and public servants, who make up 30% of public service staff, do not have the right to strike, unlike employees in the private sector. Unions must also represent at least 75% of employees in order to be able to call a strike, and must see that it remains proportionate to the objectives.
In Finland, 80% of the working population belong to a trade union. Here, too, there is a basic tenet of social harmony and fines can be imposed for breaching it. In Sweden, a compulsory social truce has been introduced which prohibits strikes during the period when a collective agreement is still valid. Most collective agreements contain clauses prohibiting strikes or other types of industrial action during their validity. In the event of disagreement, the opposing parties are required to submit the matter to conciliation committees. Parliament may also end such a dispute through legislation.
Generally speaking, breach of strike regulations may incur various disciplinary, administrative, civil or criminal sanctions, depending on the country. In the United Kingdom, for example, contravention may lead to termination of contract, although the employers powers are limited here by Section 9 of the 1982 Employment Act.
In Ireland and Austria, too, a breach of the principles governing the right to strike may result in dismissal.
In Italy, for example, public services are treated as necessary for the realisation of fundamental rights and are established in the Constitution. The armed forces and law-enforcement agencies are not allowed to strike anywhere. In Germany, Austria, Denmark and Estonia, public servants do not have the right to strike either, in order to ensure the continuity of public services and in return for security of employment. In Turkey, a law barring public servants from striking was passed in 2001.
In Poland, a 1991 act limits strikes in that it prohibits those that are considered detrimental to life and health or that threaten state security.
There are similar restrictions in Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary in addition to legal restrictions, certain constraints are imposed on the civil service under an agreement between civil-service unions and the Ministry of the Interior.
The parties have a legal duty to reach agreement in order to allow minimum service to be maintained, in particular for transport and electricity, gas and water supply during the pre-strike negotiation and arbitration periods.
In these four European countries legislation includes compulsory social-harmony clauses for trying to avoid strikes. In particular, the duty to preserve social harmony prohibits all industrial action during the negotiation of collective agreements, also known as conciliation periods.
In Germany, in addition to the three basic principles and the requirement that unions be truly representative, only workers who have belonged to a trade union for at least three months have the right to strike.
Switzerland has regulated the right to strike in its constitution and says that strikes and lockouts are admissible as long as they concern industrial relations and do not violate any obligations to preserve labour peace or conduct arbitration. Swiss law may deny certain categories of workers the right to strike, for example in order to guarantee essential public services such as the safety of the state, the safeguarding of central interests in foreign policy, or in securing the supply of vital goods and services to the country.
Categories include civil and military senior management, federal prosecuting staff, diplomatic staff abroad, border guards, customs officials and military air traffic controllers.
"Minimum service" in essential services in Europe
The European Social Charter provides a number of particulars in this respect.
Firstly, in services whose suspension might endanger life, safety or health and which are essential services in the strict sense of the term. Secondly, a minimum-service requirement might be introduced in services which are not essential in the strict sense, but where strikes of a certain scale or duration might cause a national emergency threatening normal living conditions. Thirdly, it could be introduced in services of prime importance.
The minimum service in practice
With the exception of the United Kingdom, most Council of Europe countries have brought in regulations on a minimum service in the event of a strike in essential services.
The Constitutional Court of Spain has always taken into account the overriding need to protect users interests in the particular circumstances of each dispute. It has ruled that the communitys right to vital services takes precedence over the right to strike. It has further ruled that a service is essential not by virtue of its nature but by virtue of the results expected of it, taking into account the nature of the interests it is intended to satisfy.
In Spanish case law, the main essential sectors are transport, hospital health services, assistance services, energy supply, water purification and provision, the collection and treatment of solid waste, the postal services and education. The minimum-service arrangements are compulsory.

RIL Property capitalises on office space with Parkland, Readywear projects
According to independent industry research reports, the demand for Grade A office space is expected to grow and continue to outstrip the supply base in the mid and long term.
RIL Property has capitalised on this favourable industry conditions via its Colombo 2 focused offering through Parkland, and mid-term demand via the development of the Readywear building situated adjacent to Parkland.
In the long term, the company is expected capitalize on its land bank to meet the Grade A office space demand, RIL Property Limited CEO Hiroshini Fernando.
Real-estate industry has seen a tremendous growth since the end of the civil war. However there has been a lack of focus given to the development of Grade A office spaces hence there is an enormous void in this market segment.
Speaking to Daily News Business she said that a key reason would be that real estate developers have very much focused more on quick returns that have been available in the high end residential and hotel property markets. Therefore it is imperative that developers re adapt their strategy towards the development of the commercial office space market, which has been projected as a great platform that provides good return on investment in the mid and long term.
Asked how the development of Grade A office spaces facilitate the Government's Megalopolis project and boost investor confidence she said that the Megalopolis project would entice the foreign investors to further invest in Sri Lankan projects,. In addition to currently available incentives offered by the government, they would also be able to utilize the infrastructure facilities that would be available.
The corporates then would require their offices to be setup in the central business district. Existence of developments such as Parkland will also boost investor confidence by portraying a mature real estate market.
Developments such as Parkland would be their first choice of commercial space as it falls in line with regulatory/compliance requirements currently being promoted by multinational corporations. This is evident with Parkland as it has secured a diverse and highly creditworthy tenant base in a short span of time.
Furthermore, our next project, which is the refurbishment of the Readywear building, will further provide Grade A office spaces for both local and foreign corporate with state-of-the-art amenities.
With the expected growth in the economy, the entrance of multinational corporations and the expansion of business of local and foreign corporates, RIL foresees a steady demand growth.
We see great potential and are confident that we would be able to meet our projections made on the Readywear building.
As was visible with the launch of Parkland we brought in many firsts to the commercial space segment and we have surpassed our clients expectations while offering competitive pricing.
Comenting on the RIL IPO was recently oversubscribed she said that the IPO funds will be utilized for the refurbishment of the Readywear building at an investment of Rs. 694.1 mn. The renovation is expected to complete by mid-2018 with a rentable area of 45,897 sq. ft.
The IPO funds will also be utilized for the expansion of BreadTalk at an investment of Rs. 256 Million, targeting the setting up of 16 outlets by the financial year 2020/21 The expansion of BreadTalk is based on per capita income growth, lifestyle changes, and food preferences. (VW)

Save energy to prevent potential power crises  Siyambalapitiya
Electricity consumption up by 18 percent during day, 10 during night:
Due to the prevailing drought, the consumption of electricity has increased by 18 percent during the day and ten percent during the night, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday said.
While the drought had raised electricity demand, the Norochcholai Coal Power plant stands troubled in need of urgent repairs for the 38th time, the minister said.
The drought has drastically reduced water storage. As of now, we have 32 percent of water in our reservoirs.
The country has lost three rainy seasons. The monsoonal rains have failed us after 30 years. We are in the middle of a power crisis, the minister stressed. The country gets 40 percent of its electricity from water.
Siyambalapitiya said although our country is ranked 11th in the world for hydro power capacity and generation, our ability to produce hydro-based electricity is dependent mostly on climatic conditions.
Therefore, to pull through this drought successfully as a nation; the support of the public is of paramount importance, he said.
I appeal to the public to save energy, because by saving energy they could also save money for themselves and more importantly, they would be contributing to lead the country out of a potential national power crisis, he said.
The situation may require us to purchase diesel and coal based power from private power companies. But we plan to pull through the crises without burdening the public, he added.

Logistic support vehicles for Army peacekeeping contingent in Mali:
Six international institutions have presented bids to supply military logistic support vehicles required by the Sri Lankan Army peacekeeping contingent in Mali.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as Defence Minister sought Cabinet approval to award the bid to the institution recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee.
The lack of equipment has been an issue which has plagued the Sri Lankan peacekeepers ever since they received the mission in 2016. At the time, it was reported that the UN had to cut down on the number sent from Sri Lanka due to a lack of adequate equipment. The Sri Lankan Army however denied such reports and reiterated that they would be sending troops in batches.
In November 2016, Cabinet approval was sought to award the contract to supply demining and explosive disposal equipment to a party chosen by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe received Cabinet approval to enter into a loan agreement with the Russian Bank SBERBANK to fund the purchasing of equipment required by the troops.

SLCs successful drive against chuckers
Eradicates menace  down from 178 in 2016 to 5 in 2017:
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) can proudly lay claim that their campaign to eradicate bowlers with suspect actions from school level upwards has been a tremendous success.
Quoting official figures SLC vice-president K Mathivanan who is also in charge of domestic cricket stated, Last year there was 178 bowlers reported at school level for suspect bowling actions. We had this visibility drive campaign where umpires had workshops for school coaches and umpires to create awareness. That has helped us to bring down the number of reported cases from 178 (in the under 19, under 17, under 15 and under 13 categories) last year down to 5 this year. Only one boy was reported in the under 19 age group this season and four in the under 13. There was none reported in the under 17 and under 15 age groups. This is certainly an encouraging sign; its a vast improvement from last year.
Mathivanan affirmed that this season in club cricket there were 6 bowlers reported for suspect bowling actions - 4 in the Premier and 2 in the Sara trophy tournaments. These bowlers he said were taken under the wing of former Sri Lanka fast bowler and member of the 1996 World Cup winning team Ravindra Pushpakumara who worked on their bowling actions at the Khettarama Stadium High Performance Centre.
Mathivanan attributed the success of the campaign to the Illegal Bowling Action Committee (IBAC) headed by former Sri Lanka double international Ishak Sahabdeen and the assistance rendered by former Sri Lanka umpires Asoka de Silva and Tyron Wijewardene who have worked assiduously towards trying to eradicating this menace that has affected Sri Lanka in world cricket.
The boys and coaches know that the umpires are also monitoring them. Some time back the umpires were just calling them but now they know their actions are being monitored and some of the suspect bowlers are not bowling at all. They may have even given up bowling, said Mathivanan.
One rule that has really discouraged illegal bowling is that schoolboys have been prohibited from wearing long sleeves when bowling so that any deviation of the arm can be visible.
The dire need to stamp out the chucking malady at school level came up after three Sri Lankan bowlers were reported for suspect actions during the 2014 ICC Under 19 World Cup in UAE. To prevent a repetition of it in the 2016 Under 19 World Cup in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka sent seven bowlers with suspect actions to the accredited testing centre in Chennai to have their bowling actions scrutinized and corrected. With the prior precautions taken no Lankan bowler was reported.
Buoyed by the success Mathivanan said that SLC would continue with their campaign each year.
We will start the campaign again in August to create more awareness with posters and also issue a CD with the bowling actions of what represents a fair and unfair delivery. Earlier we had the visibility drive through verbal communication only, said Mathivanan.
Well have posters put up in the schools and have workshops with the school coaches and umpires. Its only through the workshop program this awareness was created. We want to keep this campaign going each year as there are new boys coming through the under 13 age group upwards.
We just cant relax because this is an ongoing thing and the moment there are signs of relaxing this menace can always creep in, we need to conduct this program every year, he said.
Mathivanan stated that a budget of Rs. One million was approved for the drive last year and this year too he would get approval on a similar budget if not higher following the success of the campaign.

SLFP CC to take decision on Galle Face attendees
The Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will meet and decide on the course of action to be taken against the SLFP MPs who participated in the Galle Face May Day rally, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the Central Committee will not meet on May 5. Democracy in the SLFP is at its highest point now and therefore the fate of the Gall Face attendees will not be decided by one person such as President Sirisena or the SLFP or UPFA General Secretary. It will be decided by the SLFP Central Committee ,Amaraweera said.
According to Minister Amaraweera, elections will be held and there is no need for the Joint Opposition to organize `hartals demanding elections. An election cannot be won by just asking for it and the 2015 Presidential Election campaign saw large crowds flock to the rallies addressed by the former President.On that occasion only 500 or 600 persons attended the rallies addressed by the Common Candidate. However the former President was defeated and the Common Candidate won. The SLFP will never be divided. All will unite one day just as it happened at other times in the partys history.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that it is very painful to see the former President on the stage of another political partys May Day rally for the first time in the history. If he told that he wanted the Chairmanship of the SLFP, we would have supported him. When the top people unite, the followers will suffer. The best example is Buddhika Pathirana.
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said that disgruntled elements also participated in the Galle Face May Day rally. Some political parties had demanded those aspiring to be candidates at the next election to bring buses full of people to May Day rally. But the SLFP did not do that.

The Body Shop in Sri Lanka together with the Hilton Colombo hosted invitees at a session about sensitive skin and superfood for skin recently. A soothingly timeless pairing of milk and honey gets an upgrade in the brand new body care range from The Body Shop. Body Shop Marketing Head Aradhika Mehta introduced the brand and the new range to all the invitees. Superfoods are the next big thing in both beauty and cuisine, and the Hiltons Chef de Cuisine Chamlie Waidyaratne and Pastry Chef Ranjith Kapukotuwa explored this topic alongside. The event was attended by beauty bloggers as well as guests of Hilton Colombo.
1-in-3 women believe that they have sensitive skin, and caring for this can be a joyless task. The Body Shop has formulated a thoughtful range of skincare products to nourish, soothe and restore sensitive skin. With pleasurable textures and a hypoallergenic fragrance, this is for the woman who luxuriates in her skincare routine, stated Mehta. The Almond Milk and Honey range is 100% vegetarian and has been formulated without colourants. It was dermatologically tested on a large group of volunteers and an overwhelming majority of women found the range the ideal balm to soothe sensitive skin, with 95% saying that they would recommend the body lotion to others with sensitive skin. This Soothing and Restoring Body Lotion protects against uncomfortable, tight and itchy skin with silky smooth, fast-absorbing and lightweight moisture that lasts for 48 hours.
In the shower, choose from several options.

Stax takes on Hubway Challenge
Stax, the global strategy consulting firm has taken on the Hubway Challenge. It submitted an entry to the Hubway Challenge organized by Hubway which is a bike share programme in Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Sommerville MA, US.
They opened their bike trip data for the years 2015 and 2016 to the public to produce creative visualizations or other interesting tools related to how users get around metro-Boston using Hubway bikes.
Stax Inc., has gained recognition for innovative and analytical solutions offered through the consultancy firms based in Boston, Chicago, New York, Singapore and Colombo, Sri Lanka. Stax provides premier corporate and private equity clients with actionable answers based on deep research and analysis.
We at Stax, are proud to be part of a superior Data Challenge which has opened the horizon to our talented team who are keen on presenting unparalleled ideas in keeping with our vision, stated the Data Analytics Manager of Stax Colombo, Roshanthi Gunaratne.
Randika Rodrigo, Senior Data Analyst who worked on the solution further elaborated, Looking at the data we noticed that bike redistribution which was subsequently followed after all the bikes from a station were being used, seemed to be very inconsistent and inefficient.
This prompted us to suggest a mathematical and strategic approach to enhancing natural distribution, which would inevitably lessen the burden on bike distribution vans.
While analyzing data from previous years, we noticed that the departure volume was consistent over days of the week, time and by station.
Therefore, we were able to rank the stations by expected outbound volume.
Using this data we created a redistribution optimization tool for Hubway to be used by the dispatcher of bikes to distribute bikes to the nearest station with the most expected outbound volume and which currently shows a less number of bikes.
The optimum solution for Hubway offered by Stax was established after extensive research and it could be extended to other organizations with distribution networks.
Working with many manufacturers and retail stores, Stax has seen that one of the major challenges clients face is how to efficiently run the distribution network.
Stax can help clients set up cost effective, efficient, and technologically savvy distribution networks by creating similar tools based on clients historical data and predictive analytics.

Striking solution
In the days leading up to May Day, an announcement by Cabinet Spokesman and Minister of Health Rajitha Senaratne was to rock the political establishment- and generate much discussion about the fall and rise of former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka.
It all began at last Wednesdays post- Cabinet media briefing. Minister Rajitha Senaratne was to declare that Fonseka, who is now Minister of Regional Development in the National Unity government, would be offered a special post to deal with the current wave of strikes, work stoppages and protest campaigns that are disrupting public life.
It was the specific details that Minister Senaratne mentioned that gave credence to the issue. The Minister said that the post will be that of an Overall Commander. He said Minister Fonseka would have to quit his Cabinet portfolio to take up the position. He also said it would be for a period of two years.Minister Senaratne also elaborated on Minister Fonsekas response to the request. He reported that Fonseka had said he was prepared to undertake any responsibilities entrusted to him.
Naturally, the news made national headlines the next day. There was speculation that Fonseka would be resigning his ministerial position to take up this newly assigned responsibility. Fonseka himself was asked about the report.
To his credit, Fonseka offered a more plausible insight into what had transpired. He stated that the President inquired whether he would be in a position to instruct the Army- or the Armed Forces- in a situation which required their intervention. Fonseka said he had declined commanding the forces but had agreed to evaluate mechanisms which could be used to maintain public life, law and order.
Commendable proposal
While there was no other official reaction to the issue, the only other response came from Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers in the Cabinet- who largely downplayed and dismissed the idea.
Minister S. B. Dissanayake- also known for being outspoken- said that he believed that the offer was made to Fonseka only as a joke. I don't think the President was serious. The President asked Sarath Fonseka if he could be the Army Commander again. No one took it seriously, Dissanayake said.
However, Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, who attended the same press briefing after Dissanayake said the President's offer to Fonseka was noteworthy. He also said it was a commendable proposal as trade unions could not be allowed to disrupt public life in the country. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who is also the General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) however dismissed the idea. Minister Amaraweera told a news conference that the President only asked whether Fonseka could help implement a mechanism to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential services for which Fonseka agreed.
It was discussed during the Cabinet meeting that people had to face inconveniences due to strikes launched by trade unions without prior notice. It was said that the situation had arisen due to the overuse of freedom given by the government. The President said a special mechanism should be set up to provide essential services without any disruption. There were such mechanisms even during the war Amaraweera explained.
Minister John Seneviratne was to also endorse the view that what was discussed was not serious. When speaking about the non-ending strikes, the President has jokingly asked whether Minister Fonseka could control such situations, he said.
Militarys defeat of the LTTE
Minister Rajitha Senaratne, who triggered this reaction has meanwhile stuck to his guns. He maintains that his initial announcement was accurate. He said it was he who was responsible for reporting what transpired at Cabinet meetings to the media as the Cabinet Spokesman.
I state everything that happens there as the Cabinet Spokesman; because of that, the government will not fall into an abyss Senaratne declared, launching a thinly veiled attack on SLFP members who have their legs on both sides of the divide including those who are trying to join hands with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Whatever transpired at the Cabinet meeting, former Army Commander and now Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka has emerged with a higher profile after all the publicity he generated. It is indeed a remarkable comeback for the decorated soldier now holding the rank of Field Marshal.
Even Fonsekas critics readily acknowledge that he was one of the major architects of the militarys defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009. Having taken up duties as Army Commander at the height of the war with the LTTE in 2005, he was the target of a suicide bomb attack in April 2006. Fonseka survived and the trauma he endured reportedly strengthened his resolve to end the Eelam war.
Fonseka provided the military leadership for the LTTEs defeat in May 2009 and the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was to publicly say that he was the best Army Commander in the world. However, soon after relations between Fonseka and the Rajapaksas were to sour, leading to Fonsekas decision to contest the 2010 presidential elections.
Leader of the Democratic National Alliance
Fonseka secured only 40% of the vote against Mahinda Rajapaksas 58% but it was what happened thereafter that, in hindsight, ensured his popularity and a further foray into politics. Less than two weeks after the election, Fonseka was taken into military custody. The military announced he would be court-martialed for committing military offences during his time as Chief of Defence Staff. However, in April 2010, Fonseka contested the general elections and entered Parliament for the first time as the leader of the Democratic National Alliance. In August 2010, by proclamation from President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Fonseka was cashiered from the army, having been stripped of his rank, medals and decorations. His military pension was forfeited. In November 2011 he was sentenced to three years in jail.
Amidst local and international pressure President Mahinda Rajapaksa signed the order for Fonsekas release in May 2012. Subsequently, at the 2015 presidential election campaign, Fonseka extended his support to candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
Following his victory, President Sirisena gave Fonseka a complete presidential pardon and acquitted him of all charges on January 22, 2015, restoring his civic rights. The pardon restored his military rank and decorations as well as his pension. In March 2015, Fonseka was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal by President Sirisena.
In February 2016, he took oaths as a Member of Parliament for the seat vacated by the death of M. K. A. D. S. Gunawardana and two weeks later was appointed as Cabinet Minister of Regional Development by President Sirisena. In June 2016, Fonseka formally joined the United National Party.
Special appointment for Fonseka
Fonsekas rise from prison jumper to the Filed Marshals uniform is as spectacular as his fall from grace from Army Commander. The latest fuss about a special post can only enhance his reputation further.
Known as a ruthless disciplinarian, when there was speculation about a special appointment for Fonseka, the trade unions - mostly supported by opposition parties - were up in arms, claiming that their democratic rights were being curtailed. There were even pointed references to the previous regime and a return to the type of governance undertaken by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Whether Field Marshal Fonseka is given special powers or not, the government does have a challenging task ahead, dealing with the continuous spate of strikes that are affecting public life, the latest being yet another protest planned by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) tomorrow.
Desperate situations, they say, call for desperate measures. In such circumstances, what matters is not whether Fonseka is given a special title or not- but whether his experience and expertise can be utilised to maintain law and order and ensure the uninterrupted provision of essential services to the public.
That is certainly not a joke- and it could well be a task tailor made for Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.

Trinco Oil Tank Farm to be developed as a joint venture between CPC,Lanka IOC :PM
The political decision to develop Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm as a joint venture between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Lanka IOC has been made, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister, tabling the MoU on cooperation in economic development projects signed between the Governments of Sri Lanka and India during his visit to India last month, observed the MoU includes developing Trincomalee Upper Tank Farm as a joint venture.
Since 2003, the Sri Lankan Government is obtaining USD 100,000 per annum from the LIOC for the tanks leased to it. None said no to those monies. Now we have decided to lease this land to a joint venture and develop it. Our plan is to make use of this storage facility to enable the CPC to enter Indian market. There is no legal agreement yet. All stakeholders including the trade unions would be consulted before finalising the agreement, he noted.
The Prime Minister said the political MoU also includes proposals of a 500 MW LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya, 50 MW solar power plant in Sampur, appointing a joint committee to develop the Trincomalee harbour, encouraging Indian investors to invest in special economic zones in Sri Lanka, development of Northern road network and Lankan Railway line, construction of a new container terminal at the Colombo port also with Japan and CPC, and development of agriculture and livestock.
We have set time frames and now the two Governments should initiate discussions on each of the proposal in the MoU and ink agreements separately, he said.
He said Parliament would be informed of those agreements once finalised.
The Prime Minister commenting on Trincomalee development said the Magapolis and Western Development Ministry is making plans in this regard with a Singaporean company.
The private sector can make their own investments here and Japan and India have expressed their willingness to bring such investments. The operation of the port will be under the Sri Lankan Government. We should be able to deal with any country, attract their investments and develop our country. We are dealing with the companies of those countries and not the Governments. We will be unable to pay our debts unless we double our exports, he added.
The Premier, responding to a supplementary question by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila on the proposal over the gas distribution pipeline mentioned in the MoU, said it was only a concept adding that all parties could discuss and work out the details later.
The LNG Terminal/Floating Storage Regasification Unit in Kerawalapitiya is a project which Sri Lanka, India and Japan will work together. Minister Kabir Hashim proposed to include even Litro Gas Company to this project. Likewise, the concept can be developed through discussion. By any means, we will not let the security of the country be at stake. This has no connection to Manner gas deposits. Mannar gas deposits belong to our country and it is up to us to decide how to use it commercially the Premier explained.
The Prime Minister said the Cabinet of Ministers had given its approval for the MoU.

The UK parliament officially dissolved at one minute past midnight on Wednesday and will not resume work until after the general election on June 8.
Prime Minister Theresa Maycalled the snap electionto strengthen her hand innegotiations for Britain to leave the European Union.
On Wednesday she will visit Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to gain formal approval for the dissolution.
The UK voted almost a year ago to leave the 28-nation EU in a referendum and the so-called Brexit issue is set to dominate the election campaign.
May's Conservative Party is currently leading the opposition Labour Party by a large margin according to the latest opinion polls.
Three polls published at the end of last week suggested that about twice as many people plan to vote Conservative as Labour.
May has been criticized, however, for not taking part in television debates and for only allowing loyal supporters to her campaign meetings.
The Liberal Democrats, UK Independence Party and Scottish National Party trail behind the two main parties.
By law, parliament is dissolved 25 working days before an election takes place.
Lawmakers are stripped of the privileges of being a member of parliament, and if standing for reelection, must campaign alongside other candidates.
Government ministers remain in charge of their departments until after the result of the election is known and a new administration is formed.

Vertical living becoming the norm in Sri Lanka
Lamudis annual real estate market report on Sri Lanka is released. Each year, Lamudis researchers take an in depth look at the emerging markets where they operate. After consolidating the most important information about the economy and the local market, a whitepaper is created. This whitepaper aims to inform potential investors about the market, its potential, and its challenges.
Outside of the realm of investors, anyone interested in Sri Lankas real estate industry can consult this useful report. Readers can gain all the information they need without needing to hunt through data hidden on sites across the web.
As well as focusing on the real estate market specifically, this years whitepaper reports economic trends which emerged within the country over the last year. Sri Lankas economy is going from strength to strength with steady growth, increased urbanisation leading to greater wealth, and a rapidly expanding tourism industry. It is clear that the country has experienced an impressive revival since the end of the war in 2009. Positive trends indicate that now is a great time to invest in a country which is encouraging increasing amounts of foreign investment.
Real estate market report
With state of the art modern high rise buildings adorning Colombos skyline these days, it is fair to say that Sri Lankas real estate landscape has changed dramatically since peace was declared. Infrastructural development on the island is underway and although the focus of large commercial developments is still on the capital, other cities, such as Kandy, are on the cusp of booming thanks to increased tourism numbers.
Since Colombos growth is happening faster than elsewhere, both residential and commercial land and property command higher prices in the city. Property prices are increasing in both sectors.
However, property across the island remains affordable with young professionals being the main purchasers of residential city property. Apartment living was not a concept that was familiar to most Sri Lankans until recently. It seems that living habits are changing with vertical living becoming the norm as the country becomes increasingly developed.
Changes that took place in 2016
Alongside price trends, this years whitepaper outlines demographic trends and changes in laws which are encouraging new target markets, including overseas investors.
The new visa options available for potential buyers are detailed in the whitepaper as well as plans to initiate real estate investment trusts.
Sri Lanka is emerging from being under global investors radar to being a destination for profitable business decisions. 2017 looks hopeful as many world class developments are underway. Next years whitepaper promises to bring yet another balanced report on this flourishing haven for property seekers.

Weerakumara raises concerns on legal limitations
Presidential Commission on Treasury bond issue:
National Freedom Front Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake yesterday raised concerns on legal limitations under which the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue is operating.
MP Weerakumara was responding to the media after testifying before the Commission yesterday.
Weerakumara said the Commission informed him to give evidence under the limitations of a legal framework.
I cannot give evidence without speaking of my conclusions. I saw the COPE subcommittee on the Treasury Bond issue being checked. I doubt that the Presidential Commission is also under legal restrictions. But I hope it will not be the case, he said.
MP Weerakumara said the Commission will have a broader legal framework to operate. He said the Commission will not become a discussion as to what happened.
I asked the Commission as to why I was summoned if they cannot question me. The Commission had the same problem. They should listen to the statement I have to make and filter what is important, he said.
I asked as to why only Arjun Mahendran had a lawyer representing him when there are about 15 primary dealers involved in the transaction.
Meanwhile, at the Commission, while Weerakumara was testifying, objections were raised against his testimony. Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva and Nihal Fernando PC said Weerakumara is only making allegations and stating conclusions.

WiLAT partners with UN Womens HeforShe campaign for women empowerment in SL
Women in Logistics and Transport (WiLAT) was formed to enhance womens representation in the Logistics and Transport industry by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT).
In pursuing WiLAT Sri Lankas mission in empowering women in Logistics and Transport and in celebration of their 4th anniversary a colorful event was held on March 20 at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo. The key highlight of the evening was that WiLAT partnered with UN Womens HeforShe movement to promote women empowerment in Sri Lanka. The theme for the event was Be Bold for Change in line with this years 108th International womens day.
Speaking at the event, Chairperson WiLAT, Gayani de Alwis said, as per UN Women; men consist of 60% of the employed labor and 95% of the CEOs of the worlds largest corporations are men. In Sri Lanka, 75% of the labor participation is by males and female participation is only at 36.2%. The achievement of gender equality requires an inclusive approach that recognizes the crucial role of men and boys as partners for womens rights.She thanked UN Women and the 10 corporates for supporting this cause by being bold and walking the talk. Gayani commended the organizing committee led by project chair, Dhashma Karunaratne for organizing this event in grand style which attracted over 225 WiLAT members and invitees.
As such, WiLAT invited CEOs to lead by example through actions that demonstrably advance and empower women. Globally 1,416 CEOs have signed up as an expression of support for advancing equality between women and men to: Bring the broadest pool of talent to their endeavors; Further their companies competitiveness; Meet the corporate responsibility and sustainability commitments; Model behavior within the companies that reflects the society they would like for their employees, fellow citizens and families; Encourage economic and social conditions that provide opportunities for women and men; and Foster sustainable development in the countries in which they operate
WiLAT was indeed successful in obtaining leading Logistics organizations such as Aitken Spence, Colombo International Container Terminals, Expolanka, Hayleys, Hemas, John Keells, McLarens, South Asia Gateway Terminals, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, and Unilever to support their women empowerment initiative by obtaining CEO statements assuring and guaranteeing womens empowerment in their respective organizations.
The keynote speaker of the event was Carl Cruz, Chairman Unilever Sri Lanka. Cruz highlighted the key strategies adopted by Unilever Sri Lanka to promote women participation and empowerment. Unilever is one of the 10 top corporates who have pledged support globally for the UNWomens HeforShe initiative.
This was followed by an engaging panel discussion which was moderated by Kasturi Chellaraja Wilson, Managing Director Hemas Pharmaceuticals and Hemas Logistics and Maritime sector of Hemas Holdings PLC with the participation of many other eminent industry personnel such as Ruwan Waidyarathne Managing Director Hayleys Advantis, S Premachandra, Managing Director Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Shiromal Cooray, Chairperson Sri Lanka Institute of Directors and Managing Director Jetwing Travels, Ramaaya Salgado Country Focal Point UN Women Sri Lanka, and Dr. Nisha Arunathilaka Research Fellow Institute of Policy Studies.
The panelists discussed challenges and hurdles encountered by them pertinent to women empowerment and what possible solutions were taken to continue this great initiative.
Ramaaya Salgado said, UN Women is happy to partner with WiLAT, who is the pioneer in womens empowerment in the Logistics and Transport industry in Sri Lanka. UN Womens HeforShe movement is a growing network globally and its encouraging to see 10 leading local corporates joining this Global movement to make the workplace more conducive for women
Dhashma Karunaratne, Vice Chairperson of WiLAT Sri Lanka and project chair of HeforShe campaign concluded by sharing some insightful information; research confirms that gender equity worldwide can lead to a 12-trillion dollar increase in Global GDP; stating that while men bring important skills to a workplace, an equal proportion of women would introduce different  and just as effective  skills, which, when pooled together, an organization would see a surge in creativity, innovation and growth.

Winning Schoolboy cricketer award passport to national honours - Atapattu
The battle for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Division one title has turned out to be a keenly contested tussle between two players of the same team.
A slim margin of 46 votes separates Peterites Lakshina Rodrigo and Santhush Gunatileka who are engaged in a neck to neck contest. Rodrigo leads at the end of tenth weeks count with 8,993 votes while his fellow teammate Gunatileka is closely following in the second place with 8,947 votes.
But the Peterite due will not have the things easy as they are being followed by Isipathanas Sanjula Abeywickerma who is placed third with 8,721 votes. Infect, a mere 272 separates first three in the latest division 1 votings.In division two and three the top contestants Piyumal Sinhawansa ( St.Annes, Kurunegala) and Charitha Basnayake of (Bandarawela CC) were cruising along.
Meanwhile, former Sri Lanka captain and ex-Sri Lanka national coach Marvan Atapattu said that he considers the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title he won in 1990 as a certification or a guarantee that he would play for Sri Lanka.
When I had been performing well and scoring constantly for Ananda as a schoolboy cricketer, many considered me as a future Sri Lanka prospect. Although I too had felt that I had a chance, there was no guarantee, he said.
Atapattus crowning glory as the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year 1990 was an assurance that he would play for Sri Lanka. All those who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title before me had gone on to play for Sri Lanka with distinction. So, when I won the title, I knew that I too could join that select band, provided I work hard, Atapattu recalled as the early era of his career.
I considered it to be a certification and a guarantee that I would play for Sri Lanka, a source of encouragement and inspiration. So I worked harder, dedicated myself and gave 100 per cent to achieve that goal. I finally made it shortly after winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title, the 46-year-old former Sri Lanka opener said.
Just a few months after winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, young Atapattu was selected to make his Test debut against India in the one-off Test in Chandigarh on November 23, 1990.
I see schools going all out to win matches, rather than targeting to producing top cricketers to play for Sri Lanka national team. In an inter-school match, or at any level for that matter, one team has to win. But that does not necessarily mean that the standard of that particular school team has improved. In my opinion, what is important for a school is the number of players they produce to play for Sri Lanka, the veteran former Ananda, SSC and Sri Lanka captain said.
Unlike during his era during which many schoolboy cricketers directly matched into the national team, Atapattu sees a huge gap between the present day school cricket and international level. You can hardly identify a schoolboy cricketer and say that he would play for Sri Lanka.
When I look at the present Under-19 players, except for one or two, I dont see future national prospects who have potential to become great Sri Lanka players, he said.
But Atapattu does not put the blame on players. Instead, he said that wrong guidance and coaching they have got due to undue competition to win matches at any cost, have killed young talent. I dont blame players.
It is because of the wrong guidance and coaching they have got. Old boys,principals, school masters and coaches are only interested in winning matches, rather than producing quality cricketers to play for Sri Lanka, he pointed out.
Atapattu said players switching schools and coaches trying to Import outstanding players from outstations to make champion teams has affected school cricket. Offering a chance to a top player or two from outstations could be approved as an inspiration to outstation cricketers.
But the present trend is far from that. I know a particular instance where top schoolboy cricketer from Kalutara had even been offered cash incentives to change school teams. This is crazy. School coaches, principals and old boys must act in a responsible manner rather than hiring players from outstations just for the sake of winning, he said.
Atapattu, famous for his superb technique as a solid opening batsman, said they had a huge respect for their coaches during his era.
I wonder whether the players have the same respect for their coaches now. Some teams say they have obtained the services of level one coaches but their ability to produce and offer proper guidance and coaching to the players could be questionable, he said.
He attributed improper guidance and coaching as the reason for school crickets faliure to produce enough national level players for the Sri Lanka pool. I dont blame schoolboy cricketers. At that young age, they do all what the coaches say.
It is something to do with the wrong or improper advice they get. It is important they change the approach and think of a broader aspect of producing quality players. It is all about the number of players they produce for the national team and not just the number of matches a team wins, he stressed.
It is the duty of the coaches, principals, masters and Old Boys to abandon the present practice of merely winning matches. Instead, they should focus on producing top cricketers. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) should look at a big picture at the highest level, he said.
Asked about reasons that had attributed to poor spectator interest, unlike during his school era, Atapattu said the present day school cricket lacks brilliant individuals.
Why should somebody come to see a match when all 11 players in a team are alike During our days, spectators, irrespective of their school affiliations, came to see top players in action, respective of their school affiliations. That does not happen now because there are no outstanding players who could woo spectators, he said.
