Air Force make Police fight hard for 24/12 win
Police Sports Club scraped through to a hard fought win against a fighting Air Force outfit by 24 points ( 3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion) in their Dialog 'A' Division league rugby second round match played at Police Park yesterday. Police led 10-nil at the breather.
After a tremendous fight for supremacy by both teams to put the points on board, Police were successful in doing so in the latter stage of the first half when in the 39th minute the referee awarded a penalty.
Their nippy scrum half Sudam Sooriarachchi took a quick tap and sliced through the Air Force defence to score a superb try. Full back Reeza Mubarak made the conversion and Police went into a 7-0 lead.
Just on the stroke of half time Police received a penalty for an infringement by Air Force and their reliable kicker Mubarak made no mistake with a 30 metre penalty to increase their tally to 10-0 at the half.
Immediately on resumption in the 46th minute Police captain cum second row forward Chanaka Udara picked up a loose ball from a ruck and dived over mid left for their second try of the match. Once again Mubarak fired across the conversion and the score stretched to 17-0.
In the 65th minute of the game Police won a line out in their 22 metre line and off the ensuing rolling maul, their gigantic number eight Radeesha Ranjan scored one of his trade mark tries of the ongoing rugby season. Mubarak who had an outstanding game and a 100% record with his boot, put over the conversion once more and Police went ahead further to a 24-0 lead. After this set back the Airmen finally got their act together and opened scoring in the 80th minute, when off a quick tap Isuru Jayaratna crashed through for a try mid right. National centre and last year's Air Force skipper Charith Seneviratne fired across the conversion and the score read 24-7 in favour of Police.
In the 82nd minute of the game Police star number eight Radeesha Ranjan was sent off the field for unwarranted play where he obtained his second yellow card of the match.
In the dying stages, Air Force worked their three quarter line wide; to enable their cracking full back Nuwan Perera to form the overlap by joining the line and dart across the field for a brilliant try far right covering nearly 35 metres. Seneviratne surprisingly fluffed the conversion.

CR-Havies game should be a ding dong battle
CR and FC who suffered a nail-biting 15-12 defeat at the hands of Kandy SC in Nittawela last week will go all out to make amends for it when they take on Havelocks SC in their Dialog 'A' Division League return rugby match at Havelock Park today. Kickoff is at 6.45pm under lights.
The lads from Longden Place went down 34-18 in the first round game played on their home ground and another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected. CR will miss the services of sturdily built hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya, winger Anuradha Herath and flanker Dilanka Perera who are on the injured list.
The Park club will be sans Dulaj Perera and Danushka Ranjan who are also down with injuries. Flanker Shenal Deelaka who missed the last match due to injury makes a welcome return to the Havelocks team.
Havelocks who scored a hard fought 27-24 victory against Police SC last week will strive hard to pull off this game in their favour.
CR and FC (Probable XV): Nipuna Devinda, Lahiru Pavithra, Shane Sambandapperuma, Ishan Noor (captain), Panduka Angammana, Sasanka Ariyaratna, Jason Dissanayake, Arun Kumar, Kavindu de Costha and Tharinda Ratwatte, Bhanuka Nanayakkara, Ashan de Costa, Kanchana Ramanayake, Kavindu Perera, Prince Chamara.
Havelocks (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Prasad Padmasanka, Ganuka Dissanayaka, Sithum Peiris, Janik Jayasuriya, Shenal Deelaka, Rohitha Rajapaksa, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, Rahul de Silva and Samantha Lakshan, Kevin Dixon, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Sadun Herath (captain), Rimzie Jamaldeen.
Kandy go out favourites
The high-riding Kandy SC will go out favourites against Navy SC in their Dialog 'A' Division League return game at Welisara today. Match commences at 4.30pm.
Kandy gave a pathetic display against CR and FC last week at Nittawela and will have to come up with a much better performance if they hope to overcome the Sailors who have notched up victories over CR, Army, and Police before holding the much fancied Havies to a remarkable 20-all draw at Havelock Park.
The forte of the Navy side have been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with another superb display with Roshan Ranasinghe, Sathya Ranatunga, Supun Peiris, Nivanka Prasad, Matheesha Sarathchandra and Sajith Saranga likely to give of their best.
Navy SC (Probable XV): Roshan Ranasinghe, Nisal Desatha, Sathya Ranatunga, Matheesha Sarathchandra,, Chathura Dilshan, Supun Peiris, Nivanka Prasad, Sajith Saranga, Richie Dharmapala and Chanaka Chandimal, Saliya Handapangoda, Lee Keegal, Kosala Thisera, Heshan Maduranga, Thilina Weerasinghe.
Kandy SC (Probable XV): Piyumal Manchanayaka, Damith Dissanayake, Kishore Jehan, Shehan Dimitri, Gayan Ratnayake, Heshan Kalhara, Shehan Pathirana, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratna (captain) or Srinath Sooriyabandara and Nigel Ratwatte, Richard Darmapala, Gayan Weeraratne, Lavanga Perera, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Danusha Dayan.

Kohli chases Jayasuriya/Sangakkara records in Asia Cup
NEW DELHI: With the commencement of the Asia Cup 2016, the focus from Virat Kohli's personal life is bound to shift on his professional life.
Having recharged his batteries with a break during the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka, India's vice-captain will be rearing to go come February 24.
The right-hander was in supreme form on the recent Australia tour, further cementing his reputation as the batting heir to Sachin Tendulkar. While Kohli has continued to accumulate runs in ODI and Test cricket, a marked improvement was witnessed in his T20 batting Down Under. This makes him the most lethal batsman in the world, especially on sub-continent wickets.
The incredibly fit Kohli, firing on all cylinders, is a warning sign for fellow Asian giants like Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Considering the form of both Kohli and the Indian side, there is a high probability that the Delhi lad will finish as the Asia Cup's highest run-getter.
A look at Kohli's past performances in this tournament further enforces this hypothesis.
1) Virat is 8th on the list of most runs in the history of the Asia Cup. He has scored 613 runs in 11 outings.
2) The 28-year-old boasts of the highest individual score (183) in the tournament. The 4th and 28th positions also belong to him.
3) Kohli (61.30) is 5th when it comes to the highest averages in the Asia Cup.
4) With a strike rate of 97.14, he commands 9th place on the list for highest strike rates.
5) Kohli, with 3 tons from 10 innings, is 3rd on the most hundreds list. The two players above him - Sanath Jayasuriya (6) and Kumar Sangakkara (4) - have played 24 and 23 innings respectively.
6) When it comes to most runs in a single Asia Cup series, Kohli is 3rd with 357 runs from 3 matches in the 2011/12 edition. Jayasuriya is on top with 378 runs from 5 matches.

Sweden plans to house migrants on cruise ship
SWEDEN: Sweden plans to house nearly 1,800 migrants on a luxury cruise ship, as it struggles to cope with its share of the huge migrant influx into Europe, officials said Thursday.
An American charter company, US Shipmanagers, is set to provide its liner the Ocean Gala, built in 1982 and transformed into a floating hotel anchored in a Baltic Sea port.
"The provider has to find a homeport and the vessel has to be appraised" to make sure it meets safety and comfort standards, Swedish migration agency spokesman Alexandra Elias told AFP.
Negotiations are well on track to agree details of the arrangement, under which the agency will pay 450 Swedish krona (48 euros) per passenger to US Shipmanagers.
The charter company wants to anchor the Ocean Gala in Haernoesand, some 400 kilometres (250 miles) north of Stockholm, but local authorities there are opposed, officially for administrative reasons. Sweden is struggling to find space for the 163,000 asylum seekers who arrived in the Scandinavian country last year, part of the huge wave of migrants flooding into Europe, many fleeing war in Syria.
Due to a shortage of beds in migrant centres, thousands are housed in churches, mosques, gymnasiums and evacuation centres run by civil security authorities. "The situation is still tense. In 2016 we will need an extra 20,000-30,000 places," said Elias. Five thousand refugees housed in campsites or holiday villages will have to make way for tourists before the summer.
The tide of refugees entering Sweden was significantly reduced after Stockholm reinstated random border controls in November.
Slightly fewer than 700 asylum seekers were registered in the last seven days, compared to some 10,000 new arrivals per week last October.

Tamil Nadu fishermen to 'lay siege' to Sri Lankan High Commission

Fishermen from eight coastal districts in Tamil Nadu have decided to 'lay siege' to the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission at Chennai on February 29, demanding release of 29 fishermen from the state, lodged in prisons in the island nation.

They have also demanded release of 78 fishing boats.

A decision to this effect was taken yesterday at a meeting of fishermen's panchayat leaders of Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, Tuticorin and Kanyakumari districts here.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Rajendran, president of the fishermen panchayat in Nagapattinam district, said 29 fishermen from various parts of the state are now lodged in Sri Lankan prisons.

"Seventy eight fishing boats have been seized by Sri Lankan naval personnel in 2015 and had not been released yet. The boats are valued at between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 30 lakh each, depending on their size," he said.

Fishermen's associations have been organising a series of agitations since January 26, demanding immediate action by the Union Government, Rajendran said.
On January 29, they had resorted to road and rail blockade at Karaikal. They also laid siege to the port in that city.

However, it had not yielded any positive result and so a decision was taken by fishermen to 'lay siege' to the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission at Chennai on February 29, he said.

"If that agitation also fails to get back the fishermen and boats, we will intensify our agitation statewide," he added. (economictimes)

Tennis sees most suspicious betting identified in 2015
Tennis accounted for nearly three-quarters of all suspicious betting identified by a leading sports gambling watchdog in 2015.
Essa says it identified 100 cases with 73 of them occurring in tennis matches.
Last month a BBC and BuzzFeed News investigation found evidence of widespread suspected match-fixing among leading players over the past decade.
Essa issues alerts to regulated bookmakers across Europe when irregular activity is spotted on a match.
If several bookmakers confirm that they are encountering suspicious betting patterns, the watchdog sends a formal warning to the sport's governing bodies.
Of the 73 cases, 24 of them occurred in the final three months of 2015.
According to Essa, football - the world's biggest sports gambling market - attracted suspicious betting on 19 matches worldwide.
The BBC and BuzzFeed investigation found 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 in the past decade have been repeatedly flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) over suspicions they have thrown matches.
All of the players, including winners of Grand Slam titles, were allowed to continue competing.
Following the report, the Tennis Integrity Board, which oversees the TIU, said it would start an independent review into its anti-corruption practices. This will take at least 12 months. The TIU said in a statement that suspicious betting activity in tennis is not necessarily proof of corruption.
All information supplied by betting operators is analysed by the TIU. This analysis includes many other factors that can influence results, including player fitness, fatigue, form, playing conditions and personal circumstances.
If the analysis suggests suspicious activity, the TIU moves to investigation, which includes interviewing players, taking phones and laptops.
An alert can be an indicator of suspicious activity. But it is not proof or evidence that corruption has taken place.
On its own, betting data is not sufficient to bring forward a successful prosecution; it has to be considered, assessed and verified along with the TIU's many other sources of intelligence.
Statistics of the kind released by Essa must be considered in that light.
Unranked Thai player Jatuporn Nalamphun has received an 18-month ban and a $5,000 (3,490) fine after being found guilty of betting offences under the Tennis Anti-Corruption Programme. - BBC

There's more to it than meets the eye
There's more to playing Under 19 cricket at international level than playing first eleven cricket at school. That was the hard truth that emerged from Sri Lanka's performance at the recently concluded ICC Under 19 World Cup held in Bangladesh. Sri Lanka finished fourth in the overall standings losing to India in the semi-finals and then to Bangladesh in the play-off for third place.
Sri Lankas leading wicket-taker
Asitha Fernando
"The batting was the main thing we were not getting that extra 30-40 runs. The players are not converting scores of 20-30 to another level. Other than Charith (Asalanka) nobody could go to the 60-70 mark then automatically what happens is the partnerships we are looking at is not happening," said Sri Lanka under 19 coach Roger Wijesuriya assessing the team's performance at the Under 19 World Cup.
"We were getting only 30-40 partnerships and at times the situation was so nice for them that they needed only to occupy the crease to get the required total. Pacing out an innings is something they will learn with experience.
"The way I see it is there are two things, one is the pressure and the other the risk factor. For e.g. Charith Asalanka handling the pressure is very good but he takes the risks too early, then he realized it and kept on batting. There are two kinds of players - one lot is they don't know how to take the pressure and take the score to another level, the other is the risk situation that they are taking too early," he said.
Overall Wijesuriya said that he was not happy with the performance of the team because they were well prepared for the tournament.
"We had a very good balanced side and the boys were very clear with the plans and what we wanted to achieve. They knew what was expected of them in all three departments but once you come to the middle neither can the coach or anybody do it for them," said Wijesuriya.
"I am really happy with my bowling and fielding the bowlers stuck to their plans. If we had totals of 240-250 the wickets would be very much easy to take because the batting side has to go for it. You take the Bangladesh match we had a golden opportunity to score about 240, if we had that total the bowlers would have got the chance to take the wickets, it would have made their job easy," he said.
"With Avishka's (Gunawardene) assistance everything was very nicely planned in the batting but at the end of the day Avishka can't go to the middle and do it for them. The players must realize that it is their responsibility to do it in the middle they must learn to adapt to the situation and pace out the innings accordingly. It's a learning process for everybody and it won't come overnight. The more exposure they get playing matches they'll learn."
Wijesuriya said the difference between the Indian and Bangladesh sides in comparison to Sri Lanka was that their players had got great exposure to playing cricket at a higher level.
"The majority of the Indian cricketers play in the Ranji trophy so there exposure to bigger cricket is very much high," explained Wijesuriya. "You take Bangladesh before the under 19 World Cup they had played something like 30-50 matches whereas our players had not played even 15 matches. The Bangladeshis they camp together and if you see the facilities they've got we can't even get closer to them. The ground facilities and centres everything is fantastic.

"In Sri Lanka if an international team tours the country we play about 20-25 players and at the end of the day nobody gets the best exposure. This World Cup we went with 15 players but only 13 played that is how we should play a series at home against international teams," he said.
Wijesuriya said the shortcomings at under 19 level had nothing to do with the schools.
"The schools are producing the cricketers. Schools can't do anything more than that. It is our duty from Sri Lanka Cricket to get the players to train more with our district coaches and play district, provincial or zonal matches and in under 23 tournaments to give them the exposure and maturity," said Wijesuriya. "There's no point blaming the school associations because they have done their duty. It's our duty from SLC to fine tune them and get them to higher level.
"Last year we didn't play an under 17 two-day and under 19 three-day tournament as scheduled. These are tournament that must be played as scheduled. Every year we should have a proper calendar going then the selectors have an easy task to pick the best. It's an ongoing process. At the same time for inbound and outbound tours we must try to see whether we can give one or two boys to play in the Sri Lanka 'A' team. "We have to identify about 15 to 20 players and get them to play at a higher level with senior cricketers so that they get the exposure and learn. That is how we can make that extra mile. These are ways where we can improve these boys. They need exposure at higher level than they get at school," Wijesuriya said.
From the 15-member squad that took part at the U19 World Cup only two players Chamindu Mendis and Jehan Daniel will be eligible to play at the next U19 World Cup which will be held in 2018 in New Zealand. However Wijesuriya stated that the majority of the players could still play under 19 cricket for another year and they would figure quite prominently in the two upcoming series scheduled for June-July against South Africa and a tour to England in July-August.
