Country making progress overcoming many obstacles
Finance and Media minister Mangala Samaraweera asserted that the country is now moving forward with a stable economy after overcoming many obstacles in the past.
Minister Samaraweera noted that when the new government assumed office there were two main challenges to resolve, the huge debt problem and the rights issue which had tarnished Sri Lankas image in the eyes of the international community.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking at a ceremony organised to commence the Matara stage IV water supply project at the National Water Supply & Draining Board Office premises at Nupe,Matara last Sunday.
When we came to office, this government was burdened with many things.
Debt was one, human rights violations was another. We have been able to successfully address both issues by now. We have more challenges in this regards but we are on the right track, Minister Samaraweera said.
The minister explaining the debt situation noted Sri Lanka has to repay Rs.3.2 trillion of debts within the next two years but our annual income is only Rs. 3.12 trillion.
The minister said, we have to find ways and means to pay theses debts in 2018 and 2019. It should be noted that of this 82% were loans obtained by the previous government. By leasing the Hambanthota Port, we have been able to attract investors to the Hambanthota, Monaragala, Galle and Matara districts not only from China but from South Korea, Germany, India and Japan.
With similar ventures in the pipeline, we would be able to increase government revenue, the Minister said.
The minister also noted that it was the governments policy to develop the country in collaboration with other nations.
Whenever development projects were introduced they have always met with criticism but it is those who criticised the
most in the past that are making most use of them now. It is now that we are laying the foundation to develop this nation for the future generations, Minister Samaraweera added.
The minister also stressed that the government will not pass on the countrys debt to the future generations.
He said the government has initiated a massive islandwide development programme and the public will receive the benefits of the programme within a very short period.

Sri Lanka, 1983: Jude Ratnam was five years old. He fled the massacre of the Tamils instigated by the majority-Sinhalese government on a red train. Now a filmmaker, he takes the same train from the south to the north of the island.
As he advances, the traces of violence left by the 26-year-old war, which turned the Tamils fight for freedom into self-destructive terrorism, pass before his eyes.
Reminiscing about the fighters and Tamil Tigers, he unveils the repressed memories of his compatriots, opening the door to a new era and making peace possible again.
Demons in Paradise is the result of 10 years of work. For the first time, a Tamil documentary filmmaker living in Sri Lanka is showing the civil war from the inside.

Status quo at AIBA until September court ruling
Geneva: A Swiss court rejected Monday an urgent provisional management shakeup at amateur boxings ruling body AIBA, ruling the push to oust embattled president Wu Ching-Kuo could wait for a proper hearing.
The Swiss court has announced today (Monday) its decision to reject the requests for urgent provisional measures, AIBA said in a statement.
The court has decided that the condition of extreme urgency was not fulfilled.
Wus executive committee has passed a motion of no-confidence against his leadership and had asked Swiss courts to approve a temporary administration, accusing the Taiwanese president of financial mismanagement.
AIBAs executive committee meeting in Moscow last month passed the no-confidence motion, claiming that the body was on the brink of bankruptcy.
The organisations headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland were closed for a week following the no-confidence vote, before reopening on August 2.
Executive committee member and Wu rival Pat Fiacco of Canada told AFP last week that AIBA had racked up debts worth 15 million Swiss francs ($15 million, 13.1 million euros).
Fiacco said they wanted Swiss justice to take provisional measures until October or November when an AIBA board meeting will vote on the no-confidence motion.
Wu has meanwhile charged his rivals with trying to pull off a military coup, and insists the organisation is on sound financial footing.
According to Mondays statement, the Lausanne court saw no reason to rush through emergency measures.
A hearing is scheduled on 17 August 2017, at the occasion of which the parties and their legal counsels will be heard. A decision on provisional measures will then be rendered by the court, it said.
This decision maintains the status quo and AIBA will therefore keep functioning in full accordance with its statutes, it added, stressing that this meant Wu and his management team would remain in place.
According to a spokeswoman for the Lausanne court, Liliane Beuggert, a ruling in the case is not expected until September.
In the meantime, AIBA said it was focusing on organising the next World Boxing Championships in Hamburg from August 25 to September 2. AFP

Act now on climate change
Several districts in Sri Lanka have experienced a severe drought for the past several months. A few areas such as Anuradhapura witnessed rains last week, but the other areas are yet to receive rain. Residents have to trek miles to get drinking water or wait till a water bowser turns up. Agriculture and livestock have been severely affected, adding more woes to an already battered economy in these regions.
This is just one of the signs that climate change is real and happening in our region too. Rainfall patterns have changed drastically over the last few decades and droughts have become common. And when rain finally comes, devastating floods occur. This applies to the whole of South Asia, not just to Sri Lanka.
This is why we need a collective South Asian response to the problem of climate change. Fortunately, all eight SAARC countries are signatories to the Paris Climate Accords and it should be possible to take action right now to turn the tide. This is essential, because extreme temperatures in South Asia could reach dangerous thresholds by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed, according to an alarming new study published in the Science Advances journal.
A two degree rise by 2100 has already been predicted for the world as a whole, but South Asias fate could be worse. Millions of people in one of the most populous regions could face serious heat danger if the planet reaches high-end warming levels projected for 2100. Researchers say the disastrous scenario could be avoided if countries meet their commitments to keep temperatures from rising more than 2C by 2100.
Human beings, like any other animal, have their physical limits. Above certain temperature and humidity thresholds the body can no longer function properly and will eventually die. South Asia has already experienced what it would be like - a heat wave in India and Pakistan in 2015 killed roughly 3,500 people.
Here is the biggest paradox  South Asians are the least responsible for climate change, but seem to be the most vulnerable. These are people who did not contribute to the root cause of the [climate] problem, notes Elfaith Eltahir, a hydrology and climate expert at MIT and one of the studys authors. The accumulated emissions have been contributed primarily by the rich fraction of the worlds population, he adds. This research shows the kind of outcomes that could happen if we keep going in this trajectory of no action related to climate change or minimal action.
Eltahirs modelling uses wet bulb temperature, a scientific measurement that combines temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover to measure heat stress in direct sunlight. This has been chosen because temperature is not the only element of weather that affects the human body. Generally, a wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit  approximately the temperature of the outside of the human skin, which tends to be a few degrees cooler than the bodys core temperature  is likely to be lethal after just a few hours.
Lethal wet bulb temperature refers to a condition that almost universally leads to death within about six hours unless people are able to get away from the heat, such as by going indoors into an air-conditioned space. This presents another problem  not many households or even companies in South Asia can afford air-conditioning. Any mortality at a time when air conditioning technology is broadly available will be clearly unacceptable. The effects of unchecked temperature rise would extend beyond the health concerns associated with being outside in high temperatures. With workers unable to stay outdoors for extended periods of time, the regions economy and agricultural output would also decline.
There will probably be more intense typhoons and cyclones as global temperatures go up. As mentioned previously, the rains could be far more devastating. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has forecast fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall. This means more flooding, and less rainwater getting the chance to percolate underground to recharge aquifers. An increase in temperatures will also result in a global sea level rise. Nineteen of the 25 cities most exposed to a one-metre sea-level rise are in Asia. Islands such as the Maldives face the biggest risk, because they could literally disappear.
Recent surveys show that the South Asian public is very much aware of the negative effects of climate change. A recent Pew research survey completed in India found that 47 percent of the participants saw climate change as a major risk. Sri Lankans are also now aware of the negative effects of climate change after repeated exposure to drought and floods. However, the local media should launch more awareness and educational programmes on climate change in all three languages. Climate change must be incorporated to the science curricula in schools so that children will gain an understanding of how they could reduce their Carbon footprint. Indeed, all South Asians must do their bit from now on to save their region from becoming a parched land.

Furthermore, the OHSAS uses a management approach tool called the PDCA (Plan, DO, Check, Act) cycle, which is an ongoing process that enables an organization to establish, implement and maintain its health and safety policy based on top management leadership and commitment to the safety management system.
The safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. Providing them with a safe working environment is a responsibility we take very seriously. This drives us to minimize risks associated with health and safety within the workplace.
This dedication has allowed us to maintain an impressive safety track record and this latest certification is further validation of our commitment to the highest safety standards, said Advantis Bunkering Director Praneeth Gunawardena.
Advantis Bunkering is a fully owned subsidiary of Hayley Advantis Limited, the transportation and logistics arm of Hayleys PLC.

The company has established itself as a reliable bunker supplier at all ports in Sri Lanka, and went on to expand its services to the Maldives in 2016.
OHSAS 18001 is an Occupation Health and Safety Assessment Series for health and safety management systems and is intended to help organizations mitigate occupational health and safety risks. It was developed in response to the widespread demand for a recognized standard against which to be assessed and certified.

Ali bowls England to South Africa series win
Manchester: Moeen Ali finished a brilliant campaign with a five-wicket haul as England beat South Africa by 177 runs in the fourth Test at Old Trafford on Monday to seal a 3-1 series win.
Victory, achieved with more than a day to spare, also saw Joe Root triumphant in his first Test series as England captain.
South Africa, set a huge 380 for victory, were bowled out for 202 shortly after tea on the fourth day when Ali took two wickets in two balls to remove Morne Morkel and Duanne Olivier.
That gave the off-spinner a return of five for 69 in 19.5 overs and 25 wickets in total in a series where he also scored 252 runs.

This result meant England had won their first home Test series against South Africa since 1998.
It was also just South Africas second defeat in 20 away Test series, their other overseas campaign reverse in that sequence coming against India in 2015/16.
South Africa, 43 for three at lunch, saw Hashim Amla (83) and captain Faf du Plessis (61) put on 123 for the fourth wicket.
But Ali then took three wickets for five runs in 11 balls -- including the prize scalp of Amla -- as the Proteas collapsed from 163 for three to 173 for six.
Earlier, Ali, both the man-of-the-match and the man of the series, made 75 not out off just 66 balls in Englands second innings 243, having been dropped on 15.
That left South Africa facing a mammoth chase, with no side having made more to win in the fourth innings of a Test at Old Trafford than Englands 294 for four against New Zealand in 2008.
South Africas already difficult task was not helped when they lost both openers, leaving them at 18 for two.
Dean Elgar, who made a gritty second-innings hundred in Englands 239-run victory in the third Test at The Oval, fell for five on Monday when caught behind off Stuart Broad.
Heino Kuhn, struggling to cement his Test place, repeatedly played and missed before, on 11, edging James Anderson, again bowling from the newly-named James Anderson End, to Cook.
Temba Bavuma again battled hard until, from the last ball before lunch, he was given out caught behind on review off Toby Roland-Jones.
Amla completed a 100-ball fifty with his ninth four, a pull off Ben Stokes.
He then twice forced Stokes off the back foot for two stylish offside fours before driving Ali for six.
But with South Africa 163 for three, Amla missed an intended whip shot off Ali and was lbw, although England, for the second time on Monday, had to first review umpire Kumar Dharmasenas original not out decision.
No replays were required when Quinton de Kock (one) edged a drive off Ali to Alastair Cook in the slips.
And 173 for five became 173 for six when Theunis de Bruyn fell for a duck, nicking Ali to slip fielder Stokes. The end came quickly for South Africa, 182 for six at tea.
Du Plessis, who played at Old Trafford for Lancashire, had added just one to his tea score when he was caught behind off Anderson, Englands all-time leading Test wicket-taker.
Anderson, who finished with three for 16, then had Kagiso Rabada caught in the covers. Ali, appropriately, finished the match with Morkel holing out for a duck before Olivier, also out for nought, was taken by Stokes at slip. - AFP

Ambulances to use expressways for free

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne will present a cabinet paper requesting to allow ambulances to travel through expressways for free, Health Ministry spokesman said.
The spokesman said that currently, health workers transport patients in critical conditions by their own expense.
When transferring patients in critical conditions to the Colombo National Hospital, ambulance drivers use expressways, the spokesman said.
The issue was brought to the Health Ministers notice while he paid a visit to the Puttalam Base Hospital for an inspection.
During the visit the Health Minister has ordered health authorities to transfer additional nurses from Kurunegala district to the Puttalam Base Hospital in order to end the shortage, the sources said.

Amir takes five for Essex
LONDON: Pakistans Mohammad Amir took five for 18 as English County Championship leaders Essex had the better of the opening day in a First Division encounter away to Yorkshire at Scarborough on Sunday.
The left-arm fast bowlers first five-for for Essex in just his second Championship match was instrumental in Yorkshire being skittled out for a meagre 113.
Essex ended the first day on 188 for five, a lead of 75 runs, with captain Ryan ten Doeschate 61 not out.
The 25-year-old Amir, along with then Pakistan captain Salman Butt and pace partner Mohammad Asif, was banned in 2010 for deliberately bowling no-balls as part of a spot-fixing scam during that years Lords Test against England, with all three players later jailed by an English court.
But since his return to Pakistan duty in January last year, Amir has again become a regular in all three international formats.
He returned impressive figures of three for 16 in six overs as Pakistan upset the form book to thrash arch-rivals India by 180 runs in the final of the Champions Trophy one-day international tournament at The Oval in June.
Prior to Pakistans tour, of England last year, former England captain Alastair Cook said all match-fixers should be banned for life to protect crickets integrity. Cook, still an England opener, has spent his whole county career with Essex.
But Amir, speaking after joining Essex following his Champions Trophy campaign, insisted in June that he had no problems with his new team-mate.
I met him the first day when I arrived and he was very nice, said Amir of Cook.
No (there are no issues between us), nothing. Hes always nice and always very supportive.

Animal instincts
Animal prints are an essential part of the fashion lexicon. Back in the day, spots and scales had a dubious reputation  but this season theyre small, quiet, and set against a backdrop of royal blue, green and noir, making it a lot more sophisticated.
Designer Aditi Somani points out that animal and bird motifs have been a favourite with Indian craftsmen since centuries. A closer look at Indian art reveals that when these motifs have been used in fine arts, they have a deeper meaning attached to them (representation of a temple, gods and goddesses, etc). And when the same birds and animals have been employed in decorative arts, they reflect the worldly environment devoid of any ideated meaning. An interesting thing about this seasons animal-inspired fashion is animal motifs on a sari. I think its catching up and we will be seeing a lot of it. Motifs of elephants or deer are the most common these days and these have found their way into all kinds of saris from Ikat to Kanjeevaram.
Besides these, she says one can watch out for kantha embroidery depicting animals and birds along with motifs inspired by cave art, Egyptian murals, Hindu mythology and even pop art illustrations.
Celebrity stylist Rupa Chourasia agrees. I think animal motifs have reigned in the Indian art circuit including Indian fashion. Their usage in garments, I believe, mostly came into the picture since the Mughal era when the zari work or zardozi became popular. However, style gurus say that animal print can never be tamed completely, but there are many ways you can bend its power to your will. Do accentuate it: if you want to put a focus on the pattern, you should keep the rest of your outfit subdued. Treat it like any black item in your wardrobe. The animal pattern will stand out without being overpowered and fading into the background.
Be subtle: animal prints are easy to find, but if youre looking into freshening it up, start looking for animal patterns in hazy neutral shades. Never mix prints.
The prints will completely compete with each other, ultimately resulting in a total messiness. Whether its clothing, a pair of shoes or purse, experiment with your items, but be sure not to overdo it. That means no bright colours. Learn how to strike a balance with your items and note that when it comes to animal print, sometimes less is more.

Aussie Olympic legend Betty Cuthbert dies
SYDNEY, Monday  Australian Olympic icon Betty Cuthbert, the only athlete to ever win gold in the 100m, 200m, and 400m, has died aged 79 after a long battle with multiple sclerosis, officials said Monday.
Cuthbert shot to fame as a little-known 18-year-old at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, winning the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, earning her the nickname Golden Girl by local media.
She suffered a hamstring injury at the Rome Games four years later and briefly retired, before being coaxed back to the track to win the 400m at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.
During her career, she set nine world records, four of them in 1958, and remains the only athlete, male or female, to win Olympic gold in the 100m, 200m and 400m.
Swimmer Ian Thorpe is the only Australian to claim more Olympic gold medals, with five.
Betty was the Golden Girl of the track and a national heroine, said Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates.
Its very sad to lose such a great champion. Betty battled her illness for many years and showed tremendous courage, but more importantly she always managed to smile.
Athletics Australia president Mark Arbib called her inspiring.
She is the only athlete, male or female, to win Olympic gold in the 100m, 200m and 400m, with her trophy cabinet also including three medals from the Commonwealth Games, he said.
She will be forever remembered as a legend of the sport and a trailblazer for our female athletes.
Born in Sydney, she moved to West Australia in later life after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1969, which confined to a wheelchair.
She returned to the spotlight in 2000 when she took part in the ceremony to light the cauldron at the Sydney Olympic Games.
Cuthbert was an inaugural member of the Athletics Australia Hall of Fame and she was inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.
Rest in peace Betty Cuthbert -- an inspiration and a champion on and off the track, tweeted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, while fellow track legend Cathy Freeman said: Thank you for the inspirational memories, Betty Cuthbert. - AFP

The Australian Government confirmed that 13 illegal maritime arrivals (IMAs) were returned to Sri Lanka on August 4.
The individuals returned were not intercepted on a recent illegal maritime venture.
These non-citizens have been found not to engage Australias protection obligations, and have no lawful basis to remain in Australia.
People who have no lawful basis to remain in Australia are expected to return home. Settlement in Australia will never be an option for anyone who attempts to travel to Australia illegally by boat.
The Australian Government is continuing its efforts to remove IMAs if they have been found to have no valid claim to protection, and have no further outstanding immigration matters.
Australia will continue to remove individuals and groups to Sri Lanka, on both a voluntary and involuntary basis.
Australia remains committed to stamping out people smuggling and preventing people from risking their lives at sea. Any people smuggling boats that attempt to reach Australia will be intercepted and turned back.

Between chaos and order
The origins of violence have mystified and fascinated humans for centuries. It can be seen in an act of rape or murder. It can be seen in the classroom bully and the school yard bully. It was seen in the weapons David Koresh amassed. It found a place in the warped mind of Hitler.
Religious bodies have offered their own explanations of violence. In fact the bible speaks of the origins of violence as one that is spiritual. One that is older than the world itself. It speaks of a violence between the Arch-Angel Michael and the Angel Satan (and possibly the angels they commanded) that was waged over this world. Violence has found its way into all forms of literature.
And it has become a subject of curiosity for Mackenzie Nix. Though by no means a violent man Mackenzie Nix has observed aggression and is intrigued by it. Daily News chatted with Mackenzie on this dark aspect of life that is the theme of his exhibition of ink drawings and digital prints called Things Fall Apart. His exhibition will be taking place at the Barefoot Gallery from August 4 to September 3.
After completing high school in Australia there is a gap year. That is common in Australia. So he went to South America for seven months and lived in Peru. He has been to Berlin and been to Jordan as well.
Mackenzie is a designer studying to be an architect. He finished his degree in Sydney in 2015 - Design in Architecture.
I came here to Sri Lanka in 2015. I really liked Sri Lanka from what I learnt about its architecture. It has so much social meaning in it. I came back in 2016 and decided to work here.
Nix has moved to Sri Lanka in 2016 to work under Channa Daswatte to help record and document endangered heritage architecture in Galle Fort for the Galle Heritage Foundation.
In your everyday life or wherever you are, sometimes you encounter objects that seem to have so much meaning associated with them. For me in Sri Lanka and when I was travelling in Berlin (which started this mode of thinking), I started to think that, there were some objects, that when you look at them you kind of notice that there is this whole history of violence behind them. You dont know if it is a domestic item or a religious item, but through these items you can kind of get a glimpse into this violence that runs under through so much history, culture and religion, said Nix.
Nix referred to the biblical character Noah in our conversation. The problem is Noahs son did not do anything wrong but was punished. So that is the bone of contention. In Christianity it is not good to get drunk. And all of this is never explained.
After the story of the flood Noah gets drunk after consuming wine and falls into a slumber, and his son Ham saw his fathers nakedness and got his brothers to cover Noah. When Noah woke up he cursed his sons descendants to slavery. So when I read it, I sort of felt the story did not go the way it was supposed to. You have this real injustice done to this boy in this book the bible, which is supposed to be a just book and the foundation of humanity. I found it to be a very strange event which had an undercurrent of violence, stated Nix.
Nix confessed that he is not sure where this fascination with anger and violence comes from. He feels that he has this fascination with dark details of things. It has always been there. Maybe it is a deep seated discomfort. This is my first exhibition. After this I guess I can call myself an artist, but I have never really thought of myself as an artist. I am a very visual person. This is more what I like to do. I came here to do Architecture but most of the work I have done is this. So it is all slowly taking over, said Nix.
Despite our efforts at a carefully constructed society, things fail. Things fall apart. Chaos erupts. There is very thin veneer between Chaos and Order. It can all fall apart in a split second.
Maybe violence is the wrong word to use. I dont know the proper word. Maybe I am talking about this bubbling disorder. So basically the themes I explore are basically violence, disorder and chaos. I think you need to contain violence for a society to function but it will always be there. It is always waiting. It is just life. It exists in nature. Things start to fall apart and the world breaks down. Recognizing it can actually free you from the problem or certain ways of thinking. There are dogmas and political agendas that people try and force on you. They are all these very surface level things. There are bigger undercurrents, explained Nix.
We all carry a certain amount of anger within all of us. It does not mean you are homicidal. It is just a part of being human. All these things collide and fall apart and living in a world with so many different people, that violence does exist. But having that anger in you, it does not make you are violent person, it is a part of life, said Nix.
Nix illustrated another example  the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. God told his angels to rescue Lot and his family. But asked them not to look back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. But Lots wife looked back and was turned to a pillar of salt.
I always found that story very disturbing. Even though god singled out these good people to save, he killed one of them. So this was really disturbing to me. Not every thing is just and good. And that system of morals breaks down. Both Noahs son and Lots wife saw something and were punished. Lots wife just witnessed something and she got punished. Why did that happen Maybe that happened because there is no morality and that system does not exist, explained Nix.
So when you take the story of Noah it is really very insidious and dark. This idea of punishing innocent people is very strange. Even Jesus is so different from the God of the Old Testament. Comparing those things together is very interesting. In the Old Testament things are very murky and a bit primordial and very ancient. You find it difficult to draw the line between justice and injustice. But even Jesus was aggressive, once kicking the traders out of the temple. In one incident he even sent the demons in a man, Legion, into a horde of pigs. But those incidents are also very just.
I just find aggression really interesting to think about.

Biomed International installes Lankas first 3D Technology in Operating Theatre at Sri Jayewardenepura
Biomed International (Pvt) Ltd, a pioneer in the Medical Equipment Industry has introduced yet another countrys first with the installation of Three Dimensional (3D) High Definition Video Laparoscopy System at Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital, Kotte for Urological Surgery.
The 3D HD Laparoscopy System installed is being successfully used by the team at Sri Jayayawardenapura Hospital headed by Consultant Urologist and Transplant Surgeon Dr.Niroshan Seneviratne.The commissioning of the System has created a new benchmark in technology and has added value to the pioneering medical and nursing team to better their care and service for patients in the region.
The salient feature of the 3D HD Laparoscopy System is that, when minimally invasive procedures are performed by the surgical team, sharp 3 Dimension view of organs are captured in the monitor screen and the surgical team utilizes / wears 3D glasses to view the images up-close, which enhances the feeling that one can actually touch the organs viewed on screen.
The state of the art 3D Laparoscopy System manufactured by B.Braun Aesculap AG, Germany renderers many benefits for Laparoscopic Urological surgery said Dr. M. Seneviratne.
It provides better view of the internal surgical field where the procedure is being performed, allowing the surgical team to get depth-perception, gives greater magnification and view of the urinary system including reproductive organs and many other advantages.
The 3D HD feature helps make suturing easier in Urology surgeries compared to a 2D Laparoscopy system.
The ability to perform Surgeries laparoscopically where the surgeon looks into a live video image is a contrast from open-surgery (laparotomy), where the surgeons would be looking down at the area of surgery, after performing a large-cut in the abdomen.
Laparoscopy is used in urology at the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital for both kidney and prostate surgery.
With the 3D Laparoscopy System installed at Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital it has taken Laparoscopic surgeries performed at the hospital into a whole new level benefiting both the surgical team and patients, said Chamindra Dharmapala, Deputy General Manager-Sales, Biomed International (Pvt) Ltd.
Several private sector hospitals too have contacted us to obtain this machine.
Biomed International (Pvt) Ltd is aa pioneer in the Medical Equipment Industry since 1989 which is renowned for introducing and delivering cutting edge technology to the healthcare industry in Sri Lanka.

Bowie scorches 100m, Walsh masters shot put
LONDON, Sunday  American Tori Bowie upset Jamaican favourite Elaine Thompson to win world 100m on Sunday, as New Zealander Tomas Walsh dominated the shot put with a stunning series of throws.
Before another packed-out session at the London Stadium, Greek pole vaulter Ekaterina Stefanidi and heptathlete Nafi Thiam also added world titles to the Olympic golds they won in Rio last year.
Earlier in the day, Kenyas Geoffrey Kipkorir Kirui won the mens marathon to make up for his countrys podium no-show in the last two championships, while Kenyan-born Bahraini Rose Chelimo edged veteran Edna Kiplagat to win the womens race.
Twenty-four hours after the fireworks of the mens 100m final when Usain Bolt was upstaged by arch-rival Justin Gatin, Bowie ensured the US team made it 2-0 in the sprint stakes over Jamaica on day three of the championships.
Bowie made up for her silver at the Rio Games with a savage dip at the line that saw her win in 10.85 seconds, just one-hundredth ahead of Ivorian Marie-Josee Ta Lou, with Thompson fifth (10.98).
The dive doesnt feel too good now, said US champion Bowie. I never give up until Im over the line.
Bowie fell to the ground after crossing the line and initially it was Ta Lou who celebrated only for the board to say otherwise.
I had no idea that I had won, said Bowie. The only thing I knew was that tonight I was going to lay it all on the line.
Thompson had started well, but faded after the halfway mark, unable to find an extra gear as she has done most of the season.
Ta Lou then emerged as the clear leader but Bowie ate into her advantage and then produced the dip of her life to take the title from under the diminutive Ivorians nose.
In the field, Walsh was in imperial form, producing his best, 22.03 metres, with the sixth and final effort in the mens shot. The 25-year-old former builder edged out Americas defending champion Joe Kovacs, who posted a best of 21.66.
There was drama to the end, however, as Kovacs was left fuming that his final throw that appeared to be more than 22m was ruled, rightly, a foul.
Croatias Stipe Zunic took the bronze with 21.46m whilst there was disappointment for Olympic champion Ryan Crouser, who could finish only sixth with 21.20m.
To pull it out on the last one is awesome, said Walsh.
I knew that Crouser was going to attack on the last attempt and it is so special for me to know that I was able to attack, too.
Greeces Olympic champion Stefanidi enjoyed a compelling battle with American Sandi Morris in the pole vault. The 27-year-old vaulted a national record of 4.91 metres for victory, failing three times at what would have been a championship record of 5.02m. Morris, the world indoor champion and Olympic silver medallist on countback from Stefanidi in Rio last year, claimed silver with a best of 4.75m.
Cubas defending champion Yarisley Silva shared bronze with Robeilys Peinado of Venezuela.
Stefanidis feat was mirrored by Thiam, the 21-year-old Belgian doing just enough in the seventh and final event of the heptathlon, the 800m, to amass a winning total of 6,784 points, with overnight leader Carolin Schafer of Germany taking silver with 6,696.
It was a really difficult year, with a lot of pressure but I managed to produce a great performance, Thiam said.
The thing with sport is, it doesnt always pay off when you work hard and youre never really sure if youre going to produce something great. Im doing great things at the moment but I know hard times are going to come at some point, they do for everyone. But as long as its going good Im going to use my happiness as motivation.  AFP

The Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (FIU-Sri Lanka) entered into Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the China AML Monitoring and Analysis Centre and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Kingdom of Bhutan at the 20th Annual Meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), held in Colombo recently, to share financial information in facilitating investigation and prosecution of persons suspected of being involved in money laundering and terrorist financing (ML and TF).
FIU-Sri Lanka Director Dr H Amarathunga signed the MOU with China AML Monitoring and Analysis Centre Director General Luo Yubing and Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan Deputy Governor/Head of FIU Phajo Dorjee on behalf of the respective institutions.
These MOUs have been entered into in terms of the provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006.
China became a member of the APG in 2001 and joined the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as a fully fledged member in 2007.
The FIU-Bhutan which was formally established in October 2010 within the Royal Monetary Authority, obtained its membership of the APG in 2011.
The FIUs across the world adopt MOUs to cooperate with each other through the exchange of information in order to combat ML and TF which are more often internationally connected and emanating from global criminal activities.
In view of this, greater coordination among Financial Intelligence Authorities is facilitated through MOUs which provide a legal framework adaptable to each country. This has been introduced by the Egmont Group, the association of FIUs worldwide. With the signing of the above two MOUs, the total number of MOUs entered into by the FIU-Sri Lanka, has increased to 35.

Minister for Commerce and Industry Rishad Bathiudeen and Ambassador of Peoples Republic of China, Yi Xianliang were the Guests of Honour on this occasion.
Ambassador Yi Xianliang urged Sri Lankans to make use of this opportunity to foster partnerships in infrastructure investments with their Chinese counterparts to mutually benefit and prosper both countries.
The Ambassador said the President of the Peoples Republic of China is eager to assist Sri Lanka industrialize and furthermore that since Sri Lanka is small, it is best to develop large industrial zones in few locations. As such, the area around Hambantota Port would be ideal for a large industrial zone. This would complement harbour activities to make it viable.
The Chinese Ambassador also suggested the use of the Chinese RMB as a mode of currency for trade with China, which stands now at US$ 4.3 billion.
Using the Chinese RMB this could be considerably increased. He also touched on the Hambantota Port Agreement and said that the Chinese Government will strongly promote the industrial zone based around the Port.
Several presentations by by the heads of organizations and key institutions of the Government of Sri Lanka were made to the Chinese investors ranging from opportunities for investment in Sri Lanka by the BOI, Western Megapolis Development Project (plans, projects and opportunities for investment) and also opportunities for investment in other sectors such as tourism and leisure, the water supply sector and irrigation infrastructure.
Part Two was segmented into presentations made by three major conglomerates in Sri Lanka (Hayleys Plc, Aitken Spence Plc and John Keels HoldingsP lc) which was followed by two Chinese counterparts presenting their companies to the audience.
At the end of the forum the Chinese Investors interacted with prospective Sri Lankan collaborators and formed links towards which the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka would be pleased to facilitate partnerships in fostering infrastructure investment in Sri Lanka.

DENGUE PLEA
In spite of several appeals to the relevant authorities through the newspapers to look into the haphazard road construction work at Lake Drive Rajagiriya, no action has been taken which has resulted in a recent death due to dengue and continues to cause severe inconvenience and health hazards to the residents.
Road construction work at this highly residential location began over two years ago with heavy machinery being used for the process which damaged the existing road. Holes dug up were not properly filled back making it dangerous for vehicles and pedestrians, specially at night. Moreover, rainwater collects in these holes making it a breeding place for mosquitoes and causing a potential threat of dengue to the residents.
Rocks disposed along the side of the road have not been placed in a secure manner with the threat of coming loose and causing damage to residents vehicles and property. No one knows who is handling the road construction work which is being carried out in a very lethargic manner and most of the time the workers are seen lazing around or sleeping and chatting to each other and barely any progress is evident.
The funny thing is that inspectors from the authorities warn the residents regularly on taking measures to prevent dengue and threaten to fine them if they fail to comply. However, no action is taken against the ugly mess caused by the road construction workers.
It is high time that someone in authority investigates this matter and finds a solution to the problem faced by the residents of Lake Drive Rajagiriya which has been a burning issue for well over two years.

Code of choice
The freedom of association for purposes or objects which are lawful is an aspect of pluralism which underpins the concept of democracy. It is natural that in labour relations in a pluralistic society, collective bargaining is recognized as a fundamental tool through which stability is maintained while the freedom of association is the sine qua non because without the right of association, the interest group in a society  employees and employers  cannot function efficiently.
Among the basic principles of the International Labour Code are the freedom of association and collective bargaining in the conduct of industrial relations. The freedom of association is of little procedural value unless there is a concomitant right to act collectively. Therefore, the link between ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 to which Sri Lanka is a signatory above key Conventions is a substantial one. The study noted that restrictions exist in the Trade Unions Ordinance regarding membership and other rights to federate.
Social justice and human rights
Social justice and human rights are intimately connected. Without human rights guaranteed by civil liberties, social rights have no meaning. Political freedom, civil liberties, social justice and cultural vitality are the mutual complementary expression of the freedom of human spirit. Freedom of Association provides the fundamental ground for the formation of any kind of organisation with lawful objects. The recognition of this right under the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka authorizes for the formation of non-governmental organisations and trade unions under the basic law of the country.
The present Constitution of 1978 deals with the right to freedom of association more explicitly. The following guarantees relevant to this freedom receiving specific mention are as follows:
(a) Freedom from Torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment (Article 11);
(b) Prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, place of birth, political opinion or anyone of such grounds (Article 12 (2));
(c) Freedom from arrest, custody, detention and personal liberty, the deprivation of which shall be only in accordance with established legal procedure (Article 13); and
(d) Freedom of speech, the expression including publication, the freedom of peaceful assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to form and join a trade union and the freedom of movement (Article 14).
These rights are however, subject to restrictions prescribed by law in the interests of national security, public order, the protection of public health or morality, or for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others, or meeting the just requirements of the general welfare of a democratic society (Article 15(7)). The use of the word law includes regulations relating to public security. Freedom of Association is subject to restrictions prescribed by law in the interests of racial and religious harmony or national economy. Article 15(4)). Exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine a question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right is vested in the Supreme Court (Article 17, Article 118 (b) and 126(1)). The 1978 Constitution also states that the freedom of speech, expression, peaceful assembly, association and the right to join a trade union shall, in respect of the armed forces, police and other forces charged with the maintenance of public order, be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them. (Article 15(8)).
The Scope of the Fundamental Rights is guaranteed by Article 14(1) (c) and (d).
Fundamental rights
The Courts in Sri Lanka have defined, clarified, and extended the application of those fundamental rights in various decisions handed down from time to time. In De Alwis v. Attorney General, the petitioner, the Secretary of the relevant trade union, disputed his transfer on the ground that it was to discourage the trade union work of petitioner, and alleged a violation of his fundamental right to association under Article 14(1)(d). It was submitted on behalf of the State that Article 14(1)(d) only guaranteed the freedom to form and join a trade union and that as the petitioner did not complain that he had been prevented from joining a trade union, there was no infringement of his fundamental right. Tambiah J. held that:
Article 14(1)(d) should not be read so narrowly and literally, and if [this] narrow interpretation is accepted, the enshrined fundamental right would remain an empty right. The words form and join must refer not only to the initial commencement of the Trade Union and the initial admission to membership but also to the continuance of the Trade Union and membership. The right .. also carries with it the concomitant right to freely engage in lawful Trade Union activity. If a Trade Union member or official is penalized or victimised for indulging in legitimate Trade Union activity, he would be entitled to complain to this court that his fundamental right under Article 14(1) (d) has been violated.
In Wijeratne v. AG, where the petitioners complained that the Police had seized posters (containing demands, inter alia, for salary increases and permanency of employment), which had been prepared by members of a trade union for a picketing campaign, the Supreme Court held that:
The planned protest was clearly not a hasty, strident, over-reaction to a trifling or transient grievance, but a patient, subdued and dignified plea to the conscience of the community for a living wage[The Petitioners] freedom of speech and expression was violated by the seizure of his posters.. by preventing the non-violent demonstration, his freedom of peaceful assembly was infringed; and since that protest and assembly was a legitimate activity of a lawful association .. his freedom of association was also impaired..

Dennis Lillee the best fast bowler produced by Australia
Dennis Lillee had his Test debut in 1971 v England at Adelaide played in 70 Tests, took 355 wickets at an average of 23.92, best bowling figures were 7 for 83, he had 23 five-wicket and 7 ten-wicket hauls. According to Ian Botham, in his book My Autobiography, Lillee was the best fast bowler; he has ever played against, and credits him being a master craftsman and says he had everything.
He was the hardest working cricketer ever; his commitment to the cause was incredible. In Dennis Lillees book, My Life in Cricket, he states that during Australias tour of England in 1981, he had a period of personal tension and ran into trouble at Lords. He was desperate to get in some net practises with Allan Border and John Dyson, who had stayed down while the team went to play Northamptonshire. But Lillee has found in the past it was no easy matter getting facilities for practise at Lords. Several times before, he had been thwarted when he telephoned the ground and asked to use the nets. Some official told him that nets were not available, only to find out for himself later that he could have been fitted in quite easily recalls Lillee. When he phoned that time, he was put through to the room attendant who said there was a game in progress between Eaton and Harrow (the two top schools in England). The attendant has said that they would not be able to use the nets, but that they could change somewhere else in the ground.
He has also stated that there will be a bit of activity near the net area, but Lillee had said that they wanted to use the nets and will not get in the way, so the three of them went to the ground. They had contacted Jeff Thomson who was playing for Middlesex at that time to make arrangements to borrow some of his gear (theirs was with the team in Northampton) and he agreed that they could get some of his gear out of the Middlesex dressing room (the home team at Lords). They got some balls from the room attendant and some towels for a shower afterwards and then they went to get Thomsons gear, the boys using the room had told them, they were quite happy for them to use there dressing room, which they did. Lillee goes on to state that they duly had their net practises and by the time they had finished the Eton-Harrow game was over, and therefore Allan Border and he had run a few laps of the ground - to the accompaniment of some terrible jeering from the Eton-Harrow supporters still drinking and eating away up in the private boxes and in the grand stands.
Lillee recalls when Border and he arrived at the dressing room; they were confronted by Jack Baily the secretary of the MCC. He had kicked John Dyson out of the room, when he saw him said rather venomously, What are you doing here Lillee has said we have been practising. Who said you could practice, was the sharp retort. Surely we are allowed to practice and determine ourselves when we do that Lillee replied quietly. Baileys voice rose each time Lillee opened his mouth. This time who said you could practice here He shrugged, nobody said we could practice here, but we thought we could come down here and if we could not practice, we could have a run around and do some exercises. His reply brought Lillees blood to the boil, but you cant do that without official consent.
Lillee then through clenched teeth murmured, I have a few things to say to you, and said to Bailey that he is sick and tired of going through those channels only to be told one thing and find out another.
We thought we would take the chance and come down here today - if there were no facilities we would have had a run and gone back to the hotel. By now, Lillee was nicely warming up to the occasion. We got to practise somewhere, Lillee added, upon which Bailey repeated his edict about requiring official permission. Thats so much like you people, Lillee said and you sit at your desk with your suit and tie on and try to control guys like us who are trying to get out and do something. In Australia, if your people wanted to practice before a Test, they would be treated like kings.
We always knew that the English people by and large are Toffee nosed, till you get to know them well. However, the Australians are friendly folks who greet you and treats you well.
Denis Lillee was a diehard fitness fanatic, who took everything front on, battled through several severe injuries and came up trumps, to become the great bowler he was.

'Dodgy' greenhouse gas data threatens Paris accord

Potent, climate warming gases are being emitted into the atmosphere but are not being recorded in official inventories.
Air monitors in Switzerland have detected large quantities of one gas coming from a location in Italy.
However, the Italian submission to the UN records just a tiny amount of the substance being emitted.
Levels of some emissions from India and China are so uncertain that experts say their records are plus or minus 100%.
These flaws posed a bigger threat to the Paris climate agreement than US President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw, researchers told BBC Radio 4'sCounting Carbonprogramme.
Bottom-up records
Among the key provisions of the Paris climate deal, signed by 195 countries in December 2015, is the requirement that every country, rich or poor, has to submit an inventory of its greenhouse-gas emissions every two years.
Under UN rules, most countries produce "bottom-up" records, based on how many car journeys are made or how much energy is used for heating homes and offices.
But air-sampling programmes that record actual levels of gases, such as those run by the UK and Switzerland, sometimes reveal errors and omissions.
In 2011, Swiss scientists firstpublished their dataon levels of a gas called HFC-23 coming from a location in northern Italy.
Between 2008 and 2010, they had recorded samples of the chemical, produced in the refrigeration and air conditioning industries, which is 14,800 times more warming to the atmosphere than CO2.
Now the scientists, at the Jungfraujoch Swiss air monitoring station, have told the BBC the gas is still going into the atmosphere.
"Our estimate for this location in Italy is about 60-80 tonnes of this substance being emitted every year, then we can compare this with the Italian emission inventory, and that is quite interesting because the official inventory says below 10 tonnes or in the region of two to three tonnes," said Dr Stefan Reimann, from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology.
"They actually say it is happening, but they don't think it is happening as much as we see.
"Just to put it into perspective, this greenhouse gas is thousands of times stronger than CO2.
"So, that would be like an Italian town of 80,000 inhabitants not emitting any CO2."
The Italian environment agency told the BBC its inventory was correct and complied with UN regulations and it did not accept the Swiss figures.
Another rare warming gas, carbon tetrachloride, once popular as a refrigerant and a solvent but very damaging to the ozone layer, has been banned in Europe since 2002.
But Reimann told Counting Carbon: "We still see 10,000-20,000 tonnes coming out of China every year."
"That is something that shouldn't be there.
"There is actually no Chinese inventory for these gases, as they are banned and industry shouldn't be releasing them anymore."
China's approach to reporting its overall output of warming gases to the UN is also subject to constant and significant revisions.
Its last submission ran to about 30 pages - the UK's, by contrast, runs to several hundred.
Back in 2007, China simply refused to accept, in official documents, that it had become the largest emitter of CO2.
"I was working in China in 2007," said Dr Angel Hsu, from Yale University.
"I would include a citation and statistics that made this claim of China's position as the number one emitter - these were just stricken out, and I was told the Chinese government doesn't yet recognise this particular statistic so we are not going to include it."
Areport in 2015 suggested one error in China's statisticsamounted to 10% of global emissions in 2013.
The BBC investigation also discovered vast uncertainties in carbon emissions inventories, particularly in developing countries.
Methane, the second most abundant greenhouse gas after CO2, is produced by microbe activity in marshlands, in rice cultivation, from landfill, from agriculture and in the production of fossil fuels.
Global levels have been rising in recent years, and scientists are unsure why.
For a country such as India, home to 15% of the world's livestock, methane is a very important gas in their inventory - but the amount produced is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
"What they note is that methane emissions are about 50% uncertain for categories like ruminants, so what this means is that the emissions they submit could be plus or minus 50% of what's been submitted," said Dr Anita Ganesan, from the University of Bristol, who has overseen air monitoring research in the country.
"For nitrous oxide, that's 100%."
There are similar uncertainties with methane emissions in Russia, of between 30-40%, according to scientists who work there.
"What we're worried about is what the planet experiences, never mind what the statistics are," said Prof Euan Nisbet, from Royal Holloway, University of London.
"In the air, we see methane going up. The warming impact from that methane is enough to derail Paris."
The rules covering how countries report their emissions are currently being negotiated.
But Prof Glen Peters, from the Centre for International Climate Research, in Oslo, said: "The core part of Paris [is] the global stock-takes which are going to happen every five years, and after the stock-takes countries are meant to raise their ambition, but if you can't track progress sufficiently, which is the whole point of these stock-takes, you basically can't do anything.
"So, without good data as a basis, Paris essentially collapses. It just becomes a talkfest without much progress."

A drama teaser dubbed Julius Sneezer!
Back in the Elizabethan era only men could act and so they had to take on both male and female thespian roles. Acting in Elizabeths England was frowned upon my many in society as a profession unsuitable for women, as it was rough and rowdy instead of genteel.
As a result, women were not legally permitted to act on the English stage until King Charles II was crowned in the year 1660. Shakespeare and his contemporaries therefore had no choice but to cast young boys in the roles of women, while the men played all the male roles on stage.
convent schools
The same was true in Sri Lankan boys schools in the 60s when co-education was confined to the kindergarten. Boys attending Baby Class in cloistered convent schools were kicked out as soon as the good sisters thought they were getting a bit too big for their britches.
In primary and secondary school we were made to perform a whole lot of cross-gender roles in the name of Shakespearean drama or any drama for that matter. At the time there were too many boys performing girls roles. And obviously the equivalent was true in girls school dramatic societies where lasses draped in mens period Roman costumes performed male roles.
In all such cases if the pants, pantaloons, breeches or togas did not quite fit, neither did the skirts. And so it was when the St. Bens Dramatic Society staged its Shakespearean plays. Legendary drama coach Koti Wilson insisted that all such plays kept strictly to the straight and narrow versions. The plays were always staged with hardly a deviation from Shakespeares original style. The martinet Koti Wilson, pounced on his charges at the slightest infraction with tigerish proclivity. Short, squat and dark complexioned his rotund figure belied his lightning agility to rend slap-happy blows to his students.
Bizarre costumes
He would be turning in his grave had he witnessed some of the contemporary adaptations of the genre that were staged subsequently with bizarre modern costumes of the times. His favourite expression to motivate the students was: You dont mess with the Great Bard ever. And Wilson adored the works of Shakespeare just this side of idolatry.
Soon after, the neighbouring Shepherdian Convent was to stage Julius Caesar with an all female-cast. The same girly cast tittered fit to die when some of us sashayed on stage in the guise of women. So we whistled shrilly when the entire feminine shebang presented the Bards tale of love, loyalty and betrayal. It was revenge at its sweetest when we reviewed the play in our college magazine The Ben referred to the bevy of attractive assassins and the play as a whole as: Chock full of Babes with Blades.
professional thespian
I must have been around 16 at the time and was cast as Caesars wife Calpurnia, to which I vehemently objected. I was insistent that I play the heroic Mark Anthony because I had studied the role by memory and could spew out the classical funeral oration with the eloquence confidence and panache of a professional thespian. The idea of performing as a flamboyantly effeminate tranny with a fanny was anathema to me.
Besides, I argued logically that I did not possess the curvaceous body shape or the chirpy soprano-like voice to play the role with any sort of credibility. But old Wilson was unmoved and I found myself trying on a gown during dress rehearsal. I was aghast when I observed a classmate standing in the backstage changing room nearly naked wearing nothing but panties and a stuffed bra. Our makeup and wardrobe director was a young and pretty kindergarten teacher who insisted she was trying to get the right shape on shapeless boys figures.
The guy Patrick relished the role of Portia and seemed very much at ease in high-heels with an equally female voice that bordered on the right type of squeals. Needless to say he was promptly rechristened Patricia and carried the moniker for the rest of his school career and beyond.
apple lumps
So Okay, I played Calpurnia under duress and tottered the stage dangerously on heels like a child learning to balance on a bicycle with two wheels. That was when tragedy struck the cast. The thespian chosen to play Mark Anthony suddenly contracted a case of mumps and his cheeks resembled apple lumps. In addition, the one playing the title role of Caesar had come down with a sudden cold but with persuasion could still play his allotted role of simply dropping dead on stage.
Now old Koti Wilson faced with the dilemma of having no Anthony understudy appealed to me to take on the role I had coveted. But the eleventh hour fix meant that I was to actually play both roles though not at the same time, with a suicidal change-over deadline. I joked that as a cross-dresser I was being forced into being dragooned into a double-crosser.
Koti Wilsonian
The word drag queen hadnt come into the common lexicon then, although precocious Colombo schoolboys used the fixed Sinhala locution ponnaya for any male who even play-acted with exaggerated femininity. There were other hilarious moments during the play proper when conspirator Mettelus Cimber, whose name the naughty cast mispronounced suggestively in the Sinhala vernacular as far from being born a caesarean baby suddenly found the audience snickering as if observing a comedy.
The guy was wearing a watch instead of the usual wristband. The moment he made his exit to the wings he was slapped not on his wrist but his cheeks by an enraged Wilson. He wittily came up with the excuse: But sir, my watch is all right...It has Roman numerals.
There were other hilarious faux pas such as when Casper cast as the Soothsayer muffed his opening line by attracting the emperors attention calling out: Hi Caesar! instead of the original Hail Caesar! Needless to say he was whip-slapped for his performance in true Koti Wilsonian style.
Then came the tragic assassination scene when a sick Caesar surrounded by the gang of back-stabbing conspirators fell to the floor. He attempted to break his fall by resting on his elbow but someone kicked it and he slumped on the stage muttering: You brutes! You Brutes! His Et Tu Brute came some 40 seconds after he was supposedly dead! Resuming his position on the stage floor, he lolled his head, drooped his eyelids then shut them presumably for good, but not for long.
His eyelids twitched, and his nose itched and the dead Caesar was suddenly resurrected with a grandfather of all sneezes that reverberated though the hall. No need to state the obvious that the play was referred to as Julius Sneezer for as long as one could remember.

EPC opposition party meets Governor Bogollagama
The opposition members of Eastern Provincial Council led by Opposition Leader M.S. Uthumalebbe, met the newly-appointed Governor of the Eastern Province Rohitha Bogollagama on Friday.
Uthumalebbe told theDaily News that the discussion was mainly focussed on the recent and the present political and social issues. They had brought strict conditions created for giving approval for the pilgrims who wish to perform Haj and Umrah during the month of Thul Kahthah and Thul Haj.
The Eastern Province officers are implementing some new rules on the issue. These rules are not implemented in the other provinces.
Especially the Education sector employees are restricted to get no-pay leaves for their pilgrimage, said Uthumalebbe.
The officers urge the applicants to submit unnecessary documents and order the applicants to go Makkah only during the vacation. It is a shame as the Muslims do Haj only during the month of Thul Haj. We condemn the new rule that if anyone visited Makkah during the last five years in the name of performing Umrah or Haj, they would not be able to apply for for no-pay leaves, Uthumalebbe added.
The Governor agreed to remove the restrictions after negotiating with the relevant officers, he said.
M.S. Uthumalebbe, M.L.A. Ameer and Nagalingam Thiraviyam participated in the discussion.

Fenghuang Lou restaurant to open branch in Hambantota
Fenghuang Lou, Jawatta Road, Colombo 05, one of Colombos Chinese restaurants will open its first outstation branch in Hambantota by the end of the year.
We have earmarked two properties in Hambantotoa for this project and will invest around Rs. 100 million for the entire project, said Fenghuang Lou founder and Managing Director M.R. Hassan.
We are very proud to be operating Fenghuang Lou which has attracted a large number of Chinese expats and tourists, besides our own Sri Lankan clientele, all of whom have contributed largely towards our popularity in a very short span of time here in Colombo.
"Our success has prompted us to branch out and we have selected Hambantota to locate our second branch as we see a demand for authentic Chines cuisine by the large number of Chinese in the area as well as Sri Lankans.
He said that their vision is to be an outstanding restaurant for Chinese cuisine amidst a large cluster of Chinese restaurants already operating in the city and they hope to realize it with their kitchen brigade headed by a leading Chinese chef from the Shandong province of China, Executive Chef Zhang Guo Min, who works full time at the restaurant.
Director K. Sumanasena said that the venue is also very popular among the business community and even among politicians due to its wide selection of private dining areas.
At Fenghuang Lou, Sri Lankan guests too can also taste the best of upscale cuisine in an ambience of sleek and contemporary setting, said General Manager Rohana Perera.
Fenghuang Lou is also reputed for its wide variety of Chinese dishes made available in its delicious a la carte menu and this is the reason Chinese tourists in large numbers patronize the restaurant.
Fenghuang Lou also operates an extensive take away service with a large variety of dishes for one to choose from and have it delivered to one's doorstep within the city at no extra cost, said Sales and Marketing Executive Shanmie Rasangika Gamhewa. (SS)

Fighting to improve the lives of workers
As strikes cripple the country and unions become a dirty word in the eyes of the public, Rakhi Sehgal, Indian labour researcher, trade unionist, Vice President of the Contract Workers Union (Hero Honda Theka Mazdoor Sangathan) in the State of Haryana and Member of the National Executive Committee, New Trade Union Initiative (NTUI), a national federation of independent trade unions, spoke of a new movement of trade unionists who are breaking away from the traditional and politicized union centres to challenge the status quo and reclaim the labour movement to fight for what it fundamentally stands for- the rights of the workers.
Following are the excerpts of the interview
Q. You returned to India for your post graduate research and chose to stay back
A. I have abandoned my PhD for the moment. My PhD research was on labour, the official title was social reproduction of labour looking at contract labour in the garment and auto manufacturing industry and I wanted to look at new manufacturing areas, which Gurgaon was. Initially, I was talking to garment factory workers on simple battles like; getting their provident fund, trying to get children into school, getting their minimum wage or just being treated with respect when they go to the Labour Department. Many of the issues were affecting me and the workers told me, so many of you have come and gone. Done your research and become professors but our situation is the same. Also at the time, I too felt that the research I was doing was far too removed from the realities of the workers.
In 2003, I landed in Delhi and it was the same year there was a General Strike in opposition to the neo-liberal turn the government had taken. It was an interesting time, for the labour movement and that caught my attention. I went to all the rallies and strikes we had.
Q. India is experiencing fast economic growth and industrialization, in that respect, do you see labour movements too growing along or being pulled back
A. the labour movement has no choice but to grow. Workers have no choice but to organize, whether the central trade unions are able to address the issues or not.
And if you see the Maruti struggle; which is a very organized sector, the way in which the plant level workers articulated and headed the struggle, it was ahead of what our imagination; shaped by what central trade unions and established trade unions had told us was possible. So the fact these workers stood for the longest time in solidarity with their contract worker comrades was instructive in that it told us that the core of this struggle was the inequality between the contract and permanent worker.
And they ensured that they were fighting as much for the contract workers as themselves. And here they displayed a certain maturity in understanding. If the shop floor had a majority of contract workers, what is the point in forming a permanent workers union which is ultimately going to speak for a very small population
Organizing movements in Sri Lanka should also happen outside of the traditional sectors, outside of government and in the private sector. Possibly where there are large numbers of migrant workers, precarious, manpower, illegal migrants and contract workers.
Q. In the sub-continent, more often than not, trade unions are often politicized and few stand for the rights of workers. Do you see workers moving away from such political affiliations
A. In India, yes. The new trade union I am affiliated to, the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions (NFIT), they are not affiliated to any political party. It does not mean we dont follow a left ideology, which we of course do, but the experience of the neo-liberal turn of the Indian policies and how left parties were part of the electoral process and the space for addressing labour issues, narrowed down, even for the parent parties. And that was what triggered the battles within the unions and either there was exodus- voluntary or not out of those spaces and the workers felt that they needed to take it the battles into their own hands to be able to lead their own battles without their interest being used as a bargaining chip in electoral politics. I think increasingly we are finding the same thing happening in other South Asian countries as well.
Sri Lanka is an interesting example because it experimented with neo-liberalism much earlier than other South Asian countries. In a way we are seeing the extreme devastation of labour because of neo-liberal policies and the need to recover from that and rebuild the labour movement; it is a unique challenge and is something that the rest of South Asia is watching.
Q. But do you see many trade unions breaking away from the old trade union structures
A. It is an interesting negotiation between the two and there too, it depends on the demographic profile. When you take India, the demographic profile of new workers is that they are young, they have economic aspirations given the kind of consumer culture they are exposed to and have the militancy of youth.
There is new dynamism coming from India in the organization of contract workers, the unorganized sector workers, women workers saying no to the central trade unions when they dont give space for the women leadership or if they dont give space to air their issues. There they say they will form their own unions.
This is not to say that the new movements are not collaborating with the older unions or taking their advice, but they are certainly re-negotiating their relationship with their older trade union centres.
Q. What is the role of women in these trade unions Most of the agricultural and industrial workforce, at least in Sri Lanka is made up of women, but we see few in leadership positions in unions
A. Yes it continues to be a struggle on how we can create a space for womens issues and womens ways of articulating issues that male comrades dont see as important. This would also help break the gender dynamic within the family. As long as these chores are contained within the private household, it is a womans job, but the minute it comes out into the public sphere, the men do it and have no problems doing it. Thats one way of addressing it.
Q. You have spoken of the idea of criminalisation of labour and securitisation of industrial spaces
A. When workers are in that desperate situation, they have no choice but to unionise because they realize that their only protection is in numbers.
Many in the middle class, dont understand the motivation of the people whose backs are against the walls constantly. They are the ones who are really fighting the battle for all of us.
At times there are no other options. There are no other jobs and when they do have jobs, it doesnt pay well so they want to stay in there, dig in their heels and fight.
But the fact that they are being criminalized is serious. It is no longer a labour or industrial issue, it is quickly being turned into a law and order issue and criminal cases are being filed against the workers. And somewhere there, the injustice of it is fuelling the anger of the workers and they are able to overcome their fears.
Q. You have also spoken about how not having a proper space to articulate issues related to industry is leading to such serious problems
A. Yes that is the case at least in Gurgaon.
The larger question is, what is the extent of crisis in capitalism in this existing phase of accumulation that it is forcing capital to rely on the state and repressive mechanisms and institutions of the state to discipline labour. Usually economic methods are sufficient, so why does capital now globally have to rely on extra-economic and coercive apparatuses It is something we as labour activists havent fully grappled with or understood. Therein lies perhaps a seed of a fight back. If this is a moment of extreme crisis of accumulation, then how do we reshape this balance of power battle I still dont have answers to that. But this is how I read the securitisation of industrial spaces.
Q. Some of these demands such as fair wages, clean and safe environments to work in are quite basic. Why do you think there is such resistance from industries to grant these demands to workers
A. In my personal opinion, to treat workers as rights based individuals is to empower them. Capitalists do not want an empowered labour force which demands a seat at the table with them. There is also a remnant feudal mentality here, we think that workers are sub human. The discourse of capitalism has created workers as the other and therefore not someone that should be demanding any rights. That construct is certainly at work in South Asia. Also the belief that they are getting enough and that they need not get more. It is also a disciplining mechanism; the spectre of poverty is disciplining mechanism. The premise that there are another 100 workers waiting to get your job is a disciplining mechanism, similarly the increasing use of sexual violence against women.
In Sri Lanka, you are facing a shortage of construction and garment workers, why isnt there enough training of local workers Why do you have to import workers And even if there is a requirement, why isnt there an agreement for skills transfer and training of workers so that you dont have to depend on foreign workers The government also has to have the imagination and pressure from the people to say that we are fine with X number of people coming into Y sectors, for a certain number of months, etc
Q. When you take the struggles in Maruti or Honda in India, the working conditions of their workers in their home country are better than that of India. Why is the level of accountability low when they invest abroad
A. That is because of the manner in which their own local laws have emerged and are backed by the kind of social forces that are at work. When they come over here, our own state is saying we have lax labour laws and that we wont implement them, so our state is also complacent in it.
That is why we need an engaged citizenry which does not allow national boundaries to colour what is right and wrong. If we want to the companies to be held accountable to the same standards as in their home countries, it is also our responsibility to hold our companies accountable when they are engaging in similar activities abroad.
As labour activists in South Asia, we also need to look outside of the box, and understand the proper level we have in which to confront capitalism. We need to collaborate in the region more for meaningful action on the ground.
Q. What makes the relationship between industry and unions always antagonistic
A. That is a post 1970s interpretation. If you see the labour movement post World War II, there was a certain equilibrium worked out between the labour movements and capital. A certain amount of rebuilding needed to happen and as we came into assembly lines, a certain amount of regularization had to be done. At that moment, unions were seen as friends that could help capital do that kind of work and also inculcate those values among workers. A social pact was made with the workers, that they too would see a sort of improvement in their living standard as industry grew. Post 1970s, attack on labour came with the moment of crisis of global accumulation of capital, I think when we cast our eyes on unions and capital, it has to be a more historic gaze. Today they are antagonistic, because capital is in crisis and wants a free hand to over exploit whether it is a natural resource or human. Anyone who challenges capitals right to take shortcuts to accumulate short term profits is seen as the enemy.

The final straight-the fastest man in the world will hang up his spikes after the World Championships in London
We will always be impressed by the physical and moral values that enabled Usain Bolt to become the fastest man of all time! Beyond his role as a Hublot ambassador, he is a daily inspiration for us, a role model. We will never be able to thank him enough for that. Good luck for London, good luck for the future, Usain, and may you continue to... shine!
Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO Hublot.
After a career which has not only made him a legendary athlete but also one of the greatest sportsmen of all time, Usain Bolt is going to hang up his spikes with a unique track record. 11 World Championship titles - maybe 12 after his last participation to the World Championship that will be held within the next days - and 8 Olympic medals! Usain Bolt is the only athlete to have defended his gold medal over three consecutive Olympics, even going as far as beating three records in one Olympiad!
He holds the world records for the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 x 100 metres. Since 2010, Hublot has joined Usain Bolt in the same quest. The quest to measure time, to surpass oneself, and to de determined to stand the test of time. First, Unique, Different: the slogan defining the Hublot brand adapts perfectly to its Lightning Bolt ambassador: the first in the race, the first to beat records, unique by virtue of his track record, different due to his style, different due to his size among sprinters. The partnership resulted in the launch of a watchmaking creation just like the great champion, the Hublot Big Bang UNICO Usain Bolt watch. A piece proposed in two versions, yellow gold or All Black ceramic. Designed in collaboration with Bolt, this model in shades of green and gold is a nod to the champions favourite colours. Its strap presents an embossed Jamaican flag. A very special Big Bang for the fastest man since the Big Bang!
The Hublot and Bolt duo has also prepared a surprise for the 2017 edition of an auction of unique watches in aid of research and support for children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. An event organised by the Monegasque Association against Muscular Dystrophy, of which Hublot has been a member since 2005. At this years event, Hublot will be presenting the Big Bang Unico Sapphire Usain Bolt for Only Watch, a unique watch, machined out of
very delicate sapphire and displaying the colours of the Jamaican sprinter, as well an encounter with the athlete himself.
The world sprinting king will enter the Pantheon of sport once and for all after his last individual race, the 100 metres event at the World Athletics Championships which will be held on 5 August in London and after the 4x100m on August 12. On this occasion, Hublot is partnering with the Usain Bolt Foundation and the After School All Stars, two charities raising funds for after-school educational programmes for disadvantaged children thanks to the Omaze digital platform. One of the donors will be rewarded via a competition offering a trip to London, a meeting with Usain Bolt and a VIP welcome, as well as a Hublot wall clock.
Hublot intends to pursue the strong partnership linking it to Usain Bolt, the man, after the champions retirement from sport, by continuing to share the common values of courage, generosity and positive energy. And wishing that he stays on the same wave of success in his future activities that he enjoyed as a professional sprinter.
Hublot fully supports Usain Bolt in his attempt to win a final World Championship title. Lightning Bolt is going to put the chronometer to the test!

Food sector exports double to $240 mn in 2016
Sri Lankas food exports in 2016 has jumped by a huge 112% to US $ 240.48 Mn doubling from 2015s $ 113 Mn in the categories of processed fruits and vegetables, confectionary & bakery items and processed foods.
We believe that more than 40% of our SMEs are in food processing sector. These efforts are a part of our bigger plan to link this sector to our exports revealed the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka on 4 August in Colombo.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the launch of the 16th edition of Pro Food Pro Pack Agribiz international expo at BMICH.
We believe that more than 40% of our SMEs are in food processing sector producing at an annual reported value of Rs 100 million and employing 1.5 million people. This sector is therefore highly significant in our economic planning said Minister Batiudeen, and added: As a result my ministry has allocated close to Rs 195 million (US $ 1.2 Mn) for this year alone to enhance Sri Lankas food sector in many projects. The most important project is the setting up of Sri Lankas first Accredited Food Laboratory for SMEs called as the Centre for Food Analysis and Food Safety under the Industrial Development Board of this Ministry. This is also the first such facility for the SME food sector of Sri Lanka. The cost of this lab facility is Rs 140 million President-Sri Lanka Food Processors Association Maliek De Alwis said that the food sector within Sri Lankas SMEs could be way larger than officially believed. The food sector presence within Sri Lankas SMEs could be more than 50%-almost 60% if we are to count the unregistered micro, village level food suppliers, and urban restaurants, street-side small hotels and bakeries. The Ministrys efforts will be relevant to all of them.
SMEs play a critical role in Sri Lankas economy. Reports say more than 60% of the GDP contribution is from SMEs. National statistics show a little more than one million registered SMEs to be found in Sri Lanka -each employing three persons on average.

Govindasamy calls for ramping up skills of local workers to capitalize on OBOR initiative
Our labour force should step up and needs exposure to a higher level of skills if Sri Lanka is serious about seizing maximum advantage of the One Belt-One Road (OBOR) initiative, said Sunshine Holdings Group Managing Director, Vish Govindasamy, speaking at the Belt and Road initiative  transformative opportunity for Sri Lanka panel at the recently concluded Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017.
Perhaps the largest single overseas investment drive by China, OBOR was discussed and deliberated by an eminent panel also comprising Dr. Amitendu Palit, Senior Research Fellow and Research Lead of Trade and Economic Policy, National University of Singapore, Dr. Wen Zha, Associate Professor of China Foreign Affairs University, Ambassador Nihal Rodrigo, Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to China and the UN, and Jim McCabe, Chief Executive Officer of the Standard Chartered Bank, with Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, Chair of Global Economy Program at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, as moderator.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aimed at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes.
OBOR will connect 65 countries, including Sri Lanka, with the session discussing advantages to both the world and Sri Lanka, the potential weaknesses involved, and the opportunity for Sri Lanka to be part of the larger global economic leadership and commerce.
Replying to the question of whether Sri Lankan labour could match the productivity of Chinese labour, Govindasamy said, I dont think there is a need to match their capabilities. However, the Sri Lankan government and the business community need to step up and double their efforts to increase skills and key competencies of our local labour force and equip them with the right talent and attitude to harness opportunities out of Chinas ambitious plan of OBOR. More work needs to be done from both sides to elevate the level of skills require to work with Chinese business entities.
Asked if Sri Lanka is ready to be a part of OBOR, Govindasamy said, OBOR can be transformational for us if we allow it. FTAs between Sri Lanka and China need to be understood in totality and Sri Lanka needs to be prepared - whether it is sending economists who understand the language over to China to comprehend the enormity of the potential and intra-regional trade opportunities, initiate public-private partnerships, to build our logistics capacity - whatever it is, we need to double up our efforts or lose out on the US$ 8 trillion platform that OBOR is offering.
Its like a bullet train thats coming our way and we are on a steam engine track.
On working with Chinese businesses, Govindasamy said, I think it is a learning curve for Sri Lanka to understand and build solid relationships with China. Doing business with China is no different to other businesses in other parts of the world; however when it comes to the industrial sector, speed is a necessity. They need to know answers quickly and so Sri Lanka should enhance its competencies to be able to respond quickly within a given time. It is about learning, trusting and understanding their culture and it is really important for us to do business with China.
Sri Lankas diversified conglomerate Sunshine Holdings, celebrating its 50th year of responsible entrepreneurship, supported the countrys premier economic forum for the third consecutive year, as the Platinum Sponsor.

Htota Port agreement cuts debt burden: PM
Sri Lanka can enhance foreign reserves and relieve the debt burden following the new agreement on the Hambantota Port signed between the Ports Authority and China Merchants Port Holdings, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said the government succeeded in restoring GSP+ concessions. The country can export over 6,000 varieties of goods under tariff concessions, he said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of the modernised Ambewela milk factory in Nuwara Eliya yesterday.
The countrys income will increase, if we can export at least 50  100 varieties of goods under concession, he said
The Prime Minister said the government has faced the task of creating more investment opportunities in the country.
We have received investments to set up an oil refinery facility, a steel factory, a liquefied natural gas plant and a cement factory in Hambantota, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the government is creating industrial zones in the North Western Province and the Kalutara district generating thousands of employment opportunities.
I set up three industrial zones in Biyagama. Pallekele, Horana Koggala and Sithawaka industrial zones were established during our rule, he said.
He said the government has put in place a new programme to supply milch cows to dairy farmers.
The youths who pass out from schools in the plantation sector should have freedom to secure a job of their choice. We are ensuring a better future for them, he said.
Ministers P. Harrison and Navin Dissanayake were also present.

Herath to be rested for Pallekele Test

Rangana Herath will be rested for the third Test at Pallekele after pulling up from the second Test with a stiff back. Two players will be further added to Sri Lanka's squad to replace Herath and the already-injured Nuwan Pradeep.
Though there is no injury to Herath as such, he has had a heavy workload over the past three weeks, in which he bowled 71.1 overs in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe, as well as a combined 91 overs in the two Tests against India. Considering his age, and the fact that Sri Lanka will have to play a Test series against Pakistan over the next two months, the selectors have made the decision to leave him out.
"This is where our player management comes in, because we don't want to break anyone," SLC cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said. "We made the call not to risk Herath because he's also bowled close to 200 overs in the three Tests. That's a lot for his body." Herath also confirmed he will stay in Colombo and receive treatment, rather than traveling to Kandy with the team.
Though he has had a modest series against India so far, Sri Lanka's attack will nevertheless be significantly weaker in his absence. He was the best of their bowlers at the SSC, taking 4 for 154, and had also taken 11 wickets in the difficult victory against Zimbabwe at Khettarama. Dilruwan Perera will now be the senior spinner, with left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara and left-arm wristspinner Lakshan Sandakan also in the squad.
Herath is the fourth Sri Lanka player to become unavailable during the India series, after both Asela Gunaratne and Pradeep picked up injuries in the first and second Tests respectively, and Suranga Lakmal was ruled out by a back complaint. Herath is not in the habit of missing Tests, however. The last Sri Lanka match he missed had come more than two years ago - against Pakistan in July 2015 - and that was because he was dropped from the XI. The last Test for which he was unavailable was the 2014 Boxing Day Test against New Zealand in Christchurch, when he was nursing a leg injury, and also attended the birth of his second child.
The Pallekele Test is scheduled to begin from August 12. It is, however, a dead rubber, with India having already won the series 2-0.

The 31-year-old American safely negotiated the two rounds on Sunday and is one outstanding performance away from repeating his Olympic winning feat on the same track in 2012 and just two years after a kidney transplant.
Slightly alarming for him was he felt his hamstring prior to the semi-final. His biggest threat will be Jamaica's Olympic champion Omar McLeod who looked to be in ominously good shape and is determined to break Merritt's world record in the final.

Indian fishermen rescue Sri Lankan Navy officer

Indian fishermen on Monday rescued a Sri Lankan Navy officer off the coast of Tamil Nadu, mistaking him for the boat-owner's son - who had jumped overboard in a panic after the officer's vessel theatened to fire at them if they tried to escape.
The officer, Vijaya Singa, had tripped and fallen into the sea after the Navy vessel collided with the boat, whose crew - led by proprietor Ganesan - was fishing with banned double fold nets.
The fishermen had agreed to surrender.
But after helping Vijaya Singa climb aboard (thinking he was Ganesan's son Balamurugan) they began to speed away.
As the Navy vessel gave chase, its crew realised Vijaya Singa was on the Indian boat, and immediately alerted the Intelligence Bureau at Rameswaram.
It wasn't until Ganesan's boat was surrounded nearly three hours later that he and his men realised who they'd rescued. They were detainedat Kangesam.
Balamurugan was arrested on Nayina, a Sri Lankan island.
Charges of damaging a Sri Lankan Navy vessel and illegal fishing were brought against Ganesh and his men, and Balamurugan was charged with illegal entry.
The Lankan Navy hasn't official confirmed the incident, presumably to avoid embarrassment.
However, it has admitted that Vijaya Singa fell into the sea, and said he's being treated in a medical camp at Kangesam Naval port.

St Andrews: Kim In-Kyung finally put her major heartbreak behind her with a final round 71 and a two-shot victory in the Womens British Open at Kingsbarns on Sunday.
The South Korean famously threw away the 2012 ANA Inspiration when she missed a one-foot putt at the final hole.
But that is now all forgotten for the newest major champion.
I cannot describe my feelings, she said. I just tried to have some fun, but it wasnt fun on the back nine.
I got really inspired playing in Scotland. So many people come here just to play golf and I feel so lucky. I didnt have too much fear and just gave my best.
She added: Its been a long process to get over 2012. A lot of people helped me. Now I enjoy playing golf again. What it did teach me is to to give the same effort to every shot, even the shortest of putts.
Six ahead at the start of the day, the 29-year-old Kim looked to be in easy street when she moved seven in front after a tap-in birdie at the par three opening hole.
But she then had to fend off the chasing pack. AFP

LG Twinwash latest addition to washing machine range
LG, one of the most popular global brands for home appliances, continues to redefine how we get our laundry done with its latest addition to the LG Washing Machine range LG TWINWash.
The LG TWINWash, using Korean technology, directly addresses the most common problems associated with laundry by offering consumers the option of using two innovative washers at the same time.
This creates the opportunity for two laundry loads of differing fabrics and colours to be washed separately yet simultaneously, which in turn achieves greater savings on water, energy and time. The LG TWINWash is comprised of a 21kg front load washer and the 3.5kgLG TWINWash Mini with each possessing one-of-a-kind features that lend to an impeccable wash for a wide diversity of clothing ranging from delicate fabrics to heavy duty clothing, making it easier to wash an entire weeks worth of clothes in just one sitting.
The 21kg front load washer saves you a trip to the laundromat by tackling large loads of normal, badly soiled and tough-to-wash clothes. Due to its inclusion of the 6Motion DD, the front loader washeradapts the drum to correspond with fabric type and wash load using a unique combination of six motions  tumbling, stepping, scrubbing, rolling, swinging and filtration. The 6Motion DD also provides options to adjust the intensity of the wash assuring you that your clothes will come out spotlessly clean.
The other salient function present in this large washer is the True Steam. Using pure steam solely composed of water, this function deeply permeates each layer of fabric to completely eliminate dust mites, allergens, pet dander and bacteria. The True Steam mitigates the probability of skin irritants lingering on the fabric, leading to freshly washed clothes that can be safely worn by family members who have sensitive skin or newborn babies and toddlers.
Both washers employ LGs innovative Inverter Direct Drive that enhances the durability of the LG TWINWash. Unfettered by extra parts such as a belt or pulley, the Inverter Direct Drive directly transfers power to the drum which keeps your laundry moving seamlessly and provides more precise control. Themotor, backed by an international 10-year warranty, also ensures that the LG TWINWash will consistently produce a powerful performance over extended periods of time.
Purchase your LG TWINWash from your nearest Abans or Abans Elite Showroom. Receive a special discount of Rs. 100,000 along with a 2-year warranty when you buy an LG TWINWash.

Although average turnover levels hovered around LKR ~0.70Bn (+35 W-o-W) due to active participation by foreigners and resulted in high turnover levels on Tuesday (Rs.1.22Bn) and Wednesday (Rs.0.98Bn), average turnover levels tumbled to ~LKR 0.43Bn during the rest of the week.
Crossings meanwhile, amounted to 39% of total market turnover over the week, with active participation in conglomerate JKH (69% of crossings).
Foreign buyers meanwhile, remained net buyers for the 27th consecutive week, and although net inflows for the week remained broadly the same as last week (LKR 0.88Bn), YTD net inflows on the CSE amount to LKR 25.8Bn compared to a net outflow of LKR ~5.0Bn recorded during the same period last year.
Market momentum in the week ahead is likely to be influenced by remaining corporate earnings for the June Q1 2017.
CBSL holds policy rates steady for third time
The Central Bank left policy rates unchanged for the 3rd consecutive month this year, citing waning inflation levels and stronger global growth prospects.
The Monetary Authority noted that the domestic economy is expected to recover modestly over the remaining three quarters of 2017 amid the rebound in agriculture activity and the reinstatement of GSP+ to the EU.
The Central Bank also noted the positive developments in inflation, adding that inflation has moderated at a faster pace over the recent month despite supply-side disruptions on the back of floods in the month of May.
The Central Bank added that inflation is forecasted to ease further towards Q417 due to the tighter monetary policy stance maintained since end of 2015 and as the one-off impacts (particularly from the VAT revisions) ease.
The Central Bank also noted that although private credit growth remained high over May and June, signs of deceleration exist although at a slow pace.
The Monetary Authority added though, that higher market interest rates should moderate this growth over the remained of the year and that the recent decline in G-Sec yields, should gradually transmit to other market interest rates in the next few month.
The Central Bank further noted that gross official reserves stood at US dollars 6.7 billion as at end July 2017 and that LKR depreciation (against the USD) so far this year has been 2.6%.

Metaphor unspoken
The royal banquet is in full swing. A bird of ill omen suddenly smashes the merriments into smithereens. A sense of gloom reigns as the messenger lays bare the bad news before the king. Before long, the king has to take a decision in the face of the siege. Despite the protest from his own kith and kin, the king sets out.
The country is at war!
Over a few days, a triumphant king returns to the palace only to come upon a courtesan en route. She tells a tale that involves the chief minister and the queen consort. Driven by overwhelming antagonism, the monarch orders the execution of both the chief minister and the queen. No inquiry, at all No, he threw all that caution to the wind. This earned the ire of the deities, and the capital was plagued with three kinds of evil: famine, epidemic and the non-human peril. The whole city was all locked up in an inexpressible darkness until a congregation of saffron-robed saints crosses the threshold to instil serenity.
That tale unfolded elaborately at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre before a distinguished spectacle under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena just a few days ago. Packed with essential oils of modernization, Professor Ariyaratne Kaluarachchis newest ballet effort, Tri Horror, tingled the millennia-old wisdom. Professor Kaluarachchi has crammed every traditional element possible into this refreshingly modern ballet. If you had (or will have) a chance to watch this ballet, it would definitely have left you tingling for a while. The tingle factor is the thing. How could Professor Kaluarachchi, a busybody in the highest echelons of the University of Visual and Performing Arts administration, achieve that end
I committed my weekends completely to work on this. If not for the support of the team, I would not have been able to make this a reality. Kaluarachchi belongs to the privileged clan of artists. He has an electrified career of working under (and with) the veterans such as Chitrasena and Sarachchandra. Their legacy left enough space for the likes of Kaluarachchi to explore their own inner heights. The Sri Lankan audience is yet to be familiar with the art of ballet. Even in a developed western country, it will be difficult to understand the narrative completely with the body expressions, Professor Kaluarachchi notes. The tale was spilt out in brief before the ballet opened the curtain. An obedient student of Chitrasena of Karadiya fame, Kaluarachchi, however, opted to move a few steps beyond his mentor.
Queer classic
A ballet, without a single verbal expression, will remain resolutely enigmatic. Yet, it will reach the modern audience as a queer classic crammed with memorable body expressions and other essential ingredients such as background sets, which syringe a scarlet marvel to the production.
Sri Lankas ballets  or dance dramas, as it is known in the vernacular  have banked on body expression with heightened concentration on facial emotions. Professor Kaluarachchi chose to combine this stimulation with other dynamics.
Instead of using words, ballet dancers use their bodies and movements to relate the narrative. A ballet dancer requires a variety of facial expressions for that. The ballet artists are creatively charged to safeguard the expressions without distorting it. During Chitrasenas time, we did not have a theatre like Nelum Pokuna. At the Lionel Wendt you cannot perform a substantial feat, Professor Kaluarachchi elaborated.
Professor Ariyaratne Athugala shouldered a similar feat titled as Maha Samayama. Beyond the semblance of their first names, both academics have used their artistic prowess to create an archway that opens into the traditional a grand courtyard of ancient wisdom. But will the Sri Lankan audience be able to breathe in the fullness of the experience Kaluarachchi toys with doubts, because a major portion of the spectacle consists of self-chosen couch potatoes. A simple soap tale will suffice for that audience. That audience has to change. And they will transform, Professor Kaluarachchi keeps his fingers crossed, into an intellectual audience capable of grasping the visceral storytelling.
Professor Kaluarachchi roamed every nook and corner of the Nelum Pokuna to heighten the theatric effect of the production.
Breathtaking scenes
To make the demonic forces slide down to the hell, chief minister indulging in some royal luxury on the second floor of the palace and many other breathtaking scenes turned out to be no challenge at all.
Kaluarachchi also employed the stilt-men of the local peraheras to launch a surreal effect in the production. We need to revive the traditional arts to enter the modern arts. When we visit other countries, we can see how far these arts like ballet have gone. We have a rich tradition influenced by the orient as well as the occident. We have a lineage with Chitrasena and Premakumara Epitawela reigning in the industry.
Kaluarachchis message is clear. We need not worry too much about our local culture and lore. We need to reach for a super-imposed echelon, where the orient and occident converge. Go, watch it the next time Tri Horrors comes to town. That will place you in more familiar terms with Ariyaratne Kaluarachchi. Even better, you will discern how Sri Lanka shall evolve with the ballet and the similar art of delicate intellect.

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cohorts are spreading ill-feelings and suspicion among communities. They are encouraging division and violence between the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities, said Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
He said so speaking at the opening ceremony of the UNP political office at Kallady, Batticaloa, on Sunday (6).
He further said, Because the previous government was not serving the people in the correct manner, I found a new party and tried to serve the people. We were successful in bringing the Mahinda Rajapaksa government to an end in 2015.
It is difficult for a new party to contest with well-established old parties; therefore, we got together in 2015 and established a new unity government. Previously, the people of the North and East suffered untold hardship and were marginalised. Today, all communities are living peacefully, he added.
He said, it is the policy of the Government that all privileges and rights of the majority should be shared by the minority as well.
The Government will ensure that in the future, racial conflicts will not take place.
All Sri Lankans will live in unity.

NO PROCEDURE FOR CONFISCATED DRUGS
Amali Mallawaarachchi
Following the absence of a proper procedure on disposing confiscated illegal substances by law enforcement authorities, a new legislation on the matter will be introduced before long, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
Following raids it is yet unclear as to what happens to the confiscated drugs, after it follows the process of being sent to the Government Analysts Department, or being held by the respective judicial body.
Repeated attempts by the Daily News to ascertain as to what happens to the drugs following the raids and discovery failed as the Police were unable to provide definite answers.
Concerns have been raised by President Maithripala Sirisena at a Cabinet meeting recently on the mechanism of handling confiscated substances by the law enforcement.
Earlier it was reported that Cabinet Ministers had informed President Sirisena that there were no set regulations on how confiscated substances should be disposed of. Minister Rajapakshe also told Daily News that setting up a reliable mechanism to handle the confiscated drugs will be a priority.
A three member committee was appointed recently to prepare necessary laws and regulations on how illegal drugs confiscated by law enforcement authorities are handled following investigations. Minister Rajapakshe said there possibly be a new system where the confiscated substance be destroyed after trials under the supervision of a responsible official, probably judiciary.
Minister Rajapakshe said the committee is holding discussion on the frame work, with the participation of the Police, Government Analyst, Customs Department and all other authorities involved in illegal drug confiscation.
Following the preliminary discussions with relevant law enforcement authorities, the committee will go ahead with setting up the law, Minister Rajapakshe said. The committee commenced its work only very recently. It will take a couple of months to complete the task, Minister Rajapaksa said. The three-member committee comprises Ministers Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe,Sagala Ratnayaka and Susil Premajayantha.
In 2016, law enforcement authorities had seized approximately 1500 kg of Cocaine.

Of pain and pleasure
Originality, uniqueness and confidence are the pillars on which Umaria Sinhawansa Perera has built her career on. She is a woman who does not allow anyone to hold her back. TnC Melodies features Umaria, a performer whose winning attitude along with talent has enabled her to conquer the music scene in Sri Lanka.
Umarias genres include R&B, jazz, pop, Funk. It is basically a cocktail of everything combined together. She has managed to combine these genres into her Sinhalese music as well, especially when performing live. No doubt her talent has played a big part in her musical development. To be able to combine genres into Sinhala really does take some flair.
Interestingly enough Umarias inspiration comes from real life. In other words what she sings about is what you are I are going through. Our pain and pleasure. If it makes sense to Umaria then it becomes part of a song that connects with us on a very deep level. It is also important to Umaria, that the producer is on the same page as her. Along with the melody comes the lyrics. Lyrics that form this bond with us and Umaria.
Umaria Sinhawansa Perera
We live in a world where many issues need to be pointed out. And music is the best way to convey these concerns. I'm particularly an advocate for women and children's rights. So as long as my songs make an impact on certain issues, that is the end goal. And fortunately people have embraced every project and I couldn't be happier, explained Umaria.
Umaria says she has always been a goal oriented person. One would suppose that setting goals is Umarias way of attaining her ambitions. For someone like Umaria, ambition is a natural consequence of her talent and her personality. She is very determined and focused. She is someone who sets targets and someone who dreams. Achieving those dreams, goals and ambitions is only a matter of time because of her potential.
I've always been a very goal oriented person. I set goals for myself that are challenging. And I somehow manage to achieve them before the deadline. For the future I have plans and ambitions that are more challenging but somehow I will achieve them. And only time will tell, says Umaria.
At the age of 14, Umaria started her music career. Regents and leaders in history have often started their careers at a young age. To enter the highly competitive music industry at the age of 14 takes courage. It takes courage and talent. Umaria is content with her career. She has worked hard and now she is enjoying her success. It has really paid off. She has achieved the stuff of dreams, singing with the late great maestro Amaradeva, and creating a song that will live forever. But it does not slow down. Umaria will continue to work incredibly hard because there are so many worlds to conquer.
Umaria is who she is today because of the artistes that have inspired her. But indeed Sri Lanka is too small for Umaria.
She needs a bigger kingdom. To date she has released around 40 - 50 singles. They are in the form of movie songs, Tele-drama and collaborations. Her English material will be out in a short while. Umaria grew up with music. Her parents are also musicians and no doubt their influence has played an important role in her success. Possibly they saw the potential for success in Umaria. They have become an inspiration and role model to her. The young Umaria also blossomed because of her husband and also because of two other musical giants  Bathiya and Santhush.
The Industry has evolved. There are the positive and negatives. We can do amazing things if we respect each other. If talent and decency are put together then society benefits. Music can do amazing things. But along with a great voice you need a great heart. Your voice will fade. You music will fade. You need to put a soul into your music. Then it will live forever.
My advice to anyone who wants to become a musician is to work hard, cultivate a proper work ethic. Have discipline and always have goals, without a goal it's like a ship without navigation. Know what you want and just go for it. And ALWAYS have a positive and humble mind set, said Umariya.

Poor batting cost us the Test - Chandimal
Test captain Dinesh Chandimal admitted that Sri Lanka lost the second Test to India at the SSC because of their poor batting display in the first innings.
Replying to Indias massive first innings of 622-9 declared, Sri Lanka was shot out for 183 and although they came up with a fighting batting display in their second innings to score 386 they still lost the Test by an innings.
We were completely outplayed. The first innings effort was disappointing and it cost us heavily. They batted well to score 622 which is huge. That put us under a lot of pressure, said Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
I am really pleased with the way we batted in the second innings. We fought hard. It was a fine effort by both Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne. After yesterday (Saturday) we had some discussion and in those meetings we planned about how to go about things today. I still feel that everyone fought very hard but we kept losing wickets. We need to pick up the positives and look forward to the next game.
It was a special innings that Dimuth played. As an opener we expect that kind of innings from him, so were very happy he played that innings on a very tough deck like this one.
Of the innings that Ive seen over the last three or four years, this innings was one of the best  both from our team and oppositions. It was an excellent innings. He always goes to the crease looking to score runs. That must have helped him get the 141 runs, he said.
A majority of the strokes played by the Lankan batsmen against the Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were the sweeps and the reverse sweeps.
After the second days play we felt it was tough to bat on the pitch. We tried to play straight but we couldnt score well, explained Chandimal.
Before the second innings we had a discussion and had a chat about what was the best way to score runs. Everyone agreed that the best way moving forward was by using the sweep and reverse sweep shots heavily. We executed it really well in the second innings.
Sri Lanka went into the Test heavily reliant on spin with three spinners and one seamer, but suffered a setback when the solitary seamer Nuwan Pradeep broke down with a hamstring injury.
At the moment we have in our bowling two experienced bowlers, Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera. We had a wicket that turned and we expected them to come into the scene. But we couldnt execute those plans, said Chandimal.
Its really hard to play with one seamer. What we thought about is that under these conditions, the only way we could have balanced the team was with one seamer in the attack. That was the plan. Unfortunately he got injured and that became a big problem.
With Pradeep ruled out from about 2-3 weeks and Suranga Lakmal also on the injured list Sri Lanka are short of quality fast bowlers going into the third and final Test beginning in six days at Pallekele.
Yes its a bit of a disadvantage not to have Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal. We havent made any decisions on selection because it was only in this match Nuwan got injured. We havent spoken to the selectors. We will make a plan in the future and try to execute that, said Chandimal.
We have four days now. We try to win every match. Even over the next few days we are hoping to spend a lot of time and energy in training. If we can win even one match against a team like India, we will be able to really boost the mental state of the team. They are the no. 1 team. The staff and everyone else will be really committed at training.

Pothole Therapy..!
Everybodys complaining about potholes during the monsoons, but I really cant figure out why. Potholes are good and we need to congratulate our government for allowing us to keep them for such long periods of time.
Follow me to a dinner party; what do you think everybodys talking about Why potholes of course. There was a time when people didnt know what to say to each other once they were introduced, now its so different. Instead of staring at their glasses and getting drunk, theyve actually got a common topic: I just encountered two pot holes on the way here. Says a pretty young thing to a millionaire.
Two Ive left my car behind in one of them!
What car was it
A Mercedes!
Are the front seats comfortable
Well have to ask my driver, hes still in the pothole!
Shall we go and pull him out Ive never sat in a Merc! says the pretty young thing and an instant friendship is formed!
Now just imagine, what these two people would have had to say if potholes did not start them going
Then theres so much adventure in potholes. A friend of mine who spends most monsoons climbing the Himalayas was grinning the other day: Bob, theres adventure right here, he said. You get into a pothole and just like mountain climbing, your whole life is at stake! Youre not sure youll come out with broken limbs or malaria or cholera. No mountain could ever give me such an element of risk. From now on its the potholes for me!
An American who got off the International Airport grinned at me, You guys are into water sports in a big way huh he asked. I need to warn our Olympic team about this!
About what I asked looking round slightly puzzled.
This, he said, these mini swimming pools all over. With so much swimming you chaps should walk away, sorry swim away with the gold. Poor Phelps!
Potholes, said a government medical college psychiatrist lecturing to his students, helps make us a tough people. We should be grateful to a government who year after year have helped produce strong countrymen! After a falling in a pothole episode, our people are able to handle overcrowded buses and trains, no pavements, unhygienic slums, overflowing garbage, flooded roads, riots, strikes and bomb blasts!
Sir, should we like a letter to the government thanking them for potholes asked a bright medical student, who was tipped off to win the gold medal in mental trauma.
Go ahead, beamed the psychiatrist lecturer, but be sure to mention my name. Im doing a paper for the international community to learn from our pothole therapy!
Like I said, just cant figure why everyones complaining about potholes. Theyre good for us and we need to appreciate the government for allowing us to keep them even after the rains have gone..!

President may remove Ravi: Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena

President Maithripala Sirisena may remove Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake if he does not resign over revelations uncovered by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond scam, State Minister of Public Enterprise Development Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He said President Sirisena is likely to take a decision on Karunanayake within the next two weeks. If found innocent, he can always come back.
Asked if the ruling party would vote in favour of the no-confidence motion, he said that SLFP members may vote in favour of it.
He recalled that when a Secretary complained that there was fraud with regard to a fertilizer tender to former President J. R. Jayawardene, the then Agriculture Minister E. L. Senanayake resigned honorably even before revelations were made.
He said that the credit of the whole issue should go to the President as he removed former Governor Central Bank Arjuna Mahendranwithin 48 hoursafter the bond scam revelation and it was followed up by the appointment of a Presidential Commission.
We must also say that it the first time in the history of Sri Lankan politics that a ruling party minister is being questioned directly at a Presidential Commission and this is a result of the two party coalition ruling the country. If there was a single party government, a ruling party minister would never have been questioned by the AGs Department in a commission.
The Commission of Inquiry has exposed how politicians behave and this is a good lesson for politicians to be honorable, he said.

Sizzling Zverev takes fourth title of the year
WASHINGTON: Alexander Zverev issued a warning to top ATP rivals Sunday after winning the Citi Open for his fourth title of the year -- hes not the next generation, hes the now generation.
The 20-year-old German defeated South Africas Kevin Anderson 6-4, 6-4 to capture the $355,460 (302,000 euros) top prize at the US Open tuneup event on the Washington hardcourts.
World number eight Zverev dropped only nine points on his serve and never faced a break point in becoming the youngest player to win four ATP titles in a year, or take the Washington crown, since Argentinas Juan Martin Del Potro did it at 19 in 2008.
I improved a lot in the last few months to get where I can win tournaments, Zverev said. The longer the tournament goes for me the better Im able to play. Hopefully this can continue to be like that.
Zverev won his first title last September in St. Petersburg and added trophies this year at Montpellier, Munich and Rome, where he downed Novak Djokovic in the final.
He also ousted number four Stan Wawrinka at Miami and pushed Rafael Nadal to five sets in the third round of the Australian Open.
Im Next Gen but the rankings say it for themselves, Zverev said. I think I showed I can play with the big guys this year.
I think I showed Im not an in the future kind of guy. Im right now.
Only Wimbledon and Australian Open champion Roger Federer with five titles has won more ATP crowns this year than Zverev, and thats only because the Swiss star handed the German his lone finals loss of 2017 at Halle in June.
A lot of people are looking at him as the face of tennis and the next Grand Slam champion, Anderson said of Zverev. He seems to deal with it all pretty well. It will be interesting to see how the next little while progresses.
I wouldnt be surprised if he wins a few Grand Slams. He definitely seems to be on a path in that direction.
Zverev, who will remain a career-best eighth in Mondays rankings, made a Slam-best fourth-round Wimbledon run, losing in five sets to Milos Raonic.
Winning those types of matches is the next level I need to reach, Zverev said. To get far in those events is my next goal.
Zverev thanked new co-coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, the former world number one from Spain who worked with him at an event for the first time this week.
What a way to start together and hopefully we have many more years to come and many more titles together, Zverev said. Its amazing what weve already accomplished. - AFP

Social esteem Vs national worth
Most of the people in our country are living for themselves, for their future personal advancement, personal prosperity and security, personal economic stability and freedom, freedom from want and deprivation, and laying a firm foundation for their continued steadiness and progress. A good many are constrained to do so. These people have little or no thought of the larger society, their contribution to its necessary economic growth and political stability and community solidarity or its well-being, and fellow feeling for others that would enhance the lives of all.
It is the time that all of us cared about the values we live by before we expect others to take notice and respect our values. All could be induced to be also conscious of the environment and pollution.
VALIDITY AND VALUES OF IDEALS
This being the wide-ranging picture and state of affairs in our country, we should be asking ourselves whether we should have a set of strong and stable national values that we cherish and promote. What are the most important values, ideals and goals that most of the Sri Lankan parents, school principals and teachers hold out to their children and students under them
Have any serious sociological investigations ever made a study of what they are, or questioned or examined their validity and value and their effect on the general character of communities and our Sri Lankan society Is there, and if there, what are the marked differences evident in the values among the Sinhala people, Tamil people, the Burghers, the Muslims, the Malays, bilingual people and those speaking the mother tongue and English, and the people in various economic strata in Sri Lanka
No serious and well recognized sociological, psychological and anthropological research has been done either by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Planning or any Sri Lankan university or Research Institute. Anyway, we in Sri Lanka do not base ourselves on serious studies or research to know the real state of affairs or even to know whether the existing trends in society needs correcting or amending or furthering for the better and more acceptable ways of social integration, community solidarity, social health and stability of our national life.
If there needs to be social engineering, planned placement of sizeable groups of people in selected locations for development, that too, of course always needs to be based on objective and valid data and uphold immutable human values. Very often these are done for political gain rather than for national benefit.
This is because, politicians at the summit of national power, staid, sedate and generally unremarkable as they are, are led more by their primitive hunches of self-advantage than by any socio-economic, socio-cultural or scientific-technological studies and researches that are done or need to be done. Indeed these studies may not be done for the simple reason that they are not taken notice of by those who should take notice of them, at least to initiate a discussion that is of some use to the community. Obviously, politicians should have genuine caring for objective fact and they should have the intellectual depth to consider appropriate and in the manner, they deserve those matters that are of importance to the national community.
Unfortunately, one can observe politicians in parliament (who have got their university degrees, professional qualifications and even doctorates and others below GCE Ordinary Level and even below Grade Nine) who seem to be intellectually stunted and are anything but creative in temperament. Some have been known to have bought doctorates (!) for financial considerations from doubtful sources (!)
Our primary national values should form the base and foundation of our national social order and be the primary component of our national society. These values should guide our way of life and behaviour.
ORDER OF VALUES
In the hierarchy of the values we uphold, truth, justice and devotion to our Nation and all its people should hold the foremost place. Human dignity, fundamental rights, equality, freedom, democracy, devotion to duty and honesty are values that all of us need to uphold; they are worth striving for and they are worthwhile measurements that people make use of to assess the acceptable standards of our national life. Besides, there is honour and mutual respect, formal courtesy and social manners and social and individual esteem and admiration that are valued.
We desire many of these social values as a Nation and wish to see the most important of them clearly incorporated in the New Constitution as the general standard and the acceptable order of norms that over the years will be at the summit of the subconscious level in the minds of all the people. They will spring on to the conscious and active level when the occasion demands.
People arrange their preferences and give primary importance between alternatives according to the understanding, desirability and sensitivity they ascribe to these values. There are many who for selfish political reasons speak of these values as imports from the west when they are called upon to explain the breach of these values when they were in power. In any case, we decry the inattention to these human values by the national authorities in our past history.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to ask ourselves whether all of us Sri Lankan people embrace these values with equal commitment irrespective of caste, creed, ethnicity, culture and gender and whether all of us without exception consider it worthwhile and ready to sacrifice things of lesser value to uphold these values we hold as foremost.
It is the function of these values to uphold the equal dignity and rights of all citizens, irrespective of their social background and standing. Upholding these values promotes social order and stability in society. In sociology, value has a meaning different from that in philosophy or economics.
In the sphere of economics, value means a price. So economically, just as commercial commodities, the services of a doctor, nurse, lawyer, a teacher, domestic help, a gardener, a clerk, a factory worker or any employed person has a minimum wage, a nominal price, even though none of their services can be priced because of the human quotient in the service rendered by a human being of immeasurable human dignity. This is an aspect that most do not appreciate or value except perhaps when they retire from service. No monetary value can or should be set to the service of the clergy.
PRICED CLERGY
It seems there are among some of the religious clergy too who stipulate a price for their services which is indeed a disgrace. Jesus said, You received without charge, give without charge. Provide yourself with no gold or silver, not even with a few coppers for your purses, with no haversack for your journey or spare tunic or footwear or a staff, for the workman deserves his keep. (Matthew 10.8-10). St. Paul who followed Jesus Christ so faithfully and understood Him so well, declared, Observe not the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law (2 Cor 3.6) to emphasize that being faithful to the spirit of the law was far more important than to meticulously follow the letter whereby the very purpose of the law is disregarded.
It is unfortunate that there are men and women supposed to be witnesses of a religious way of life who live for gold and silver and even wear millions worth of gold on their person (!) and amass wealth and even exploit the ignorant and the poor, including superstitious politicians, who come to them in their moments of distress
How do the politicians of today who have put themselves forward on the pretext of social service, accumulate wealth by all sorts of questionable means Also, how many of our learned lawyers pedantically scrutinize the letter of the law and miss the spirit and purpose of it and belittle justice What are the social values of the professionals
The manner in which some of the highest values we esteem have been upheld by those in humbler positions of life puts to shame not only the well-to-do but also those professionals who would go to any length to make financial gains unworthy of their social standing.
There has persisted over the years a solid stratum of social values among a cross section of all our people in our society irrespective of their station in life. Otherwise, our Nation could not have survived even to this extent. The more than 62% of the voters who on January 8, 2015 especially opted for a cleaner democracy were people who held on to national values one would like to see all uphold.
For a nation to have sound values it is necessary that these basic values are inculcated to all of our younger generation in our homes and schools and in our Daham Paselas. Unless they do so, all of them become empty shells without any value. In fact, these values should be sharpened, refined and presented in more sophisticated ways as the students advance in their studies.

Sri Lankan Haj pilgrims arrive in Jeddah
The first group of 149 of the 2,850 Sri Lankan Haj pilgrims arrived in Jeddah on a Saudi Arabian Airlines plane on Monday.
The islands national carrier, SriLankan Airlines will carry 25 percent of the pilgrims, while the Saudi Arabias national carrier will ferry the other pilgrims within the next few days.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammed Azmi Thassim, Acting Consul General Uthuma Lebber Mohammed Niyas and senior diplomats welcomed the pilgrims.
This year, we had a increased quota because some of the development works have been completed in Makkah, Thassim, who received the pilgrims told the Daily News.
The envoy said the consulate has deployed a team at the Haj terminal of the Jeddah airport to welcome Sri Lankan pilgrims. The officials offer refreshments to the pilgrims on arrival and attend to their needs until they leave for the holy cities. He said four teams have been formed in Makkah, Jeddah, Minah and Madinah to assist the pilgrims. In addition to the missions staff, the diplomat said he had solicited the cooperation of volunteers, who would help the pilgrims in Makkah, Madinah and at the Haj terminal.
A medical team will also arrive with the pilgrims to look after their health needs, Thassim said.

SriLankan in talks with 3 airlines
Three airlines including Japanese Airlines are currently in negotiations with the Government, in efforts to divest 49% of the holding of the national carrier SriLankan Airlines, Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Japan Airlines have already visited us, their representatives have already met with the Prime Minister, and initial discussions have commenced, Hashim said. Still, he said, this does not mean anything has been established yet. He did not wish to disclose the other two airlines.
They have asked for information and we want to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) after which we will submit information to pursue it further he said.
Whichever airline SriLankan Airlines ends up partnering with, said Hashim, the rough framework of the agreement will be the same.
The partnership will certainly be a Public Private Partnership (PPP) and we intend on divesting 49% of the holding to come in with equity. 51% will be held by the state. We would hand over the entire management of the company, as we dont think we are the best at managing the airline business.
Hashim concluded by saying that, In the event that there is some issue with equity participation we will be looking at other options  options like management contracts with limited equity involvement, where we hand over the management of the airline and also will be able to derive equity. As recently as May, SriLankan Airlines had been in an agreement with TPG, a U.S. private equity firm, to acquire 49% of the company. But TPG ended up pulling out of the agreement after completing the due diligence process, said Ravindra Hewavitharana, Secretary of the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development.
Hewavitharana explained that until a partner is found, SriLankan Airlines is looking at other ways to cut down costs.
We are looking at different types of nationalization, as well as restructuring and re-engineering of internal processes, said Hewavitharana.
Since 2009, a year after its separation from Emirates Airlines, SriLankan Airlines has been operating at a loss.
The most recent fiscal year, which ended in March 2017, the company reported losses of Rs. 27.79 Billion, up from a loss of Rs. 12.08 Billion the year before.

Supplementary estimate of Rs. 70.5 million submitted to Parliament

The Government today presented a supplementary estimate to Parliament seeking its approval for total of approximately Rs. 70 .5 million to meet the travel expenses of few ministries incurred during the month of June.
As per the estimate, the Foreign Affairs Ministry has spent Rs. 28.8 million, City Planning Ministry a sum of Rs. 1.2 million, Sports Ministry Rs. 1.4 million and Power and Energy Ministry Rs. 1 million.
The Army had spent Rs. 20 million while Navy Rs. 10 million for the same. National Co existence and Languages Ministry has spent Rs. 3.09million as per the estimate.
The government also sought the approval of the House for the payment of Rs. 283.1 million as the royalty fee for dredging sea sand for the Port City Development project and Rs. 2.041million for the setting up of a digital multimedia crime investigation centre.
Further approval was sought to spend Rs 250.5 million to set up a national cyber security unit.
However Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake pointed out that the supplementary estimate included a sum of Rs 30 million for the Agriculture Ministry for its furniture.
He said it was highly questionable as another sum of Rs 40 million was allocated for the same ministry recently and Rs 24.5 million is paid monthly as for its rent.
He added that the Minister or the Finance Minister should make a statement on the matter.
At this occasion Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said he would bring this matter into the notice of Agriculture Minister.

Use compostable, biodegradable lunch sheets, bags - CEA
The ban of manufacturing and selling polythene will not be extended by the Central Environmental Authority from September 01 and therefore consumers should get used to alternatives after the deadline, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Waste Management Unit Director Ajith Weerasundara told Daily News Business.
According to Director Weerasundara, over 1.5 million polythene lunch sheets and two million polythene bags (popularly known as 'silisili' bags) are currently used by Sri Lankans every day.
Director Weerasundara said the ban of using polythene was strictly imposed by the Government at this juncture to stop environmental pollution reported from all parts of the country.
He said it is up to consumers who love the environment to adhere to the Governments law and use alternative lunch sheets and bags from September 01.
When asked what the best alternatives were, he said consumers could use compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets which are highly environmental friendly.
He said in addition they could even use banana leaves or similar leaves and also lunch boxes which do not pollute the environment.
Meanwhile, commenting on the said plastic lunch boxes, a leading recycle plant owner in the Kalutara District, Gamini Peris said there are recycling plants in the country and plastic lunch boxes, yogurt cups or plastic drink bottles can be collected easily and recycled.
But polythene lunch sheets and bags are added to the environment by consumers with food particles after using them and no one is interested in collecting and taking them to recycling plants,  he said.
He said plastic items such as flower pots, shoe manufacturing materials, bags, toys, toy bats, sports gear, tyres, bags and many other ornamental items can be easily recycled and manufactured.
Packaging Materials (Pvt) Ltd Chairman/Managing Director R.D. Premasiri admired the Governments decision of banning polythene due to environmental pollution.
He said authorities should also focus attention towards a large number of large, medium and small scale manufacturers who are engaged in the polythene manufacturing industry and they should be given a helping hand or else many ordinary employees, workers and also their families will lose their daily income .
Focusing attention towards compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets which are said to be highly environmental friendly, a polythne manufacturer in the Colombo District Rohan Peris said only few consumer in the country use compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and therefore research should be done at the Industrial Technology Institute in Sri Lanka (ITI) to check the quality of these sheets to ascertain if they are actually degradable during a short period.

War for the Planet of the Apes : Smart siminian showdown
Its almost 50 years since the original Planet of the Apes starring Charlton Heston hit the screens back in 1968, and shocked audiences with its grim outlook of a world where apes evolve over humans to become the dominant species. In the current blockbuster scenario dominated by superheroes and intergalactic battles, its a challenge for this premise (and rebooted franchise) to remain relevant. However, co-writer and director Matt Reeves knows exactly why the post-apocalyptic tale worked in the late 60s and returns to those narrative roots, keeping its essence firmly grounded.
Human speech
Reeves goes beyond elaborate CGI, and explosive set-pieces to make this a purely human story, only told from the perspective of another species. This means most of the major acting goes to the man who has become synonymous with motion capture  Andy Serkis. His portrayal as Caeser  the highly evolved ape with the ability for human speech  is nothing short of stunning. Combined with the latest technology that renders the simians to near perfection, Serkis and the other actors behind these superior primates, are each given peculiar characteristics to make them truly unique. This lends additional credibility to the narrative, which relies heavily on the apes to make it work.
Amongst the humans, the Colonel played by the ever so reliable Woody Harrelson, in what could easily pass off as a younger Walter E. Kurtz played by Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now, is effective while Amiah Miller as Nova shares some poignant scenes with her simian counterparts.
Although most of the proceedings are predominantly dire, Steve Zahn as the Bad Ape lightens the mood at appropriate moments to lend some humour, without going bananas.
Remarkable experience
Considering this is the third entry following Rise and Dawn in the rebooted franchise, War builds on those two films but manages to succeed on its own two legs. Audiences unfamiliar with those events wont feel entirely left out; there are a few callbacks along with minor exposition to fill those gaps.
All of which to say this is a remarkable experience that should not be missed - War for the Planet of the Apes is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that balances action and special effects well enough to make it stand out from all the blockbusters seen so far this year.

Warrior withered, legend never will
Sri Lanka faced its darkest period in the annals of contemporary history with the escalation of the relentless attacks by Tamil Tigers. During this period, a gallant warrior came to the fore to take the bull by the horns. He was Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne who was affectionately referred to as Jungle Wimale or Kela Kumaraya during his early days in the army. Later he became known as Prince of Gajaba or Father of the Gajaba Regiment.
Sri Lanka Army named the new infantry battalion formed in Anuradhapura after the legendary Sinhala Monarch Gajabahu who invaded Chola Kingdom. Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne used to narrate the historical background and the Regimental insignia which carries the famous Keteriya of the grand Sinhala King Gajabahu I with pride and affection. He would not have fathomed that he too will join the clan of legends in the modern military history.
My first encounter with him was a family vacation at Diyathalawa in the mid-70s when I accompanied my mother who was his lovable female cousin, Padma Akka. He and his wife, Manel, received us with much love and made us feel comfortable in their cosy bungalow in front of Polo Grounds at the Diyathalawa Army Cantonment. He was the guiding star in my early life after my fathers untimely death in 1979. While involved in his busy army life Viji mama had time to listen to us and offer guidance.
Gajaba Regiment
He was gradually promoted to higher ranks and raised the formidable Gajaba Regiment to the status it enjoys today. It played a pivotal role during the first three Eelam wars albeit limited in hardware at the time. Determination, courage and the astute leadership at the battlefront were his forte. He was not discouraged by the failures of the establishment to place him on proper seniority.
General (Rtd) Gerry de Silva writes in his book War Heroes Killed-In-Action:
Vijaya must have felt that the Army was unkind to him In reference to a mistake done in 1962 about the seniority of this Soldiers General who was appointed as the appointed Battalion Cadet Adjutant in his final term Battalion an under officer in the prestigious Indian Military Academy  Dehradun during his training period. Indeed a major achievement for a non-Indian Cadet Officer.
I had the opportunity to meet this gallant soldier between August 4-5, 1992, a few days before his untimely death (it was the last time); when he hurriedly came to Colombo on a Siamachetti fighter aircraft piloted by the late Squadron Leader Shirantha Gunathilake to attend an emergency meeting at Army HQ; later I got to know that this hurried visit to Colombo was with regard to the major offensive he planned with late Lt. General Denzil Kobbekaduwa to gain control of a part of Jaffna from LTTE. He was in a somewhat of a distraught mood due to the then army hierarchy not permitting to proceed with the planned operation and failure to appreciate his patriotic commitment; specially that he volunteered to take up the appointment of the Commander Security Forces of Jaffna; whilst he was selected to follow prestigious National Defence College  India programme which was considered the most important Military Degree to take up the highest command appointments including the post of Army Commander.
General Hamilton Wanasinghe commended his role in Operation Balavegaya (August 6, 1991) and made special emphasis on the fact that then Brig. Wimalaratnes decision to stay behind and fight the separatist terrorists instead of availing yourself of the NDC course is indeed commendable gesture and no measure appreciate very much.
Officer par excellence
Viji mama was not unfettered by being placed in the incorrect place in terms of seniority. On the contrary, he was fully committed to task bestowed on him and had the highest amount of zeal and resolve to take up the challenge of finishing the war, which by then had dragged for over a decade. He proved beyond doubt that sheer commitment, continuous training, honesty and integrity will open the path for an officer par excellence.
He had sterling qualities of a military leader. This has been noted by his fellow officers and subordinates (including some who took part in the final battle against LTTE -Humanitarian Operation) in numerous books and articles. It needs no repetition.
His knowledge of the Sri Lankas history, as well as the military, was profound. He took time off of his busy schedule to place on record the heroic achievements of his subordinates. This exercise could produce a star-studded galaxy of battle-hardened warriors from the Gajaba Regiment, which he commanded in its formative career days until his untimely death.
Amidst his busy and demanding career; he was in touch with all members of the family. He used to entertain the gatherings by singing songs like Yaman Bando Vesak Balanna and Bola Bola Meti Gedarata Genenawa Guwan Yanayak Wage depicting the humorous and jovial facet of this much-loved warrior general.
Asiaweek correspondent John Colmey in the August 1992 issue identifies Wimalaratne, 51, as a legend in the Sri Lankan Army (Asiaweek - Volume 18, Issues 27-51 - Page 492). The legend never had the opportunity to read this article owing to his untimely death on August 8, 1992. Maj. General Vijaya Wimalaratne left a legacy which is still remembered with pride by fellow warriors and Sri Lankans and indelibly stamped in the annals of military history of our isle.
Nishsnathi and Hiran lost their much-adored father during their youth. But keeping true to his wishes, both selected medical profession. Dr Hiran Wimalaratne serves in the Army Medical Corps following his fathers footsteps while Dr Nishanthi Wimalaratne serves in the Cardio Unit of the General Hospital Colombo.
