Drastic drop in water levels at Castlereagh, Moussakelle reservoirs
The water level of Castlereagh and Moussakelle reservoirs, which feed the hydro electric plants at Laxapana, new Laxapana, Canyon Polpitiya and Upper Kotmale has been reduced to nearly 40 percent of full capacity due to the prolonged drought.
Since there is a possible danger to the existing water supplies the National Water Supply and Drainage Board requested the public to utilise water sparingly.
A large number of people visit Moussakelle to witness the ruins of the old Maskeliya Town which has reemerged due to the reduction of the reservoirs water level.
Water cascading from Devon Falls and St. Clair Falls have also reduced to almost a trickle due to the existing dry weather.

Drone camera falls on Ruwanweli Mahaseya during Kapruka Pooja
A videographer was arrested by Police after his drone camera fell on the sacred Ruwanweli Mahaseya in Anuradhapura on Saturday evening during a Kapruka Pooja, Police said. The drone camera had reportedly struck the Hathares Kotuwa before crashing at the base of Ruwanweli Seya. It had come down due to a technical fault.
SSP Ravi Peris said the Ruwanweli Seya was not damaged due to the incident.
He said the videographer had not obtained approval to use the drone camera either from the chief incumbent or the management of the Ruwanweli Seya. SSP Peris said that if the drone had fallen on the large crowd gathered it may have caused injury to devotees.
Police recently announced that those operating a drone camera should get prior approval from Police and in case of religious places, the approval of authorities.
It is learned that the videographer had been hired by a group of employees from a government institution, the organisers of the Kapruka pooja on Saturday. The videographer is to be produced in Court.

Facebook wants to know your deepest, darkest thoughts...
In April, the site revealed the existence of a new division, known only as 'Building 8' which is dedicated to creating ground-breaking products at the intersection of hardware, software, and content.
And a new job advert posting suggests that the mysterious division could be working on mind-reading technology.
Mark Zuckerberg has previously made his ambitions to create a telepathy system very clear, calling it the 'ultimate communication technology'
WHAT IS BUILDING 8
Mark Zuckerberg
According to Facebook: 'Building 8 is focused on building new hardware products to advance our mission of connecting the world.
'We bring together world-class experts to develop seemingly impossible products that define new categories.
'We drive innovation in augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, connectivity and other important breakthrough areas.
'Our teams move fast, with aggressive and fixed timelines.
'We extensively create and leverage partnerships with universities, small and large businesses, and set clear objectives for shipping products at scale.'
Facebook posted the adverts on its job site, which can be accessed by the public.
One advert is for a 'brain-computer interface engineer' to work on a '2-year B8 project focused on developing advanced BCI technologies.'
Details on what the job will involve are limited, but the advert adds that one of the key responsibilities will be applying 'machine learning methods, including encoding and decoding models, to neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.'
The second advert is for a 'neural imaging engineer' who will be responsible for 'a project focused on developing novel non-invasive neuroimaging technologies.'
Both jobs are based at the Menlo Park site in California.
These limited descriptions suggest that Building 8 might be working on monitoring how brain activity changes when looking at pictures or videos.

Fitch revises sector outlook for banks to negative from stable
Fitch has revised its sector outlook for Sri Lankan banks to negative from stable.
We believe operating conditions have become more challenging, as signalled by the downgrade and Outlook revision on the sovereign rating to B+/Negative in February 2016 from BB-/Stable. Fitch expects rising macroeconomic pressure to strain banks credit metrics,Fitch said.
Fitch sees capitalisation as a significant issue facing the sector, stemming from thin capitalisation at state banks and diminishing capitalisation at most non-state banks. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has issued the Basel III capital requirements that banks are expected to comply with from July 2017.
Fitch believes most banks will need to raise capital to meet the targets set for 2019, although there may be no immediate issues regarding compliance. Stronger capital buffers are desirable to counterbalance structural balance sheet issues, such as high credit concentration, and absorb unexpected losses.
Sri Lankas operating environment is a key rating driver for the banking sector. It constrains the Viability Rating of some banks, as it is rare for a Viability Rating to be assigned above the sovereign rating, however well banks score on other factors.
Banks with long-term ratings driven by sovereign support
The IDRs and National Long-Term Ratings of NSB and BOC and the National Long-Term Rating of Peoples Bank reflect Fitchs expectation of extraordinary support from the sovereign (B+/Negative), albeit constrained by its limited ability.
Fitch sees state support for NSB as stemming from its policy mandate of mobilising retail savings and investing them in government securities. The National Savings Bank Act contains an explicit deposit guarantee and Fitch believes authorities would support, in case of need, the banks depositors and senior unsecured creditors to maintain confidence and systemic stability. Fitch has not assigned a Viability Rating to NSB, as it is considered to be a policy bank.
Fitch expects support for BOC and Peoples Bank to stem from their high systemic importance, quasi-sovereign status, role as key lenders to the government and full state-ownership.
The Negative Outlook on the IDRs of NSB and BOC reflects the Negative Outlook on the sovereigns rating. The Outlook on the two banks National Long-Term Ratings is Stable, as National Ratings reflect a banks creditworthiness relative to the best credit in Sri Lanka, and as such, are unlikely to change due to sovereign rating action.
BOCs Viability Rating of b+ reflects its thin capitalisation and weak asset quality. This is counterbalanced by its strong domestic funding franchise, which is underpinned by state linkages. Fitch considers state support as BOCs primary rating driver, even though its Viability Rating is at the same level as its Support Rating Floor.
The US dollar senior unsecured notes issued by NSB and BOC are rated at the same level as the banks Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDRs, as the notes rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations. The notes have a Recovery Rating of RR4.
The National Long-Term Rating of Seylan reflects Fitchs expectation of state support, which is attributable to its state shareholding and higher share of banking sector deposits relative to some peers. Seylan has a lower support-driven rating due to its smaller market share compared with larger peers.
Fitch believes Seylans standalone financial strength has improved, reaching the same level as it support-driven rating. However, Seylans asset quality remains weaker against peers despite its reported gross non-performing loan ratio improving to 5.12% at end-3Q16, from a peak of 29.7% at end-2009. Further, Seylans reserve coverage is significantly weaker than higher-rated peers.
Seylans Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior debt is rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations
Banks with Long-Term Ratings Driven by Intrinsic Strength.
The National Long-Term Rating of CB reflects its measured risk appetite relative to peers, strong funding profile as seen through a sustained high share of current and savings deposits (45% at 3Q16), solid franchise and sound performance.
The ratings reflect Fitchs expectation that CBs non-domestic operations will remain small, even though the bank has been expanding its international presence.
The National Long-Term Rating of HNB reflects its strong domestic franchise, satisfactory capitalisation and improving financial profile.
This is counterbalanced by a higher risk appetite relative to better-rated peers.
HNBs risk appetite, as seen from its historically above-industry loan growth of 25.5% in 2015 versus the industrys 21.1% (2014: 14.0% versus the industrys 13.7%), has put pressure on its funding, liquidity and capitalisation.
DFCCs Viability Rating captures its developing commercial banking franchise alongside its core project financing business and still-high capitalisation levels (end-3Q16: Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio of 22.6%).
The Negative Outlook on DFCCs IDR reflects the probable adverse effect on the banks credit profile from the sovereigns deteriorating credit profile and increasing risks in the domestic operating environment. Fitch maintains the Negative Outlook on DFCCs National Long-Term Rating due to its declining capital buffers from weaker asset quality, below-average internal capital generation and high loan growth, relative to peers.
DFCCs US dollar notes are rated at the same level as its Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR.
The notes have a Recovery Rating of RR4. The National Long-Term Rating of Sampath reflects its lower capitalisation and higher risk appetite relative to peers, which counterbalance its growing franchise and satisfactory asset quality.
Sampaths gross loan growth of 15.3% in 9M16 continues to outpace the industrys 10.3% growth
(Sampath 2015: 24.2%, industry 2015: 21.1%). Fitch expects capitalisation to further weaken in the absence of capital injections, as the banks retained earnings are insufficient to sustain its capitalisation especially in the light of higher capital requirements.
The banks regulatory Tier 1 capital ratio continued to deteriorate and stood at 7.8% by end-9M16, from 8% at end-2015 (2013: 10.1%).
NDBs ratings reflect its satisfactory asset quality, weaker franchise and lower capitalisation (end-3Q16: FCC ratio of 12.4%) relative to higher-rated peers. Fitchs believes the banks higher risk appetite could dilute the benefit of any possible capital infusions.
HNBs and DFCCs Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior debt is rated at the same level as their National Long-Term Rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations.
Support rating and support rating floor
The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor of privately-owned DFCC reflect its relative lower systemic importance, in Fitchs view. The Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors of NSB and BOC reflect the states ability and propensity to provide support to the banks given their high importance to the state and high systemic importance.
Subordinated debt
The old-style Basel II Sri Lanka rupee-denominated subordinated debt of BOC, CB, HNB, DFCC, Sampath, NDB and Seylan is rated one notch below their National Long-Term Ratings to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured creditors.
Rating sensivities
The banks credit profiles are sensitive to changes in the operating environment. Negative rating action could also result from pressure on bank credit profiles through an increase in risk appetite, such as sustained rapid loan expansion or rising exposure to more susceptible segments, unless this is counterbalanced through higher capital buffers and stronger risk management.
Banks with Long-Term Ratings Driven by Sovereign Support
Changes to the sovereign rating or perception of state support to NSB and BOC could result in a change in their Support Rating Floors. Fitch may downgrade NSBs National Long-Term Rating if there is a reduced expectation of state support through, for instance, the removal of preferential support, or a substantial change in NSBs policy role or deviation from mandated core activities indicating its reduced importance to the state. A downgrade of BOCs Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) would most likely result from the sovereigns weakened ability to support the bank manifested through a lower sovereign rating. Visible demonstration of preferential support for BOC and Peoples Bank in the form of an explicit guarantee may be instrumental to an upgrade of their National Long-Term Ratings.
NSBs and BOCs senior debt ratings are sensitive to changes in the banks Long-Term IDRs. The two banks Recovery Ratings are sensitive to Fitchs assessment of potential recoveries for creditors in case of default or non-performance.
BOCs Viability Rating may come under pressure if there is a continued decline in capitalisation through a surge in lending or further decline in asset quality alongside high dividend payouts. Further deterioration in the operating environment, reflected in a decline of BOCs key credit metrics,could negatively affect its Viability Rating.
A downgrade of Seylans rating could result from a reassessment of state support and large reversal in recent asset quality improvements, together with a weakening financial profile. In the absence of changes to Fitchs support assessment, an upgrade of Seylans rating would be contingent on further improvements in its standalone profile through improved asset quality and provisioning, mainly stemming from recovery of legacy non-performing loans, while maintaining its other credit metrics in line with higher-rated peers.
Seylans senior debt ratings will move in tandem with its National Long-Term Rating. Banks with Long-Term Ratings Driven by Intrinsic Strength Enhanced loss absorption buffers against a volatile operating environment could be positive for CBs National Long-Term rating. The banks ratings could be downgraded if its ability to withstand cyclical asset quality deterioration declines due to lower earnings and capitalisation.
In addition, any marked weakening in its deposit franchise and deviation from its measured risk appetite, both viewed by Fitch as key factors that differentiate CB from its lower-rated peers, would be negative.
An upgrade of HNBs National Long-Term Rating is contingent on the bank achieving sustained improvements in its financial profile, particularly in its funding, and a moderation of its risk appetite. A rating downgrade could result from a significant increase in risk-taking and operating environment-related risks, unless sufficiently mitigated through capital and financial performance. Further weakening of HNBs liquidity position could also negatively affect its rating.
The Outlook on DFCCs National Long-Term Rating may be revised to Stable if the bank can sustain capital buffers to sufficiently cushion its weaker asset-quality amid higher operating environment-related risks.
Fitch expects the bank to maintain higher capitalisation to offset the risk stemming from its project finance portfolio, a core business for DFCC since inception. DFCCs IDRs and National Long-Term Rating could be downgraded if there is sustained deterioration in its capitalisation, particularly if its asset quality were to also simultaneously deteriorate. The ratings can also come under pressure if there is further weakening of the operating environment.
DFCCs Recovery Rating is sensitive to Fitchs assessment of potential recoveries for creditors in case of default or non-performance.
The Outlook on Sampath could be revised to Stable if it can fundamentally improve its capital buffers commensurate with its risk profile.Sampaths ratings could be downgraded if there is a sustained decline in capitalisation, increase in risk-taking or a sharp decline in asset quality.
NDBs National Long-Term Rating may be downgraded if the bank cannot sustain its capitalisation at a level commensurate with its risk profile. An upgrade could result from NDBs ability to sustain a sufficient capital buffer that can counterbalance weaknesses in its credit profile.
The assigned senior debt ratings will move in tandem with the banks National Long-Term Rating.
Reduced propensity of the state to support systemically important banks could result in a downgrade in the assigned Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors, but Fitch sees this to be unlikely in the medium-term.
A change in the sovereigns ratings could also lead to a change in the banksSupport Ratings and Support Rating Floors.

Fresh from the garden!
1. If its getting cold and you have tomatoes still ripening on the vine - save your tomatoes! Pull the plants up and bring them inside to a warm dry place. Hang them up, and the tomatoes will ripen on the vine.
2. Companion planting is an excellent way to improve your garden. Some plants replenish nutrients lost by another one, and some combinations effectively keep pests away.
3. Paint the handles of your gardens tools a bright, color other than green to help you find them amongst your plants. You can also keep a mailbox in your garden for easy tool storage.
4. Compost needs time to integrate and stabilize in the soil. Apply two to three weeks prior to planting.
5. There is an easy way to mix compost into your soil without a lot of back breaking work: Spread the compost over your garden in the late fall, after all the harvesting is done. Cover with a winter mulch such as hay or chopped leaves and let nature take its course. By spring, the melting snow and soil organisms will have worked the compost in for you.
6. Like vining vegetables, but don't have the room Train your melons, squash, and cucumbers onto a vertical trellis or fence. Saves space and looks pretty too.
7. Garden vegetables that become over-ripe are an easy target for some pests. Remove them as soon as possible to avoid detection.
8. Onions are ready to harvest when the tops have fallen over. Let the soil dry out, harvest, and store in a warm, dry, dark place until the tops dry. Cut off the foliage down to an inch, then store in a cool, dry area.
9. Keep dirt off lettuce and cabbage leaves when growing by spreading a 1-2 inch layer of mulch (untreated by pesticides or fertilizers) around each plant. This also helps keep the weeds down.
10. When planting a flower or vegetable transplant, deposit a handful of compost into each hole. Compost will provide transplants with an extra boost that lasts throughout the growing season.
11. Insects can't stand plants such as garlic, onions, chives and chrysanthemums. Grow these plants around the garden to help repel insects.
12. Milk jugs, soda bottles and other plastic containers make great mini-covers to place over your plants and protect them from frost.
13. For easy peas, start them indoors. The germination rate is far better, and the seedlings will be healthier and better able to fight off pests and disease.
14. Healthy soil means healthy plants that are better able to resist pests and disease, reducing the need for harmful pesticides.
15. Another reason to use natural and organic fertilizers and soil amendments: earthworms love them! Earthworms are extremely beneficial in the vegetable garden; increasing air space in the soil and leaving behind worm castings. Do what you can to encourage earthworms in your soil.
16. Diatomaceous earth makes an excellent organic insecticide - it is an abrasive white powder used to damage the cuticle, skin and joints of insects. It also makes an excellent slug barrier.
17. Some vegetables actually become better after a first frost, including kale, cabbage, parsnips, carrots, and Brussels sprouts.
18. When transplanting tomatoes, cover the stem with soil all the way up to the first set of leaves. This greatly encourages root growth, making a stronger, healthier plant.
19. Healthy soil means a thriving population of microbes, earthworms and other organisms. A soil that has "good tilth" will produce robust garden plants that are better able to resist pests and disease.
20. A simple five percent increase in organic material (compost) quadruples the soil's ability to store water.
21. Plants will do best if they are well suited to your growing area. Take some time to read up and choose plants accordingly.
22. Keep garden vegetables from getting dirty by spreading a 1-2 inch layer of mulch (untreated by pesticides or fertilizers) around each plant. This will also help keep the weeds down.
23. Water your garden in the early morning to conserve moisture loss and to help avoid powdery mildew and other fungal diseases that are often spread by high humidity levels.
24. If you're short on space, garlic, leeks and shallots make excellent container plants. They tend to have few insect or disease problems and don't require much room for roots.
25. Over watering is worse than under watering. It is easier to revive a dry plant than try to dry out drowned roots. - planetnatural.com

Get your Thyroid checked!
Today Consultant Oncologist attached to National Cancer Institute,Maharagama,Dr.Prasad Abeysinghe speaks about Thyroid Cancer. Recent Sri Lanka Cancer Incidence Data shows that it is the third commonest cancer among females.
Q: What is Thyroid Cancer 
A - The thyroid gland is situated below the Adams apple in the front part of the neck. Thyroid Cancer starts when cells in the thyroid begin to grow out of control.
Dr. Prasad Abeysinghe
It has two main types of cells called Follicular cells and C cells.
Follicular cells use iodine from the blood to make thyroid hormones, which help regulate a body metabolism. C cells make calcitonin, a hormone that helps control how the body uses calcium.
Different cancers develop from each kind of cell. Most thyroid cancers develop from thyroid follicular cells. They are called differentiated cancers as these cancers look a lot like normal thyroid tissue when seen with a microscope. There are two types called Papillary and follicular.
About eight out of ten thyroid cancers are papillary cancers. Follicular is the next most common type, making up about one out of ten thyroid cancers.
Rest of the thyroid cancers consists of medullary thyroid cancer which develops from the C cells and Anaplastic cancers which are undifferentiated because the cancer cells do not look very much like normal thyroid cells under the microscope. Anaplastic cancer is a rare form of thyroid cancer that spreads quickly into the neck and to other parts of the body, and is very hard to treat.
Q: Who are the most affected 
A - Thyroid cancer is commonly diagnosed at a younger age than most other adult cancers. Nearly three out of four cases are found in women, About two percent of thyroid cancers occur in children and teens.
Several inherited conditions have been linked to different types of thyroid cancer such as medullary thyroid carcinomas. Still, most people who develop thyroid cancer do not have an inherited condition or a family history of the disease.
Sri Lanka Cancer Incidence Data in 2009 showed that there were 816 woman and 180 males diagnosed of Thyroid cancer. It is the third commonest cancer among females. Among females aged between 15-34 years, thyroid cancer is the commonest cancer with nearly 40 percent of total number of cancers.
Most early thyroid cancers are found when patients see their doctors because of neck lumps or nodules they noticed. They are also sometimes found when people have ultrasound tests for other health problems.
Q: How do doctors diagnose it 
A -First step is medical history and physical exam where the doctor will pay special attention to the size and firmness of thyroid and any enlarged lymph nodes in neck.
Next other tests, such as blood tests, ultrasound exam and Nuclear medicine scans are done to get a better sense of whether thyroid gland might have a cancer.
The actual diagnosis of thyroid cancer is made with a Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy where the doctor will place a thin, hollow needle
directly into the nodule to take out some cells into a syringe and looked at under a microscope.
The chance of being diagnosed with thyroid cancer has risen in recent years. Much of this rise appears to be the result of the increased use of thyroid ultrasound, which can detect small thyroid nodules that might not
otherwise have been found in the past.
Q: What are the treatments available 
A -Most thyroid cancers can be cured. Depending on the type and stage of the thyroid cancer, more than one type of treatment such as surgery and radiation may be necessary.
Total removal of the thyroid gland along with the cancer is the mainstay of treatment for most of thyroid cancers. Sometimes the lymph glands around the thyroid gland is also removed.
Temporary voice change, low levels of calcium are Potential Side Effects following surgery. All patients require replacement of thyroxin hormone as an oral tablet post-surgery. In differentiated thyroid cancer the dose of thyroxin given is higher than the replacement dose to help stop any remaining cancer cells from growing.
In differentiated thyroid cancer, Patients may receive radioactive iodine,in the form of either one or more capsules, some weeks after surgery to eliminate any remaining papillary or follicular thyroid cancer cells or normal thyroid tissue that the surgeon could not remove. Radioactive iodine also aims to eliminate any thyroid cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.
Eliminating the remnant of normal thyroid tissue will make it easier to do the ongoing monitoring for any possible recurrence of cancer. Radioactive iodine ablation has also been shown to improve survival rates if the cancer has spread to the neck or other parts of the body.
Not all thyroid differentiated thyroid cancers need same dose of radioactive Iodine. Very small thyroid cancer does not require radioactive iodine at all. Smaller low risk thyroid cancer patients require a small dose of radioactive iodine which could be administered as an outpatient procedure. According to the newer guidelines for radioactive treatment,majority of thyroid cancers can be treated with small dose of radioactive iodine which could be administered as an outpatient at a lower cost and minimal discomfort and after effects of radioactive to Iodine the patient.
Larger and more advanced cancers which are considered as high risk are given a higher dose of radioactive Iodine and separated in isolation for few days to eliminate the possibility of radiation exposure to others.
A burning sensation or tenderness in the neck area, nausea and upset stomach, swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands, dry mouth,reduction in tear production are the potential side effects of radioactive iodine treatment (More likely for higher doses)
Cancers which has invaded the surrounding neck tissues are sometimes treated with external beam radiation as well to reduce the possibility of recurrence.
Q: How can Thyroid Cancer be prevented 
A - A diet low in iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Radiation exposure to the neck area especially in childhood is a proven risk factor for thyroid cancer. Sources of such radiation include certain medical treatments and radiation fallout from power plant accidents or nuclear weapons. Therefore avoid neck radiation and take enough iodine in diet such as iodinated salt can reduce the risk of thyroid cancers.

Govt will never advocate federalism or division of country: President
The government will never advocate federalism or division of the country on federal lines. It will also never allow the outright sale of land to foreign companies as alleged by certain disgruntled political elements, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Galle.
He said these elements were trying to seek vengence from the government by uttering falsehoods to mislead the masses.
The President was addressing a gathering at the concluding ceremony of the Nila Mehewara presidential official services national programme in the Galle district on Saturday.
President Sirisena also recalled that a certain print media institution too misinterpreted the GSP + facility regained by the country alleging that the GSP + was given as an incentive to create a federal system of government.
This is a completely baseless allegation as the government would never condone federalism. Such misleading news items were quite regrettable, he said.
The President said he would request such media institutions to check the truth and authenticity of the news before publishing them without misusing the media freedom restored by the government.
The President said the government which earned world opinion in Sri Lankas favour by restoring its international image, desired to create lasting peace and communal amity and harmony in the country.
President Sirisena said the governments objective was to strengthen the Provincial Council system by sharing powers with them.
The President said it was quite natural for new ventures and undertakings of the government to face opposition and and objections at the beginning.
But such opposition systematically died down when people began to realise the benefits accruing to them by such ventures. This was evident when the Free Trade Zone scheme was first introduced to the country. The same was true with the gigantic Mahaweli scheme, he said.
President Sirisena said Buddhism and Buddhist culture hold a supreme place in the country.
On the other hand we are responsible to uphold peaceful coexistence among nations. We have established unity among the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Malays. In this noble attempt, the Maha Sangha and other religious dignitaries can render a significant service, he said.

Govt.allocates Rs.221 b for national poverty eradication programme
The government has allocated Rs.221 billion for the implementation of the countrys national poverty eradication programme,Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
Accordingly, this programme will benefit 2.1 million low income householders in the country, Minister Karunanayake said.
The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena declared 2017 as the year of poverty eradication and this sum was allocated to show the governments commitment for the eradication of poverty.
It is regrettable that seven percent out of the population earns less than US$ 1.25 per day.Therefore, we need to change this situation with immediate effect, he added.

GSP+ to generate over  20,000 jobs in garment sector
MAS Group Deputy Chairman Sharad Amalean said the countrys large, small and medium Apparel Sector will be able to generate over 20,000 new employment opportunities to youth within the next two years by regaining GSP Plus.
Speaking at the Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Exporters, (SLCE) MAS Group Deputy Chairman Sharad Amalean highly voiced the Governments achievement of the GSP Plus which benefits not only to the garment sector in the country but also many other sectors.
He said the garment sector several occasions challenged regarding the VAT issue that was highlighted in the recent Budget proposals and all export associations met the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industries and Economic Affairs over this matter to convey their dissatisfaction of VAT being introduced at this juncture .
Speaking further, Amalean said the Government made several relief against where interest is concerned for the SME sectors and the association is glad to say that the government authorities have accepted their proposal .
I am happy to note that the Government decided to postpone the VAT for our industry by three months , he said. Amalean also mentioned about the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement, talked by the Obama administration and the current President elect Donald Trump has made a statement that he would not go ahead with this .
He said I believes that this sector can work towards the achievement of the ultimate goal as there is certain incentives given by the Government even to go to the North and East,
SME President Bandula Fernando also highlighted the receiving of long overdue GSP Plus & thanked the Government for their endeavor of getting this benefit to swell the Sri Lankan economy.
He said this GSP benefit will not only help the garment sector but also many other sectors where large number of Sri Lankans are employed.

Guinea Bissau continue to shock at Nations Cup
LIBREVILLE, Saturday: Guinea Bissau stunned hosts Gabon by holding them to a draw on the opening day of the African Nations Cup finals as they continued to create shocks as the tournament got underway.
A last-gasp goal for the small west African nation, making their finals debut, secured a 1-1 draw on Saturday a week after preparations were disrupted by a players strike over money.
Juarys goal on the stroke of full-time was a hammer blow to the hosts, who face a struggle to stay alive in Group A while one of Africas poorest countries kept up their amazing run.
Guinea Bissaus lack of cash meant they were unable to organise any friendlies after qualifying in September and their players reached their limit last week over unfulfilled promises of the payment of monies outstanding from the campaign.
It was only after a delegation went to see the countrys president that the players were paid on the eve of their departure to the tournament. But there were no ill effects from the fractious preparations as they secured a point with a gutsy showing. We are very, very happy. Now we have the motivation to go as far as possible, said coach Baciro Cande.
Cameroon and Burkina Faso also drew 1-1 in the second Group A game at the Stade lAmitie to leave the section wide open.
Benjamin Moukandjo put Cameroon ahead with a superb 34th minute free kick and they had two more gilt-edged chances to secure the victory. But the Indomitable Lions failed to take them and paid the price as Issoufou Dayo equalised in the 72nd minute.
Gabon, after a modest opening ceremony dominated by rap music, were looking to put their best foot forward in what seemed a modest opening assignment and after a nervy first half went ahead through striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
But allowing a potential victory to slip at the end of the game leaves them needing positive results against Burkina Faso and Cameroon in their remaining group games to have any chance of advancing.
It's very difficult to win the first match in these tournaments. For the next match we have to fight tooth and nail, said Gabon coach Jose Antonio Camacho, who was appointed just 40 days ago.
The tournament continues on Sunday with the first Group B matches in Franceville as Algeria meet Zimbabwe before Senegal take on Tunisia.

Hard to Find, Harder to Keep
Don't we all remember Pooh Bear's words (in the movie, not in the book) He says it to his best friend, Christopher Robin, or was it Christopher Robin who says it to Pooh Either way, no doubt, the sentiments are mutual. "If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you." If you ask your parents, they will say The Beatles sang about it too way back in 1967, "What would you think if I sang out of tune/ Would you stand up and walk out on me" (Admit it, you have heard this song too, and secretly like it) There is no one around who would remember Aristotle saying it, but it appears he said something about this phenomenon too, and described it as a "single soul dwelling in two bodies."
We are talking about friends here. Through thick-and-thin friends. The ones you can call at four in the morning, sobbing. Or the ones you can dial at midnight jumping up and down with joy. They are the ones with whom laughter comes in loud hearty gales, because they have been there beside you in the darkest days of your life and they know, better than just about anyone else, the deepest, darkest corners of your heart.
FB friends
Hold it there. Does this apply to the 21st century, though Does this apply to the 2346 friends we have on Facebook Does this species called the true friend still exist
Probably not. Think Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. It is easy to see the definition of a friend has changed in unimaginable ways in today's technologically connected world. We all know, in the context of social media, the term "friend" is often used to describe contacts rather than relationships so much so that, even though we may think we have many "friends" (a wide variety of people, from classmates, to colleagues, to neighbours, and in most cases, to friends of friends) we really have none.
This is mainly because thanks to social media we have the ability to send our "friends" a message, but communicating through messages is not the same thing as having a relationship with a person one on one. As writer Pamela Paul says in a recent column in the New York Times, "The whole concept of what it is to make a friend has shifted," drastically. She writes that with Facebook, " to friend" has become a verb, "and yet to do so, in the social-media sense, is a fairly passive act." In other words, it is easy to become friends on Facebook and virtually effort free to end a friendship, whereas in real life making friends and breaking up are major events.
Moreover, as those of us unfortunate enough to have got addicted to it, know, Facebook places every type of social connection into a single "friend" basket even when the strength of the relationship can vary dramatically. An acquaintance versus a true friend, for example, signals different levels of trust and expectations which are ironed out on the Facebook wall. In all fairness it is true social media lets us enjoy the ability to be informed and to stay current with what is happening in the lives of many of our acquaintances as well as current and former friends and even people we have not met personally whom we call our friends. But, when you think about it, you realize friendship also requires the vulnerability of caring as well as revealing things about yourself that don't match the polished image in your Facebook profile or Instagram feed.
Who are true friends
So, the all important question is: what differentiates a true, lasting friendship from the other, temporary social bonds According to psychiatrist Robert Rowney, there are certain habits that genuine friends possess, which make them more like family. And it is these characteristics that create the indescribable bond called true friendship.
One of the qualities that sets real friends apart from everyone else we know of, is that they push us to be more accepting of ourselves. Whenever we are wallowing in negative self-criticism, true friends lift us up and drag us back onto the top of the world. Whether it is feeling inadequate in a job interview or just not liking what is staring back at us in the mirror, our closest friends are the ones who beg to differ when our self-opinion starts getting low. "Real friends naturally boost your self-esteem," says Prof Rowney. "And in turn, helping out a good friend [in this way] can help you feel better about yourself as well."
Mindful manner
True friends also call us out when we are in the wrong. We all have flaws. Real friends identify them in a mindful manner. "They're able to point out some of the negative things you are doing in addition to the positive," Prof. Rowney says. "They really support you on both sides."
This gentle honesty, is what really sets genuine friendships apart from the weaker ones. "If it's a superficial friend or a new friend, they are not going to say anything that may be off-putting," says the professor. "But if it's a real friend - someone you truly trust - they know they can tell you exactly what is on their mind. People who are open and straightforward are some of the most important types of friends to have."
But, the greatest gift any friend could ever give you is full attention and awareness - and true friends make their presence a priority. "A real friend is always there, paying attention to your needs along with theirs," he says.
Having said that, he also points out that, unlike when we were in school as we get older, as time goes on, our days start to become more jam-packed with work, marriage, kids, and by extension, we become more unavailable.
But real friends don't let life interrupt the relationship. Whether it is carving out some time for a catch-up call or planning a visit, genuine friends make each other a priority.
Capable of forgiving
Finally, true friends know how to help us battle with the storms that blow through our lives. As Randy Taran, author and producer of Project Happiness, writes, "When conflicts come up, real friends have the courage to reach out directly rather than gossiping and letting irritations grow. Real friends understand, and because they understand they are capable of forgiving."
So, if you happen to have a few friends who know you are a good egg, even though slightly cracked, hold on to them for life. They are the ones who know the song in your heart and will sing it to you when you are too tired to remember.
10 Things True Friends Don't Do
* 1. They don't gossip behind your back.
True friends distance themselves from unnecessary drama. If a close one spreads rumors or shares secrets that you asked to be kept private, then they aren't a true friend worthy of your trust.
* 2. They don't resort to personal attacks.
True friends aren't in the business of making you feel bad about yourself. They communicate with words of kindness, not cruelty. They focus on your similarities, not your differences. They speak of your qualities, not your shortcomings.
* 3. They don't start pointless arguments.
True friends know that there is nothing less productive than starting an argument you can't win. A true friend should be willing to accept a person as they are, whether they agree or not.
* 4. They don't interrupt your every word.
True friends aren't so obsessed with themselves that they aren't interested in how you feel. A fair and balanced friendship can't exist in a situation where one half does all the talking and none of the listening.
* 5. They don't discourage you from pursuing your goals.
True friends are willing to offer feedback without mincing words if they feel it is necessary for your personal development, but they don't do so in a condescending or hateful fashion.
* 6. They don't look down on you for your past.
True friends aren't concerned with your past, no matter how colorful it might be.
* 7. They don't abandon you in social situations.
* 8. They don't get jealous of your success.
True friends don't waste their time in a pit of jealousy when something good happens to another person.
* 9. They don't judge you or try to "fix" you.
True friends can admit that they themselves are far from perfect, so it's a bit absurd to expect anything more from another person.
*10. They don't take your friendship for granted.
True friends don't see a relationship as a short-term fling that can be tossed aside when it becomes inconvenient, but rather a long-term commitment of high importance.

Army managed to score only three tries. For the Havelocks centre Nishone Perera and winger Chamara Dabare scored two tries each and co-winger Kevin Dixon one.
Full back Dulaj Perera who had an off day with the boot only converted two tries.

Hayleys unveils high capacity   solar power plant in Welikanda
Hayleys Group jointly with Windforce commissioned a ten mega watt solar power plant on Friday.
Located in Welikanda in the Polonnaruwa district, the plant has been installed with a solar tracking system that will follow the suns rays to ensure an incrementally higher yield of around 20% energy, than the fixed tilt system.
At full capacity, the plant could contribute 22,000 mega watt hours to the national grid plus generate enough electricity for roughly 10,000 homes.
This is a momentous occasion for us as well as the entire Country. We are happy to dedicate this plant to the nation. A plant of this magnitude reinstates the countrys ambition of transforming itself to a green energy producer and we at Hayleys take pride in doing our part towards this Hayleys Group Chairman Mohan Pandithage said.
Through renewable sources such as this, we could significantly bring down the per household cost of electricity, while adhering and aligning ourselves to the governments energy policy and plan of meeting the Countrys total demand from renewable sources, Pandithage said.
The new plant will help nudge Sri Lankas total installed Non-Conventional renewable capacity across the 500 MW mark, of which Hayleys Groups installed capacity of renewable energy alone in wind, hydro and solar, crosses the 50MW mark, according to Dr Arul Sivagananathan, Managing Director, Hayleys Aventura.
Hayleys, plans to obtain carbon credits for this project in partnership with Sri Lanka Climate Fund. A scheme will be set up whereby local businesses and corporates could obtain accreditation to offset their carbon footprint.

High security over truck attacks for Trump inauguration
US: Lone-wolf shooters, trucks used as attack vehicles and weaponized drones are all considered significant risks by security agencies as nearly a million people prepare to throng Washington Friday for Donald Trumps presidential inauguration.
After jihadist-inspired Tunisians in Europe killed dozens during two devastating truck attacks on crowds last year, the government is taking special measures to prevent a similar incident in the US capital.
While Washington is constantly on guard for Islamic State- and Al Qaeda-organized plots, the past several years have shown the country is more vulnerable to attacks planned and carried out by people based inside the country, inspired but not directed by offshore jihadists, officials say.
We know of no specific credible threat to the inauguration, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters at a secure communications facility west of the capital, where nearly 50 US agencies will coordinate security for the event. Still, the global terrorist environment is very different even from 2013, when President Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term, he added.
We have to be concerned about home-grown violent extremism, home-born violent extremism, acts of self-radicalization.
Some 28,000 security personnel -- including members of the Secret Service, National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation and regional police -- will be deployed to manage the events, Johnson said. They will begin with a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, continue to the swearing-in, then the inaugural parade and several balls before ending with a prayer service at the National Cathedral the following day. Many of the events will be very exposed, especially the swearing-in ceremony, which will have the outgoing and incoming president, former Presidents and most of the top officials in the government and Congress jammed onto the West Front of the Capitol Building.
Clear plates of bulletproof glass will protect them, and the rooftops will be patrolled by government snipers. The FBI will have radiation and chemical and biological detectors around the area. But the risks are always treated as high.
The traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House will also test security. President Jimmy Carter surprised the nation by walking the entire 1.1-mile (1.8-kilometer) distance in 1977. Since then, most new presidents have walked only a section of it -- still risky from the point of view of the Secret Service, charged with protecting the presidential family.
The security services expect 700,000 to 900,000 people in attendance, including at least 99 groups planning protests, Johnson said. A 2.7 square mile (7.0 square kilometer) area of central Washington will be cordoned off from vehicles and those entering on foot will be closely inspected.
Attendees wont be allowed to carry much more than their cell phones, cameras and wallets. The long list of banned items includes aerosols, coolers, balloons, bicycles, glass containers, laser pointers, random packages, and of course any kind of weapon.

All major hospitals have a comprehensive pandemic response plan and are fully prepared to handle any local cases of AH1N1 influenza that requires hospitalisation, health authorities said.
Authorities however said patients with flu like symptoms should seek professional help without resorting to home remedies.
Health officials said although two people died following the AH1N1 influenza in Kandy, both were patients whose immune system had got weak due to their illnesses. They also urged patients with other serious illnesses to be wary if they have flu like symptoms and seek professional medical help without delay.
Meanwhile, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said the public need not panic over Influenza AH1N1.
Many may get infected and cured without notice. The best advice is for persons affected to obtain treatment from a qualified doctor, he said. He said complications can occur among people in high risk categories such as pregnant mothers, children below the age of two, elders above the age of 65 and persons suffering from chronic diseases. Dr. Bandara said a doctor will decide whether the patient should receive OPD treatment or if he or she should be admitted to hospital.
Persons in the high risk categories should avoid crowded places and also should not visit infected patients, he said.

ISMMs landmark 25 convocation  on January 22 at BMICH
Supply & Material Management education reaching great heights in Lanka 
The Institute of Supply and Materials Management (ISMM) which was founded in 1972 and incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1981 is making arrangements to conduct its 25 landmark convocation on January 22 at the BMICH in grand style.
The diploma of ISMM Corporate Membership with three years experience in executive capacity in a reputed organization is recognized by the Department of Public Administration to be as equivalent to a first or second class degree of any university in Sri Lanka, asserted Noel Wickramasinghe, President ISMM in the sidelines of its preparations for the 25 convention. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom will attend as the Chief Guest and Mahinda Saranapala, CEO, Director Kelani Cables will grace the 25 ISMM Convocation as the guest of honour.
ISMM has also obtained ISO Quality Standard for training and 35 to 50 students pass out annually. Some years the institute had to initiate two diploma courses during the year due to the high demand and this year 35 students will receive their graduate diploma at this years convocation, Wickramasinghe said. The course directors of the 25 convocation passing out batch are Sajith Edirisuriya and Jayantha Wijesinghe. A total of 714 diploma holders have passed out so far from ISMM.
Elaborating on the graduate diploma the ISMM President said the renaming took place three years ago after adding a project and thesis to the diploma. Supply Chain Management was very important for any organization because when organizations earn money, supply chain professionals should be there to manage the cost during the purchasing process and proving services. They give the fullest contribution to make the highest profit for the organization. When purchasing capital items, buildings or providing various other services, supply chain professionals were essential to manage each and every point to give cost effective solutions to the organization, the ISMM President said.
Wickramasinghe said the third batch of ISMM graduate diploma holders will pass out on January 22 and these diploma holders could pursue their post graduate studies for their MBA at the Open University as the ISMM has signed a MoU with the Open University. He said there was also a keen interest from the Supply Chain MBA Division of the Moratuwa University to enlist ISMM diploma holders for post graduate studies there. Very soon a MoU will be signed with the Moratuwa University for MBA programs, he said. Also ISMM is making arrangements to offer their own degree for Supply Chain Management which will be open for school leavers and for those working in Supply Chain. Presently negotiations were on with the Higher Education Ministry to obtain its approval together with the University Grants Commission.
Commenting on the 25 convocation, the President said it was a landmark for ISMM and as pioneers of supply chain education; they had come along way and done justice to students by giving quality education when compared with other competitors. As a nonprofit organization ISMM was performing in the best interest of the country to develop supply chain professionals and groom them as ethically sound personnel to go ahead with their profession to develop the country, he said.
Presently our profession has been recognized by the business world. All this time this scope of job was handled by engineers, accountants and various other professionals. They are not specialized in this area. Therefore organizations had to face a lot of issues. Now organizations are going all out to get supply chain professionals for their procurement and other service areas, he said.
The Supply and Materials Management section of any organization does hold themselves responsible to approximately 60 % of an establishments expenditure budget. Some even go up to about 65-80 % if involved in trading or manufacturing. The amount identified is a substantial amount of working capital of an organizations expenditure budget and it is very important that such commitments are professionally handled to get the best return on investment.
With the GCE AL results released there were many openings indifferent categories in ISMM for those interested in pursuing a career in supply and chain management which has now been recognized worldwide. The ISMM courses begin in Stores Management and thereafter moves on to Purchasing Management and extends to Shipping, Air Cargo and Containerization, Inventory Management, International Trade which includes Imports and Exports. Those qualified there can go to supply managers certified course and from there to the graduate diploma. ISMM qualifications have also been granted NVQ levels by the National Vocational Training Authority. For example ISMM Store Keeper has been placed on NVQ level-4.

Jack, DeGale fight to draw in super-middleweight clash
NEW YORK: Badou Jack knocked out a tooth and almost knocked out the referee but he couldnt convince the judges Saturday that he did enough against James DeGale to become the unified super-middleweight champ.
Both boxing champions suffered knockdowns in the action-packed title fight which ended in a draw after two judges scored it 113-113 and the other had it 114-112 in favour of DeGale.
The fighters retained their belts and each complained afterwards that they had won the fight at the Barclays Center arena.
World Boxing Council champion Jack was knocked down in the opening round when he got hit by a left hand.
It was the third time he had been knocked down in his career, but he gained a measure of revenge by knocking out one of DeGales teeth in the 10th round.
DeGale barely survived the final round when he was knocked down by a right uppercut on the chin. He managed to get up but threw very few punches during the rest of the 12th round. I thought I won the fight, said Swedens Jack inside the ring immediately following the fight. I finished stronger.
His knockdown was a flash knockdown. International Boxing Federation champ DeGale was standing next to Jack and had heard enough.
Dont listen to this rubbish. I threw the cleanest shots, said DeGale, who is the first Briton to win both Olympic gold and a professional world title.
I got huge respect for this man. He is tough, hes durable, hes skillful. You are the man.
I won that fight. DeGale said he felt those punches from Jack in the 12th. He managed to gather his senses and buy some time by getting into a clinch.
I was kind of hurt. I am willing to do it again, DeGale said.
Bad for boxing
One of the strangest moments in a brutal, but thrilling, fight took place at the end the fifth round, when Jack accidentally punched Arthur Mercanti Jr., sending the referee staggering across the ring.
Mercanti shook it off, took a couple of sips of water, and returned to action for the sixth round.
Jacks promoter Floyd Mayweather also complained about the scoring.
This is the second time in a row Badou has gotten a bad decision, Mayweather said.
James DeGale is a hell of a fighter, but tonight he didnt win. At the end of the day, I dont know what the judges are looking at.
This is bad for boxing. Mayweather my win out in the end as the two will probably have to set up a rematch to determine who is the best 168-pound fighter in the world.
On the undercard, Gervonta Davis knocked out Jose Pedraza in the seventh round to capture the IBF junior lightweight title.
The 22-year-old Davis won his 17th straight fight with no losses with a dominating performance against the Puerto Rican, who was making the third defence of his title.

Kerber lurks as Serena chases record Slam
MELBOURNE: Serena Williams has vowed to make life difficult for top seed Angelique Kerber and a host of dangerous players out to derail her at the Australian Open, warning she is in Melbourne to win.
The American gets her quest for an Open-era record 23rd Grand Slam title underway in a difficult first-round clash against Switzerland's Belinda Bencic in forecast sweltering heat on Tuesday.
It will be one the few matches she has played after a four-month lay-off.
But the 35-year-old, seeded two, is in fighting mood despite being bundled out in the second round of her only warm-up tournament, the Auckland Classic.
I didn't come here to lose in the first round, or the second round, or at all, she said on Saturday. If I can play the way I've been practising, it will be fine.
I've been spending so much time on the court. It feels really good to be back, just hitting on Rod Laver (Arena), hitting on all the stadiums, it's a good feeling. I love it here. If she gets past Bencic, Williams could then encounter either in-form Briton Johanna Konta, who won this week's Sydney International, or sixth seed Dominika Cibulkova in the quarter-finals.
And then there's Germany's Kerber, who is scheduled to meet her in the final as the newly-engaged Williams looks to better Steffi Graf's 22 Grand Slam singles titles by winning her seventh Australian crown. Kerber stunned the tennis great at Melbourne Park last year, upsetting her in the decider for her first major title before later replacing her as the world number one.
That win sparked a memorable season for Kerber, who followed it up by claiming the US Open, where Williams crashed in the semi-finals and has barely played since.
Kerber gets her campaign started against Ukraine's Lesia Tsurenko on a Monday evening centre court clash.
But she has not had a good start to 2017, falling to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the Brisbane International quarter-finals, then slumping out in round two of the Sydney International to Russian teenager Darya Kasatkina.
Despite this, she is confident of finding her best form over the next fortnight.
For me, I'm expecting the same as I was expecting the years before -- going out there trying my best, fighting till the last point, she said.
This is always how I'm playing, how I am. This will not be changing. - Konta on a high - =================== Aside from Kerber, Polish world number three Agnieszka Radwanska, who lost to Williams in last year's semi-finals, Romanian pocket-rocket Simona Halep and Spain's Garbine Muguruza all pose a threat.
The form players are British ninth seed Konta and Brisbane International winner Karolina Pliskova, ranked five. Konta, who made the semis last year and was named the WTA's most improved player for 2016, has blossomed and is encouraged by winning in Sydney. I'm definitely very pleased with the level I played, she said. But we all know that it's not a given. It doesn't decide how you will do in the next event. Czech Republic's Pliskova is another dangerous floater but like Konta is taking nothing for granted despite her stellar early season efforts. AFP

A Meeting of the Fern Society
After failing to save my dying fern, I decided to look for help among experts.
Last winter, I had a moment of crisis after failing to keep my Green Clubfoot fern alive, despite establishing a complicated routine for my increasingly ailing plant: I set my ferns pot on river rocks within a tray of warm water, for humidity; I alternated its position according to the sun, and misted its fronds twice a day. But no matter how damp I made the air or how much I considered its position to my radiator, by February it had shriveled in on itself, its tendrils drying to paper.
I spent the next spring and summer attempting to read my way into expertise, but every field guide or plant study seemed to unfurl more disparate curiosities. Did you know, for example, that ferns reproduce with spores, rather than with seeds Since spores are invisible to the naked eye, eighteenth-century naturalists believed the seeds of ferns to be invisiblesome even thought you could harness the power of invisibility if you managed to collect fern seeds and stuff them into a pocket. In Fern Fever, Sarah Whittingham describes a method by which these enthusiasts devised to gather the mysterious seeds from bracken:
In some places it was said that brake produced a small blue flowers once a year on 23 June, the night before the Feast Day of St John the Baptist, or Midsummers Day. The flowers seed could be collected by stacking twelve pewter plates beneath a frond at midnight. It would fall through the first eleven plates and accumulate on the last one. However, fairies were also meant to be particularly active on Midsummers Eve, and if you were not careful, they would seize the spores as they fell and steal away with them.
Im not one for faeries and spiritualism, but there is a kind of magic in ferns. My inability to nurture them notwithstanding, they are some of the most resilient members of Kingdom Plantae. The second edition of a Peterson field guide on Northeastern ferns speaks to their hardiness, noting that ferns were among the first plants to recolonize Mount St. Helens following the massive volcanic eruption in 1980.
During a writing retreat in the fallhoping to quickly earn a visual education on the feathery plantI rambled around the woods, taking my field guide with me, sure Id make great progress by studying pteridophytes in the wild. But even with precise language and detailed figures, I became frustrated. After two weeks, I only felt confident in my recognition of three species: a crown of sweet-smelling hay-scented ferns, tall and ghostly pale; a tiny clubmoss; and a sprawling field of sensitive ferns. I decided if I was going to get anywhere in my fern education, Id have to immerse myself in the company of experts.
Monthly meetings
It took me the greater part of the summer and fall to track down the whereabouts of the Fern Society of New Yorks monthly meetings. I applied to be a member in June, paying thirty dollars to the greater American Fern Society then waiting to receive the American Fern Journal and the Fiddlehead Forum. Finally, in November, Robbin Moran, the New York societys president, forwarded me the chapters latest newsletter. In it, John Mickel, the founder of the chapter and the editor of the Fiddlehead Forum, detailed the previous meeting:
When we got word, while we were in New Hampshire, that our speaker had the flu, our meeting for last Saturday quickly took on a new flavor! I shared some examples of the onocleoid ferns from our garden. This group includes the sensitive fern, the ostrich fern, and a beautiful specimen of Pentarhizidium orientale, a lesser-known fern in this group. It was an extended show n tell, along with a fern quiz with fronds from over a dozen ferns, which with the mild fall, are still green and thriving in our garden. Todd Manister was our master of ceremonieswhat a great leaderintroducing new members and keeping things moving with his wit and charm. Thanks, Todd! We had interesting plants for sale, and wonderful food and cider. It was enjoyable and thought-provoking for all. So, on a chilly, bright Saturday morning in December, I rode the train up to the Bronx with a plate of cookies to attend my first meeting. The office where the Fern Society gathers is sterile and beige, lit by buzzing fluorescent lights. But the space was made cheerful by large branches of holly set on tables and the dozens of members who had already arrived, greeting each other and chatting animatedly.
As I set my cookies down onto a table already crowded with pastries, a man with white hair and square glasses approached me. It was John Mickel.
So, what brings you here he asked, tentatively.
I registered his hesitation and felt, suddenly, the force of being out of place: I was younger than everyone else in the room by at least thirty years; I had recently dyed my hair platinum. This pang of insecurity had at first led me to wonder whether my interest in ferns was pure affectation, whether this morning would have been better spent in bed. Now, in the presence of the Fern Society founder, I feared being found out.
I explained how despite my studiousness, identification of the plants still eluded me, and how I was still haunted by the memory of the fern I had killed the previous winter. Mickel brightened up, and told me Id come to the right place.
I think youll find people who like ferns tend to be very interesting, he added.
Before the meeting was called to order, Robbin Moran, whom I recognized from his headshot on the New York Botanical Garden website, held up what appeared to be a ball of twine: Selaginella lepidophylla, sometimes known colloquially as the resurrection fern. The desert plant is known for being able to stay alive without any water, despite its stems drying out and curling inward. Moran thought it was a nice symbol for the passing year.
The greater New York chapter of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators presented last, passing around detailed paintings of flowers, seeds, and other floral observation. An orchid illustrator bemoaned the decline of New Yorks native wild orchid populationthe flowers are increasingly threatened by a suburban habit of mowing and manicuring lawns. I felt very sad to hear this, and suddenly realized that, over the course of this meeting, I had been drawn in.
After the closing notes, I wandered over to the bowl at the front of the room where, just before, the resurrection fern had been a tight dry bundle. In an hour, however, it had bloomed entirely, like a hand opening, now lush and bright green.
Here, try this, Moran said, appearing by my side with a hand lens so that I might look a little closer.

This 60MW is to be installed at three or more suitable locations to ease the transmission constraints that has arisen in the Central and Southern Provinces.
According to the recommendations made by Public Utilities Commission, more generation capacity should be added to the national grid to ensure uninterrupted power supply.

The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime suppressed both electronic and print media through legal and illegal means. While some sections of the media toed the line, others tried to oppose, but they were silenced, Social Welfare and Empowerment Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Mahinda Rajapaksa held two-third majority in parliament and almost 99 percent control in provincial councils as well as extreme presidential powers. Therefore, he thought he could easily win the 2015 presidential election but he had get defeated ignominiously he said.
The minister was addressing the SLFP Central Province Graduates Association AGM at the auditorium of the Central Province Chief Ministers official residence recently.
Dissanayke said Mahinda Rajapaksa went for early elections two years before the end of his term for several reasons. One was a prediction made by his astrologer that it was opportune to call early elections. Other reasons were the inability to face the conditions laid against Sri Lanka by the UNHRC in March 2015 and the compelling need to impose taxes and curtail public relief from 2017 to offset repayment of heavy loans taken by his government.
He held early elections fearing that people would rise up against measures imposed to curtail subsidies and other public relief.
During that period we in Sri Lanka were being systematically throttled through sanctions. Removal of GSP plus facility, European Union ban on fish exports and war crimes allegations made against 46 persons including four top level politicians were some of them.
Today President Maithripala Sirisena was ably tackling and overcoming all those problems after forming a consensus government of the two main parties, the minister said.
The election pledges made by the President could not be fulfilled unless he formed a consensus government, he said.
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Provincial Minister Ediriweera Weerawardena were also present.

N. Zealand strike back with three wickets
WELLINGTON: New Zealand stormed back into the first Test against Bangladesh with three quick wickets to back up a century by Tom Latham and set the stage for an intriguing final day in Wellington.
Bangladesh, seeking a first win over New Zealand, ended the penultimate day on Sunday with a 122-run lead on 66 for three but possibly only six wickets in hand after opener Imrul Kayes retired hurt.
Although a draw remains the most likely outcome, both sides have the chance to force the issue should Bangladesh offer a sporting final-day declaration on a pitch still full of runs.
A short-pitched barrage by the Bangladesh quicks and poor shot selection against part-time Mahmudullah stopped the New Zealand first innings at 539.
The tourists built on the 56-run lead to be 66 for three at stumps in their second innings with Mominul Haque not out on 10.
Tamim Iqbal made 25 and Imrul was stretchered off after injuring his left hip when diving for a single having made 24.
After New Zealand resumed the fourth day at 292 for three, opener Latham batted on to 177 to ensure the follow-on mark was comfortably passed.
BJ Watling (49) and Mitchell Santner (73) reduced the deficit to less than 100, with Santner and Trent Boult (4 not out) frustrating Bangladesh with a 35-run partnership for the final wicket.
Santner lofted Shakib Al Hasan over the long-on boundary for six, his third of the innings, to overtake his previous best 71 against India at Kanpur four months ago.
Bouncer barrage
Bangladesh tried to rattle the New Zealand tail with short balls. Santner took one fierce blow to the head from Taskin Ahmed and Neil Wagner was hit three times by Kamrul Islam drawing blood from his chin.
Wagner, New Zealand's short-ball specialist, passed a concussion test and replaced his helmet after the third blow only to be dismissed two balls later for 18.
Despite the pace barrage it was part-time spinner Mahmudullah who broke through the Watling-Santner partnership.
The pair put on 73 after Latham's dismissal to reach 471 for six when Mahmudullah came into the attack and the innings was all over 68 runs later.
Mahmudullah's first ball was short-pitched and well off-line which Watling went to smack to the boundary only to scoop it into the hands of wicketkeeper Imrul down the leg side.
With his fifth ball, Mahmudullah had Tim Southee trapped in front for one.
Wagner was caught behind trying to hook his way out of Kamrul's bouncer onslaught to give Imrul his fifth catch, a Test record for a substitute wicketkeeper.
Last man out Santer was the fourth New Zealander and ninth player in the match to pass 50.
Latham had been a model of patience for most of his 463 minutes at the crease until he offered a chance on 158 and was dropped by Mehedi Hasan.
But he could not escape the umpire's finger when trapped in front for 177 by Shakib Al Hasan.

No fretting, simply start hitting the reset button!
The New Year is all about new beginnings, a fresh start, the chance to hit the reset button after a season of eating, drinking, and being merry. Ahem, and then eating some more. So it's not surprising that come January, many of us feel the need to set some pretty lofty goals. The thing is, only a tiny number of resolution makers actually achieve them.
It can be daunting when your list of New Year's resolutions is as long as your holiday shopping list. In addition to the post-holiday slump, not being able to keep your resolutions by February, March or even late January may increase your anxiety. When your holiday decorations are packed and stored away, the frustration of what you failed to do or other reminders of failed resolutions can make the later months a period of seeming hopelessness.
However, it is important to remember that the New Year isn't meant to serve as a catalyst for sweeping character changes. It is a time for people to reflect on their past year's behaviour and promise to make positive lifestyle changes. It's very easy to make New Year's resolutions in the heat of enthusiasm and glowing joy but most of us are more familiar with the difficulty of sticking to them. It is possible but it does take quite some focus, planning, and a determination to stick with the resolutions for the same amount of time it takes to change a habit, so that the resolutions also turn into new habits.
Attainable goals
Actually, setting small, attainable goals throughout the year, instead of a singular, overwhelming goal on January 1 can help you reach whatever it is you are striving for. That is because it is not the extent of the change that matters, but rather the act of recognising that lifestyle change is important and working toward it, is best taken one step at a time.
By making your resolutions realistic, there is a greater chance that you will keep them throughout the year, incorporating healthy behaviour into your everyday life.
People change with time, so do their aspirations.
Purification rite
Making resolutions is a purification rite of self appraisal and penitence that demands personal honesty and, ultimately, reinforces humility. Breaking them is part of the cycle. But in the estimation of the less sardonic souls among us the New Year is a great era for everyone. It is the start of a new beginning. It can also be the start of a new life if the right resolutions are made and kept.
However, it is also a pretty funny time of year in a way. People often make resolutions they don't keep and do some pretty silly things at midnight. Some take it seriously. Some bid it farewell just after the clock strikes twelve. Some call it a second chance to dream with eyes open.
Seriously taken, New Year resolutions are an opportunity to measure our goals. For the adventurous souls, it is the opportunity to tickle a funny bone or to try something bold.
It is also a time to look where you stand. For those who have made all kinds of declarations last New Year's Eve should take time to reflect how far they have stood by them. If not, it is time you did! The most practical thing to do is to get down to accomplishing the incomplete decisions. If you still feel that the resolutions you made last year and abandoned midway are worth of a second shot. So give them another chance!
And be sure they are realistic resolutions. Instead of weaving dreams in the air make a decision that would have significance that adds meaning to your life. Resolve this year to monitor how far you are holding on to your commitment, it will help you to hang on. Many people resolve to quit an addiction. If it does you no good, why stick to it If needed, seek help of support groups or professionals. If you have the will, you shall find the way. For many of us it would be a sagacious move to go back to school, so to say. Learning has no age limit.
Fitness programme
Pick up where you left off. Fit in a fitness programme that ensures a future with fewer trips to the doctor. Select an exercise regime you can stick to. A group activity may add the element of fun to the routine. Lose some flab. But don't set any strict targets or attempt to over extend a schedule. Chances are that over enthusiasm may make the going too tough and de-motivate you to quit.
Soaking up new skills, learning something new and interesting is always fun and a value addition too. Try to stop pigging out. Eating to live and not living to eat should be the aim. Yet don't deny yourself the occasional indulgence. Endeavour to lose the loan that keeps niggling at your mind and causing stress. Pay off any debt you may have and feel light at heart. One element that can make you feel better and help you sleep better at night is to contribute to a charitable cause. Giving back to the society is the least we can do to make the world a better place to live in.
Learn to liven up your lifestyle. Certainly, paying attention to your professional growth is fine, but your personal life requires attention too. Strike a balance. Try to be organised in everything you do and pay attention to the smallest detail. That is the key to make life easier, manage time and live stress free. Make a proper to-do list, and you will be half way there already. Don't strive to be a perfectionist. Perfection is unattainable in any human endeavour. Remember that minor missteps when reaching your goals are completely normal and acceptable. Don't give up completely or feel guilty if you indulged in a sinful pudding or dessert and broke your diet or skipped your exercise regime because you were busy. We all have our ups and downs. Simply resolve to recover from your lapses and get back on track. But there are many out there who start getting real about resolutions. Instead of setting their sights on one meteoric milestone, they begin shifting their focus to the smaller things that can add up to make a major, lasting impact on overall health and happiness.

No regrets!
She has improved by each project. The grapevine has been abuzz with news about her too. However in recent times her profile and any gossip linked with her were missing from the picture. However after a considerable break Chathurika Peiries is back shooting for two teledramas. Here she shares the news about her upcoming projects and changes in her personal life with Daily News TnC.
Q: What kept you involved during your absence from the limelight
A: Gayan and I opened our own clothing store, Bobby House, in May last year. It is located in Thalawathugoda Road, Kotte.
It houses ladies and gents clothing and goes under the tag line Fill all your glamorous needs. We are also building a new house in the same area. It is currently in its finishing stages so I had to look into that work too.
There are less teledramas made these days because most of the air time is taken up by Indian tele serials dubbed in Sinhala.
Therefore there are only a few time slots available for local productions. However I started shooting for two teledramas recently. I am also spending time with Gayans elder son, Nethusara. His youngest son was also with us but left to be with his grandparents for a short span.
Q: Out of all the characters you have portrayed so far which character is the closest one to your heart
A: I love my maiden role, Viveka, from Sooriya Daruwo. She is so carefree and just like me. I did not have to act much to give life to that role.
She made me a household name. My role as a dancing teacher in Sepalika is quite different.
I also did a role of a mother with four children in Malathi Malak in 2006. Athma saw me in a double role and one of them is a negative character.
Those were refreshing so I love the diversity in them.
Q: If you could give life to any historic character in a film, who would you like to portray
A: From the local context I would love to portray the role of Viharamahadevi because she is a very courageous woman. Internationally it would be the character of Princess Yashodhara, the wife of Prince Siddhattha.
She is an emblem of unconditional love. Hearing that her husband was leading a holy life, she emulated him by removing her jewellery, wearing a plain yellow robe and eating only one meal a day.
If I get a role in a production from the western film industry I would like to portray a character which engages in ancient martial arts.
Q: One acting advice you would like to share with another.
A: It is a very simple advice but I think it will shape their future. Do everything after being updated about it. Most of the time we get artistes trapped in similar roles these days.
It is tiresome to see them playing one character in the morning and getting into the shoes of a similar role in another production in the afternoon. Have more diversity in your roles.
Q: What is your most treasured possession
A: I actually do not have such a possession! (Laughs) I go with the belief that we lose everything someday so why should we cling to possessions
Q: What kind outfits suit you best
A: Jeans and tops, long dresses and short dresses look good on me. I go for pink, red, yellow and pastel shades.
Q: If you could have a day off, how would you like to spend it
A: I love the outdoors so we would have a day out. I would spend the whole day with Gayan, Nethusara and our dog, Alpha, playing in the park.
Q: What is your signature dish
A: (Laughing) Actually, I do not cook that much... (Goes silent for a while and looks slightly embarrassed) Gayan loves this healthy sandwich that I make. It has a filling which includes carrot, bell pepper, egg whites, non fat cheese, onion and tomato with a dab of margarine. It is yummy and low calorie as well. So there you go... (Looks pleased with herself)
Q: If you had access to a time machine, where and when would you go
A: I would travel back to the time that I did my G C E Advanced Level examination at Musaeus College, Colombo. I studied mathematics and accounts and I excelled in my studies. However once I got into acting I could not continue my studies. If I can go back I would like to do further studies in accounts.
Q: If you could pick three international actors to be your co stars in an action movie, a romantic movie and comedy, which three actors would you choose
A: (Laughs) If I was given a choice I would choose Gayan for all three roles! I know that he has the capacity to do all three and he and I share great on screen chemistry.
So no need for any international actors for me! (More laughter) But if I could choose to star in any movies from these genres I would pick the action movie first and the comedy next because I have done plenty of romance before. (Giggles)
Q: What is the nicest thing that another person had said or done for you
A: (With a faraway look in her eyes) This happened in August last year. I stepped out a bit and when I returned into the room I found Gayans sons deep in conversation.
Then they approached me and said Sudu Ammi, instead of calling you Sudu Ammi shall we call you Ammi I was surprised and after a pause I asked me who had instructed them to do so.
Then they said that they spoke among themselves and came up with that idea all by themselves. (Emotionally) I was so touched with that episode.
Q: What is your favourite ice cream flavour
A: Oh, nothing beats chocolate. Yum! Gayan likes both vanilla and chocolate flavours.
Q: What is the most difficult choice you had to make in life
A: There is no difficult choices in my life. You make difficult choices if you are not sure whether you are making the correct choice or not.
I have always thought deeply before making my decisions so there were no difficulties in taking them.
A free mindset matters a lot to me. I do not like to be burdened by problems. So no regrets!
Q: Artistes compering programs is a popular trend now.
A: I am not interested in presenting programs because I believe that there is a separate profession called television presenters for that. It is a special job category and they are professionally trained for that. I did present Nugasewana during the early days of my career but turned to acting full time later. I also believe that if the fans see artistes often on the screen they would have enough of them. Too much of anything is good for nothing.
Q: More and more actresses are also competing for beauty pageants. Wouldnt you like to try out your luck in that sector
A: (Laughs) No! That too if off limits for me because it is so time consuming. I do not have the patience to set aside time for such a long process. Even a photo shoot is so grueling for me. Time is a crucial factor in my life. Freedom matters for me.
Q: What is the question you get asked frequently these days
A: (Giggles) When is your marriage going to take place
Q: You seem to be postponing your marriage every year.
A: (Defensively) We had to because things kept getting in the way. Shooting took up our time. Then we had to complete work in our house.
Now Gayans sons have joined us and they need time to settle in.
You cannot plan a wedding in a hurry. It is not like planning a tea party. It takes time since you have to look into a lot of details. However we are hoping to tie the knot in 2017.
Q: What are your hopes for 2017
A: Our wedding is at the top of my list.
We are also hoping to start work in our own production. The teledrama has around 60 episodes and about 25 episodes have been scripted. Once the groundwork is done we hope to start shooting towards July.

A novel solution
Sri Lanka is in for an energy crunch according to experts in the power and energy sector. Just last week, there were two dire warnings - that the country could be headed for a water shortage as well as an energy shortage due to the prevailing drought in many parts of the country. The fact that we are facing an energy crisis has been known for some time. The coal power plant that was built amidst much fanfare by the previous government was more non-operational than operational.
No other big power plants can be constructed immediately which adds to the urgency of finding a solution to the energy crisis. However, there is a proposal which is akin to killing two birds with one stone. If implemented, this proposal would take care of two of the most pressing problems facing the country in one go'. One is the garbage problem and the other concerns energy.
Garbage disposal has become one of the most pressing issues especially in Colombo, not to mention other major cities such as Kandy and Galle. Several tonnes of garbage, especially solid waste, are collected every day in Colombo. Disposing of this waste has become a huge issue. They cannot be buried or burned and the local bodies have resorted to the practice of dumping the waste on an empty land. These landfills have become an eyesore, apart from the unbearable stench. Stray cats and dogs have become another menace at these landfills. They tend to get soggy on rainy days, which adds to the woes of nearby residents. In a strictly environmental sense, landfills are also unhealthy for the planet as they mostly contain non-biodegradable objects such as plastics.
It has long been known that garbage can be used to generate energy. Such projects are common in many countries. However, the technology is somewhat expensive for most developing countries. Hence the importance of two private entities coming forward to build power plants that would use garbage as the source material. This will be a breakthrough for power generation and garbage disposal. By burning up to 900 MT of garbage per day in Colombo and Gampaha districts, they will generate a fair amount of power that can be channeled to the national grid operated by the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Depending on the success of this venture, this system of power generation can be introduced island wide. Solving the garbage problem alone will be a big achievement - power generation will be a bonus. The Government should seek more proposals from the private sector on energy generation and garbage disposal. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are ideal for these ventures since public bodies usually do not have the funds or the efficiency needed for this type of operation.
In a way, garbage can be called a renewable sort of energy because there is no sign of it running out. Yes, we should minimise food and other waste, but things do not always go according to plan. But there are types of renewable energy that do not depend on any kind of waste material at all. Wind power and solar power are two classic examples. Sri Lanka is blessed with a geographical position and climate patterns that make these energy options viable and vital. Several wind and solar projects are currently under construction in various part of the country. At first they will contribute only a fraction of the energy requirements but in the coming years they will play a bigger role in the energy generation mix. The Government has already started a solar power battle aimed especially at rural areas. Supplying mains electricity to these remote villages is often not cost-effective due to physical infrastructure constraints. It is far easier to install solar net metering systems which can also supply excess power to the national grid.
It may sound farfetched but wave energy is another type of renewable energy that we must look at in the future. Sri Lanka is surrounded by the ocean which in itself is a huge source of energy. Some countries already harness wave energy to generate power. Sri Lanka will be able to look closely at this technology as economies of scale kick in and the costs are reduced.
Still, the best way to conserve energy and to cut costs is to take a few simple steps at home. Turning off unwanted appliances and bulbs, walking to the junction instead of taking the car and using energy efficient appliances are just a few such steps. Big things begin with a few simple steps and energy consumption reduction is no exception.

Over 30 dead after Turkish cargo plane crashes in Kyrgyzstan

A Turkish cargo plane from Hong Kong has crashed in Kyrgyzstan, killing at least 32 people, most of them on the ground, say officials.
The Boeing 747 crashed into homes near Manas airport, about 25km (15 miles) north of the capital, Bishkek, the Kyrgyz government said.
At least 15 buildings were destroyed and a number of children are reported to have been among those killed.
Flight TK6491 was making a stopover in Manas en route to Istanbul in Turkey.
The plane belonged to Turkish cargo carrier ACT, which flies under the name MyCargo. But the Kyrgyz government said the flight itself was on behalf of Turkish Airlines.
Turkish Airlines distanced itself from the incident.
"Our condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in the tragic incident involving an ACT Airlines aircraft in Kyrgyzstan," it wrote on Twitter.
Destroyed houses
The plane came down shortly after 07:30 local time (01:30 GMT) in the village of Dacha-Suu, a popular holiday home area.
Visibility was poor at the time because of freezing fog, but the cause of the crash has not yet been confirmed. The plane is believed to have been around 14 years old.
Images on social media purporting to be of the crash site show fire and smoke rising from the rubble of destroyed buildings.
There are reports that one crew member survived. There were at least four people on board, officials said.
A number of people have been taken to hospital with injuries.
A spokesman for the country's emergency services, Muhammed Svarov, told AFP the death toll "could be bigger" and that "major work is under way" to search for survivors.
Prime Minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov and local emergency services are at the scene.
Manas airport, the country's main international airport, has been closed.

Pakistan record first ODI win in Australia after 12 years
Melbourne: Pakistan beat Australia by six wickets in the second one-day international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, their first ODI win on Australian soil for 12 years.
The win was also Pakistans first ODI victory at the MCG since 1985 and levels the five-match series at 1-1.
Australian captain Steve Smith won the toss and chose to bat first on a flat-looking wicket, but Pakistans opening pair Mohammad Amir (3-47) and Junaid Khan (2-40) bowled superbly to help restrict the home side to 220 all out.
They were backed up by left arm spinner Imad Wasim (2-37), whose 10-over spell in the middle of the innings tied the batsmen down and slowed the scoring.
The modest total never looked enough once Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez (72) and fellow opener Sharjeel Khan (29) had put on 68 for the first wicket.
Babar Azam chipped in with 34 before Shoaib Malik (42 not out) and Umar Akmal (18 not out) guided the visitors home with 2.2 overs to spare.
I think the bowlers did a great job for us, said Hafeez, who was also named man of the match.
We wanted to get a total on the board that we were comfortable with because the ball wasnt coming onto the bat.
The bowlers took wickets at the right time and kept the pressure on.
Australia went into the match without a recognised spinner and were made to pay the price on a two-paced wicket that favoured the slower bowlers.
Their seam attack did its best to restrict the Pakistan batting, with Josh Hazelwood (0-32) the most impressive despite not taking a wicket, and James Faulkner (2-35) effective with his changes of pace.
But the other bowlers were ineffective and expensive, with off-spinner Travis Head going for 23 runs off his 2.4 overs. Amir and Junaid Khan set the tone early with their impressive opening spells.
Junaid, brought into the team in place of Wahab Riaz, induced an edge from the dangerous David Warner (16) to leave the Australians on 31-1.
Junaid soon added the scalp of Usman Khawaja when he edged to first slip Sharjeel Khan, who took a fine catch low to his left.
Australia promoted all-rounder Mitchell Marsh up the order but the experiment failed as he scooped the first ball he faced from Amir to Imad at cover to leave the home side 41 for three.
Head then joined Smith in the middle and hit five boundaries on his way to 29 before he edged Hasan Ali to Mohammad Rizwan with Australia on 86 for four. Smith (60) brought up a hard-fought 50 from 91 balls with only two boundaries and no sixes, but with eight overs to go he got an inside edge onto his pads and then stumps to give Imad his second wicket.
There was a steady procession of wickets until Faulkner skied a ball to point off Amir to leave Pakistan needing only 221 to level the series.
Smith said the Australians had paid the price for attacking too early and losing key wickets before the spinners came on to bowl.
We were probably about 40 runs too short -- the bowlers did a pretty good job of trying to contain them, but we just werent good enough, he said. AFP

Peace Air partners Lufthansa Consulting    in bid for SriLankan,Mihin Lanka
Peace Air, the only Sri Lankan bidder willing to run SriLankan Airlines said it has partnered with Lufthansa Consulting, a subsidiary of Lufthansa Germany to submit a comprehensive proposal to the company and to conduct a Due Diligence once the government approves Peace Airs proposal.
Peace Air which has actively participated in the Expression of Interest (EOI) has offered US$ 5.5 billion to run SriLankan Airlines.
The total investment for stage one of the financial offer of Peace Air is US$ 3250 mn with payment to government for debt and shares being US$1250 mn while the full offer for aircraft purchases is US$ 1750 mn and another US$ 250 mn for working capital making it US$ 3250 mn.
Peace Air Chairman Gamini Wethasinghe told the Daily News yesterday they have the capability and expertise from Lufthansa Consulting to run the airline with more destinations being added and with more aircraft purchased outright.
We have a concrete funding partner who operates from the UK and the SWIFT funds are in writing at the moment and the representatives are already in Sri Lanka now, Wethasinghe said yesterday.
Peace Air has accepted the recommendation of British Aviation Consultancy Company Nyras,engaged by SriLankan Airlines who said a zero balance sheet be created.Peace Air is willing to pay the full amount of US$ 1000 mn (US$ 1 bn) towards debt to the Government of Sri Lanka and make the two airlines debt free.
Our management partners are Lufthansa Consulting and Privatair Airlines.These two companies will join Peace Air to assist and manage SriLankan, Mihin Air and SriLankan Catering.They have agreed to support us in every single area of airline operations and business, Wethasinghe said.
We have proposed to the government that not a single employee will be sacked or retrenched now and we vehemently oppose the move to retrench staff in both Mihin and SriLankan since they are the asset of these airlines.
Our plan is to double the fleet and therefore we can keep all the staff, who are working today. We can always find work for them within.Train the existing staff in a field they like.There are so many things that we can do to keep the staff happy.They must feel wanted.They must feel that their jobs are safe and sound; that they stand on solid stable ground. Fear will cause a lot of damage in the Airline itself.Therefore, we must say that there is no retrenchment or sacking policy,,he said.
Wethasinghe said Rs 100,000 will be given to all employees of the two airlines as a signature bonus in anticipation of their cooperation and team work,if they are given the go ahead to manage the national carrier.
Meanwhile National Savings Bank Chairman Aswin de Silva said they will be informing the final outcome for the Due Diligence process to proceed further in two weeks time.He declined to comment further on the SWIFT guarantee made by the bankers of Peace Air for US$ 5.5 bn.
The National Savings Bank through NSB Fund Management Company are the bankers to the reorientation process and have shortlisted three bidders including Peace Air.

Perahera elephant runs amok, extensive damage in Gandara
The elephant carrying the casket containing the sacred relics at the 72nd Duruthu Perahera of the Wijerathnaramaya Viharaya in Gandara on Poya day ran amok and caused extensive damage to private and public property.
The elephant was tranquilised after about five hours by wildlife officials.
The incident is said to have occurred when the casket bearing the sacred relics got entangled with an overhead telecommunication wire opposite the Gandara Fisheries Harbour at around 6.30 p.m.
The elephant smashed up a three wheeler, toppled five or six electricity and telephone posts, parapet walls, coconut palms and was said to even have flung bundles of fishing nets before it was sedated by a team of wildlife officials led by Dr. Nandana Perera.
Dr. Perera is attached to the Ridiyagama Safari Park. The area was in total darkness after the electricity posts were damaged.
No injuries were reporteded. The casket carrying the sacred relics was damaged. The elephant brought from Maharagama was transported back around 11.30 p.m.

Police air support units to combat crime: PM
Police aviation units or air support units will be set up in cities with helicopters to respond to crime during day and night.The Police service should not be limited to ensuring law and order. It should serve the public in a broader perspective, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Moves are under way by the government to introduce a macro model which will change the mechanistic organisational functions of the Police. The model is also envisioned to bring about significant alterations to existing criminal laws as regards penalties for drug crimes and offences punishable under the Excise law and consolidated enactments of Sri Lanka, the Premier said.
Germany and Britain have reportedly agreed to support the government to meet the design requirements, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The plan and the decision to implement it were discussed with Police higher-ups at a meeting at Temple Trees on Friday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs D.M.Swaminathan, Ministry Secretary Jagath P. Wijeweera, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara and a number of Police top brass were present.
It was outlined here that bi-lingual training will be mandatory for all Police officers under the new model.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Police have to look at their scope of application and how fast they can reach their targets. They need to look at their capabilities in tackling crime in a modern environment with an appropriate organisational and technical structure.
The Sinhala-speaking Police officers should be able to carry out their work in Tamil, The Premier said.
Police units specialised in tackling computer or internet-enabled crimes will be set up in keeping with the new structure. The officers will be provided with necessary training in countering computer crimes both locally and abroad, the Prime Minister added.
Meanwhile, the government is taking steps to purchase necessary technologies to set up the modern structure.
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said that the Police need to improve its scope of tackling cyber crime.
Police need to get better equipped and outsmart cyber criminals, he said.
Minister Ratnayaka acceded to a request by Police officers to revise drug penalties, tobacco and alcohol related offences, which the Police said were too outdated.
With police informing the minister that they are faced with immense difficulties in controlling numerous protests that are staged in Colombo, Pettah and areas near the Parliament, the minister instructed the Law and Order Ministry Secretary to identify two sites in the city that may be designated to those conducting protests.
He asked the Secretary that the locations concerned may be gazetted for the use of public demonstrations.

Prevailing dry weather has caused salt water intrusion into Kalu Ganga: NWSDB GM
The prevailing dry weather has caused a salt water intrusion in Kalu Ganga, National Water Supply and Drainage Board General Manager Engineer G.A. Kumararatne said.
Kumararatne said the water intakes from the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Gin Ganga rivers are still normal.
We are unable to take water from Deduru Oya. So our option is to take water from Kurunegala lake, he said.
The water supply to the Kurunegala town is reduced to about 12 hours a day since last week, due to the receding water level of the Deduru Oya, Kumararatne said.
There is no significant change in the river water levels at the moment. We are building up small barriers to build up water for intake, he said.
However, a salt water intrusion is evident in Kalu Ganga. The NWSDB is looking into the situation, Kumararatne said. He said by the end of February the condition may change if the drought continues.
We may have to opt for a water supply control by the end of February. We may have to reduce the number of hours for the water supply, he said.
He said Sri Lanka has deep wells running up for 52,000 meters depth not affected by the last August, September and October drought season.
Apart from Vavuniya, other deep well schemes will continue as usual, Kumararatne said.
He said the domestic consumption may rise as the drought proceeds.
We can predict rises in using water for non drinking purposes such as washing and cleaning, which will ultimately cause a demand exceeding the contribution ability, he said.
The GM also said that around 130 extra water bowsers are supplying water for elevated areas.
Director of Irrigation (Water Management & training) Engineer S. Mohanarajah said a sound rain fall was expected in this season, but the received rain fall is enough only to fill 40 percent of the reservoirs.
The main problem is the drought, not the cultivation. The drought will affect the next Yala season cultivation. If we dont get water in this season, we will not be able to give water for Yala Kannaya. This is our main problem, he said.
We asked the farmers not to start cultivation very early. But some of them have started following the last rain fall due to the recent atmospheric depression. We will be able to safeguard 40 percent of the cultivation, Mohanarajah explained.
Our water storage is about 27 percent island wide, and we are going to do a strict and well planned water management, he said.
Some farmers have not started cultivating yet. They ask whether they can commence now, but we are holding them back, he said. Since we are in short of water, it is not advisable to start cultivating now, he also said.
We have to save some water for domestic purposes as well. The Irrigation Department is responsible for the water sources. The Water Board distribute water for domestic purposes in areas such as Kantale, Murutawela, Galle, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Batticaloa districts. Mohanarajah said.
As much as we need to release water for cultivation, we need to prioritise reserving the drinkable water as well, he pointed out.
Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman Anura Wijepala said the government is encouraging the public to choose renewable energy sources such as solar power in similar demanding situations. Department of Wildlife Conservation Media Spokesperson Hasini Sarathchandra said they are well equipped to minimise the impacts of the drought on the wildlife.
Sarathchandra pointed out the water was pumped into water holes within the national parks from nearby water sources such as streams or rivers in previous drought season, .
In the last drought season, we pumped water from the Menik River to the Yala National Park. Solar power was used to activate the generators to pump water from the river. The same method is used in Kumana and Wilpattu parks. The Wildlife Department is to introduce the same method to other national parks as well, Sarathchandra said. A special observation patrolling will be introduced in all the national parks following the drought, Sarathchandra said.
The animals are vulnerable to be hunted more in rought seasons, she said.

Promising future guaranteed
Excerpts from the speech made by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr Harsha de Silva, at the public forum organised by the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, January 9, 2017
January 9 marks the 2nd anniversary of an important turning point in Sri Lankas recent history. It is the beginning of the 3rd of the five year term of President Maithripala Sirisena. On January 8, 2015, the people of Sri Lanka went to the polls and on the 9th switched from a government which had embarked on a divisive and authoritarian trajectory to one of convergence and National Unity.
For the first time since Independence, traditional rivals in Sri Lankan politics, eschewed adversarial politics to undertake pressing political and economic reforms in the long-term interests of the people. Sri Lankans demonstrated to the world that they could change a well-entrenched government, long considered to be undefeatable, by using a simple tool called the ballot. It was an unexpected outcome to many, both outside and inside of Sri Lanka and demonstrated the importance of democracy.
Optimism in a changing global dynamic
During the last two years, we have achieved some notable successes as well as faced some complex challenges that have slowed down our progress. It is a trajectory that is inevitable in a democracy.
Sri Lankans are a resilient people who sustained a sense of optimism about the potential of their country even in the darkest moments of our history. Now, perhaps for the first time in our contemporary history, the future holds more promise than doubts.
We believe that we are at a stage of economic growth and political maturity, which combined with opportunities presented by global and regional developments, will allow us to propel ourselves to the next phase of development if we play our cards right.
Therefore, its with a sense of optimism that I approach this topic of my speech Sri Lanka's Role in the Indian Ocean and the Changing Global Dynamic.
The moment one hears the two words Sri Lanka his or her mind travels to South Asia. And that is why we are here at the ISAS. However, for centuries Taprobane, Ceylon, Sri Lanka or whatever the island was referred to was the heart of the Indian Ocean.
So, we would like to position Sri Lanka more as that centre of the Indian Ocean.
The future prosperity of our people lies in how well we leverage our location in the Indian Ocean.
In order to accomplish our goals we must be vigilant on regional and global developments that will aid or hinder our path.
The year 2016 was a tumultuous year in politics and economics.
We are witnessing momentous changes in the structure of the global economy brought about by the relentless winds of globalization and the current manifestation of Western neo-liberalism.
It is reasonable to be concerned at the rapid pace of changes, and what it means for our economies.
The effect of Brexit and (and other possible exits from the EU) and the trade policies of the US-President-Elect will take some months, even years, to manifest.
And many will be observing with interest the interactions between China and the incoming US Administration. It is in this context that many say that Uncertainty is the new normal in business life. Those countries and organisations which thrive in an era of uncertainty will be those who seize the opportunities presented by these uncertainties and take actions that can avert disasters and promote confidence and recovery.
So the emerging and uncertain global dynamics will present both challenges and opportunities to us in the Indian Ocean.
Sri Lankas historical role in the Indian Ocean
Our location has shaped our history so intrinsically for millennia and will continue to be so in the future.
In ancient times, Sri Lanka was important as the half way point between the two great empires of Rome and China and near the equator where navigational winds and monsoon effects changed directions. Therefore, it had strategic geographical advantages where global and navigational contexts were concerned.
The island featured prominently in the Spice Routes which were also known as Maritime Silk Roads. In fact, it is said that cinnamon from Sri Lanka and cassia from China found their way along the Spice Routes to the Middle East as far back as 2,000 BC.
Foreign merchants were attracted to ancient Taprobana because of its importance as a centre of international trade and some of them even settled in the island, particularly Moors, descendants of Arab traders to the island.
They were a dominant influence on the island's international trade in the Polonnaruwa period in the 11th to 13th centuries; a position which they retained till the early decades of the sixteenth century.
An examination of the foreign relations of the island under the Polonnaruwa kings reveals political links with South-East Asia, in particular with Myanmar and Cambodia.
Peace and prosperity along the maritime Silk Road helped increase the volume of trade via the Indian Ocean, from which Sri Lanka naturally profited.
Much of this trade was in luxury goods, and in this respect, Sri Lanka was a transit point as well as a terminal point, the latter due to Sri Lankas own considerable luxury products such as gems and pearls.
However, ancient Sri Lanka was largely a self-sufficient agrarian economy and role of trade was a generally peripheral activity.
It was only after the collapse of the ancient hydraulic civilization at the end of the Polonnaruwa period that the countrys rulers began to pay greater attention to the economic possibilities of trade.
Exports of spices, particularly cinnamon, became an increasingly lucrative activity. During the period 13th-15th centuries, Sri Lankas position as a trade hub on the East-West maritime route had been established, as had its position as a gateway to India.
Sri Lanka had direct commercial links with Malacca, and also with regions in India such as Gujarat and Bengal.
During the colonial rule by the Portuguese, Dutch and lastly the English, the volume of foreign trade expanded. The tea trade which was started by the British still plays a significant role in the Sri Lankan economy.
However, in the last 500 years the Indian Ocean region lost its geo-political and geo-economic relevance; first to colonial dictates and in thereafter post-colonial cold war concerns.
Sri Lanka's strategic role in the Indian Ocean
Now, for the first time in five centuries, global economic balance of power is once again shifting towards Asia. It is estimated that by 2030, Asia will surpass North America and Europe combined in global power based on GDP, population size, military spending and technological investments.
The global financial system is also moving away, albeit slowly, from the dollar dominated international system to a more multi-currency system.
New consumer markets are emerging all across Asia and the Asian middle class is expanding rapidly. Of the four largest economies of the world; US, China, Japan and India, three are located in Asia.
The busy East-West shipping route passes just six to ten nautical miles south of the island with more than 60,000 ships plying this route annually carrying two-thirds of global petroleum supply and half of all containerized cargo.
Thus, Sri Lankas situation in the nautical corridor between the East and West is of importance not only from a geostrategic perspective, but also from maritime economics and security perspectives. We are under no illusion that as a small country, we can change the geo-political realities of the region surrounding us. Thus, a wise foreign policy is essential, not only for the present but to ensure the prosperity and safety of future generations.
Along with many opportunities, the renewed interest will also bring vulnerability to emerging competition among major naval powers.

The All-Share Price Index took a turn from its losing streak on Wednesday with the announcement, as it rose ~65 points W-o-W, helping wipe off some of last weeks ~75 point W-o-W loss and pushing above a key-support level of 6152 points.
Gains were led by MELS, SLT, CLC, JKH, LLUB, HHL and CTC which together contributed ~ 45 points to the Index.
The daily average turnover of the holiday shortened week consequently increased by 32% W-o-W to end at LKR 0.71Bn, ~16% higher than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.61Bn and marginally lower than 2016s full year daily average of LKR 0.73Bn.
Crossings over the week accounted for ~28% of total market turnover, amid strong interest in blue-chips such as LLUB (51% of crossings), JKH (15% of crossings) and NEST (13% of crossings).
Foreign flows into the Bourse meanwhile turned negative this week (LKR 0.73Bn ) bringing the total net outflows for the year to LKR 1.7 Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current positive momentum.
Short-term bill rates rise, trade deficit narrows
T-Bill rates across all maturities rose yet again for the fourth consecutive week this week, with the sharpest increase recording in 3M Bill.
Rates on the 3M Bill rose by 19bps (cf. 6 bps last week) while rates on the 6M bill rose 10bps (cf. 16bps last week) and the 12M bill rose 9bps (cf.5bps last week) as CBSL continued to mop up the excess liquidity in the market .
Yields on the 91-day and 182-day bills have consequently increased 42bps and 50bps since October 2016 to date compared to the steep increase of ~230bps (91 Day) and ~290bps (182- day) since January 2016 to Oct 2016.
On the External front meanwhile, Sri Lankas trade deficit narrowed -12.0% Y-o-Y in Sep16 with the increase in export earnings (5.7% Y-o-Y) for the second consecutive month coupled with decline in import earnings (-2.5% Y-o-Y).
Export earnings improved despite decline in earnings in apparel sector (highest contributor to export earnings (~43%) aided mainly by improved earnings from tea (8% Y-o-Y), rubber (15.3% Y-o-Y) & transport equipment (486% Y-o-Y).
Lower import expenditure was supported mainly by lower oil import bill (22.1% Y-o-Y), non food consumer goods (16.9% Y-o-Y) & lower importation of vehicles (51.9% Y-o-Y).
Service inflows meanwhile were driven primarily by earnings from Tourism (+3.6% Y-o-Y) although workers remittances declined 1.1% Y-o-Y.
The countrys B-o-P consequently recorded a surplus of USD 243.1mn between Jan-Sep 2016 (cf. deficit of USD 2,316.5mn in Jan-Sep15) though gross official reserves declined marginally to 4.1 months of imports in Sep 16 from 4.2 months in Aug16.

Regained GSP Plus: Great Victory for Sri Lanka
Regained GSP Plus is a great victory for Sri Lanka, the country receives 500 million US dollars in foreign exports by regaining GSP. It was lost because of the short-sighted policies of the previous regime.The country will receive a new lease of life through this victory, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the opening of the Samasaranagama Housing Complex. The opening ceremony was held marking the UNP 70th anniversary and Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasas 50th birthday.
The Prime Minister said the GSP facility is awarded to countries where democracy reigns and where democratic rights, law and order is maintained. A transition period will dawn to Hambantota when the industrial zone is implemented. Hambantota needs about 2000 industrial ventures, he said.
The Prime Minister said 95 percent of state land will be used for these ventures.The country was greatly indebted due to the the Hambantota seaport construction and other similar haphazard projects carried out by the previous regime.
The government has to pay 1,900 million US dollars to settle the loans, but country has no funds. If we do not follow this, we have to burden people with all sorts of taxes, the Prime Minister said.
When the industrial zone project was launched last week, many protested. The countrys other parts can have industrial ventures if Hambantota does not want them, he said. Ministers of other districts request for industrial ventures, but a highest number of poor people live in Hambantota, the Prime Minister said. Therefore, it was our bounden duty to set up the industrial ventures in Hambbantota and provide job opportunities to the educated jobless youth, he said.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa are dead against the provision of jobs to the underprivileged youth in the region, he said. Why Mahinda Rajapaksa is against this, he queried. We will not confine industrial zones only to Hambantota. We will expand them to other regions as well, the Prime Minister said.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said 2.5 million of families in Sri Lanka, 1,90,000 of them do not have houses to live and 79 percent in Hambantota remain homeless. Rs. 2.2 million was spent on providing electricity and Rs. 1.6 million to provide water and Rs. 3.20 million to construct roads for the housing scheme. 264 udagammanas are being set up now. In 2010, the GSP facility was taken and garment factories were closed, the minister recalled
Every minister was told by the Prime Minister to carry out something valuable to mark the 70th anniversary of the party. Housing complexes were built and are being built, the Prime Minister said.
The Fisheries State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi, Hema Premadasa, Jalani Premadasa, Hambantota District Secretary W.H. Karunaratna, Housing and Construction Ministry Secretary W.K.K.Athrukorala, Lunugamwehera DS I.R.K.Vitharana were present.

Shattered hopes
IVF clinics are using 'highly misleading' success rates to advertise their services, experts warn. A new study has found that many centres are cherry-picking their results to provide a false sense of hope to couples.
Many are using their pregnancy rates to attract those desperate for children - despite this not being the figure of importance.
Scientists are now arguing that an outright advertising ban should be considered if clinics don't show a true break down of their actual birth rates.
A new study has found that many IVF clinics are cherry-picking their results to provide a false sense of hope to couples
University of Manchester researchers found that success rates are published on 67 per cent of IVF clinic websites.
Study author Jack Wilkinson said: 'Clinics can cherry-pick their results from a dizzying array of options.
'The concern is that clinics can always construct figures that show their own performance in the best possible light while making competitors look bad.
'This is not helpful to patients, who may struggle to understand differences in what each clinic reports and may be misled into making comparisons on the basis of incomparable results.
'Even if clinics are acting in good faith, the current system does not produce clear or reliable information for the people that need it.
'Just as advertising of prescription drugs to patients is not permitted, a ban on advertising IVF should be considered if there is no binding standard of reporting.'
As over half of all IVF in the UK is privately funded, clinics can compete for patients through advertising.
Success rates can often tempt couples to pick one clinic ahead of another - but the published results may not ring completely true.
Although direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs is banned in the UK, there are no such restrictions on IVF.
The researchers discovered 53 clinics were reporting success rates out of a toal of 79 investigated.
But in these said centres, pregnancy rates were reported more frequently than birth rates.
Only 51 per cent reported actual live birth statistics - the item of importance to patients.
They also discovered that clinics were reporting their pregnancy rates in 33 different ways, potentially confusing couples.
Some 72 per cent presented results without specifying the sample size, while a quarter didn't mention the age of patients.
Writing in the journal BMJ Open, Mr Wilkinson added: 'IVF is expensive and likely to fail though couples may not get that impression when visiting these IVF clinic websites.
'There is a strong incentive to selectively report success rates in a way that exaggerates performance. A lack of binding guidance means that clinics are free to do this.' -Daily Mail
IS IVF WORTH IT
* Thousands of women in Britain are having IVF unnecessarily, an infertility expert claimed last week, when they are able to have a child naturally.
* Almost half of couples labelled infertile after trying unsuccessfully for a baby for a year will, studies show, fall pregnant in the next two years if they just keep trying.
* But many panic and pay thousands of pounds for IVF, a British Fertility Society conference heard, because they believe they have a medical problem and need treatment.

Sri Lanka Insurance to launch free insurance policy to all schoolchildren
For the first time in South Asia, Sri Lanka Insurance (SLI) will launch a free insurecne policy for schoolchildren from next month.
Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Joint Managing Director T.M.R. Bangsa Jayah told the Daily News Business that this is being sponsored by the Finance Ministry with an annual investment of Rs. 2.7 billion.This will include international school children as well.
He said that this move can be considered as the next best thing in the Sri Lankan education sector after free education.
The scheme will benefit over 4.5 million schoolchildren up to Advanced Level. He said that a unique feature of this free insurance scheme is that it will not only help schoolchildren in a need of the hour but will also financially support their parents and guardians in case of accident, disability and death.
Jayah said that through this they hope to offer special insurance packages for parents thus helping them to gain a bigger maket share and also help to increase insurance penetration in Sri Lanka.
He said that the SLI has also turned around from a minus 4% growth to a plus 18% institution last year.
Commenting on the Insurance Corporation, he said that it gave over Rs. 16 billion back to government coffers last year.We have taken several meaningful steps to cut waste and corruption and through them hope to provide over 10% more than the previous year to the Treasury.SLI will open 17 more branches before end of March and action will be taken to pay insurance claims (non complicated) from all of these branches soon.

Starting new life at 60!
When Mr. Fernandos two sons decided to settle down abroad, they invited their parents to come and live with them. But Mr. and Mrs. Fernando had other plans. They moved into a comfortable retirement home away from the city.I wanted to live my retirement phase on my own terms and I have no qualms about it. My wife and I love to read and write, we enjoy nature and love to mix with like-minded people, he said.
Mr. Fernando and his wife are a part of the growing number of elderly people who are breaking away from the traditional family system and staying away from their children, mostly out of choice.
New market
Several factors are driving the demand for retirement housing in Sri Lanka. Our so-called demographic dividend will soon turn grey. Right now, nearly 2.6 million people (or roughly 12.5% of the population) are above 60 years of age. This number is expected to soar to 3.6 million by 2021 with 17 per cent of our population. By 2041, one in every four Sri Lankan is expected to be elderly.
The Government must understand the reality of the situation and get ready for the consequences. The large corporate groups must make use of this opportunity and foray into retirement villages, retirement homes and seniors-only homes.
Options
There was a time when senior care in Sri Lanka was confined to Homes for the aged. But those were generally meant for the destitute and run for charity. Things started to change at the turn of the century, with the mass exodus of young educated professionals to the West. Many sets of parents from the middle-class and upper middle-class groups found themselves in standalone mode.
As a result, the largely ignored concept of retirement housing has been slowly witnessing an increased consumer interest across Sri Lanka. Since a large number of senior citizens being financially stronger than their earlier generations, the concept of comfort and luxury can be adopted within various retirement home projects.
Since Sri Lanka has diverse financial demographics there are a number of options for senior citizens opting to stay in retirement homes. Some of the types of independent senior living homes are discussed below.
Retirement villages  This concept offers cluster housing groups offering elderly people similar lifestyle outside of their homes, besides also taking care of day-to-day household services and medical emergencies. It also provides seniors with an option to spend the rest of their lives with like-minded people from the same age-group and income-group. The aim is also to provide active lifestyle to the seniors besides it gives them the freedom and independence to lead their day their way.
In other countries where this concept is adapted, the developers are being sensitive and taking care of the needs of senior citizens while designing. They are maintained with a focus on special requirements of senior citizens  grab rails, anti-skid tiles, wheelchair-friendly premises, social and spiritual events, restaurants, convenience stores, libraries and a club area with rooms to play cards and follow hobbies. Besides, there are regular activities like cinema, cultural events and festivals to keep the occupants busy and active.
Assisted Living Houses: With advancement of age, senior citizens require constant medical attention and aid. Assisted living houses are a concept which allows elderly to live with an assistant  either a family member or a medical nurse or helper. Such assisted living houses are comparatively a newer thought. However, this concept is developing in India and is likely to pick up here in the near future. The advantage of having a medical assistance cuts out any travelling time to hospitals making such homes quite useful for people with medical issues and other disabilities.
Nursing homes for Seniors: These are skilled nursing care centres usually built at a close proximity to hospitals. Such homes have an in house medical team checking and monitoring the health issues of the inmates. Since an elderly person is quite prone to infections prevalent in a public hospital, these homes act like a private nursing care centre providing medical help in the comfort of a home.
Seniors-only housing  These are for people aged above 55. In many Asian countries, this model is growing fast. Seniors-only housing is usually developed in the suburbs to keep costs down. Although it is part of a big township, entry is restricted to the residents. Cleaning, mopping and housekeeping of the homes, besides maintenance of the common areas and health clinic are covered in the monthly charges. Although all senior housing units come with kitchens, the managements also run canteens.
Day Care Centres for Seniors - This is also an interesting concept. While a seniors family members are out for work, he can move into a day centre to keep himself occupied and busy. The members of the family can breathe a sigh of relief, while their elderly loved one is being looked after by a professional team and is being offered a chance to get out of the home, socialize and participate in fun activities. The service is to extend social support system to the senior citizens in any sense.
High-end retirement villages
The concept of high end or luxury retirement villages has caught on fast globally with a larger percentage of the population over 60. In 2014, the first High-end Retirement Village in Sri Lanka was launched in five-star style, in line with the comfortable life style assured for its occupants. It is a 30-acre coconut plantation turned into a country-club styled project with 140 well appointed two bedroomed villas, set in idyllic surroundings.
Many Lankan professionals are coming back to retire in the home country. Then there are the Lankan expatriates who desire to provide a life of comfort for their parents on their retirement. This could also interest retired foreigners opting for a safe and comfortable second home in Sri Lanka specially to spend their winter months.
Few issues
At the same time, now is the opportune moment for the Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare to take deep look at the mission, objectives and related activities of the National Secretariat for Elders. The question to be asked is: Has the Secretariat grasped control of the whole concept of elder care, in all its forms, and to regulate those who provide it virtually in all settings and circumstances
According to the records, a little over 300 elders homes are in the country, including both state-run and private. The number of elders are supposed to be around 10,000. The Government itself knows that these figures are incorrect and the actual figures are very much higher. How can that happen
Organisations and Individuals providing services for the elders should be registered under the Protection of the Rights of the Elders Act No 09 of 2000. It seems the regulation is not being adhered to. The writer believes the absence of a monitoring and regulation mechanism is the reason for this problem. The Government needs to step in to prevent unscrupulous groups of people take advantage of the loophole and prey on the innocent elders.
To make matters worse, social service is a devolved subject under the 13th Amendment. That means implementation of the national policy becomes the responsibility of each Provincial Council.
Plan for future
In most developed countries, senior citizen care services are categorized under Ministry of Health and Human Services. They believe the services involve the fulfillment of the special needs and requirements that are unique to senior citizens, either physical or psychological or both. The professionals in the health sector are fully qualified and experienced to handle situated related to those fields. Of course, the social workers have a major role to play under the guidance of health professionals. This is something the Government needs to take into consideration.
Legal Minimum Standards for care providers should also be introduced. It is heartening to note that last year Sri Lanka Standards Institute issued a SLS certification 1506 prescribing the minimum requirements for elderly care homes for resident elders. This certification should be made mandatory for all elders homes after giving necessary training to the owners and staff of the institutions. A reasonable period should also be granted for them to adjust themselves.
As we study the funding allocation, we note that there is a significant lack of government sponsored programmes or homes for the elderly. Only limited resources are set aside for elders homes. There are only four state-run institutions throughout the country. At the minimum, there should be two homes each district which should act as model homes with the relevant SLT certification.
Given the demographic outlook in our country over the next 30 years, we need to start now a highly-defined programme containing the essential norms for the quality of care, health and welfare for our senior citizens. We cannot be happy with just the introduction of the SLS Certification and services planned for elders. All of them need implementation. There lies the problem and the central question remains. Do we have the political will and the required funding and other resources to implement a multi-faceted programme so that we could achieve the excellence in elder care services

Stellar performance by Kandy SC to beat Navy
Defending league champions Kandy SC came up with a stellar performance to defeat Navy SC by a thumping 50 points (4 goals, 2 tries, 4 penalties) to 22 (2 goals, 1 try and 1 penalty) in their return Dialog league rugby match played at Nittawela yesterday. At half time Kandy led 28-10.
Kandy totally deserved this victory having had a difficult time in getting the team together since the tournament commenced. Yesterday they look a complete package with the forwards and backs clicking as a team, and team support and turn-over play. The Nittawela boys totally outplayed the sailors with heart and conviction.
The defending champions lived up to their hard earned reputation in the current league. They drew rounds of applause from their fans that saw them rock the sailors to a standstill with a spirited display which was full of rugby know how. Their performance with the ball was stunning which helped them to a half a century score.
The Kandy forwards out forced the sailors and a good part of the second half was entirely dominated by them. This third consecutive victory in the second round could easily be classed as the finest of them all, it was quite a remarkable performance. The character and flexibility shown was superb and it fashioned out a delightful win.
The sailors have been magical this season losing only one game narrowly to Havelock SC. They will be hugely disappointed because they had such wonderful victories in the second round, but yesterday failed to cope with Kandys team work and hunger for a win. What let down the sailors down was the way they played.
They were forced to manage to adapt and having to throw out their initial game plan and revert to a more compact and defensive game.
In the first quarter the sailors thought they could beat Kandy with ball in hand, but then things changed. The sailors need to be careful with their ball handling in the rest of their matches. In this game they made few mistakes whereas Kandy at times was brilliant. Some of their running with the ball and passing was at times breathtaking, skipper and scrum half Roshan Weeraratne was as usual brilliant but had to leave the field with a shoulder injury in the second half.
The return of Fazil Marija was excellent as he fed the three quarters to run every time they got the ball. He had his hands full with the magnificent play. Kandys backs can string together some lovely play and they are a pleasure to watch.
In the forwards play Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Shehan Pathirane, Damith Dissanayake and Sayru Anthony controlled the strings and were outstanding. Fullback Thilina Wijesinghe has been monumental this season sealing his spot with the No: 15 jersey.
The try scorers for Kandy SC were Dhanushka Ranjan (two) and one each was scored by Richard Dharmapala, Shehan Pathirane, Buwaneka Udangamuawa and Gayan Weeraratne. The conversion and the four penalties were neatly put over by Thilina Wijesinghe.
For Navy SC the tries were scored by Saliya Hapangoda, Lee Keegal, Dulanjana Wijesinghe one each. Thilina Wijesinghe put over the conversions.
The match was refereed by Sam George Jones from Australia.

Treasury to establish  unit for PPP projects
Sri Lanka will setup a separate division for Public Private Partnerships (PPP) under the Treasury with experts in the field to support and advice the relevant ministry on selection, implementation and management of such projects.
The government said Rs 75 million will be allocated for the initial expenses of the new unit and will initially comprise 17 personnel who will be recruited for 3 years.
The necessity of a central division has arisen for assisting, advising and facilitating the activities of PPPs to be implemented in the country, the Finance Ministry said.
This will be the first step of leveraging the maximum number of solicited and unsolicited proposals brought forward for PPPs.
Managing project selection, implementation and providing project transaction advice are the main objectives expected to be achieved through this unit.
PPP cells will be organized in the relevant ministries to handle the work as well as to liaise with the new PPP division.The division will also provide oversight in execution, transparency, good governance, formulation of polices and recommendations to Cabinet Committee on Economic Management.
PPP refers to a contractual arrangement between the implementing agency and the project proponent for the financing, design, construction, operation and maintenance.It deals with any project or facility which is in alignment with national priority and economic agendas where the proponent bears significant risk, management responsibility or both.

## Title: The Unbearable Niceness of Being

The Unbearable Niceness of Being
The first feeling to arrive while reading Emily Goulds essay on publishings gendered niceness problem was mortified panic. It was followed my many more feelings, but the mortified panic lingered throughout, accompanying other fears made more real by seeing them confirmed in writing by another woman my age in the same industry. I bristled at some points and nodded my head with the entire top half of my body at others, but the one that nagged at me most wasnt found in the essay itself but in its sub-hed: Baking cookies is just part of playing the game. Amid Goulds thorough and thoughtful critique of the expectations placed on women in publishing, I was stuck on the thought that I had missed the memo on bringing cookies to my readings to render myself more likable than my prose and wit could do alone. As I read on, however, I discovered a still greater horror: even in the absence of snacks, I still exhibit the telltale characteristics of someone who is nice.
By the time I finish writing this, I will have typed and deleted and retyped more cautiously every sentence of this essay. This is because I largely agree with Goulds conclusions about the unfairly high expectations for women in publishing and dont want to misrepresent myself as oppositional to them, but if I am honest with myself, it is also because I want to be nice. I do not mean that I want people reading this to think Im nice, but that I want to actually be nice. And no, I do not mean kind or empathetic or warm in this case. I strive to be all of those things too, but I really do just mean nice here. I keep italicizing that word because it has come to read as a hissed accusation of shallow ingratiation more often than as a simple description of agreeability. But thats what I want to be. You know, pleasant. The kind of person who compliments perfectly satisfactory but not especially exciting outfits, who staves off lulls in party conversations by asking more questions about a topic that is nearly boring them to tears. I dont just smile when I meet new people at readings or industry parties; my smile has an exclamation point in it.
Gould refers to the niceness that women in publishing are expected to perform as playing the game. Among other niceties, the game is said explicitly to involve writing fawning social media posts about okay-ish books and sending friendly notes to critics along with galleys. I read Goulds essay last Friday, the day that galleys for my first book were shipped and the day after my publicist at Grand Central sent me an Excel sheet of the names of people receiving them. I had spent hours crafting personalized emails to several of the recipients, telling them I was excited they were getting the book, detailing why I thought they specifically would like it, even recommending particular essays based on their reading and writing habits. Now, I felt a rush of panic that these recipients would think me a brown-nosing try-hard like Tracy Flickher will to power fueled by chirpy interjections and smilesor worse, a serpentine manipulator like Regina George, complimenting an outfit one moment and calling it the fugliest f-ing thing shes ever seen the next.
I use girls from teen movies as examples intentionally here because my experience in publishing has felt so often not like a real high school experience, but like some exaggerated fable about the pitfalls of gossip, caring too much about public perception, and seeking popularity at the expense of integrity. Gould chronicles the exhausting dance of being complimentary to all editors and their authors for fear that they may one day edit us; the unfulfillable desire to ignore publicists because they might eventually become our own; the withholding of a savage pan, trapped by possibility of being thrust onto a panel with or under the awards judgment of the author in question. After all, the business of publishing is not about being nice, its about seeming nice, and no one is really that nice, she concludes.
Reasonable
Gould has spent far longer in publishing than I have and been treated far more cruelly when she did not capitulate to the demands for female likability, so it is reasonable that she sees these demands as especially exhausting. I understand feeling disturbed that so much of this niceness is a veneer. But I am reticent to embrace an alternative where icy ambivalence or willful disinterest in others is the norm. Though men within publishing frequently exempt themselves from efforts at likability among their peers, nearly everyone in the industry exempts themselves from these efforts when it comes to outsiders. Gould comments on the welcome reprieve of witnessing an especially disengaged woman author at an industry event, but people seeking to get into the industry have likely met some version of that woman several times over. The resulting insecurity and sense of unwelcome among writers without access to publishings inner circle is disheartening for an industry that ought to be working tirelessly to be more inclusive, and it is men who have recused themselves from niceness who should be doing more of the heavy lifting.
I diverge somewhat from Goulds account in my belief that nice is not something that you are; it is something that you do. So much emphasis is placed on intention that we neglect to see the often positive outcomes of even niceness that comes without pure intentions. When I wrote those notes to the people receiving my galleys, the impetuses really were the giddy excitement of sharing my work with peers and a belief that it would be odd not to mention it was coming. I wouldnt weave a basket and have it sent to a colleague who likes textile crafts without explaining it; why would I do so with a book But there have been plenty of other occasions where producing that niceness took extraordinary will power. Every day, I awaken to a fresh battle against my own swiftness to judge, my petty jealousy, a viciousness Im occasionally impressed by but would mostly prefer to temper.
I corresponded with Gould for this piece, and she was clear that her intention was not to valorize un-niceness, but to argue that these expectations put an uneven burden on women to be likable. She said that one of the reasons she started Emily Books was because she is fairly naturally inclined to socializing, being engaged with others, and listening, and she wanted to relieve writers of that burden. Gould told me that barring a few exceptions, writers are terrible salespeople and spokespeople, and those things shouldnt be in the job description.
Publishing is also an industry that selectively values a kind of swaggering authenticity that would never capitulate to demands for something so banal as being nice. But authenticity is too often a short hand for callous, aloof, or honest for the purpose of cruelty rather than truth-seeking. This version of authenticity is highly regarded primarily in white male writers, who range from moderately readable to exceptional, and in the occasional woman writer who is usually exceedingly beautiful and whom men have deigned to read and enjoy. Almost without exception, these writers are also white. Most everyone, except conscientious objectors, the very un-astute, and people with unshakable confidence or inherited wealth, plays the game, Gould writes, adding that these categories are almost the exclusive purview of men. I look at these categories and find nothing to envy. Of all the things to conscientiously object to, making people feel visible and valuable just doesnt rank very highly! No confidence should be unshakeable! And if you have enough inherited wealth to make un-niceness a possibility, you are not so much a writer as a tourist in a very high-risk, low-reward immersion program.
Like Gould, I have also been called upon to spend hours engaging with readers who come far too close for comfort, have been made to feel like the marrow is being sucked out of my bones in the aftermath. Women in this industry should not feel duty-bound to befriend every reader who lands in our inbox or to go the extra mile for publicists we dont know every time they ask. But I do think that writers, if they choose not to be anonymous, can and should acknowledge the labor of their colleagues who make their work possible and the readers who make their work at least potentially profitable.

Country needs to prepare  for impending global changes
The country needs to prepare for impending global changes, said Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Special Assignments, addressing a Conference on Human Capital, Food Security and Economic Development in Colombo recently.
The Minister was the Chief Guest at the event organized by the Institute of Policy Studies in collaboration with the Centre for Development Economics and the South Asia Research Network of Monash University of Australia.
Dr Amunugama took up a theme from President Obamas globally televised farewell address delivered a short while earlier and said that the country needs to be prepared for impending global changes. He said that it was a good guideline for the seminar that was being inaugurated. Existing research findings are useful but he said that we must look to the future and direct the research effort to foresee the emerging trends in world affairs and to propose feasible policy initiatives, particularly in the economic sphere, to meet these new challenges.
The possible emergence of protectionism in the West which perceives itself as having been adversely affected to some extent by globalization is a serious threat to the developing world and especially to the emerging economies of Asia.
It may be that we are in the cusp of a brand new world economic order, the Minister declared. Will the recently entered into global commitments in respect of climate change for instance survive the impending changes the minister speculated.
He requested the participants at the seminar to take a futuristic perspective in view of the possibility of big changes in the offing.
Turning to one of the topics for discussion at the conference , Gender and Women Empowerment the Minister referred to the great service rendered by Sri Lankan female migrant workers who remit their entire hard earned wages to the home country unlike richer expatriates working in developed countries.

Annona, the Aristocrat of fruits
Mark Twain called the cherimoya (Annona Cherimola) "the most delicious fruit known to men!" The Sweetsop/Sugar apple (Annona Squamosa) is called the "Aristocrat of fruits". Garden Talk spoke to Director, Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi on Annona, genus of the family, Annonaceae that contains absolutely mouthwatering fruits.
From the 166 species, Hapuarachchi elaborated at great length on 7-
 Cherimoya (Annona Cherimola)
 Pawpaw (Asimina)
 Soursop (Annona Muricata)
 Sugar Apple/ sweetsop (Annona Squamosa)
 The Atemoya is a cross of Cherimoya (Annona Cherimola) and Sweetsop/ sugar apple (Annona Squamosa)
 Ilama (Annona Diversifolia)
 Custard Apple (Annona Reticulata)
"Cherimoya (Annona Cherimola) is a tree that produces white fleshed custard like fruit that is sweet and delicious. The creamy texture of the flesh gives the fruit its secondary name, custard apple. A name it shares with Annona Reticulata. Cherimoya is a small-sized fruit with mosaic patterns on the skin surface. The fruit is also known as the "tree of ice cream," owing to its creamy consistency. The fruit is commonly used in smoothies, ice creams, pie fillings and mousse," said Hapuarachchi.
Custard Apple (Annona Reticulata) is a fruit, where the shape varies considerably from round to heart shaped and even oblong. The flavour is sweet but not as delicious as its relatives.
"Annona squamosa (Sweetsop/ Sugar Apple) is rich in medicinally and industrially important bio-active components present in all its parts. The fruit is known for its nutritional value. It is a large deciduous shrub or small tree about four to eight meters tall. Leaves are simple, oblong and elliptic. The flowers are fragrant, creamy yellow to greenish, seen solitary or in groups of up to four. The fruit is globose, yellowish green when ripe, embossed with prominent scales with soft creamy pulp. Seeds are hard, brownish black and smooth in texture," stated Hapuarachchi.
Soursop (Annona Muricata) is a tree that averages about 20 feet in height. The fruit is the largest of the annonas and can weigh more than 5 pounds.
"The fruit is considered to be one of the finest for making sherbet because of its delicious flavor. Some people describe the flavor as a blend of pineapple and mango. This tree is propagated by seed and occasionally grafted varieties are available. It is known as Katu Anoda in Sri Lanka. It is a broadleaf, flowering, evergreen tree. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is widely propagated," pointed out Hapuarachchi.
If you take the Annona Diversifolia (e lama), the flavor of this amazing fruit is unique - sweet with a rich complex flavor. You probably won't see many of these trees for one main reason. Even as great tasting as it is, the fruit has one major drawback - the fruit splits on the tree when ready to eat. "Atemoya is a tree that produces grayish red colored fruits that are sweet and delicious! Atemoya is described as hyper- productive and will set fruit quiet heavily. Leave fruit at the base of branches. Fruit growing at the base of branches will taste better and be less likely to cause limb breakage. Most nurseries that graft trees, generally graft onto Sugar Apple or Custard Apple. Grafting onto Cherimoya produces a superior tree," added Hapuarachchi. Among the Annona (spp.) male and female flowers bloom on the same tree at different stages of sexual maturity.
"Insects handle the pollination. When hand pollination is practised the pollen is moved from one flower to another by a person. Female flowers are generally most receptive early in the morning or when humidity is high."
It is commonly agreed that fruit will be larger and better shaped with complete pollination by either human or insect intervention. Cross pollination is the ideal situation for highest fruit productivity and fruit size.
"The flesh of the Annona Muricata fruit consists of an edible, white pulp, some fiber, and a core of indigestible, black seeds. The species is the only member of its genus suitable for processing and preservation. The pulp is also used to make fruit nectar, smoothies, fruit juice drinks, as well as candies, sorbets, and ice cream flavorings," she added. In Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Harar (Ethiopia), it is a common fruit, often used for dessert as the only ingredient. In Colombia and Venezuela, it is a fruit for juices, mixed with milk. In Cuba, a thick smoothie made of soursop pulp, milk and cane sugar goes by the name of champola. Ice cream and fruit bars made of soursop are also very popular. The seeds are normally left in the preparation and removed while consuming, unless a blender is used for processing.
"In Indonesia, a sweetmeat is made by boiling soursop pulp in water and adding sugar until the mixture hardens. Soursop is also a common ingredient for making fresh fruit juices that are sold by street food vendors. In the Philippines, it is called guyabano, and is eaten ripe, or used to make juices, smoothies, or ice cream. Sometimes, the leaf is used to tenderiz meat," clarified Hapuarachchi.
Health Benefits of Cherimoya
 Vitamin C:
A single, medium-sized cherimoya fruit contains 30 milligrams of Vitamin C, providing about 35% of the daily recommended intake. Vitamin C in cherimoya is required for the healing of wounds and formation of cartilage, tendons and ligaments. Consumption of one cup of cherimoya daily develops resistance against infectious agents and scavenges harmful free radicals from the body.
 Cardiovascular health:
Vitamin C in cherimoya prevents free radicals from attacking the lipids, thus promoting cardiovascular health. It reduces bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases good cholesterol (HDL) levels in the blood. This improves the blood flow in the heart, reducing the risk of heart attacks. A well-balanced sodium and potassium ratio in cherimoya regulates the heart rate and blood pressure. It also counteracts the bad influence of sodium. Fiber in cherimoya prevents the absorption of cholesterol in the gut.
 Vitamin B6:
Vitamin B6 in cherimoya is required for the proper functioning of our metabolism and immune system. It regulates GABA neuron chemical levels to help get rid of stress and depression. Vitamin B6 also protects from Parkinson's disease.
 Fiber:
One medium cherimoya provides 5 grams of dietary fiber, amounting to about 90% of the recommended amount. Fiber is essential for keeping the digestive tract healthy and lowering the blood sugar levels. It also adds bulk to the stool, relieving constipation.
 Cancer:
Cherimoya for cancer is proved to be very beneficial. It acts against cancer cells, without adversely affecting healthy cells. The leaves and stems of cherimoya contain acetogenic, which helps in the treatment of cancer. It interferes with the action of enzymes, preventing cancer development. The high amounts of fiber in cherimoya protect the mucous membrane of the colon from exposure to toxic substances by binding cancer-causing chemicals in the colon. It also contains potent antioxidants like asimicin and bullatacin, which are found to have anti-cancer and anti-helminthes properties.
 Antioxidants:
Cherimoya contains several polyphenol antioxidants, which limit damage caused to the cells by free radicals. The flesh, juice and peel, all have decent amounts of antioxidants in them.
 Maintains Health of the Skin:
Cherimoya fruit has a high content of Vitamin C, which is vital for maintaining the health of the skin. Vitamin C helps in the formation of collagen, a protein, which provides elasticity to the skin. Vitamin C also helps to combat free radicals in the body, providing healthy and flawless skin.
 Promotes Hair Growth:
Cherimoya is a highly nutritious fruit, which can benefit the hair in numerous ways. It contains hair-friendly nutrients like magnesium, zinc iron and Vitamin C, which promote hair growth.
 Treats Hair Lice and Nits:
Unripe cherimoya fruit powder can help you to get rid of hair lice. Mix the powder with water and apply it on the scalp, one hour before shampooing to treat hair lice and nits.
 Turns Hair Lustrous and Shiny:
Cherimoya seed oil is ideal for wavy and coarse hair. It hydrates the scalp to make the hair lustrous, shiny and manageable.

Hemantha Paranathanthri
He had admirable qualities
It is with a great sense of gratitude that I pen this tribute to dear friend Hemantha Paranathanthri whose untimely death was shocking and unbelievable.
He led a very good social life. On every occasion we met at a party or get together, he was with his friendly and warm smile and hospitality. At any gathering he was the chief entertainer. He was fun loving and enjoyed dancing. He enjoyed life to the fullest.
He was the most admired person in his family. Paranathanthri was a loving brother, husband, father and a father-in-law. He had admirable qualities.
A good friend of the common man, he was admired by everyone. A person of rare qualities, he did anything with dedication.
He was courageous and did not hesitate to take bold decisions whenever necessary.
That's where his success was.
He never cared about cast, creed or religion and moved among people of all walks of life without discrimination. I met him a long time ago when he came from abroad to settle down in Kandy.
From that time, we were very close and helpful to each other. It is also with a great sense of appreciation that I recall vividly how he helped me to develop my businesses.
He was a pillar of strength to the family in all his activities. We recall with happiness the beautiful memories we had with him and feel sad that he is no more with us.
Death is a common phenomenon which we bring along with our birth. But the loss of a close and friendly person, to those around him is hard to bear. His demise is mourned by all his relations and friends.
If he has still not reached the eternal bliss off Nibbana, may we meet him again in our journey of Sansara.

Eresha Nilmini
Sacrificed her life for the country
Memories are all that remain of C.C.M.P. Corporal Eresha Nilmini of the first battalion of the Sri Lanka Regular Women's Corps and the Sri Lanka Military Corps - Police.
She was the first military police woman to have died in an LTTE attack. She left her two sisters and parents forever, 22 years ago.
Born on May 2, 1974, Eresha received her education at St. Joseph's Convent, Nugegoda where she excelled in studies and sports.
She also had the privilege of being a teacher at the Christ Church Sunday school at Kotte. Eresha participated in many beauty contests. She was among the finalists at the Miss Jessy Queen of Dehiwala - Mt. Lavina and Kotte and also in the Miss Sri Lanka for Miss World contest in 1992. She was the third runner-up at the Sri Lanka Army Avurudu Kumari contest in 1995.
On completion of her studies, she sought employment and her first appointment was at a private hospital in Narahenpita as a receptionist.
Since she developed a liking to join the military police, she applied for a position and was one among the eight, who were selected out of 8,000 applicants.
As military duties called, she found herself posted to the Northern area during the LTTE war, after completing her initial period in Colombo and was in the rank of CCMP Corporal at the time.
When she was serving in Palali, Jaffna, Assistant Parish Priest Rev. Fr. Emil Joseph of the Sacred Heart Church, Kotte dreamt one night that Eresha had stepped on a claymore mine.
The priest related the dream to her parents on December 26, 1996.
On January 2, 1997, morning, a friend of her parents informed them that Eresha had met with an accident while serving near the Jaffna Campus Thirnelvely.
Her father rushed to the Army Head Quarters, Colombo only to learn that Eresha had died in a claymore mine blast.
Eresha was a lovable daughter with soft spoken and endearing qualities with never a harsh word.
An alms giving in her memory was held at the Ragama Ranaviru Sewana to disabled soldiers on January 2.

Ramani de S. Wijeyeratne
The live wire of the family
The honour of writing a few words about our late sister-in-law Ramani has fallen on me and I am glad that I received the opportunity to do so. I must begin by saying that the families of late Sherard de S. Wijeyeratne, our dad and late Peter Fernando got to know each other around 50 years ago and by that we got to know, Rita Ramani Malkanthi Fernando.
I would also like to mention that we knew Ramani even before her youngest brother Christo was born. Ramani was our childhood playmate who became our sister-in-law. As children we would play Hora-Police and Im certain that it must have been during these play sessions that our brother Turlough managed to get a hold of Ramani, who later went on to become Ramani de S. Wijeyeratne.
She diligently looked into every aspect of her family; the needs and necessities of our brother as well as their children Dinuk and Dinukshi. She was truly the live wire of the family.
I can remember during our childhood days how our families used to go on trips and how Ramani as the eldest in their family, would look after her brothers and sisters. She was a pillar of strength and her siblings would bring their problems to her and she never hesitated to help them. I am confident that Ramanis brothers and sisters namely, Rohini, Deepal, Dayamal and Christo will agree with me in saying that she played this role to near perfection until she received the call saying come home, come home.
She had humble beginnings and later together with Turlough, she worked very hard to come up in life. How tirelessly they went on to build their own house. She often encouraged our brother not to lose confidence when they encountered challenges.
She brought up her children with lots of love and care but maintained strict discipline and guided them in the right direction. She made sure that the children got the right kind of education and more importantly that they learned the right values of life. There were times she even argued with the teachers saying that they were not strict enough with her children.
Ramani encouraged her children to engage in sports and she never missed a rugby match in which Dinuk played. She was also very proud to be a part of the de S. W. family and so were we in having her as our sister-in-law.
Ramani first fell sick in 2001 when I was out of Sri Lanka at work. I can clearly recall writing to Dinuk, reminding him what his mother has done for the family and to stand by her in her hour of need. However, I must say that Dinuk, Dinukshi and our brother Turlough made many sacrifices and did everything in their capacity for the past 15 years  running from hospital to hospital, surgeon to surgeon, and even from church to church seeking divine intervention until that fateful day.
In October 2002, she was to travel to India for treatment and it coincided with my brothers 50th birthday. She really wanted to have a big party for him but was extremely disappointed that she couldnt do it.
If I remember right, she was taken to India on October 15, exactly on the day of our brothers birthday. Since I was not in Sri Lanka, I thought I must return and see Ramani before she was taken to India. I flew that morning and together with my wife, we went to see Ramani. When we went to her place, some of her cousins were there and as soon as Ramani saw me she immediately said to them that I have come all the way for my brothers 50th birthday and that she had spoiled the show.
I in turn, had to tell her that I really came to see her and my brothers birthday can be celebrated later when she returns after her treatment. This is one of the many examples of how selfless she was. She was not worried about her sickness and what was in store for her, but was more concerned about having spoilt her husbands 50th birthday celebrations.
Ramani was known for many things and one was her great faith. She was a devoted Catholic who never missed Mass. Just recently we were talking about all the church services she would attend every week without fail: Sunday Mass, Tuesdays at St. Anthonys, Wednesdays at All Saints, Thursdays at Fatima Church and Fridays at Infant Jesus. I wonder whether she was able to do all this during the latter stages of her illness, but nothing usually stopped her from carrying out her spiritual activities. She always believed in what a friend we have in Jesus and it was with that belief that she was able to fight her sickness for such a long period.
After fulfilling most of her obligations she just simply said, have thine own way Lord, have thine own way.
Ramani was also well known for her generosity and passion for engaging in charitable deeds. She did not forget her humble beginnings and helped many people from her hometown in Ja-ela. We witnessed so many people coming in vans and buses for her funeral all the way from Ja-ela to pay their respects. Dinukshi mentioned that there were many people whom she did not know who walked up to her and told her how Ramani had helped them financially to pay their childrens school fees, buy their school books and uniforms and so on. Her children, Dinuk and Dinukshi were surprised at how she had managed to do all this without their knowledge but perhaps it was this love for helping people in need that the Lord above us must have been waiting and watching [her].
We will continue to do what you did and we will also make sure that you are remembered in each of these sessions until someday we shall meet on that beautiful shore.
Eternal rest grant unto her O Lord and let perpetual light shine upon her. May she rest in peace.

Uruguay international Suarez scored his 101st goal for Barcelona by stroking in Andre Gomes cutback in the 15th minute as the Portuguese midfielder recorded his first assist for the club since his 35-million-euro move from Valencia last summer.
Barca coach Luis Enrique had rotated his side after Wednesdays 3-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao in the Kings Cup, resting Neymar, Gerard Pique, captain Andres Iniesta and Sergi Roberto but still watched his side dominate Las Palmas.
Messi scored for the seventh consecutive competitive game by mopping up a loose ball on the rebound in the 52nd minute after Rafinhas shot was only parried by goalkeeper Javi Varas, while Suarez curled in a pass from Rafinha to get his second and Barcas third in the 57th.
Suarez spurned the chance to seal a hat-trick a minute later but Arda Turan mopped up after Varas had saved to score the fourth, while out-of-favour right back Aleix Vidal netted his first goal for the club in the 80th minute. Barcelona are second in the standings, two points behind Real Madrid, who have played two games fewer and face third placed Sevilla on Sunday. Atletico Madrid can consolidate their hold on fourth spot when they host Real Betis later on Saturday.

Bike rider Sunderland wins Dakar Rally in British first
BOLIVIA, Saturday: Motorcycle rider Sam Sunderland became the first Briton to win the Dakar Rally in any category on Saturday while French veteran Stephane Peterhansel won the car crown for his 13th career title.
Dubai-based Sunderland, on a KTM, beat Austrian team mate Matthias Walkner by 32 minutes after the final 64km competitive stage in Rio Cuarto, Argentina.
He then rode 700km to the official finish in Buenos Aires, where he stood on top of the podium.
Unbelievable. When I crossed the line I felt all the emotion hit me. The weight on my shoulders of the race over the last week, leading the rally has been really heavy, said Sunderland.
It's the first Dakar I've ever finished and to finish first is an incredible feeling. I'm really lost for words.
It's incredible to be the first Englishman. Hopefully we can create some English interest now, because so far they've not been reporting much, but I hope we can change that, he added.
Last year's motorcycle winner, Toby Price of Australia, retired with a broken leg on the fourth stage. Sunderland had pulled out with mechanical problems in his two previous attempts in 2012 and 2014.
Defending champion Peterhansel, who has won the Dakar six times on bikes and now seven times in cars, beat Peugeot team mate and compatriot Sebastien Loeb by five minutes.
Cyril Despres completed a one-two-three for the manufacturer.
There were, in all, seven or eight drivers with a shot at victory. Halfway through the race there were only four left, and by the final week it was just Sebastien and me, said Peterhansel.
Yesterday, it was decided by a flat tyre, and that was probably the turning point in this Dakar, added the champion, who thanked Peugeot for letting their drivers race without team orders.
Loeb, a nine times world rally champion, indicated he would be back for more.
I don't think I'm going to race in as many editions of the Dakar as Peterhansel, but my aim is to win it someday: we'll have to keep on trying. he said.
Russian Sergey Karyakin won the quad bikes category and compatriot Eduard Nikolaev the trucks title with Kamaz.
The Dakar Rally began in 1978 as a race from Paris across the Sahara to the Senegalese capital but switched to South America in 2009 for security reasons.
This year's race started in Paraguay and also went through Bolivia.

## Title: Call for Justice, accountability and reconciliation

Call for Justice, accountability and reconciliation
The Consultation Task Force was formally appointed in February 2016, and began receiving submissions in April 2016 on the proposed mechanisms outlined in Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1, in which the government promised to deliver justice, accountability, and reconciliation in the aftermath of Sri Lanka's long civil war.
The piece today looks at views of persons who went before the task force. The Report is in two Volumes with a Summary edition with observations on four mechanisms-Offices on Missing Persons, Office of Reparations, Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non Recurrence Commissions and a Judicial Mechanism comprising of a Special Court and Office of a Special Counsel.
The Report recommends - continuous communication on transitional justice. Many had expressed bitterness, anger and frustration over another initiative with others warning it could deepen wounds, open new ones and exacerbate ethnic and religious tensions.
International involvement was rejected by security forces representation and support for current initiatives and restorative as opposed to retributive justice with involvement of spiritual leaders. They prioritized reconciliation and reparations to prevent non recurrence, constitutional reform and information sharing with their personnel to dispel doubts and miscommunication.
Lack of solidarity and support
The Army representative had bemoaned the lack of solidarity and support for a task they accomplished under difficult circumstances. Support for truth seeking, prosecution if guilt is identified, since their view was no criminal activity had taken place, insisting no deliberate targeting of civilians with zero civilian casualty policy whilst repudiating sexual violence as a weapon of war. Echoed by the Air Force adding no illegal weapons were used.
The presence of impunity was identified as a key impediment to reconciliation and an end to it preceding establishment of the mechanisms.
Pivotal needs
Political and constitutional settlement was another pivotal identified need.
Restorative psycho-social support for civilians and combatants across the ethnic divide.
Call for balanced youth and gender representation. Address inter ethnic land disputes.
Only a very few noted the need for a separate office of reparation.
Calls for interim reparation to meet immediate needs of employment for vulnerable members of families of the killed or disappeared and one- off reparation in kind in the form of educational scholarships for their children.
Calls for spaces for memorialistaion, official acknowledgement and apologies.
Restoration of burial plots to family members. Reparation connected to truth and justice. Documenting and archiving history.
Establishing the truth
A majority of submission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and non recurrence had sought the establishing of truth, determine root causes, holding perpetrators to account, build multiple narratives of history, enable victims to seek redress for violations and abuses. Build on existing work, implement recommendations and follow through with concrete actions.
Broad time frame spanning insurrections of the South and The North and East with greater inclusion of affected individuals. A call to make public reports received in all three languages.
The prosecutorial policy, treatment of emplematic cases and fate of emaling cases was not sufficiently addressed. Branches of the courts in provinces allowed to access in the language of their choice.Specific victim friendly procedures for treatment of victims and witnesses. Establishment of a Minority Rights Commission.
Observations
On the whole the coverage is balanced. What would have added value is deeper conversations with those who fought the war on the ground for the Government, families of the MIA and the disabled of the armed forces. Narratives largely missing in processes to-date. Similarly from Sri Lankans currently overseas.
The reports correctly call for inclusion of coverage of past commissions which straddle events in the North and South due insurrections and corresponding quelling of the dissenters. Related and valuable is the call to implement accompanying recommendations from the past which automatically addresses the issue of impunity the result of ignoring recommendations of past commissions.
Reconciling narratives before past Presidential Commissions including more recently the LLRC and the Paranagama Commissions and those made to the UN are also important. One of which remains away from public scrutiny. i.e. submissions and information gathered by the Darusman advisory committee to the then UNSG.
We already have a long established policy and practice of reparation since 1983 with specific criteria.
An invaluable set of recommendation which translates into a policy of affirmative action responding to the call for one off reparation was made in the interim report to the current President by the Paranagama Commission and accepted. It addresses in detail Trauma Counseling, dealing with the loss of breadwinner in the family, options for Income Generation access to Educational Needs, Health and Housing needs, Issues related to Property Rights, Lack/Loss of Documents due to war, Disability, Women Headed Households, Lost children and children with special needs and those abusing substances.
Criminal justice system
Unfortunately the members of past commissions, those who assisted them, the present members of the Consultation Task Force, commentators including this writer with two other who authored the Third Narrative have been branded as colluders, agents, friends of various political leaders or rent seekers at different times of our history. This game of discrediting at times of thankless public service is a national past time.
In the process, a very valuable work is thrown aside haphazardly. Same is true of analytical work including on law produced at great expense and time cast aside depending on the flavor of the period, replicated with Policy initiatives.
The Report notes a lack of clarity in prosecutorial policy which will generate debate given current practices in our criminal justice system complicated by the fact past commissions would have adopted varying methods to arrive at conclusions on validity of complaints and degree of proof in determining evidence was sufficient to warrant prosecution as they have done in their reports.
The UN CoI had its own criteria in making pronouncements on Sri Lanka before the Human Rights Council.
The Armed forces have had their own Boards of Inquiry. Some cases have already been heard before our Courts. A very vexed set of issues.

Century of excellence
Visakha who lived in the times of the Buddha, is known to be a person of charm and independent spirit. She was the first female lay disciple of the Buddha and the chief female lay benefactor of the Sangha.
Jeremias Dias
She was well respected for her wisdom, generosity and her managerial skills. She was only seven years old when she encountered the Enlightened One and her wisdom surpassed her tender age as she attained the first stage of sainthood upon hearing the word of the Dhamma. It is this personality in mind that a school established on January 16, 1917 at the premises known as The Firs in Turret Road, Colombo was renamed as Visakha Vidyalaya and re-established at Vajira Road, 10 years later. Today, the school marks its Centenary Anniversary, recalling the virtues of its namesake.
Emulating Visakha of the Buddhas times, young Visakhians are taught the skills as well as virtues, building a much needed female workforce for the country. With the excellent education opportunities at Visakha Vidyalaya, students are taught to be cleansed through wisdom, being true to the motto of the school  Pannaya Parisujjhati.
Principal Sandamali Aviruppola
Proudly declaring 100 years of providing a sound education and opportunities to thousands of girls to pursue extra-curricular activities, Visakha Vidyalaya has remained the most sought-after school for girls in the country for many years, and as the school which requires the highest scores for entry through the Grade 5 Scholarship examination. Visakha Vidyalaya also takes pride in having the highest number of achievers and the highest scorers at the GCE Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations, especially in the Bio-Science stream with the largest number of girls entering medical faculties. Apart from the traditional careers, Visakhians are holding top positions and performing well in other non-traditional professions in various sectors, becoming visionaries in their own fields both here and abroad.
Since 2010 (except for one year), we had the islands first in Ordinary Level examinations. We also have the highest number of 9 As. According to the Performance Index of the Examinations Department, out of the schools that conduct classes from Grade 1 to Grade 13, Visakha is the first in Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations. Our students have performed well in all fields especially in the Maths and Science streams, Visakha Vidyalaya Principal Sandamali Aviruppola told the Daily News.
Visakha thus has reason to celebrate this 100th momentous milestone in style. The first major fund-raiser in the exciting line-up of events for the year is the Visakha Centenary Walk 2017, organised by the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls Association jointly with the School Development Committee. The Walk will be held on February 11 starting from the school premises at 7.30 am. It will proceed along Vajira Road, Galle Road; turn to Bauddhaloka Mawatha at the Bambalapitiya Junction and to Havelock Road at Thunmualla and back to school via Vajira Road. On return to the school, a mini- carnival will be held at the school premises with food and beverages as well as DJ music to keep the crowd toe-tapping until 1 pm. The Organizing Committee has provided a valuable opportunity for present and past Visakhians to reunite and celebrate their schools 100-year journey. The proceeds of the Walk will be exclusively channeled towards the construction of the new building for the primary school. The proposed three-storey building will enable Grade 3 and 4 classes - currently located within the senior school - to be housed along with the rest of the primary classes, bringing the primary school to one single location. This is one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls Association as a centennial gift to their Alma Mater.
Visakha Walk 2013
Apart from the Visakha Centenary Walk 2017, the first programme that marks the schools 100th birthday is the Bodhi Pooja on January 16, which is officially the schools date of birth. On January 21, an alms giving for 100 Bhikkunis will be held at the school premises, in keeping with the schools Buddhist traditions. A special Commemorative Coin will be launched at a ceremony on January 23. An Educational Exhibition is scheduled on March 30, 31 and April 1. Apart from the Visakha Centenary Walk 2017, the second major fund-raiser for the year will be the Visakha Carnival scheduled for April 7 and 8, which is a grander version of the traditional Avurudu Pola that takes place at the school premises annually. A dinner banquet will be held on June 24 while a campfire will be held for past and present girl guides in August. The Visakha Geetha Natakaya will be held in October.
The gamut of opportunities provided for girls with regard to education as well as extra-curricular activities at Visakha Vidyalaya is highly admirable. The performance of students in all fields by reaping the benefits that Visakha provides is even more commendable.
A girl child is different from a boy child, says Principal Aviruppola. But we as a society must ensure that all should be given equal treatment, she states.
The progress of the school over the years and the prestige it enjoys today as an outstanding seat of learning in the country is indeed a fitting tribute to the founder, the farsighted and philanthropic Jeremias Dias who envisioned the need to educate girls in the Buddhist way of life through this institution. Visakha continues to flourish at the forefront of girls education in Sri Lanka, 100 years on.

Changes cannot be made without referendum: TNA
The TNA yesterday reiterated its position that it would not settle for any Constitutional Amendment that does not require a referendum, but for a new Constitution which ushers in fundamental changes including the abolition of executive Presidency.
TNA Spokesman MP M.A. Sumanthiran, reminding that the mandate President Maithripala Sirisena received from the people was to make significant changes to the Constitution, pointed out those changes could not be made without a referendum.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the President and the Prime Minister should act according to the mandate people have given not withstanding opposition from the forces that lost out and were rejected by the people.
These lost out forces cannot speak to change the mandate that the people gave to the President just because they are in the Cabinet now. They were people who supported former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the previous presidential polls and opposed Common Candidate Sirisena. They must change and not try to change the President against the peoples will, he said.
He said fundamental changes like the abolition of the Executive Presidency was the first promise of Common Candidate Sirisena, adding that these could not be accomplished by tinkering the existing Constitution. Those who articulate the position that no referendum should be held are also saying that it will be lost. Pushing ahead changes without a referendum knowing that people would not approve them would be to fool the people. We do not want anything done behind the back of our people. We want the people to approve any significant change that the Constitution goes through, he said.

Chelsea, Spurs and Arsenal enjoy big wins
LONDON, Saturday: Chelsea made light of striker Diego Costa's absence to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points on Saturday with a 3-0 win at champions Leicester City.
After a Harry Kane-inspired Tottenham Hotspur and a ruthless Arsenal side kept up the pressure at the top with 4-0 victories, Chelsea found an unlikely hero in wing back Marcos Alonso, who scored their first two goals at the King Power Stadium.
All the pre-match ballyhoo had been about Costa, the league's leading marksman, having been dropped from Antonio Conte's squad amid reports of a fall-out over his fitness.
Before the game, though, Chelsea released quotes from Conte on their official Twitter site saying that Costa had not trained since Tuesday because of a pain in his back.
We played without Diego against Bournemouth and we have had time to prepare for this. We've prepared very well, Conte said.
That preparation was shown swiftly as Spaniard Alonso struck early in both halves and Pedro completed a rout of the feeble champions as Chelsea moved to 52 points, seven clear of Spurs.
Liverpool, on 44 with third-placed Arsenal, could regain second spot and cut the gap at the top back to five points if they win at Manchester United, who are fifth, on Sunday.
Tottenham striker Kane had a special day with a brilliant hat-trick in the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion that saw Mauricio Pochettino's ever-improving contenders move into second with a seventh straight win in all competitions.
It was Kane's first match since he became a father last Sunday. It's amazing. The week has been a whirlwind having a little daughter - to finish it off like this is the best way possible, he said, after taking his season's tally to 13 league goals.
Arsenal went up to third on goal difference after Olivier Giroud struck his fifth goal in as many games to set them on the way to a 4-0 trouncing of Swansea City, who are now bottom.
Between Giroud's opener and Alexis Sanchez's 73rd minute effort, Paul Clement, in his first league game in charge of the Swans, also had to watch miserably as Jack Cork and Kyle Naughton deflected Alex Iwobi shots past their own keeper.
Hull City recovered to beat Bournemouth 3-1 with a double from Abel Hernandez giving new manager Marco Silva the ideal league debut as they leapt from last place above Swansea and Sunderland, who were beaten 3-1 at home by Stoke City.
Peter Crouch scored his 99th league goal for the Potters - a header, naturally - while Marko Arnautovic netted twice, but the goal of the day came from West Ham's Andy Carroll who struck an astonishing mid-air volley in a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace.
It's been a while in the making. I've been trying for a couple of years. It's got to be the best goal I've scored, the striker, who has suffered from a string of injuries, said.
Joey Barton made a remarkable return for his old club Burnley, coming on as a substitute and scoring with a free-kick in the 1-0 win over Southampton.
It was an incredible thing for him to bring me back with the circus that goes on around me, said Barton, paying tribute to Burnley boss Sean Dyche, who signed the midfielder after his stormy spell with Scottish club Rangers.
It was an emotional afternoon at Vicarage Road as Watford fans paid a lovely tribute to Graham Taylor, the former England manager who died on Thursday, before facing Middlesbrough.
At the club he took from the old fourth division into the top flight, the chant of One Graham Taylor rang around the ground, fans in the stand named after him held up cards that spelt out Love G.T and others were reduced to tears.
However, after a long round of applause for their old manager, the Hornets could not deliver the result the supporters craved as they missed chances and were held to a 0-0 draw.

Corals in Crisis
The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society Monthly Lecture January 2017 will be held under the title Corals in Crisis: Increasing Resilience to Climate Change on January 19 at 6pm at the Cinema Lounge, BMICH. The public lecture is open to all members and non-members free of charge. The lecture will be delivered by Nishan Perera, a marine biologist and underwater photographer with an interest in coral reef ecology, fisheries and marine protected area management.
Nishan Perera
Coral reefs are one of the most biologically diverse and environmentally sensitive ecosystems but have been severely degraded by human activities such as overfishing, destructive fishing methods, coastal development and pollution. Climate change and rising sea temperatures are now posing a significant threat to coral reefs, compounding existing pressures caused by anthropogenic influences. Recent coral bleaching events caused by elevated sea temperatures have resulted in unprecedented coral mortality across the world.
Managing such sensitive ecosystems requires a two pronged strategy that reduces direct human impacts while increasing resilience and recovery potential of coral reefs and associated species.
Identifying reef habitats and species that are more tolerant of such stresses is therefore important in conserving overall coral reef diversity and biomass. Similarly, recovery after mass mortality events has been patchy and resulted in phase shifts in species composition. Understanding such dynamics as well as environmental and physical variables affecting reef resilience and incorporating resilience parameters into adaptive management strategies is now considered an important aspect of Marine Protected Area management.
Coral reef and Marine Protected Area management in Sri Lanka continues to focus on traditional approaches. Management is often reactive and static rather than being predictive and adaptive. Key aspects of reef resilience, its importance in management strategies, and the use of a more science based management approach will be discussed in this presentation.
Nishan Perera perera is a co-founder of Blue Resources Trust and has previously worked with international conservation agencies in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia and Australia. His current research includes field studies on coral reef resilience, reef fish distribution and sustainable small-scale fisheries.
He is the author of several scientific papers and a coffee table book on the coral reefs of Sri Lanka. He has also contributed articles and images to the Serendib, Explore Sri Lanka, Life Times Magazine, African Diver, Sport Diving Australia and Magazyn Nurkowanie Poland.

Country has two options, prosperity or destruction: PM
The country is now between two alternative options. One is to unite and follow the concept of the consensus government of good governance and work united until 2020 to achieve the prosperity of the country, and the other is to enter into old politics of discord and sabotage the whole mission and end up in disasters as a nation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
He was addressing the concluding ceremony at Siridhamma Maha Vidyalaya of Nilamehevara Janapathy Janatha Sewaya national programme on Saturday. The programme was initiated under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
We have to decide whether we continue with the same made-up development projects that the media displays or to engage in finding true solutions to the country problems and assure a sustainable future for the people. If we choose the second option, our country will prosper. Peoples incomes will be raised. Education will be promoted. Good jobs will be created. We can step up to the world without fear, he said.
If we follow the other way, he said, countrys debt burden will be amplified. We will fall into further trouble. We will have no good future. Poverty will be intensified. So we have to select one of the two paths. We have to face severe challenges as a nation. If we become united, we can march forward with confidence.
When I arrived, I saw members of the two parties were present and collectively working towards one goal. I was delighted to see the unity and cooperation among them. They were prospective rival candidates at the forth coming Local Government, and Provincial Council elections.
They have no tug of war with their collective effort. In the past, we did not see such unity among politicians with different visions. Dividends of this harmony go to the public.
We have displayed that political accord of our two parties with the start of the third year of sustainable development of consensus government, the Prime Minister said.
A new industry at Koggala FTZ was established and a new housing scheme in Hambantota was initiated. Last week the work on Ruhunu Economic Zone commenced. Foreign investment of Rs. 5000 million will be used for the economic zone.
The Galle district would be immensely benefited with it. Galle is between two zones where rapid industrialisation is taking place. On one side of it is the Colombo-Gampaha and Kaatunaayake industrial zone and on the other, is the Ruhunu Economic Zone. Hence Galle has a potential of emerging as a highly developed region, the Prime Minister said.
We have selected one area of Galle for tourism promotion and a specific region had allocated for ICT development. We have a separate area as well for commercial housing. We will further develop the Koggala Free Trade Zone. We are going to start new industries at Charly Mount estate, he said.
The Prime Minister said more lands for cinnamon cultivation will be allocated and more higher educational institutions will be established in Galle.
Minister Vajira is efficient and is supported by a clever Chief Minister. Minister Vajira with others support can develop Galle. We will make it the South Asian chief tourist destination, the Prime Minister said.

Does television have a future
Television has changed. With a dizzying array of entertainment choices on digital streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and HBO Go, consumers are facing countless hours of addictive, high-quality programming. Addiction is the key here, as a recent and much debated study by the University of Texas suggests. The researchers conducted a survey on 1829 year olds on how often they binge-watched TV, and how often they had feelings of loneliness, depression and self-regulation deficiency. The findings showed addictive behaviour: those who lacked the ability to control themselves were more likely to binge-watch. Its not the first time excessive TV watching has been linked to health problems. Scientific studies have shown that prolonged television viewing is linked to the increase of obesity, diabetes, social isolation and a suffering sex life. And with the newest trend of speed watching (streaming content at accelerated speed, sometimes two times as fast as normal) to cope with the huge amount of serialized content, we need to ask ourselves: which form of television do we actually want Why is this kind of entertainment so powerful And is this the end of old television as we know it
Digital ecosystems
The answer lies in the power and logics of digital ecosystems. Companies such as Netflix and Amazon have created powerful networks, which connect digital businesses, digital consumers and digital devices, and are ultimately changing the way we work and live.
These ecosystems know who we are, what we like, what we buy, and what our friends think about it. And we are happy to provide them with all the data they need by posting, buying, rating, consuming and commenting online.
Platforms such as Netflix and Amazon are designed to be immersive and to create profiles of their users based on their tastes, trends and social fragmentation. They operate by the logics of mass media. There is an argument that media in the twentieth century gained power by creating the discourse that guides the organization of the public sphere. Television as a mass medium is operating in a complex set of interacting structures, as actors in different social functional systems define it and adapt to it at the same time. What we interpret as television is therefore changing all the time. Currently the linguistic and visual vocabulary of television is influenced by the transition to media convergence: were streaming, downloading and watching content online  and we still call it television.
Carefully planned
At the same time, Netflixs premium content is actually very limited, but carefully planned and researched to maximize its appeal to a targeted section of the audience, exemplified in the recent relaunch of Gilmore Girls (a popular and missed TV show, with a strong fanbase) and the science fiction show Stranger Things (which exploits nostalgia for the 1980s among todays 3040 year olds, who grew up with films such as E.T., The Goonies and Stand by me). All of those are based on data and preferences provided by its users through ratings, searches and algorithms. The phrase You might also like . . .  at the end of an episode is more than just a recommendation; its a way to collect data from the audience.
In other words: Netflix knows what their users want  and what they will want  long before theyll actually produce it. Amazon even offers its customers pilot episodes for every planned show, greenlighting whatever pilots get the best ratings.
These are clever modes of audience research, and we dont even notice them. At the same time, streaming platforms feed our desire for more. Netflix gives you exactly twenty seconds between episodes to decide, if youd rather do anything else. If you refuse to make a decision, the platform will do it for you: it not only plays the next episode after twenty seconds, it also skips the intro to resume the narrative world without further interruption. You might not even realize that youre watching a new episode.
Recently there has been much talk about the filter bubble in relation to fake news on Facebook, whereby we receive news only from feeds that reinforce pre-existing beliefs. The same filter bubbles that may pose dangers for pluralistic thinking on social media also exist in relation to television streaming platforms. Given that both Facebook and Netflix wield great influence over the media that we consume, helping to shape our world views and basic assumptions about culture, they ought also to offer content that, in a broad sense, benefits society; but of course in reality they can offer anything they like. Audiences need to be more proactive. By only watching personalized entertainment, audiences currently see only what they want. They no longer need to tune in at a specific time or even stumble across unexpected content, which might challenge them. This is the classic definition of a filter bubble. Unlike news filter bubbles, the risk is not that users will form false beliefs about politics and current affairs, but that their sense of the cultural landscape will become distorted.
This leads us to the role of old television. Digital streaming platforms wont replace television. Its still one of the most significant cultural industries in terms of time spent and revenue earned. According to a survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans spend about two hours and 49 minutes per day watching TV. However, digital platforms are supplementing older forms of television, as often happens when new media technologies are introduced and disseminated. The same happened with printed books and e-books; radio and podcasts; analogue recordings of music and streaming services such as Spotify. New media technologies have rarely completely replaced their predecessors.
Primary mission
Traditional television should remember its primary mission, and certainly should not try to compete with ecosystems primarily focused on entertainment content. European countries, in particular, have a long tradition of a mixed mandate system, in which state-supported public broadcasters compete with the commercial sector. You can find prime examples in Germany, France, Austria and especially in the UK with the BBC. Its purpose is to serve the public interest by promoting education and learning, stimulating creativity and sustaining civil society. And at the same time it competes with commercial offers such as ITV or Sky. The BBC provides the model of public broadcasting that offers the biggest opportunities for old television to reinvent itself by contributing to national and transnational identities, giving attention to minorities and refusing commercial objectives. ARTE, the public Franco-German TV network, provides another example. Its clearly a channel with a European identity, promoting arts and culture programming. Its viewers are able to see high-quality documentaries, political debates and classic films. At the same time the network is able to experiment with new technologies such as Virtual Reality productions. Television has the chance to speak to and engage its audiences in a way that streaming platforms dont. With the additional benefit of broadcasting live events such as sports and political debates, television can reflect our work-life balance and help to structure our daily lives.
The way we live has changed in the past ten years and terms such as prime time rarely suit the media consumption habits of a new generation. But structures, schedules and programming should be able to adapt to new consumption forms. This is the only chance television has to compete with the filter bubbles of digital entertainment.
