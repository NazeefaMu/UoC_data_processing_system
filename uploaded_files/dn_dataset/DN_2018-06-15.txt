Ever glowing life
Juliet Coombe discovers a heavenly solution to wellness in the heart of Colombo city and feels inner calm after a two and a half hour ever glow experience that puts the sparkle back into her life
Leaving the noise and smells of Colombo 7 behind I take the Jetwing Colombo 7 lift at Ward Place to the second floor, where I enter into an oasis of tranquillity and wonderful smells of cinnamon and spices.
The atmosphere of the Frangipani SPA is such that I feel completely at ease as I fill out my health form and wait with some excitement for my series of treatments from head to all over body massage. The iced flannel that is brought is an absolute lifesaver after the blistering heat of the Sri Lankan hot sun. The Frangipani SPA is like a little sanctuary, an oasis away from the extreme weather changes from torrential rain to humid hot sun for travellers, over worked business people and stressed out mums to just treat themselves to an experience that will reboot even the weariest person. It is all about taking a quiet moment out of ones busy life to put the ever glow back into your lifestyle both on the inside and the outside explains Samantha the highly experienced therapist who clearly loves her job.
I was wrapped in a crisp white towel and this was the beginning of the idyllic experience as I was then treated with special oils that suited my skin type, which were soothing, cool, and empowering without being overbearingly strong in smell. I learn the word massage comes from the Arabic massa meaning to touch, feel or handle and that in 700 BC, Bian Que, the earliest known Chinese physician, used massage in medical practise to release stress. Touch is vital in all our lives as it stimulates the release of endorphins (the bodys natural pain killers) and there are approximately five million touch receptors in our skin-3000 in each fingertip alone and that a 60-minute massage is about the same as 7-8 hours sleep to your body.
The ever glow experience started with a head massage, which was an amazing re-boot mixture for the hair of egg, olive oil and avocado oil. Different skin explains my therapist working in the mixture so my hair would glow again requires different oils and this is created for dry hair from too much sun shine which damages the hair so it breaks at the end. The head massage pressure was strong and used pressure points to help the herbs to absorb and makes the hair have a youthful glow with vibrancy one only sees at fashion shows.
The next part of the experience was a facial and Samantha mixed different herbs again as in my case she said, your skin is a combination skin and so I have used a cleanser of tomato juice, one lime drop, aloe vera and pure bee honey. Aloe Vera face massage and the pack to take out the impurities of the skin and dirt required a milk rice heated fermentation with herbs to warm up the skin and make it youthful by removing all the dead skin, which in turn brings an outer glow in process. After this was fermentation was gently moved around the face, a pack with turmeric, oats and curd be placed on my face for twenty minutes. During this time my shoulders were worked on and I was asked to pick between the salt scrub, which detoxes the whole body or the herbs red with the ancient beauty treatment of white sandalwood. I went with the second option, as it is great for re-conditioning the skin and body polishing. After this all over scrub I was told it was best to take a cold shower with only water no soap as that remove all the good work of the herbal infusions and use only the herbal conditioner on the hair as many conditioners strip the goodness further out of the hair and do not really help re-build it beyond the surface level.
After showering moisturiser was put on to re-build my skins ph- balance and the herbal moisturising cream with aloe Vera smelt so good I fell into a deep sleep, as Samantha found the pressure points of my feet to help clear all the internal organs of toxins. She moved from feet to upper body and finally the neck area to release me of the stress of carrying too much camera equipment around for my job.
On finishing this wonderful experience she offered me a delicious ginger tea and explained that it is important to try to do this every two weeks, and this is the secret to a healthy long life with an ever glow in your face. Many people who are about to get married come for the seven day bridal packages with her, which includes yoga and many secret treatments that will make the entire body glow on that special day. So go on treat yourself to an ever glow experience that will re-energise even the most burnt out person. Ask for Samantha De Silva the main therapist at the Jetwing Colombo 7 SPA as she has over 12 years experience in these treatments, including working in India in Kerala and a passion for the wellness programmes that is infectious.
As I sip my ginger tea Samantha explains I love sending people away healthy with their energy fully recharged. Showing me a mirror she said you are glowing with a very relaxed look in your eyes, and sure enough my skin was vibrant all over and the twinkle youthful look was unmistakable. It also explained the timeless beauty of the hotels General Manager, Rookamanie Fernando, who is a pioneer in getting all of us to get our work, life balance right. Rookamanie as past of her wellness mission has introduced a Recharge Sunday experience at Jetwing Colombo 7 to encourage people with a sample one hour SPA treatment to make this part of their weekly routine. It also includes early morning yoga, a healthy breakfast, and a chance to feel on top of the world again while enjoying the pool that gives one a birds eye view of Colombo.

Garfield turns 40 !
Jim Davis revealshow the lasagne-loving star was born
Who hates Mondays, loves lasagne, has no filter and is orange all over Im talking about another creature, one that added laughter, value and insight to most of our livesQ: You guessed it, it's Garfield. The cat that said what we were all thinking, and he turns forty in the coming week. I had my first brush with Garfield at age 8 or so, the little strip would come in a supplement of a national daily, and it would be the only part of the newspaper I read for the next six years. Id cut out the comic strips and paste them in my scrapbook; Garfield was snarky, honest, fat, always hungry and little lazier than acceptable. He was my spirit animal and in many ways still is. The strip that started out in 1978, now holds the Guinness World Record for the most widely syndicated comic strip, with over 200 million people reading it every day. To add to this, Garfield has dozens of record-breaking best-selling books, award-winning animated television series, movies and over 400 licensed products ranging from toys, games, backpacks, and costumes to bedding, credit cards, diapers et al. Garfield is the brain child of famed cartoonist Jim Davis, who came up with the idea when he was an assistant on a comic strip called Tumbleweeds. Before Garfield, who shot to be an instant success, Jim was working on another strip called Gnorm Gnat which was scrapped before it could take off. But like they say, whatever happens, happens for the best. We had the honour of speaking to the 75-year-old legend to get an insight into what went into creating the most iconic cat character that continues to resonate with all ages, ethnicities, genders and races through the years.Q: When did you know you wanted to be a cartoonist Theres an old joke in cartoonists circles  it helps to have been dropped on your head as a baby. But honestly, I knew I wanted to be a cartoonist after I made my mom laugh with one of my drawings.Q: Are you more Garfield or Jon Im more Jon. Im a daydreamer, easy-going, and some would say wishy-washy. But, like Garfield, I do love lasagne, coffee, and cat naps. Im also an optimist and I love Mondays  not very Garfield-like.Q: What is the most memorable story about working on Garfield This was recent and it came out of the blue. In March 2017, we started getting word that there was an entire debate about Garfields gender that was heating up the Internet, and in particular on Wikipedia. Someone started an editing war on Garfields Wikipedia page  over a 60-hour period Garfields gender vacillated back and forth from male to not male. Wikipedia had to put the page on lockdown to stop the editing war. Then it spilled over onto other social networks and raged on over a quote Id made years ago when I said Garfield is very universal. By virtue of being a cat, hes not really male or female or any particular race or nationality, young or old. The Washington Post finally called me for comment to stop the debate  and I did. I said, Garfield is a male. He has a girlfriend, Arlene.Q: Did you expect it to become so successful and keep going for over 40 years You know the old saying, "timing is everything" When Garfield was introduced in 1978, there was a pent-up demand for anything to do with cats -- the New York Times even referred to the late 70s-early 80s as a "Cat Culture" and a cat was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Garfield happened to be there at exactly the right time. It was also the dawning of the "me generation" and Garfield was the perfect spokescat. He defended his right to be fat and lazy, and he didn't feel guilty about anything. He said and did the things most humans would love to say or do if we had the courage.Q: Do you still draw the comics Are you still part of the ideation Yes to both the drawing and the ideation, though I confess I have a couple of assistants who help me with both. I still consider the comic strip to be the most important thing I do so Ill never let go of that part of the job. But, admittedly, the demands of running the licensing company and working on other projects like TV and movies can be a bit much at times. It helps to have people to bounce ideas off of.Q: You have had a long and successful career, is there any particular achievement that you are proud of It meant a lot to me to be recognized by my fellow cartoonists. I won the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the year from the National Cartoonists Society. TNN

Green light for cricket board elections
The Court of Appeal yesterday decided to vacate its Interim Order dated May 31, 2018 staying the holding of the election that was scheduled to be held on last May 31 to elect the office bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).

All parties to the petition agreed to call for fresh nominations to conduct an election under the prevailing laws to elect the office bearers of SLC.
Former SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga had filed this writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking a writ order preventing SLC, its office bearers from permitting Thilanga Sumathipala to hold the post of SLC President in any manner whatsoever after the SLC election scheduled to be held on May 31 this year.
All parties including former SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga agreed to annul the validity of nominations called for the election of May 31. They also agreed to call for a fresh election. The fresh election will be conducted in accordance with the Sports Laws.
The calling of nominations would be opened enabling any party to raise objections regarding the nomination of the candidates. The authority conducting election must provide sufficient time to raise objections.

However, Romesh de Silva PC appearing for the petitioner informed court that he is challenging the eligibility of Thilanga Sumathipala to contest the election and thereby the petitioner would proceed with the petition.

Harm not the harmless
We have learnt that Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister has instructed the Department of Wildlife to capture and relocate two wild elephants living in Sinharaja to Horowpothana elephant holding ground without any scientific assessment made whether these wet zone elephants can survive in that harsh dry zone conditions.
According to the eminent conservationist and Researchers of the calibre of Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando and Jagath Gunawardana, the decision was not based on any scientific evidence or with the welfare of the elephants in mind. This unscientific, non-consultative decision was made as a reaction to a death of a villager in Pothupitiya, Ratnapura due to an elephant attack.
We appeal to President Maithripala Sirisena to stop this single handed decision considering the following.
* Sinharaja is a UNESCO World heritage site. Elephants help maintain this ecosystem since they act as a keystone species. Removal of such species would have severe negative impacts on this natural ecosystem. Government of Sri Lanka has a global obligation to protect this World Heritage Site from illegal activities including negative impacts of ad-hoc decisions. Therefore, the decision to remove elephants from this world recognized conservation area should be made on strong scientific basis.
* Taking the elephants born and bred in the wettest area of the wet zone in the country to an alien environment of the dry zone in Horowpothana, known for its harsh climatic conditions would not bode well for the elephants.
* The capture and transportation to the far off area can be traumatic to the elephants. According to researchers elephants are known to be highly sensitive and this transportation would be deadly for them.
* The vegetation and feeding plants will be different to what they are accustomed to, causing issues. Further, these elephants might have various ailments such as breathing issues due to the low elevation dry climatic conditions in Horowpothana compare to their current location.
* These elephants may not survive among other dry zone elephants in the Elephant holding site due to the rejection of unknown elephants and the genetic differences due to different gene pool. This aspect has not been researched by the Wildlife Department or other researchers well.
* According to the researchers these two elephants will not remain in an environment alien to it and will escape, and a majority of the time the animal dies from this traumatic experience. There are many incidents that elephants have escaped from this location in Horowpothana and got killed during the escape.
* If these two elephants have been fitted with a GPS collar people would monitor where the elephants are roaming which could prevent elephant attack. This way we can prevent human deaths. No such solutions have tested to date to resolve the issue.
The two elephants act as the guardians of the Sinharaja forest and their presence stops animal poaching, illegal logging and illegal brewing of alcohol. As far as we know these poachers and loggers are behind this decision. We therefore feel taking away the remaining elephants could lead to the eventual destruction of Sinharaja.
We have learned that the Officers of the Wildlife Department are already in Sinharaja to initiate this operation.
Therefore, we humbly appeal to President Sirisena to immediately intervene in this matter and reverse this unwise, unscientific, non-consultative decision.

THE HOLY OPPORTUNITY
As the end of Ramadan draws near, Muslims around the world and Sri Lanka will be preparing for Eid, to celebrate the conclusion of the end of the fasting period. Ramadan is the month where good deeds will be done in excess, more praying, more recitation of the Quran and more charity, less gossiping, less backbiting, less lying and so on and so forth.
It is a lot like school, or university, where you strive hard to get the best grades under clinical conditions where all the resources are made available, and then rewarded with a graduation ceremony. Then you are thrown in to the real world, where you would have to find an internship or job, deal with a vicious boss, (or vicious everything) and no one will show your mercy if you display any weakness or incompetency. You will be expected to display the same restrained and tenacity practiced during the university years.
Eid is a lot like that, it is not the end of Ramadan, but the beginning where you display how well you fared throughout the year till the next Ramadan. Eid is about preparing yourself to enjoy the fruits you gained during Ramadan. For example, one should establish contact with an estranged relative during Ramadan, and visit them on Eid. It will be less awkward and the visit will be more qualitative, rather than chancing a sudden visit on Eid day.
Ramadan for most is spiritually clinical, thus rendering it almost impossible to extend the good deeds for more than one month. It is the opportunity to establish a psychological relationship with almighty God which will result in spirituality making our motions of worship more meaningful.
In order to understand the spirit of Eid, the essence of Ramadan must be adhered to, which is three fold. The first being the re-establishment of ones connection with his Maker, and then through this connection judging ones own character and begging for repentance of mistakes past, a plea to wipe each slate clean to start afresh. The third element is the recognition of relationship with ones fellow beings, to mend broken fences in order to spend a united Eid. All of these three dimensions are intertwined to make ones Ramadan worthwhile.
Thus, Ramadan is not only about Muslims and their spiritual upheaval, it is about recharging, reconnecting and rebuilding what was broken or dented with all of Gods creatures, be it male, or female, Muslim or otherwise.
The holy month of Ramadan is an opportunity for every Muslim to engage in prayers, give in charity and to seek forgiveness from God for the trespasses one does against him. Interestingly, certain trespasses one does against man will not be forgiven by God, till the wrongful seeks the forgiveness of the wronged. In order words, the month of Ramadan compels the faithful to seek out the relatives and friends with whom one has wronged or upset and render an apology.
Positive character traits
Ramadan is also the month where the faithful develops positive character traits, such a punctuality and consistency. From the sighting of the moon announcing the arrival of Ramadan to the times Suhoor (Pre dawn meal) and Ifthar (meal at the breaking of the fast) is partaken, timings and precision plays a colossal part in building positive characteristics.
This enables one to discipline himself and to be conscious of time, a trait developed through thirty days of consistency. Whilst the faithful should engage on extra spiritual deeds and abstain from food and drink they should also focus on developing their personality. Fasting is also the only spiritual deed which another cannot witness, except for God who judges one according to his sincerity. Prophet Muhammad described this connection thus, Every action of the son of Adam is given manifold reward, each good deed receiving then times its like, up to seven hundred times. Allah the Most High said, Except for fasting, for it is for Me and I will give recompense for it, he leaves off his desires and his food for Me. for the fasting person there are two times of joy; a time when he breaks his fast and a time of joy when he meets his Lord, and the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better with Allah than the smell of musk.
Abstaining from food and drink is the core element of Ramadan, in a state of fasting if food or drink enters ones system the fast is rendered broken. However there are other aspects which also nullify the fast, although not physically, but in spirit. It is incumbent upon the fasting individual to polish his speech and his interaction with others. Rude words, lying, backbiting and slander is utterly discouraged and if engaged in doing so, the faithful is immediately required to seek the forgiveness of the wronged and then God, for slander and backbiting is deemed equitant as to eating the flesh of another human being. These as may not break ones fast, but it will degenerate the spiritual connection man has with God and also taint his relationship with others, which will block Gods mercy and grace reaching him. Prophet Muhammad said, If a person does not avoid false talk and false conduct during fasting, then God does not care if he abstains from food and drink.
In essence, the month of Ramadan transcends religious and racial divisions and functions towards bringing people closer together.
It is a month where not just Muslims but nonMuslims partake in rituals and acts that bind the cord of unity amongst man. A prime example is the ifthar meal, which nonMuslim brethren from all walks of life have at least once hosted an ifthar meal to their Muslim brothers, or joined them for the meal. This act is highly appreciative in Gods eyes, as reflected by the Prophet.
Eid prayer
He who gives food for a fasting person to break his fast, he will receive the same reward as him, except that nothing will be reduced from the fasting persons reward.
The prophet Muhammad used to engage in charity after Eid prayer, encouraging Muslims to share their meals with their family, friends and neighbours.
It is also incumbent upon each Muslim to pay a compulsory poor due zakathul Fitr prior to Eid prayers, so that the less privileged can also enjoy Eid along with their family and friends.
Ramadan dawned upon Sri Lanka in the wake of devastation caused by floods and landslides. For many Muslims, observing Ramadan was a trial as they were displaced and also lost their belongings to floods. Eid is a time for charity and goodwill, which must be shared amongst Muslims and non Muslims alike.
The purpose of compulsory charity, Zakath, is to allow the poor the same dignity of the privileged, diminishing class divisions in society. Yet as Sri Lanka celebrates Eid, there are many who are still languishing in camps due to landslides and floods that occurred last May.
Eid is a time for all to reach out to their fellow Sri Lankans, to extend their support to carry out the Humanitarian call which was evoked in each and everyone of us at the wake of disaster and need. Lets learn from the spirit of Ramadan which calls for consistency and continuation of good deeds to provide constant support to those who need it as reflected in the humanitarian aid rendered in the immediate aftermath of these disasters.
While we celebrate Eid u Fitr with loved ones and family, lets remember those who are less fortunate, and extend our love and compassion to them on this blessed day.

HORIZON CAMPUS INVESTS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY RESEARCH
With the changing landscape of Biotechnology presenting many challenges for both the industry and educators alike and the need of preparing todays science undergraduates in the country for future industry opportunities in this sphere, Horizon Campus is currently on a quest of investing their capitol in equipping their lecture team, labs and facilities to help establish their campus as a powerhouse for Biotechnology education in the country.
Eranda Mandawala of the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Sciences at Horizon Campus, said, to prepare a knowledge-based talent pool in Biotechnology requires that we invest in competence, education and research. At the campus we are assuming a national responsibility to support the growth of specialist skills and knowledge in Biotechnology and cultivate a leading community of qualified graduates in life sciences.
We will be making the campus a gathering place for creative researchers who are capable of linking academic disciplines in new ways to generate new knowledge and apply this for innovation and value creation in the field of Biotechnology.
With the driving mission to ensure the campus becomes one of the best resourced centres for Biotechnology research and education in the country, major investments have been made in state-of-the-art laboratories to conduct impact-driven molecular research that will provide researchers with insights into how to design new drug molecules to target complex health challenges such as Cancer, Alzheimers Disease and antimicrobial resistance.
Mandawala explained the biomedical challenges we face today include complex disorders associated with ageing, cancer, lifestyle and drug resistance. To develop new therapies for these diseases, we need to understand the biological activities of biomolecules in a cell.
The area of molecular and cell biology therefore have a great deal to offer medicine in the future. It is at the forefront of scientific discovery, unlocking the innermost secrets of the cell and developing new ways to detect and attack disease, provide a new generation of diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and play a major role in the development of new vaccines and other approaches to the control of diseases.
This also represents a platform for a new industry in Sri Lanka with new jobs, products and services in the health sector and our aim is to produce the required talent for this industry.
The lab at Horizon campus has been equipped to carry out PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing, a technique that identifies characterizations of viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal agents.
All of these are closely aligned with undergraduate and post-graduate teaching facilities to help provide a seamless transition for students and give them many opportunities to conduct research projects in the specialized context of molecular biology.

Japan mulls Abe-Kim meeting
JAPAN: Japan is working to arrange a meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Kim Jong Un after the North Korean leader said he was open to talks, local media reported Thursday.
The Sankei Shimbun said Kim discussed the possibility during historic talks Tuesday with US President Donald Trump.
During the summit with Trump, Kim told Trump I can meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Sankei reported.
Japan wants the talks to push the emotive issue of citizens abducted by the North decades ago, which has seen little movement despite a whirlwind of diplomacy in recent months.
Government officials are weighing several scenarios, including Abe visiting Pyongyang in August, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported Thursday.
Another scenario would see Abe meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the sidelines of a conference in Russia in September, the daily said.
Several Japanese media outlets said Thursday that Kim had expressed a readiness to meet Abe when he held a historic summit earlier this week with US President Donald Trump.
And Abe has already said publicly that he would meet Kim in order to resolve the abduction issue.
Japanese foreign ministry officials plan to hold talks with North Korean officials at an international security conference in Mongolia this week as they try to firm up plans, local media said.
If (Abes) visit to Pyongyang in August proves difficult, he could hold talks with Kim on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Russias Vladivostok in September, the Yomiuri said.
Top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga declined to confirm the reports, telling reporters Thursday nothing has been decided at the moment. If a Japan-North Korea summit takes place, it is extremely important that it would lead to a solution of the nuclear, missile, and above all, abduction issues, he added.
The issue of Japanese citizens who were abducted in the 1970s and 1980s to help Pyongyang train its spies has long soured already strained relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang.
The Japanese government has officially listed 17 people as abductees, but there are strong suspicions that dozens more were snatched.
Abe will meet later Thursday with relatives of those abducted and pledge to resolve the issue in talks with Kim, local media said.
Japan has repeatedly called for the issue to be raised in discussions with Pyongyang, and Trump said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon that he had discussed the issue with Kim.
Japan has maintained a hardline position on North Korea despite the stepped-up diplomacy with Pyongyang in recent months, and has been left largely on the sidelines as South Korea and the United States have held talks with Kim. Kim and Trump signed a document on Tuesday after their talks in which the North Korean leader reaffirmed his commitment to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, without giving further details.
It made no reference to other weapons capabilities, including the missiles that North Korea has fired over Japan, nor to people abducted by North Korea. - AFP

The Making of the Green Gene
The Responsible Fashion Movement launched their second Hackathon last month, under the theme THE MAKING OF THE GREEN GENE in association with the Hirdaramani Group. The aim of this hackathaon is to hack the process and create a solution around denim-based products. This is part of the Responsible Fashion Movement.
The Responsible Fashion Movement has a global agenda to impose progressive thinking, where mindsets are changed, ethical practices implemented and fashion consumers are made aware of their choices. It is an action point to bring about Responsibility, Responsiveness and Accountability to the fashion and design industry to create a good and responsible fashion ethos, which should become the new norm in fashion design. As before, the objective behind the Fashion Hackathon is to involve design students, designers and industry stakeholders to bring in functionality and practicality based on the knowledge imparted in the forums that preceded it.
Responsible Fashion Hackathons started late last year with the first project named as The making of the Green Tee, part 1. This involved design students from a universities and fashion schools attempting to create the greenest t0-shirt possible based on the technology available. The results of this were presented to a panel of international designers at the First Responsible Fashion Summit.
The second edition, The Making of the Green Gene, will see its participants attempt to create a pair of Jeans or a product that uses denim using waste fabric from the Hirdaramani manufacturing plant. Participants will use waste fabric from 4 categorized waste baskets, in order to create a product that will have the strongest environmental impact.
These hackathons are aimed at creating a culture of innovative design solutions among design students and how amazing would it be to see a generation of green thinking designers in Sri Lanka who have solutions to global garment issues. Not many people know that a teeshirt as basic as it maybe can consume upto 2000 litres of water, equivalent to an individuals annual water need. These are issues. And We want Sri Lanka to be a shining example of Responsible Fashion. says Ajai V Singh, Founder of The Responsible Fashion Movement in a press release.
The Hirdaramani Group is one of the leading apparel manufacturers in Sri Lanka. In response to addressing the growing concerns of fashion and its environmental impact, they conducted an in-depth study into the impact of denim on the environment, mapping it from the cotton farming stage to the retail and post-consumer stage.
Responsible Fashion Hackathon is a unique program by the Responsible Fashion Movement, it is focused on creating solutions to global issues while engaging and involving young people. For Hirdaramani group Denim is a key product category and we encourage innovation and design solutions.
We are happy to partner the Responsible fashion Movement which aims to showcase Sri Lanka as a Responsible Fashion destination. This is probably the first such denim hackathon in Asia. We look forward to more, says Director Hirdaramani Group Aroon Hirdaramani.

Mechanism to reform prisoners
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that reading habit should be cultivated among all the people of the country including prison inmates.
The Minister has proposed a mechanism to cultivate reading habit among prison inmates prior to entering in to the society. By cultivating reading habit among prison inmates, they can be converted to useful persons to the society, he added.
The Minister said so, while offering books to rural libraries and donating furniture to the libraries, which were damaged by the recent flood, at the Library and Documentation Service Board yesterday.
According to the Minister, prison inmates can easily be educated and made knowledgeable through cultivating reading habit.
Addressing the gathering, the Minister pointed out that prisoners tend to involve in various vicious acts after entering in to prisons and the habit of reading is an ideal solution for refraining them from falling prey in to various forms of nasty acts. Then, it is a need to introduce a suitable mechanism to drive these persons to the correct path and to make them useful to the society.
Speaking on his suggestion, the Minister said that there may be room for prison inmates to get knowledge by reading.

INVENTOR OF NANO BULB TO CURB SPREADING OF INFLUENZA :
MEET SCIENTIST MANJU GUNAWARDENA
Since humans rolled out the first wheel we have been tinkering with new inventions. It was the people who think in novel ways made this world an awesome place and only they could leave their names to remember among thousands who are born and die every day.
Senior Research scientist and inventor Manju Gunawardena is no exception. He is an award winning scientist in many fields in Science and engineering. His inventions have been accepted by many countries and one of his remarkable inventions was a nano bulb as a solution to the spreading influenza.
In the recent past, several deaths have been reported due to spreading of influenza and as a result there is a dire need to find a solution. Many foreign countries have already found methods to curb the spreading of influenza. And Manju Gunawardena says that his invention - nano bulb will save hundreds of lives.
Following are the excerpts of the Interview:
Q:How would you introduce your invention
A: Among the diseases in the world the most dangerous is epidemic diseases. This is not something significant to Sri Lanka. Because epidemic diseases are one of the worst to deal with. We can be infected by these diseases in many ways. There are three ways in which these diseases can be easily spread. Many people get these diseases from hospitals, from people who are already infected and due to the poisonous gases in the atmosphere. I made this bulb as a solution to all these issues.Senior Research scientist and inventor Manju Gunawardena is no exception. He is an award winning scientist in many fields in Science and engineering. His inventions have been accepted by many countries and one of his remarkable inventions was a nano bulb as a solution to the spreading influenza. 
Q: If you could explain further
A: Among the people who die in the hospitals, twenty percent die due to spreading of epidemic diseases within the hospital. It is called Hospital acquired infections or Nosocominal infections. The bulb that I have invented could eliminate the presence of poisonous gases in the atmosphere.
And also from the outer environment, people can also get H1N1 influenza and bird flu. People can be infected by these diseases when they are in the bus, cinema halls, classrooms and other closed rooms.
Q: How long can this bulb be used A: There is no timeline to depict the usage of the bulb. This can be used similar to a CFL bulb. The nano particle has been applied to the outer surface of the CFL bulb. 
People can overcome these by fixing a bulb in those rooms.
The other factor is that there could be poisonous gases in our atmosphere. When someone breathe that air for a longer period he / she may be infected by these diseases. It happens due to polluted atmosphere.
Q: What was the reason to make a bulb
A: As a solution to the issues I mentioned earlier I invented this Nano particle. This nano particle has the ability to combine with sunlight or any other form of light and it eliminates poisonous particles, bacteria and virus in the atmosphere. As bulb is something that can be used easily by people, I included the nano particle to the bulb. We only apply the nano particle to the outer surface of the bulb.
Q: Can you also explain the specialty of this
A: When we consume antibiotics for a longer period, a resistance is formed. Therefore, when the drugs fail to cure the disease we either have to increase the dosage or start taking different drugs. The specialty of this bulb is that the nano particle used cannot form any kind of resistance. Therefore, the bacteria or virus will not form any resistance against the nano particle.
Q: How long did you spend to make this
A: I have been engaged in research for the past 7 seven years related to this matter. As a result, today, I have been able to launch this as a new invention.
Q: Have you got the patent license for this
A: Yes. I have the patent right for this bulb. And one of the Indian companies is manufacturing and distributing these bulbs.
Q: Why did you give manufacturing right to India and not Sri Lanka
A: From when did Sri Lanka started encouraging and supporting these materials. These days, due to spread of influenza many children died in Southern area. We tried to get down these bulbs from India but no one here was interested in the initiative.
Q: Whom did you discuss this with
A: I personally spoke to one of the higher officials attached to the relevant Ministry. But I never received any reply from them. May be they wanted to appoint a committee, do a research, prove it and then buy these bulbs. They do not realize that they are losing a good opportunity that could save hundreds of people.
Q: So which means you were not recognized anywhere in Sri Lanka
A: I cannot exactly say that. When I got the award in 2012, I got a warm welcome. The biggest problem in our country is that we do not create room for discussion on the matter afterwards. But I should say that I got a great welcome by Ministry of Science and research and National Science Institute. They also gave me a great support. The problem here is the Ministry that needs this was not showing enough support and interest. We are not doing this with the aim of earning a good profit.
Q: How long can this bulb be used
A: There is no timeline to depict the usage of the bulb. This can be used similar to a CFL bulb. The nano particle has been applied to the outer surface of the CFL bulb.
Q: Can you assure that this bulb will not harm the users in any manner
A: Many scientists from India and England assured that this nano bulb would eliminate the virus from the atmosphere totally and save people from getting influenza. Amazon in India will be distributing our products very soon. Not only that, many doctors in India include the bulb in their prescription as well. They ask the patients who had been in hospital for longer period and recovered from their illness to use these bulbs in their homes.
Q: Who would be most benefited by the bulb A: This would be helpful for any person who is sick. They can fix these bulbs in bathroom and toilet in their houses as this has the capability to destroy all kind of germs. It would be very useful to have a bulb in the kitchen. In India, most of the people who had undergone surgeries use this.
Q: Why did you give manufacturing right to India and not Sri Lanka A: From when did Sri Lanka started encouraging and supporting these materials. These days, due to spread of influenza many children died in Southern area. We tried to get down these bulbs from India but no one here was interested in the initiative. 
Former President Abdul Kalams personal doctor also recommended this.
Q: What was the response you received from other countries
A: In countries like Japan and England this bulb has been approved to eliminate influenza virus. In India, a separate factory has been established.
Q: Who would be most benefited by the bulb
A: This would be helpful for any person who is sick. They can fix these bulbs in bathroom and toilet in their houses as this has the capability to destroy all kind of germs. It would be very useful to have a bulb in the kitchen. In India, most of the people who had undergone surgeries use this.
Q: If you could precisely tell who are the people can use this
A: People who have asthma, fever, urine infection and other virus, bacterial infections or epidemic diseases can use the bulb to make sure that their diseases does not get worsened.
Q: From when did you start making new inventions
A: I have been doing this since I was 28 years old. And this is my job now to make new inventions.
Q: If you could tell about new inventions you are doing now
A: There are about 75-80 products that I made that are in the market so far. I have got three gold medals and one bronze medal from the International Federation of Inventors Association, Geneva and jurys special golden award.
I am the only one who had received most number of awards from the association. And it has been functioning for the past 43 years.
Q: What was the invention that brought you a gold medal
A: A nano technology to find the diseases earlier and to find the drug that would cure those diseases.
Q: Do you have plans to do new inventions in the future as well
A: I would be doing this as long as I am alive. I am more focused on finding solutions to the problems faced by people daily.
Q: If you could tell about new inventions you are doing now A: There are about 75-80 products that I made that are in the market so far. I have got three gold medals and one bronze medal from the International Federation of Inventors Association, Geneva and jurys special golden award.

Meghan Markles latest outfit paid homage to Princess Diana
If the pale pink Carolina Herrera dress Meghan Markle wore Trooping the Colour ceremony felt familiar, it might be because Princess Diana wore a strikingly similar design over three decades ago.
The Duchess of Sussexs off-the-shoulder look is reminiscent of a Catherine Walker design worn by Prince Harrys late mother to a Berlin Opera House Gala in 1987. Both dresses feature the same pastel hue, open neckline and buttoned-up bodice.
Despite its similarity to Princess Dis gown, Markles outfit was deemed inappropriate by some on social media, who felt that exposed shoulders had no place at Queen Elizabeths birthday parade.
This isnt the first time Markle has channeled the late princess of Wales style: Her engagement ring from Prince Harry features diamonds once owned by Diana, and she wore her late mother-in-laws aquamarine ring to her wedding reception in May.

Moratuwa, Peradeniya university professionals certify safety of Rajagiriya Flyover
The Rajagiriya Flyover is recommended for safe operation and for the use of the public, said Peradeniya University Engineering Faculty Senior Lecturer Dr. Krishan Wijesundara.
He made this statement at a press conference held at the head office of the Road Development Authority.
Dr. Wijesundara further said that the Rajagiriya Flyover is designed in accordance to the Euro code and an As Built analysis was carried out to check the structural stability. The As Built analysis for the Rajagiriya Flyover was carried out by the Moratuwa Universitys Engineering Faculty, together with professionals from the Peradeniya Universitys Engineering Faulty.
According to the Finite Element Analysis carried out by the Moratuwa Universitys Engineering Faculty, structural stability of the Rajagiriya Flyover is assured and thus, it is safe for operation and fit for the intended purpose. Therefore, the Rajagiriya Flyover was opened for traffic.
Deflection and vibrations in structures are inherent due to live loads, according to design standards. Steel structures amplified the vibrations compared to concrete structures, but at any moment will not jeopardise the integrity of the structure. Steel is the best material to construct this type of long-span complex bridge.
In addition, Peradeniya Universitys professionals monitored the flyover to check actual stresses and performance of the bridge. This analysis is very important as a base date for future reference.
The second purpose of this analysis was to verity the result obtained from computer analysis with the actual data obtained from this monitoring mechanism.
This is a very valuable assessment as these data could be used for academic purposes of the university.
This flyover was monitored and data was collected under fully loaded conditions with vehicles. The highest weighted vehicles available in Sri Lanka were loaded onto the flyover to get relevant data for the analysis.
As per the design criteria, the allowable vertical displacement of this flyover is 40 mm, while the actual observed maximum vertical displacement is only 8 mm with heavily loaded vehicles.
Therefore, the flyover is in the safety region. For this structure, natural vibration should be higher than 2 Hz to ensure safety aspects, while the actual natural vibration is higher than 2.5 Hz. Therefore, the vibration level of this flyover is also in the safety region.
Therefore, the Rajagiriya Flyover is recommended for safe operation, as it is theoretically proved using real readings that were verified by the analysis.
Addressing the news conference, RDA Project Engineer Himantha Jayalath said that this four-lane flyover was constructed with a four-lane service road under the flyover to take all turning movements. Totally there are eight lanes for this flyover system. And the number of existing lanes on the Sri Jayewardenepura road is six.
Therefore, this eight-lane flyover merges with six lanes of the existing road. This merging occurs at a distance of 150 mm beyond the flyover, for smooth merging. Therefore, this not a bottleneck, as pointed out by some media, and this is the general phenomena of a flyover.
Jayalath further said that the Rajagiriya and Battaramulla area was congested even during off-peak times before the construction of the flyover.
But this congestion was reduced after opening the Rajagiriya Flyover and much better benefits were obtained during evening peak time. This evening peak congestion was further reduced by utilising an additional lane in the peak direction. This concept is successfully used in other developed countries, and hence we started this with professional consultation from the Moratuwa University, he said.
The investigation report prepared by the academics of the Peradeniya and Moratuwa Universities has confirmed that the Rajagiriya Flyover meets the required standards, said Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Suriyaarachchi.
Suriyaarachchi explained that the objective of the press conference was to reveal the actual situation pertaining to the ongoing research activities on the Rajagiriya Flyover. A measurement device was installed last Sunday to conduct checks, owing to which the use of the flyover was temporarily halted for about half an hour. These checks and monitoring are an integral part of the flyover plan, in the best interests of the public, he said.
However, there were various misleading reports in the media in this regard, Suriyaarachchi said. While thanking the media for the interest they are evincing with regard to the road development activities, the Chairman requested the media to clarify their doubts if they have any, and verify the truth of the information from him or his officials who are willing to cooperate, before they are published.
Road Development Authority Director General Rohitha Suwarna said generally with steel bridges and with concrete bridges, the vibrations are kept at a minimum. Hence the vibration when vehicles travel over them is at a minimum.
Explaining the high standards of the Rajagiriya Flyover, Suwarna reiterated it has been constructed meeting the necessary international standards and norms. He further said that there is plenty of knowledge and resources within Sri Lanka pertaining to the highly advanced technology of flyovers.

National policy for human resource development in tourism urged
With new investments coming to the hotel sector amounting to USD 2.8 billion the industry will require thousands of newly trained workers in the next couple of years, said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga said.
The Minister made these views speaking at the 39th Graduation Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management which was held at the BMICH .Needless to say these investments have put a lot of pressure on SLITHM to deliver thousands of new workers at craft, supervisory and management levels. Im happy to note that SLITHM has risen to the challenge by producing the required numbers, he said.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) Director General Buddhika Hewawasam emphasised the need for a national policy on human resource development in the tourism sector.
This is to develop the much needed tourism related human resources to serve the demanding tourism sector of Sri Lanka.
Noting that there is an ongoing need for long term national strategies and policies covering human resources development in the tourism sector, Hewawasam said the shortage of well trained tourism personnel coupled with high rate of turnover continued to be a major issue for the tourism and hospitality industry with the situation worsening with many new hotels, coming up in the country and absorbing the existing experienced personnel.
He expressed these sentiments, speaking at the 39th graduation ceremony of Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), held at BMICH.
The country requires at least 400,000 employees by 2020 if we are to serve two and a half million tourists. Sri Lankan tourism is also committing to achieve five million tourists by 2025. To this end, hotel schools have to be improved and capacities will have to be increased.
To cater to growing demand for high quality human resources in the tourism industry, SLITHM is currently bringing out close to 7,000 trained personnel per year.
Apart from this, the existing private colleges in tourism also bring out s trained personnel although one cannot be sure about the quality of this training.
A professionally efficient workforce is essential to provide the level of services expected by the international tourists, However, Hewawasam highlighted four major constraints, that are still found in human resources development such as the shortage of qualified human resources, gaps in the availability of tourism training infrastructure, qualified trainers and teachers and the lack of attention given to the conditions of work in the tourism sector.

New Public Procurement Guidelines to cut down on corruption, waste
The National Procurement Commission (NPC) after two years of deliberations, yesterday introduced the new Public Procurement Guidelines for all government procurements. This is expected to be the first step towards cutting down on corruption and waste in government and making public expenditure more transparent.
The guidelines which are an update of the existing ones which have been in place for 12 years, has been Gazetted and is expected to be presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister soon.
The NPC stated that it needs to be approved in Parliament before August 9.
The NPC was one of the independent commissions set up by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and is empowered to formulate a fair, equitable transparent, competitive and cost effective procurement guidelines and procedure for procurement and to monitor and report to appropriate authorities when the procurement process has not been followed in an appropriate manner.
The NPC only has the power to monitor, we do not have the authority to stop any irregular procurements, NPC Chairman Nihal Wickramasuriya siad.
The Chairman addressing the media at BMIC explained that once the guidelines and handbook for government servants are approved, all ministries would have to formulate their own procurement plans in accordance with approved action plans.
The NPC would then monitor whether the ministries and departments are conducting procurements according to the plans, whether all qualified bidders are afforded equal opportunity in the bidding process, whether the selection of contractors and the awarding of contracts are done in a fair and transparent manner, whether suitably qualified members are appointed for Procurement Committees and Technical Evaluation Committees and to investigate and report on officers who have worked outside of the guidelines.
The NPC has the power to report institutions which do not follow the Guideline to Parliament and the Auditor General.
Wickramasuriya also explained that they had taken the opportunity to introduce new features such as the ability to conduct procurement with multiple suppliers at once on a short to medium term basis, to move towards E-procurement, Information Systems, Open Contracting Data Standards (OCDS), Green Procurement and the introduction of Appeal Boards to all levels of procurements,
At present, only Cabinet level procurements have Appeal Boards but now we will have it at all levels of government, the NPC Chairman said.
According to NPC Member P.A.D.C.B. Perera, however moving completely to an E-procurement level would take the country at least 10 years, But, we can start small, like publishing tenders and tender procedures online.
The OCDS system which will allow the public to access procurement data in the meantime will also only come into effect after the E-procurement process in complete, added Perera, We have set the policy so we are ready when the time comes.
The Treasury which is handling the implementation of the Guidelines, he said has already appointed a Steering Committee and studying the best way forward.
The Guidelines in addition will also empower the NPC to look into the credibility of persons appointed to Appeal Boards.
More importantly this will also allow citizens to submit Right to Information Requests once tenders are awarded and they will have access to the full reports of the Technical Evaluation Committees, The public will know how their money is spent, Wickramasuriya said.

Norwegian vessel to research in Lankan territorial waters
Marine research vessel Dr. Fridtjof Nansen will arrive in Sri Lanka on June 21 to carry out a research in Sri Lankas territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal for nearly 26 days, accompanied by Sri Lankan scientists and researchers.
The vessel is owned by the Norwegian government and is jointly managed by the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN.
The vessel is one of the worlds most advanced research vessels. The main purpose of the survey is to improve the knowledge base for sustainable resources management and to enhance the understanding of the marine ecosystem in Sri Lanka.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo recently, Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Thorbjorn Gaustadsaether said the Nansen visit gives an opportunity to highlight the good and longstanding development cooperation between Sri Lankan and Norway, especially on fisheries which started in 1971.
This also gives us a chance to highlight the importance of sustainable marine resources management and to discuss some key environmental concerns, such as marine littering and pollution as well as potential of blue economy.
The vessel is one of the most advanced research vessels in the world and brings together state-of-the-art technology with world class expertise on marine resource management. The first vessel visited Sri Lanka about 40 years ago.
With a world population that is expected to increase by more than two billion by 2050, our need to obtain resources such as food and energy from the oceans will continue to grow in the years to come, the Ambassador said.
The present Norwegian support to the fisheries sector includes assistance in developing a fisheries policy for Sri Lanka which has already been approved by the Cabinet. The implementation of the policy and the revisions of the fisheries legislation and institutional restructuring as appropriate will be important in time to come.
Norway also supports technical and institutional cooperation between the Institute of Marine Resources in Norway and NARA in Sri Lanka on sustainable management of fisheries resources in Sri Lanka.

The plight of the national carrier
The doings at the countrys national carrier, SriLankan, are gradually beginning to unravel with the testimony now being heard by the Presidential Commission appointed to probe the irregularities at the SriLankan, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka. The latest to give evidence before the Commission was President of the Airline Pilots Guild of Sri Lanka Ruwan Vithanage. According to him, since the termination of the Emirates partnership, the Chairmen, CEOs and boards of directors appointed had not contributed to the development of the airline. Most of the Chairmen, CEOs and Directors appointed after the exit of the Emirates management were selected on the basis of family and political connections, he told the Commission, as reported by an English Daily yesterday, as its main story.
The national carrier is and has been a happy milch cow for many with political influence, to milk dry. As a result, all successive governments had to shoulder a heavy financial burden to keep the airline afloat. The present government is still grappling with the problem of finding a suitable partner to bail out SriLankan.
All those guilty of bringing the national carrier to its present sorry pass should be punished and their ill-gotten wealth confiscated. The shenanigans at SriLankan, during the Rajapaksa regime, were disclosed in detail in the Weliamuna Committee report. Why no action was taken is a mystery. This, while disclosures in the Presidential Commission report on the bond issue even led to the resignation of a government minister.
Relatives of government politicians being appointed to top posts in government departments and corporation is nothing new in this country. However there should be justification for such appointments. To begin with, he /she so appointed should be qualified to hold the post. In this respect one can fully justify MR appointing his younger brother Gotabhaya as Defence Secretary, at a time of war. He (Gota) had the credentials to hold the post, being well acquainted with battle strategy, as an ex-soldier himself. However, the same cannot be said of the appointment of his brother-in-law as Chairman SriLankan. Here was an individual plucked from nowhere to head the countrys national carrier, no less.
The Weliamuna Committee report goes deeply into how the national carrier was plunged into a financial black hole in which it is still wallowing. It also unearthed the sleaze and the sex scandals that were the norm and how the countrys national carrier and its female staff were used as playthings, while billions of rupees of public money was being squandered to pander to the whims of the countrys first family.
We say this because there were well published reports of flights being diverted to fetch the chairman from pleasure sojourns in far off countries and also an empty plane dispatched to ferry a choice canine for a powerful member of the Rajapaksa family. Then, there was the famous episode where the refusal of the Emirates CEO to offload first class passengers to accommodate a family entourage of the Rajapaksas, in a foreign destination, led to the exit of the premier airline and the beginning of the woes for the national carrier.
All this, while the government keeps on scoring own goals naming and shaming its own members who are paraded before various commissions and being penalized, and, what is more, affording the opportunity for its critics to point the accusing finger at the government when the guns should be trained in the other direction.
Those responsible for this national crime are today not even in the picture while the main topic is the bond scam and a so called list of names of politicians who benefited from Perpetual Treasuries.
We reiterated in these spaces that the government gets its act together and honour the pledge it gave to the people to rope in the thieves and plunderers. It should go after all those who drove the national carrier to the ground and recover the loot.
The fate of SriLankan is only one instance where billions were lost to the country due to the indulgences of the Rajapaksa clan. There are other acts of mega corruption which have escaped the attention of the public thanks to the governments laissez-faire attitude in bringing the culprits to book. There was the infamous Hedging Deal which inflicted an astronomical financial loss on the country and the Greek bond issue which cost the economy dearly. The masterminds behind these swindles are today giving statements to the pro-Rajapaksa media on the parlous state of the economy, such as the individual who Governed the premier bank in the country and another who played a major role in the stock market manipulation, allowing the pump and dump artistes to have a field day.
It is strange that no investigation has been launched into stock market manipulations in the past, which constitute a financial crime, although at the time the UNP leaders were very vocal on this matter. At least some of those militant UNP backbenchers should agitate for action, even at this late stage, so that all those now pontificating on the economy will be unmasked.

[Ramadan MESSAGES]
Season to give priority to peace: President
The most important thing in our life should be the purification of mind for the betterment as well as the protection of human beings. Any act, which is harmful to society, first germinates in a human mind. Consequently, the salvation and betterment of human beings could only be attained in an environment of good thoughts where moral values are strengthened, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in his message marking Ramadan.
The message added: It is the noble message of giving priority to peace with honour conveyed to humanity by the Islam devotees when they celebrate Ramadan or Eid-ul-Fitr after observing a fast for a month, and making sacrifices. It is a message common to the entire universe. The betterment of all human beings depend on an environment where each and everyone understands the real meaning of such a message.
The Ramadan rituals show us we can create a peaceful living environment while promoting peace and reconciliation in the present day complex world, only through being sensitive to the others sentiments, while being honest to oneself.
I extend my best wishes to all Islam devotees who celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr, which has such meaningful vision that addresses the common humanity transcending religious limitations, the message stated.
Marks equality, purity, devotion: PM
The festival of Eid ul-Fitr, falls on the first day of the month after the holy month of Ramadan, and marks the sighting of the new moon at the end of the month of fasting. This is an important religious festival celebrated by Muslims across the globe to mark equality, purity and devotion, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his Ramazan message.
The message adds: Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam - along with faith, prayer, charity and pilgrimage. Muslims also celebrate the revelation of their holy book, the Quran, during the same month, giving Muslims an opportunity to reflect on their spiritual life in honour of the Quran.
This period of fasting functions as a means of reassessment for Muslims, as they strive to lead a life of cooperation and compassion with spiritual purity. Through the practice of Zakat and other charitable donations during the period, Muslims demonstrate their generosity and set an example for humanity by acknowledging the importance of selflessness in their lives.
I hope that our Sri Lankan Muslim community, together with Muslims across the world, have a prosperous and a peaceful Eid ul- Fitr, having gifted the world with both the social and spiritual virtues instilled in this festival.
May the blessings light up the path and lead to happiness, Eid Mubarak!
Month of reflection, sacrifice
As the holy month of Ramadan comes to an end, Muslims all over the world are celebrating Eid-ul-Fitr. Eid is an Arabic word meaning festivity. The month of Ramadan is a month of reflection and sacrifice, said National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie in his message marking Ramazan.
The message added: Muslims fast to learn self-discipline and to feel the pain of those less fortunate so that they find the kindness in their heart to do more for society. This month is not only for fasting but for giving and caring as well.
On the morning of Eid, special prayers are held to spread goodwill and seek blessings. Prayers are made for everyone including our country and the world for peace and harmony.
After special prayers, friends and family gather together to have meals and to exchange gifts and greetings.
Sri Lanka is a multi-cultural and multi-religious country where Muslims have lived side by side with other communities for many centuries. The joy is spread to everyone with Eid greetings and food that is shared with neighbours and friends regardless of their faith or ethnicity. It is with great pleasure that this day is shared with everyone.
Ramadan: a symbol of hope
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is observed by Muslims the world over as a period of fasting to commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to the Holy Prophet Mohammed according to Islamic belief. This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam, stated Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga in his message marking Ramadan.
The message added: "Muslims in Sri Lanka are known to devoutly follow the teachings of the Holy Prophet and the fasting and celebration of Ramadan is deeply entranced in the fabric of Sri Lankan society.
"This is illustrated by the fact that Ramadan is a much anticipated celebration not only among the Muslim community but also among the other communities in Sri Lanka, which have peacefully coexisted for centuries in this beautiful island.
"My sincere wish is that in an era where religious extremism is causing divisions across the globe, unity, fellowship and adherence to the true values of Ramadan displayed by the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, will be a symbol of hope for the whole world," the message stated.
Resolve to live a peaceful life
Eid-ul-Fitr is an important day in the Islamic calendar where Muslims around the world celebrates on two great feasts. This festival, celebrated after the completion of a month-long fast, has been described as a reward by Holy Prophet Mohammed and as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty Allah for having us to perform our obligations as per the commands of the Almighty, stated Moors Islamic Cultural Home President Omara Kamil, in his message marking Ramadan.
The message added: On this sacred day in the Islamic calendar, let us all pray to Almighty Allah to grant permanent peace amongst all communities in our dear motherland.
Let us resolve on this great day to live a peaceful and an exemplary life, according to the great teachings of the Holy Quran and the message of Holy Prophet Mohammed, the message stated.
Season to help others
The Ramadan festival season is highly valuable because the good deeds performed during this season are considered more meritorious than those performed during the rest of the year, stated Colombo's Deputy Mayor M. T. M. Iqbal in a Ramadan message.
The message added that Ramadan can also be identified as a season which emphasised the need for helping others. Prophet Mohammed had stated that even the removal of an obstruction on a high road was also an act of merit. As such, the time had come for urban dwellers especially to perform their duty as regards garbage clearance in the city and assist that endeavour in whatever possible manner, the message said.

Ronaldo primed for likely last shot at World Cup glory
The 33-year-old will lock horns with six of his Real Madrid team-mates as the Spaniards attempt to shrug off the shock sacking of coach Julen Lopetegui following the announcement that he will take over at the Bernabeu next month.
It is worth wondering what Ronaldo might have known of Lopetegui's imminent appointment at Real, given the relationship both have with Portuguese super-agent Jorge Mendes, at a time when the forward's own club future remains the source of speculation.
But now, amid all that, Ronaldo's focus is on the World Cup, the one major honour still missing from his CV.
It is a stretch to make Portugal one of the favourites to win the trophy, even with Ronaldo, but they are nevertheless in Russia as the reigning European champions after surprising France on home soil two years ago.
Ronaldo is 33 now, still in fantastic physical condition and the reigning Ballon d'Or winner. He can probably play on for as long as he wants, but it is hard to imagine him returning for a fifth World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
If he is to cap his career with a World Cup winner's medal, then now is his time, and what better way to start than by inspiring Portugal to victory over their neighbours and put themselves in pole position in Group B.
"Of course Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world at the moment and he will be the top player at this World Cup. There are no words to describe him," said admiring team-mate Joao Mario at Portugal's base near Moscow this week.
FATHER FIGURE
Ronaldo was playing the last time Portugal beat their rivals in a major tournament, winning 1-0 to eliminate Spain in the group stage at Euro 2004.
He was just 19 then, and has gone on to become his country's leading scorer with 81 international goals.
He won his 150th cap in the recent friendly against Algeria. And yet he has never quite managed to replicate his club form on the major tournament stage. He lasted just 25 minutes before coming off injured in the Euro 2016 final, watching from the sidelines as Eder's extra-time goal shocked France.
At the World Cup so far, Ronaldo has managed just three goals in three tournaments: a penalty against Iran in 2006; one against North Korea in 2010, and one against Ghana in 2014.
There will be an obvious determination to improve that record in Russia, with Portugal also facing Morocco and Iran in their group.
But he also needs to act as a father figure to the talented young members of Fernando Santos's squad, like Bernardo Silva, Goncalo Guedes and Gelson Martins.
The latter is one of four Portugal players -- along with William Carvalho, Bruno Fernandes and Rui Patricio -- who say they will be breaking their contracts with Ronaldo's first club, Sporting Lisbon, after being attacked by disgruntled fans last month.
Ronaldo has a responsibility to unite the squad and focus minds ahead of his fourth World Cup.
"Ronaldo is our captain, he sets an example for us and is advising us younger players and sharing his experience," said Manchester City's Silva. That experience, and inside knowledge of many of the Spain players, will be crucial on Friday by the Black Sea.  AFP

Salad Emoji suitable for vegans
Google has removed the egg from its salad emoji in order to make it more inclusive for vegans.
Jennifer Daniel, who works as a user experience manager for Google, announced the change on Twitter.
She tweeted that was "big talk about inclusion and diversity at Google" and cited the redesigned emoji as an indication. If you need any evidence of Google is making this priority may I direct your attention to the emoji - we've removed the egg in Android P beta 2, making this a more inclusive vegan salad."
The tweet was criticised by a number of Twitter users, with some arguing over whether eggs were vegan or not. Sky News can confirm that as eggs are produced from animals they are not svegan.
Ms Daniel responded to the controversy by saying: "Hello carnivores, vegans and everyone in between!
"Just want to clarify that the goal of salad emoji redesign was to create an image more faithful to unicode's description. 'A bowl of healthy salad, containing lettuce, tomato, and other salad items such as cucumber.' Bon appetite!"

A scholar par excellence
When the lives and works of our sagacious citizens who had sought and strived not to yield in their efforts to bring joy into the lives of the working classes, farmers and also to uplift the lives of the poor, Fr Peter A Pillai OMI occupies an exalted position.
He began his schooling in Jaffna at his fathers school. His blessed parents (Joachim and Anna Pillai) never dreamt they would bequeath to the Roman Catholic Church - three men of God, Fr Peter, Bishop Emillianus and Brother Cadjethan. He joined St. Benedicts College.
A scholar par excellence, Fr Pillai passed the junior Cambridge and senior Cambridge with distinctions in all the subjects, a first class at the BCs Honours exam, a double first in Mathematics at the London BSc and later obtained a BA which matured into an MA (Cantab) and MSc London.
He joined the OMI novitiate and later was ushered into the Oblate International Scholasticate and Angelicum Pontifical University in Rome. He was awarded the PhD for his thesis on Bhakthiand soon after DD from Rome. He returned to the island in 1936 and joined St.Peters College. Then he was appointed Warden of Aquinas Hall, the University Catholic Students Hostel.
He was a humble person and did not want his stupendous educational milestones to be mentioned before or after his name, except the name of his beloved order OMI. Rev. Dr Peter, A Pillai OMI, MA, MSc, PhD, DD wished that he be called PA Pillai, OMI.
In 1936, the British press called him the most learned priest in the British Empire. In 1936, the sun never set on the British Empire. When he set foot on his motherland, he had a vision. To reach that vision he set forth on a mission.
A million words will not suffice to publish his speeches, lectures and articles that enlightened and gave courage to many here and abroad in trying to mend the inequalities that exist between human beings who live in this world.His friend was Dr. N. M. Perera and respected the middle path policies of the Samasamaja Party. Socialism was good he said.
He said that man was privileged in possessing an immortal soul and intelligence to know right and wrong. He lost it in the Garden of Eden. However, God loved him so much, that he gave us a reprieve. He gave his son to die for us. Once again we became children of God.Fr Pillai brought out the infirmities of man. He said that ancient and modern civilizations many gifts of God in ones own homeland were enjoyed by the affluent.
Lord Jesus spoke about this in his Beatitudes and his words about the rich man and the utter impossibility of the elite to enter through the gates of heaven. He strived to show the powers that be the inequalities that exist in mankind in the world and in our own country. He spoke fearlessly on the tragedy of Apartheid in South Africa segregation of Gods children due to colour, horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He spoke on how conquerors played dice with helpless nations.
This is mine, this is yours policy. They had said God was white. About our own land, Fr Pillai spoke and wrote on the scourge of malaria, poverty, subjugation of the poor by the rich and politicians. The latter preferred a not so educated populace.
Reasons were obvious. Governance was easy. He lauded C. W. W. Kannangara (the father of free education). Fr Pillai is a forgotten crusader. He was the knight who fought for social justice. At times he was alone. A cartoon shows him holding a placard with the words social justice, all alone in the midst of snow capped noontime. He was the pioneer who spoke on social welfare, dignity of labour and about the masters of the working classes who showed goodness while hiding questionable agendas. He pleaded for a minimum wage structure and the employees provident fund and the right to strike for a just cause.
His words and thoughts are graphically shown during a college carnival. He had been told that the owner of a chain of cinemas around the island and a few of his officers were seen doling free balcony and Outer Dress circle tickets-acceptable at all his cinemas to the students. He had wanted to show that there was full occupancy or patronage in his halls whereas only a very few had been at these cinemas, manned by black legs. Employees were on strike, a very just and fair strike.
The chairman was a very valuable old boy, a benefactor of the highest Caliber. Fr. Rector made an announcement. All doled out cinema tickets should be returned to him or to those who gave them and he said that no student should patronize these cinemas till the strike is over. Later, we heard that this magnificent employer had gone up to the rector and said that he would accede to all the demands of his employees, immediately. A beautiful gesture welcomed by his employees and the entertainment prone citizens. He continued to be a benevolent old boy.
He became rector of St. Josephs College on December 8, 1941. He never stopped speaking about that day. It was the feast of the Immaculate Conception. He belonged to the order of Mary Immaculate. He succeeded Fr Legoc who left us due to a road accident.
He was a rector for twenty years. During this period he never stopped his supplications for those living in squalor, in the city and in the provinces. He founded the legion of Mary, Catholic Social Guild and many other associations like the Catholic Intellectual Movement.
He was a sought after member of the Ceylon Association for the advancement of Science and the University Council and Senate. Amidst all this, he was a child of the times. He fought for radical changes. He foresaw the happenings of 1971. He craved for inter-denominational and Inter- religious amity. He was the happiest when Pope John XXIII spoke on Ecumenism.
He was at St. Josephs College for 20 years. It was fascinating to see him chat with the youngest boarder before giving him 15 cts for a piece of Muscat and a glass of lime juice.
He had more empathy than the hypocritical display of sympathy as shown by many. This virtue was most poignantly shown to us one day. We were young boarders. Sunday, a person was brought before him for stealing candle sticks and some silver ware from the college chapel. The man was in tears.
I know that I would never be able to sell these items. They will give me a few rupees. I dont want to trouble my poor children. I wanted some money to buy betel leaves and areca nuts. Please let me go. Those around wanted the police to be called. Just then Fr Pillai our rector passed by. He gave Him twenty rupees. Twenty rupees in 1949 was a lot of money. He told the weeping old person not to ever enter the college here after. Our one and only security officer at the time, Sebastian was told to take the man up to the gate. About two months later, Sebastian had told a few office personnel and the Rev.Fr in charge of borders a tale bordering a fairy tale. He had taken a person in a neatly attired National Dress to Fr Rectors office. Fr Rector had recognized the person. This person had walked up to Fr Rector in tears. He had offered the father a sheet of betel leaves and had fallen at his feet and sobbed. He had said amidst tears that, instead of calling the police, Fr had given him Rs.20. With that money, he had bought a saravita rack inclusive of a carbide light apparatus. Now he was a successful saravita mudalali. He had said Fr, my Lord Buddha will bless you. My son is married to a catholic girl. They said that they will pray for you when they go to All Saints Church. Sebastian had said that he saw Fr Rector wiping a tear, he had told him take the mudalali to the tuck shop.
Aquinas College of Higher Studies was established by him in 1954 and he was its first Rector. The Aquinas College of Higher Studies was the first university in Sri Lanka to offer external degrees, thereby giving undergraduates the opportunity to pursue their higher studies while being employed. In addition to his other duties, he was appointed Vicar General. In 1961 he retired as Rector of St Josephs College. He had an illness toward the end his life. Even while he was ill he would hold discussions and courses to guide young priests, as they were one of his primary concerns.
He could not understand why people should talk in the House of God (Chaplet) and the House of Knowledge (library).Once, he had been doing some reference in a library, abroad. The librarian knew Pillai. The library was closed for the day and only when they opened it the following morning Fr Pillai realizes that it is morning.
He told our general knowledge class, that one of his saddest days was when he was in USA in 1953, August. One of the very prestigious American newspapers had a banner headline`Trouble in paradise - it was the day after the 1953 August Hartal. This wonderful soldier of Christ left us in 1964 yes like all patriot soldiers he did not die but did fade away.

Scoliosis Surgery at Asiri Central
The Brain and Spine Team of Asiri Central Hospital, Colombo recently performed scoliosis surgery on sixteen year old Lasindu Perera.
Creating a major milestone in medical history this was the first time, a neurosurgical team headed by eminent Consultant Surgeon Dr. Sunil Perera undertook the procedure.
Lasindus severe scoliosis or an abnormal curvature of the spine posed serious health risks restricting movement and activity for the boy requiring immediate remedial surgery.
However, this was not the first time Dr. Perera and his team had intervened to save Lasindus life. In September 2016 the teen experienced partial paralysis, and after investigations by Dr. Perera was diagnosed with a large tumour on the left side of his brain near the thalamus and brain-stem.
He had a tumour in a very dangerous place, not usually accessible. If we had only given him radio therapy the child would not be living today. Everyone refused to perform the surgery. We got him here and we did the surgery and the child recovered well, Dr. Perera said.
Dr. Pereras next encounter with the teen was in January 2018 when Lasindus physiotherapist consulted the doctor seeking advice on the boys growing curvature.
According to Dr. Perera, a cobb-angle or lateral bending of the spine of over 10-degrees would indicate scoliosis and require treatment beginning with wearing a brace for nearly 23 hours to stop the progression of the spinal curve. Lasindu was diagnosed with a cobb-angle of 70-degrees.
In Lasindus case his previous illness created further complications. Dr. Perera explained, Unfortunately because of his earlier surgery, his spine was getting worse and he was walking with a little odd gait. It was getting worse and that is why we decided on doing the surgery.
For the complex surgery, Dr. Perera tasked a separate team to monitor Lasindus nervous system. While we were operating we had to monitor the nervous system. Monitors from the top down to the toes where every second there is a signal that passes to the brain to the toes and if there is any disruption then you know.
Post-surgery, Lasindu has been cured and will soon resume normal school activities. Commenting on prevalence of scoliosis in the country, Dr. Perera noted, Statistically the incidence is about three per cent of the population. We definitely need to do about 1,000-2,000 such surgeries unlike the 30 that is being conducted now. A large amount of patients are being taken to India and other countries to do the surgery.

SLT forum on Digital Economy
Sri Lanka Telecom successfully presented in the globally emerging topics of the Digital Economy, through a knowledge sharing programme themed, TelcoNext - Empowering the Digital Economy, Together.
The programme was held at the Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo recently with the participation of a large number of tech savvy professionals in the corporate, IT, BPO, BPM, public sectors as well as academics in Sri Lanka.
The programme addressed areas pertaining to the much talked of Digital Economy supported with global trends, Digital Sri Lanka initiatives, IoT implementation, hyper connectivity, digital services, competitor behaviour, softwarization and virtualization of the operators to face future demands. By modernizing the ICT infrastructure, which is the backbone of the digital economy, both Sri Lanka Telecom and Mobitel presented the promising capabilities to create greater agility to accelerate e-commerce market development in Sri Lanka.
During the forum, the keynote speaker Eng. Anuradha Udunuwara addressing the gathering said, The success of startups today is mainly because of the readiness of the modern ICT infrastructure and platforms already built by operators in the country, which is the backbone of the digital economy. On the other hand operators should not look at startups as threats to their traditional businesses, and operators should make collaborations in their long term business strategies instead of competing. Eng. Anuradha Udunuwara is a visiting Industrial Fellow of the University of Hertfordshire UK, Faculty of Commonwealth Telecommunications Organization UK, a guest lecturer at the University of Peradeniya and also a senior telecommunications expert.

Spain turmoil as coach Lopetegui fired on eve of World Cup
KRASNODAR, Wednesday - Spain's World Cup preparations were thrown into turmoil on Wednesday as Real Madrid-bound coach Julen Lopetegui was fired on the eve of the tournament, just two days before their opening game in Russia.
In a bombshell development which followed the naming of Lopetegui as Real's new coach on Tuesday, the Spanish federation confirmed that the 2019 World Cup winners had sacked their coach and replaced him with Fernando Hierro.
"We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves," said Hierro, who was already working for the Spanish federation as sporting director. "The objective is to fight for a World Cup. The players have been working towards this for two years.
"I've told the players that we have a wonderful, exciting challenge and we can't let this be an excuse to distract us from our dream."
Hierro appeared at a press conference alongside Spanish federation chief Luis Rubiales, who had earlier delivered the news of his decision to fire Lopetegui despite reported resistance from the Spain players.
"Negotiating is legitimate but it took place without the RFEF being informed until five minutes before a press statement was released," said Rubiales. "There has to be a message for all workers in the federation that there is a right way to do things."
Lopetegui had signed a new contract until 2020 just last month.
"I am very sad but we have a magnificent team and hopefully we'll win the World Cup," Lopetegui told reporters on his departure from Spain's training base in Krasnodar.
Hours later, Hierro, 50, was named as an emergency replacement despite having only one season's managerial experience in the Spanish Second Division with Real Oviedo.
Spain are due to face European champions Portugal in Sochi on Friday before taking on Iran and Morocco in Group B.
PLAYERS' SUPPORT
There were fears Lopetegui's appointment by the European champions could open up old divisions between the Real Madrid and Barcelona factions in the Spain squad.
For the first time since 2006, there are more players from Madrid in a Spanish squad for a major tournament, with a six-strong Real contingent and just Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets from Barca, as well as Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta, who ended his 16-year career at the Camp Nou last month.
"Lopetegui's decision was inopportune, unexpected and rushed," former Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez, who won the 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012 and Euro 2016 with Spain, told Marca at a pre-tournament event in Moscow.
"It was a surprise for everyone but Rubiales reacted very well. He has looked after the federation, which should be above any individual."
However, according to reports in the Spanish media, the players tried to intervene at the last minute to prevent Rubiales sacking Lopetegui.
Lopetegui, who took over in 2016, never tasted defeat in his 20 games as Spain boss.
"I have spoken with the players and what I can guarantee is that the players will do everything in their power, along with the new technical team, to take the team as far as possible," said Rubiales.
Spain and Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos appealed for unity between the fans and players.
"We are the national team. We represent a badge, colours, a fanbase, a country. The responsibility and commitment are with and for you. Yesterday, today and tomorrow, together," tweeted Ramos. La Roja were among the favourites to lift the trophy this summer but the astonishing developments of the past two days could have a devastating affect on their chances.
"It completely surprised me, I dont know the background of the decision, but two days before the first World Cup game, it's amazing," said Germany coach Joachim Loew.
"There must certainly be unrest within the federation and the team."
The Spanish drama came as the other 31 teams in the competition put the finishing touches to their preparations. Hosts Russia kick off the extravaganza in Thursday's opener in Group A in Moscow. Elsehwere in Group A, all eyes were on Egypt star Mohamed Salah, who is racing to be fit in time for the Africans' opener against Uruguay.
"There's a good degree of progress but no definitive decision on whether he takes part, as we are following his case day by day," team director Ihab Lahita told reporters.  AFP

Sri Lankas GDP  projected to grow  4.6 percent - WORLD BANK
After reaching 3.1 percent in both 2017 and 2018, the Wolrd Bank says that the global growth is expected to decelerate over the next two years as global slack dissipates, major central banks remove policy accommodation, and the recovery in commodity exporters matures. Amid moderating international trade and tightening global financing conditions, growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is projected to plateau, reaching 4.7 percent in 2019 and 2020, up from 4.5 percent in 2018.
Global growth is expected to edge down over the next two years, as global slack dissipates, trade and investment moderate, and financing conditions tighten. In EMDEs, growth in commodity importers is expected to remain robust, while the rebound in commodity exporters is projected to mature.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, including the possibility of disorderly financial market movements, escalating trade protectionism, heightened policy uncertainty, and rising geopolitical tensions. EMDE policymakers need to rebuild monetary and fiscal policy buffers and boost potential growth by promoting competitiveness, adaptability to technological change, and trade openness.
Growth in South Asia is projected to accelerate to 6.9 percent in 2018 from 6.6 in 2017, mainly reflecting fading disruptions to economic activity in India. Growth in the rest of the region is expected to stabilize at 5.6 percent in 2018.
Over the forecast horizon, growth is projected to reach 7.1 percent on average in 2019-20, reflecting broad-based strengthening across the region.
Despite the possibility of upside surprises to global activity, risks to the outlook are still tilted to the downside. Downside risks relate to both domestic factors, especially policy slippages amid sizable fiscal adjustment needs, and external factors, including the possibility of a faster-than-expected tightening of global financial conditions and increased global trade tensions.
Growth in South Asia slowed but remained strong at an estimated 6.6 percent in 2017. Growth in the region has improved markedly since mid-2017 and continued to firm in early 2018, reflecting improved consumer and investor sentiment, higher investment, and firming exports (e.g., Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka).
Domestic Demand
Growth in South Asia continues to rely on domestic demand, with firming but modest support from export growth (e.g., Bangladesh, India). Import growth is accelerating amid strengthening domestic demand, while higher energy prices are also contributing to a further deterioration of trade and current account balances (e.g., India, Nepal, and Pakistan).
Domestic and external financial market conditions have been generally supportive, but sovereign bond spreads have increased in 2018 amid rising inflation expectations and monetary policy normalization in advanced economies.
Monetary policy in the region has remained broadly accommodative and supported fast credit growth (e.g., Bangladesh, Pakistan); however, the State Bank of Pakistan recently hiked its policy rate to reduce growing external pressures.
Inflation has been increasing in the region recently, and is close to or above targets in some countries (e.g., India, Sri Lanka).
In many countries, budget deficits continue to be sizable or have widened further in 2018 reflecting both weaker-than-expected revenues and expansionary policies (e.g., Bangladesh, Nepal) with fiscal policies being generally pro-cyclical in the region.
Indias GDP growth bottomed out in the middle of 2017 after slowing for five consecutive quarters, and has since improved significantly, with momentum carrying over into 2018 on the back of a recovery in investment.
Although investment growth was still moderately lower in 2017 than in 2016, high-frequency indicators suggest that it accelerated into 2018. The temporary disruptions caused by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax dissipated by mid-2017, and manufacturing output and industrial production have continued to firm since then.
Growth in the region excluding India has been mixed in the first half of 2018. In Bangladesh, growth has rebounded following the natural disasters of mid-2017 (e.g., severe floods and landslides), and activity has remained strong and broad-based in 2018.
In Sri Lanka, activity in 2018 has been supported by a recovery in investment, especially in the construction and agriculture sectors, and related activities, following a slowdown in 2017 driven in part by adverse weather conditions.
Pakistans GDP growth rose in FY2017/18, supported by infrastructure projects funded by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), improvements in energy supply, and persistent private consumption growth.
In Bhutan, growth has been moderating, partly owing to delays in hydropower projects. However, growth is still strong, at 5.8 percent in FY2017/18.
In Afghanistan, the recovery continues to be disrupted by security challenges and political uncertainty.
Growth in South Asia is forecast to pick up to 6.9 percent in 2018, mainly reflecting the fading effects of temporary factors that weakened activity in India.
The forecast is broadly unchanged from January 2018. Domestic demand is the key driver of growth in the region, although firming exports should provide additional support in 2018.
The baseline scenario assumes a moderating recovery in global trade, higher commodity prices, and gradually tightening global financing conditions.
Forecast for 2018
Growth in India is projected to accelerate to 7.3 percent in FY2018/19 and 7.5 percent on average in 2019-20, reflecting robust private consumption and firming investment, broadly in line with January projections. In the rest of the region, growth will remain stable at about 5.6 percent in 2018 and throughout the forecast horizon as ongoing recoveries in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka are offset by slower growth in Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives.
In Pakistan, GDP growth is estimated to rise to 5.8 percent in FY2017/18, before moderating to 5.0 percent in FY2018/19, reflecting tighter policies to improve macroeconomic stability. In Bangladesh, growth is expected to recover from the effects of natural disasters in FY2017/18 and reach 6.7 percent in FY2018/19, supported in part by robust export growth and remittances.
Sri Lankas GDP is projected to grow 4.6 percent on average over the period 2018-20, reflecting a recovery from the effects of last years natural disasters on agriculture, as well as robust consumption and investment growth.
After the strong rebound in FY2016/17 from the effects of the devastating earthquakes in FY2015/16, Nepals GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 4.6 percent in FY 2017/18 and average 4.3 percent in 2019-20.
In Bhutan and Maldives, growth will continue to benefit from construction and services, especially tourism, and average 7.4 and 5 percent respectively over the forecast horizon.
In Afghanistan, growth will remain subdued due to continued security challenges and political uncertainty.
Risks
Risks to South Asia outlook are tilted to the downside, although upside surprises to global growth remain a possibility in the short-term.
These include domestic policy slippages, renewed security challenges, and natural disasters. The outlook could also be adversely affected by external shocks such as an abrupt tightening of global financial conditions and escalating trade protectionism, even though the region is relatively less open to trade.
Since South Asia is net oil importer, a higher-than-expected rise in oil prices might amplify macroeconomic vulnerabilities and weigh on economic activity.
In a number of countries, a further deterioration in fiscal balances (e.g., India, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka), a continued build-up of debt, and widening current account deficits (e.g., Pakistan), present significant vulnerabilities to a tightening of domestic or external financing conditions (Basu, Eichengreen, and Gupta 2015).
Furthermore, a setback in the implementation of reforms to resolve weakening corporate and financial sector balance sheets could hold back the investment recovery currently underway and dampen credit growth in the region.
An increase in political uncertainty (e.g., Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) and further deterioration in the security environment in some countries (e.g., Afghanistan) might dampen confidence and set back growth.
In recent years, the number of people and geographical areas affected by natural disasters such as drought, floods, and earthquakes has risen in the region.
A rise in the prevalence of natural disasters, including those caused by climate change, could disrupt infrastructure, agricultural output, and economic activity in general (e.g., Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka).

Red Bull Campus Cricket:
Sri Lanka gears up for seventh edition
The only global T20 cricket tournament for university students, the seventh edition of Red Bull Campus Cricket (RBCC) is soon to begin in Sri Lanka. This international cricket tournament provides the ideal opportunity for young cricketers to represent their university and thus gain an opportunity to further represent their country on an international level at the Red Bull Campus Cricket World Finals.
Red Bull recognized the importance of developing an international platform for campus cricket around the world. A highly revered sport in Sri Lanka, cricket is played with an unmatched passion and is a game for both body and mind. Globally, Red Bull is a preferred choice by leading sportsmen who recognize the importance of enhancing both the mind and body when playing sports. As such, campus cricket was the ideal choice.
RBCC aims at bridging the gap that exists for players from school to club teams, thus paving a clear pathway for talented players to reach national level. In the past RBCC has provided a platform where the world has witnessed the rise of now internationally acclaimed players, such as KL Rahul from India, Lungi Ngidi from South Africa, Chirag Suri from UAE, and Niroshan Dickwella from Sri Lanka.
Whilst connecting a generation of university goers and building a lasting comradeship are at the very heart of RBCC, sports is the center of the entire tournament. As such, RBCC follows very strict cricketing guidelines that maintain the game at high professional standards in the cricketing world. For Sri Lanka, tournament director and renowned former national cricket player Brendon Kuruppu is charged with the duties of ensuring the tournament follows proper guidelines and is played in the right spirit.
This year, RBCC has taken one step forward to encourage students to pursue their talent and passion in sports by bringing in veteran and 1996 world cup winning former cricketing legend Roshan Mahanama as the events brand ambassador. Roshans presence, along with that of Brendon Kuruppu, will lift the tournaments stature and, whilst increasing aspirations, further enhance the seriousness of sport and the tournament.
Over the past years, Sri Lanka has consistently proven to be a worthy contender at RBCC. After hosting the very first Asia Finals in 2012, the Sri Lankan team University of Moratuwa represented Sri Lanka at the first ever World Finals held at the R. Premadasa Cricket Stadium in 2013. In the years to follow, the National Finals were won by the International College of Business & Technology (ICBT) in 2014 and 2015, consequently representing Sri Lanka at the World Finals held at the Kia Oval in London and Dehradun, India respectively.
Hosted by Sri Lanka both in 2016 and 2017, the national finals were won by Business Management School (BMS) for two years in a row. While they emerged victorious and captured the coveted championship in 2016, the South African team won the world title in 2017.
This year, Sri Lanka is proud to host the Red Bull Campus Cricket Tournament for the fourth time. The World Finals will be played on home turf throughout the month of September, bringing this international stage to Sri Lanka once again. However, before gaining the opportunity to represent Sri Lanka, local teams must first conquer the national level. From Sri Lankas leading universities, 24 local teams will battle it out in front of hundreds of spectators from every university, in a tournament filled with fair amounts of fun and fierce competition. Commencing on the 19th of June at BRC and Colts Cricket grounds, the national tournament will bring together players and spectators from around the country amidst an atmosphere of feverish excitement.

- In Switzerland, you must pass a test and take a practical training class in order to have a dog. If you are a first-time dog owner, you have to take a theoretical class apart from a practical training class.
- In Little Rock, Arkansas, US, your dog cannot bark after 6 pm. Its the law!
- Anyone caught making ugly faces at a dog in Oklahoma, US, is subject to fines or even jail time. The dogs surely appreciate it, but enforcing this rule cant be easy. Can someone define ugly faces

Swiss court frees Tamil Tiger bankers
Switzerlands Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that 13 alleged financiers of the Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers were not guilty of supporting a criminal organisation and let them walk free.
Bringing to an end a nine-year process, the court found that prosecutors had not proved the accused had supported a criminal organisation. It acquitted five of them completely and handed suspended sentences to the others for lower-level financial offences, the ATS news agency reported.
The 13 defendants - 12 Tamils or Swiss citizens of Tamil origin plus one German - stood accused of participating in or supporting a criminal organisation, fraud, forgery, money laundering and extortion.
During their eight-week trial, began in January and closed in March, public prosecutor Juliette Noto had called for jail sentences of up to six and a half years, ATS said.
She charged that the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which oversaw a fundraising and money distribution operation, had created a sophisticated system to raise money from the Tamil community in Switzerland aimed largely at funding armed struggle in Sri Lanka.
According to the prosecution, families who refused to pay were threatened. But on Thursday, the court ruled that WTCC was not a criminal organisation and that the prosecution had failed to sufficiently prove a hierarchical link between it and the Tamil Tigers.
The prosecution, which was not permitted to use press articles as evidence, also failed to prove the Tigers were a criminal organisation, the court said. - AFP

Trinco port, a regional hub for bunkering operations - LIOC
Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC), a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation will intensify their bunkering operations in Sri Lanka focusing on the Trincomalee Port.
Senior Vice President, (Finance) LIOC, Anuj Jain said the company plans to make Trincomalee a hub for bunkering operations for the entire the region. Trinco port which is known as the worlds 5th best natural harbour provides an excellent opportunity to provide bunkering facilities for the vessels operating on the Bay of BengalWestern Countries shipping route.
He said they also have plans to develop the remaining tank farms in Trincomalee. However the trade unions are blocking this move and this project is now on hold. Lanka IOC already operates 15 oil storage tanks out of 99 tank farms in Trinco. He was speaking at a function to launch the 15th annual National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA) 2018 organized by National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile the company has observed that the retail fuel business is not as profitable as it was in the recent times. Hence, we have diversified into different areas such as supplying of other petroleum products which strategy has helped the company to maintain its local operations at a profitable level.
The LIOC has entered into the lubricant market in Sri Lanka and the business in that sector has been very productive. We have now moved up to the number two position in Sri Lankas lubricant market.
He also said the company is looking at more opportunities to diversify its business in Sri Lanka and looking at investing in solar and wind power generation business.We believe that such diversification will be the key for our success in Sri Lanka, Jain said.
Speaking further he said that they are happy the company could change some of the dynamics of the local petroleum industry since their entry into the market. When we invested in Sri Lanka, fuel was pumped in petrol sheds which were dilapidated and we introduced petrol stations which offered multiple services. This changed the entire concept of petrol pumping business.
We were happy that our brother Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) too followed us and today Sri Lanka has fuel stations of international level.
We observed how Sri Lankan consumers changed their vehicles and purchased the latest models in the international market. This gave us the opportunity to introduce several new Petro Chemicals and new types of fuel to the local market which has become very popular in the island. Commenting on the Sri Lankan energy sector he said, more investments are needed in that sector.
The 15th annual National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA) 2018 organized by NCCSL will be held on December 5 at the Colombo Hilton.
The print media sponsor of the event is Lake House.

UPUL CHANDANA - a brilliant Leg Spinning all rounder
Leg spinning/googly bowling all-rounders are born and not easily found or made. That type of bowling is the most difficult art in the aspects of bowling.
In the pre Test era the best ever in this style of bowling produced by the country were Gamini Goonasena and C.I. Gunesekera and several others who I have mentioned in previous articles and need no reiterating.
Going down memory lane in addition to Goonasena and Gunesekera, surprisingly others who bowled this difficult art were all all rounders and defies explanation. After entering the elusive Test playing portals the best leg spinning all rounder that the country produced was D.Somachandra de Silva who also went on to captain the country.
Most captains inexplicably have little or no confidence in leg spinners and by not playing them, chop their careers that could have won games for the country and could be classed with this style in world cricket.
Buy their wickets
The axiom was that leg spinners have to buy their wickets. Meaning that they have to leak runs to dismiss batsmen. Most captains fearing and not wanting to concede runs rarely preferred going in with a leg spinner. That was cowardice, that was because they did not understand the mayhem a good leg spinner could cause, fooling batsmen and getting wickets.
Before going on to describe the prowess of CHANDANA, it would be of interest to mention the bulls eye throw by CHANDANA who was fielding as a substitute from square leg that hit the wicket and had Englands Alec Stewart run out by yards at the London Oval.
That Test ended in a historic victory for Sri Lanka with the 'Matara Mauler' Sanath Jayasuriya making a double hundred and the dashing Aravinda de Silva making a century. That was the Test match where the best off spinner in world cricket Muttiah Muralitheran took nine England wickets.
If not for CHANDANA hitting the wicket to run out Stewart, who knows Muralitheran would have gone on to capture 10 wickets in an innings and join the famous Jim Laker of England and Anil Kumble of India who have captured 10 wickets in an innings. On a lighter note, Muralitheran would surely love to hate CHANDANA!
From Mahinda College, Galle
CHANDANA began his cricketing career at Mahinda College, Galle and from poor beginnings. He lost his father when he was seven.
His was a big family of 10 and they had to make do with the earnings of his elder brother.
However it did not deter him, but made him determined to one day make good. Continuing to play the game and showing immense all round talent, his career progressed and it was not long when his dream of playing for the country materialized.
CHANDANA played many eye catching knocks as a hard hitting middle order batsman, taking blinding catches and mesmerizing batsmen with his spin magic.
His one disappointment was that being in the squad that won the World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan he was not given a game. The other was former Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu.
One disappointment
He was delighted that he bowled and troubled great batmen of the calibre of Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar although troubling them but not being able to pocket them.
He began his international career in 2002 when he was named captain of the Sri Lanka A team against Kenya in an unofficial Test series where his talent blossomed both in batting and bowling where he headed the averages.
One innings that he still remembers is the big hitting 92 he made at Bridgetown in Barbados chasing massive West Indian score of 300 plus to help his side win which put the century by Brian Lara and Chris Gayles 94 to second best.
I have been on tour with CHANDANA and I remember the fifty odd he made against Australia in one-dayer in Melbourne peppering a strong Australian attack. He is modest, no big talk and is easy going and I can vouch for his simplicity.

Ven. Gnanasara sentenced to one years RI for Contempt of Court
Bodu Bala Sena Organization General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to one years Rigorous Imprisonment to be served in six months yesterday by the Homagama Magistrates Court.
The sentence was handed after the controversial monk was found guilty of intimidating Sandhya Ekneligoda, wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda at the Homagama Magistrates Court premises on January 26, 2015, and for contempt of court.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera was also slapped with a fine of Rs.3000 by Homagama Magistrate Udesh Ranatunga and was ordered to also pay Rs.50,000 as compensation to Ekneligoda after a motion was filed by her lawyers under the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witness Act.
Attorney-at-Law Manjula Makumbura representing the Thera requested the Magistrate for a lenient sentence by taking into account that he had no previous convictions and the service he had done for the country, such as, preserving Buddhism and creating racial harmony within the country.
Makumbura said the Thera is not someone who should be taken away from society due to his good work which benefits society at large.
However, Senior State Council Janaka Bandara vehemently opposing the possibility of handing a lenient sentence said an example must be made in this instance to give society a message that no one could act in such a manner before a court. He said leniency at a time where the courts have been insulted through his behaviour would only lead to the public losing trust in the court system while contributing to its collapse in society. Bandara, therefore, pleaded that the maximum possible sentence is given to the defendant. Attorney at Law Upul Kumarapperuma appeared for the plaintiff.
Before delivering the sentence, Magistrate Ranatunga said taking all representations into consideration said he believed a message must be sent to society and was basing his judgment accordingly.
While the Thera, against his lawyers advice requested to make a statement following the sentencing, it was declined. However, the Thera disregarding the order went on to question as to what wrong he had done to the country before being led away by Prison officials. However, the lawyers representing Ven.Gnanasara Thera said an appeal will be made against the sentence today. Speaking after the sentencing, Bodu Bala Sena National Organizer Ven. Vitharandeniye Nanda Thera said everything possible will be done to assist the monk and secure his release. It was not for his personal gain that he committed such an act and therefore we will appeal to courts for his release, the Thera said.
A large number of monks supporting Ven. Gnanasara Thera along with several laymen also conducted religious observances in front of a temple near the court premises after the sentencing.
Before being led away by Prison officials, the Magistrate admonishing the monk said he can oppose the sentence through an appeal and should refrain from making such statements which would only land him in further trouble.

Walkers with a divine touch
Tendency for people to take their own lives due to deprivation of love and warmth from the society and loved ones has increased in unprecedented volumes over the years. Thus it is high time the stigma prevailing in Sri Lankan society as regards to mental health and suicidal thoughts is erased for good.
People who live in shells swathed with such negative thoughts are seldom seen by the society, let alone the clergy. We do not proactively pay attention to their fears but rather address these situations in a reactive manner.
Putting a mentally sick person in an asylum or grieving over a dead body of a girl or a boy who has died by suicide is not what the world expect from a sensible community. The need for better awareness on mental health has become critical.
Footsteps to Freedom
`Footsteps to Freedom is a walk along the coastal belt of the island to raise the nations awareness on mental health and suicide prevention even in the most remote parts of the island.
A set of energetic youth have come forward to create awareness within the society of this adverse situation prevailing and discuss proactive ways of eradicating it. Via Footsteps to Freedom journey they have been able to address many a strata of the society on mental health and suicide prevention.
Nivendra Uduman, Sara Nazoor and Ranil Thilakaratne have spent almost three months travelling within Sri Lanka by foot. Nivendra is a counselling psychologist while Sara is a trainee psychologist. Ranil is from CCCline 1333, an organization that works primarily in the area of suicide prevention.
These young people have walked around the coast for over 1,400 kilometres and touched more than half a million lives, in an effort to erase the shame among vulnerable persons and raise awareness on mental health and suicide prevention.
In 73 days they have conducted over 100 interactive sessions and workshops in schools, hospitals and various other places of importance and even in nooks and corners of remote villages during their walk around Sri Lanka.
On June 12, concluding the journey that began on April 1, 2018, they returned home to Colombos Independence Square.
Speaking to the Daily News, Ranil Thilakaratne said We walked to mingle with the people and share thoughts on mental well being. Our object was to shatter the stigma that prevents people from seeking help.
We managed to save lives. People who were on the verge of committing suicide came out of the shadows to talk to us. We were able to refer them to counsellors and doctors. People who had addictions were eager to talk to us and find out ways and means to give up those addictions. Other than talking to people one-on-one we conducted workshops at various entities, he added.
Ranil highlighted the need for better awareness of the services that exist to support those struggling with their mental health.
A 15 year old girl has died by suicide, and it was harrowing to learn of her reason. She was a victim of rape and she has felt that she would be blamed and judged for what happened to her even though it was beyond her control. People need to know about the services that are available, he stressed.
Founder of Footsteps to Freedom Nivendra Uduman highlighted how important it is to simply listen to vulnerable persons.
A deputy principal of a school spoke about thoughts he was having towards ending his life due to health issues. He said he felt relieved after talking to me, he said.
Sara Nazoor as a trainee psychologist has found herself listening to many women who have revealed they had suicidal thoughts but were at the receiving end. Sara pointed to practical problems in the system that prevents better care for vulnerable persons.
Language barrier has taken its toll many a time. When a Tamil woman had called the toll-free number counsellors who could speak in Tamil weren't available. It was heart wrenching to know that at times I was the only person who was checking up on them, said Sara.

Postal Service trade union action unacceptable
Postal Service trade union action cannot be accepted at this juncture even though they have several justifiable reasons, Postal Ministry Secretary and Postmaster General said.
Several Postal Ministry Trade Unions were demanding the Government to settle several issues. The issues were created by the 6/2006 circular. One such issue is cancellation of Class 3 category from the postal service, he said.
Postmaster General D.L P. Rohana Abeyaratne addressing the media yesterday at the Postal Ministry said that the 6/2006 circular resulted in keeping a postal service employee at the same post for 40 years before they are promoted to the next position. Therefore, the demand to cancel the Class 3 is justifiable, he said.
He said the trade union action has caused an immense loss to the Postal Service. Transactions valued around Rs. 159 million are taken place daily. The trade union action stopped them.
Ministry Secretary R.M.D.B. Meegasmulla said the union action is not reasonable but they have several justifiable reasons.
A Cabinet paper was submitted and evaluated by a Cabinet Sub Committee chaired by Minister Sarath Amunugama. The Sub Committee received the Cabinet paper on June 11 and said they need two weeks to resolve the issues. However, the Trade Unions opted for trade union action on June 11 without giving time for the Committee to look into the matter. Then the Secretary said the trade union action cannot be accepted. The unions should have given enough time to the Committee to look into the issues, he said.
He said that of five issues, three were settled by the Committee and the other two will be resolved as soon as possible.
Meegasmulla said the Postal Service incurred an irreparable loss especially to its Airmail and Speed Post Courier Service due to the Trade Union action.

All Blacks branded cheats after France card row
WELLINGTON, Thursday: France backrower Kevin Gourdon called the All Blacks cheats on Thursday and said they were treated leniently by referees after they escaped punishment over a contentious incident in last week's first Test.
Gourdon's outburst, two days before the second Test in Wellington, follows condemnation of World Rugby's decision not to hand out further punishment over a tackle in which French wing Remy Grosso suffered two facial fractures.
All Blacks flanker Sam Cane was penalised on the field for a high shot on Grosso, while prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi escaped punishment for his role in the head-high collision with World Rugby saying his role fell "just short" of the red card threshold.
Immediately after the Test, won by New Zealand 52-11, French coach Jacque Brunel described the double hit as "dangerous" and "illegal" but later softened his stance, saying the collision was probably accidental.
But World Rugby vice chairman Agustin Pichot attached the words "should be cited (in) my view" to a tweet showing video of the tackle, which has ended Grosso's tour.
A former top referee, England's Rob Debney, wrote in The Times that officials' leniency towards the All Blacks "exists on a subconscious level. The accountability for taking a decision against them, the scrutiny it comes under compared with other teams, is incredible."
Gourdon said the All Blacks tended to get the rub of the green from referees "because they win all their games".
The All Blacks "cheat, of course, but it's certainly related to the fact they play good rugby... which has a positive effect on the referees", added the flanker.
SIN-BINNING NOT 'SIGNIFICANT'
All Blacks assistant coach Ian Foster dismissed the cheating allegations, and denied the world champions and number one Test team received any favouritism from officials.
"I think if you look at the penalty counts (and) yellow cards last year, we were one of the top yellow-carded teams in the world so I'm not sure how this 'soft on us' comes to fruition," he said.
Foster also reiterated that the All Blacks did not agree with the yellow card handed out to France lock Paul Gabrillagues last week for a tackle on Ryan Crotty.
"I think we've been pretty open and honest about how we interpreted last week," said Foster.
"We thought they were a little bit unlucky with their yellow card; it was one of those marginal ones. Was it up there Yes it was. Was it significant Probably not."
Cane's tackle on Grosso was high, for which he was penalised at the time.
"The question is: was it worthy of a yellow card And, I guess, between a referee and an independent citing commissioner, they've said no. So we've just got to take the emotion out of it," Foster said.
Brunel has made five changes for the second Test with Gourdon the only loose forward to survive from the first Test hiding, although he has been moved from the flank to the back row.  AFP

Amarapadma leads after two rounds
The June Edition of the Pin Fernando Grand-Prix conducted by the Sri Lanka Golf Union and powered by UTE Engineering, got underway at the beautiful but challenging Sri Lanka Air Force Eagles Golf Links in Trincomalee.
Veteran N. Amarapadma maintained his lead after the halfway mark, seven strokes ahead of second placed B A Sanjeewa. N. Ranga and J M D Indika were in joint third place, a further six strokes adrift. The scores returned indicated the difficulty of the course, especially the greens and short game which made scoring tough. Nonetheless, all top ranked players participated among over 35 entries and the cut-off was implemented for the top 20 players after two rounds. The final two rounds promises a close finish with current Grand-Prix leader Sisira Kumara and the pack of top players chasing down the leader to the final hole.

The Art of the Deal..!
Profit is the primary motive of a business deal. Who you make a profit from, how you made that profit, doesnt really matter as long as the final result keeps the cash register ringing. Seems, thats what the American president is now doing; as Chairman of a company called America, hes decided to use the art of the deal and show profits, unfortunately, what he and a number of Americans dont hear is a wailing across the ocean: Sir! wail the people of North Korea, Arent you the president of the worlds largest democracy
Yes! tweets the President proudly, I am!
Which means your people are free! Can speak what they want, do what they want, act the way they want
Yes! tweets the President proudly, Thats true!
Then why do you hobnob with a man, whos taken all this away from us How do you make a deal with a terrorist A man who threatened to bomb your country
And American generals commanding troops across the world, shake their heads in disbelief as they look at a stranger at their door, Who are you they ask, looking at the hooded man carrying a machine gun and bombs tied round his waist.
The terrorist who bombed your embassy!
So why have you come here Have you decided to give yourself up ask the generals.Ive come to be your best friend!
You cannot be my best friend, or friend for that matter! cry the generals, We fight to maintain law and order whereas you kill and maim to create chaos!
But isnt that your new policy asks the terrorist, guffawing, Isnt that what your president is telling the world: Do what you want, but leave us Americans alone
Who told you that
The terrorist flicks on the remote and the TV comes to life, Isnt that your president, hugging the biggest terrorist in the world who threatened to bomb his country
Businessmen compromise deals with tough opponents, but when a country with a strong, respected ideology decides to be cowed down by threats and signs treaties with those whove intimidated them, it shows a weak leader, or someone producing dubious profit to his shareholders.
I pull out a book, Id read many years ago, The Art of the Deal, written by Trump and place it next to a book brought to me by a tall bearded old fashioned looking man, trying to say something, Whats it Abe I ask.
Looks like this President is following his own book! says Abraham Lincoln, I wonder whether hes doing the same with all the criminals, thieves, rioters, shooters and gangsters in our country Telling them, You leave my voters alone, Ill keep you out of prison!
I nod at Abe and hear him say softly, Osama and Obama would have had tea together if the former president had followed the art of the deal..!

Call to expedite Constitutional reforms process
A vast number of progressive proposals that can make a real change in peoples lives will be missed if the Constitutional reforms process was stalled, Constitutional Assembly Secretariat Additional Secretary Yuresha Fernando said.
She was speaking at a panel discussion organised by the USAID and Internews at Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute on Wednesday. The event was to mark the launch of a report on Right to Information, Anti-Corruption and Bribery, Transitional Justice and Constitutional Reform.
She pointed out that the claims of Buddhism losing its foremost place and attempts of dividing the country, have overshadowed the public and media dialogue on Constitutional reforms.
Many progressive proposals that really matter to the peoples lives have come up during the process including a very expansive Chapter of Fundamental Rights, but these have never come to the public limelight, she stressed.
She said right to education, right to health services, right to environment, right to the ownership of property, right to privacy, right not to be subjected to disappearances, freedom to hold opinions without interferences, security of persons, freedom from exploitation, family rights, rights of children, senior citizens and persons with disabilities etc. have been newly added to the Fundamental Rights Chapter as per the proposals by the relevant sub-committee.
Recalling how a telephone call to the IGP led to a controversy in recent times, she observed the Law and Order Sub-Committee has proposed to include a new Clause stating that the subject minister can make no interference into case specific investigations. The subject minister can only take decisions on policies, she added.
The permanent secretaries in the ministries are now hesitant to take decisions. The Public Service Sub-Committee has proposed a new Clause to make even the minister equally responsible for any order or decision being carried out by a ministry secretary under the orders of a minister. This will give more confidence to the ministry secretaries, she noted.
She also pointed out that a proposal has been made to maintain a senior management group and to make appointments to higher positions in the public service from that group.
This way, political appointments to higher positions will cease as one does not qualify to get a higher appointment merely because of political influence, she added.
She urged to create a vibrant discussion on these aspects of Constitutional reforms as well without framing it entirely on Buddhism and power devolution. Do not be driven by the misinterpretations and half-baked truths when you analyze the claims of dividing the country. See whether there are checks and balances before coming to conclusions, she said.
Had the government taken the upper hand, it could have finished off the process by now, but the process consumed this much of time and effort because it was truly a multi-party process. Thats why the Steering Committee met 73 times. Reaching a political consensus across party lines was difficult and therefore, the report will contain two main parts, Principles and Formulations in the first and contentions and suggestions of various parties in the second, Fernando said.
Responding to a question by a journalist, she said the 20th Amendment proposed by the JVP has not affected the Constitutional reforms process, adding that all parties were actively taking part in Steering Committee meetings.
Right to Information Commission Director General Piyathissa Ranasinghe and National Media Centre Director Jagath Liyanarachchi were the other panelists at the event moderated by Shan Wijethunge.

Capital regulations to raise resilience  of SL finance Companies - Fitch
New capital-adequacy regulations for Sri Lankan finance companies are likely to improve the resilience of the sector to economic shocks, but will add to capitalisation pressures - particularly for the countrys numerous small-scale finance companies, says Fitch Ratings.
Fitch-rated finance companies are unlikely to face immediate rating action, as Fitch believes they all have adequate capital to meet the thresholds that will apply from July 1, 2018 - even after taking account of potential RWA changes, based on the current asset mix - and most already comply with the July 1,2021 thresholds. However, future rating action will take into account finance companies ability to meet the higher minimum requirements over the next few years. It is possible that some will require external capital to support loan growth and stay in compliance with the higher requirements.
Smaller finance companies had already been struggling to raise capital to comply with an earlier requirement that each finance company hold a minimum core capital of Rs 2.5 billion by January 1, 2021. The new minimum capital ratios are likely to add to those difficulties, although the lack of regular disclosures compared with banks prevents us from assessing in full the likely impact on individual finance companies.
The minimum Tier 1 ratio will increase from 5% to 6% for all finance companies on July 1, 2018, and then rise to 8.5% by July 1, 2021, with incremental increases each year. The minimum total capital ratio will also increase steadily. Additional capital surcharges for finance companies with assets of more than LKR100 billion will be introduced on a staggered basis from 1 July 2019, and will reach 150bp by 1 July 2021 (see chart).
Meanwhile, capital ratios will come under downward pressure from changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to bring the framework further into line with the recommendations of the Basel committee. The changes will substantially increase RWAs, stemming mainly from additional of risk weighting for operational risk and changes in the computation of RWA for credit risk.
Finance companies that are highly exposed to uncollateralised lending to retail borrowers - such as microfinancing - may see the sharpest increases in RWAs, as this lending will be risk-weighted at 125% instead of 100% previously. However, the new RWA methodology does not include market risk - unlike for banks - which the regulators view as low in this sector.
The document setting out the new capital regulations categorises finance companies with more than Rs100 billion - those facing the additional surcharge - as domestic systemically important licensed finance companies (D-SILFCs). However, we do not believe that this means the authorities consider these companies to have the same systemic importance as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs).
Accordingly, we continue to see the propensity for sovereign support for Fitch-rated finance companies as very low.

Disappearance of 11 youth:
CDS helped Navy offficer escape legal action
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) informed court that Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne had aided and abetted Navy officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi to escape from legal action by allowing him to avoid court warrants issued against him.
Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi is a wanted suspect in connection with the disappearance of 11 youth in Colombo in 2008 and 2009.
The CID told court that he had fled the country with the blessings of former Navy Commander and Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne.
The CID informed the Court, according to the earlier statement given by Navy Lieutenant Commander Laksiri Galagamage about the suspect (Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi), the CID had found that former Navy Lieutenant Commander Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi was in the Navy officers quarters during the period that court had issued the warrant.
The CID had found that Chandana Prsad Hettiarachchi and current (CDS) Ravindra Wijegunarathne were as in the same Navy officers quarters.
The CID had found the CDS had used two rooms in the seventh upper floor. The CID officers have found the meal chart of Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi during that period.
Further, they have informed court that Ravindra Wijegunarathne helped Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi to hide in the officers quarters. The CID had requested the Navy Commander to submit Documents pertaining to the vacate of post by Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi and his official vehicle.
Since the Navy had failed to submit the relevant documents on the suspects and witnesses as requested during several previous hearings, Counsel appearing for the aggrieved party Attorney-at-Law Achala Senevirathne requested the Magistrate to issue a notice on the Navy to handover these documents to the CID.
The CID stated that they would take necessary action to arrest Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi.
Two other suspects Kasthurige Gamini and Aruna Thushara Mendis were ordered to be further remanded until June 28. The Magistrate fixed the hearing for June 28.

It was more than a case of doing what the Romans do when a group of Ceylinco Life policyholders and their families spent four days in the Eternal City recently courtesy of the life insurance leader.
The group, comprising of the grand prize winners in the 11th edition of Ceylinco Lifes Family Savari promotion, undertook a city tour, visited the Vatican Museum, the Sistine Chapel, St Peters Basilica, the Colosseum, Piazza Navona and the Pantheon and enjoyed a grand farewell dinner and get-together on the last day of the tour.
Rome was the fifth European destination offered as the grand prize in the Family Savari promotion series, following previous visits by Ceylinco Life policyholder families to cities in France, Switzerland, Germany and England. Ceylinco Life has also treated winners to holidays in Japan, China, Dubai and Singapore.
In May this year, Ceylinco Life hosted two other groups of policyholder families, from 200 people that had won a visit to Singapore and 4,000 that were chosen for a days outing at the Leisure World theme park under Family Savari 11. Another 40 people representing 10 policyholder families have won a holiday in China which is due to take place from 28th June to 1st July.
All expenses pertaining to these tours including accommodation in 4-star hotels, guided tours, air fares and excursions, are borne by Ceylinco Life.
Conducted annually since 2006, the Ceylinco Life Family Savari promotion is intended to increase the penetration of life insurance and to reward policyholders for keeping their policies active. It is the largest customer promotion in Sri Lankas insurance industry. In all, Family Savari 11 produced 4,260 winners from 1,065 policyholder families, an increase of 2,000 people over the 2,260 rewarded annually at previous Family Savari promotions. Since its inception, nearly 24,000 people have won overseas holidays or an excursion to the Leisure World theme park under this programme.

Cheryshev stars as Russia rout Saudi Arabia in WC opener
Moscow, Thursday: Denis Cheryshev struck twice for Russia as the World Cup hosts thumped Saudi Arabia 5-0 in the opening match of the tournament in Moscow on Thursday.
Iury Gazinsky scored after 12 minutes and Cheryshev added a second before the break after coming on as an injury replacement for Alan Dzagoev.
Artem Dzuyba netted a third before terrific late efforts from Cheryshev and Aleksandr Golovin wrapped up Russias first win since October to launch their Group A campaign in style. Russia headed into the curtainraiser at the 80,000-capacity Luzhniki, the crucible of Russian and Soviet sport, without a victory in over eight months and ranked a lowly 70th in the world.
For Saudi Arabia it was a return to the global showpiece for the first time in 12 years, with their only previous finals wins at the 1994 World Cup.
Only South Africa, in 2010, have failed to advance from the group stage as the host nation and a seven-match winless run had ramped up the pressure on Stanislav Cherchesovs side. A lack of an attacking threat in recent outings was a primary concern for Russia going into a group campaign in which they will also face Egypt and Uruguay.
Those fears were soon washed away, at least for the time being, as Alexander Samedov and Fedor Smolov carved out early chances only to be denied by desperate sliding blocks.
The opening goal came soon after, as Saudi Arabia failed to clear a corner and a curling cross in from the left by Golovin picked out an unmarked Gazinsky to head low into the far corner. It was a goal that prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to turn to the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, seated alongside FIFA chief Gianni Infantino, and shake his hand.
Russia lost Dzagoev to a hamstring injury midway through the first half, the CSKA Moscow midfielder clutching his hamstring as he crumpled to the turf.
But his replacement, former Real Madrid winger Cheryshev, celebrated his recent recall to the national side with Russias second goal two minutes before half-time. Cheryshev was still left with plenty of work to do inside the area after a pass from Roman Zobnin, brilliantly flicking the ball past two closing defenders before rifling into the roof of the net. Saudi briefly threatened early in the second half when an inviting cross in from the right skipped just beyond the reach of Taiseer Al-Jassam.
Russia then nearly grabbed a third when Abdullah Al-Muaiouf spilled a low drive from Roman Zobnin, the Saudi goalkeeper recovering just time in time to nudge the ball away from Smolov. The forward was soon replaced by Dzyuba, who struck almost immediately by heading another Golovin cross beyond a helpless Muaiouf in the 71st minute.
Cheryshev hammered in a fourth with the outside of his left in stoppage time and Golovin capped a magnificent performance by bending in a last-gasp free-kick.
Russia meet Egypt in their next match on June 19 in Saint Petersburg, while Saudi Arabia will look to rebound against group favourites Rostov-on-Don a day later. AFP

MORE ON LIFE AND SUFFERING
As stated by Joe Perera in his above captioned letter appearing in your issue of June 13, there had been several letters on this unanswerable question  Life and Suffering, from eminent persons who shown interest. I could make mention of Dr. Upul Wijayawardhana as one such who writes questioning life and religions.
Christians believe in God and Muslims in Allah for our destinies in our lives inclusive of diseases. Buddhists and Hindus believe in Karma guiding our destinies or happenings, Rationalists believe in nature and scientist say it is Chance. All these  God, Allah, Nature and Chance mean one unknown force. The medical explanation as to how diseases occur says When people do certain things that should not be done, these behaviours plus ones genetic weaknesses result in abnormalities called disease. If they never did certain things, these weaknesses like Cancer, High blood pressure etc. would never occur.
However, this does not answer the mysterious question entirely. My humble view is as long as man lives against nature and try to improve life and longevity artificially, taking drugs, eating foods, diseases take hold on man. Did our forefathers die of Cancer, High Blood Pressure, Heart attacks etc. They ate raw meat, vegetables, fresh fruits and breath fresh air all provided by nature. Of course they did not live long, but a short period, given by nature. And that short period was sweet happiness.
Craving, greed and unnatural living to extend life are the main causes, is the answer.

Coach resigns following shock loss to Thailand:
Conflict among senior players, lack of team unity downfall of womens cricket - Devapriya
Sri Lanka womens cricket team coach Hemantha Devapriya who resigned from his position with immediate effect yesterday said that the failure to promote youngsters into the national team and conflict amongst senior players were main causes for the downfall of Sri Lanka womens cricket today.
The national team hit an all-time low when they were defeated by four wickets by Thailand, a team without any international status yet in the Womens T20 Asia Cup match played in Kuala Lumpur and failed to qualify for the final finishing fourth out of six teams with two wins and three losses. Thailand incidentally was coached by a Sri Lankan, former fast bowler Janak Gamage who played four ODIs for the country in 1995.
Ive decided that enough is enough and decided to step down from my position immediately after that defeat, Devapriya told the Daily News. We have not performed well in the last three series against West Indies, Pakistan and the Asia Cup. The side needs big changes if we are to be ready for the next World Cup but those changes are not forthcoming despite me including the shortcomings in my tour reports time and again.
We need to build a young side and with Sri Lanka Cricket now promoting the game at school level there is a lot of young players coming through but what we see is the same players being picked for every series, Devapriya lamented.
There is no unity in the present team as seniors have a lot of conflicts within them. As a result there is no consistency in performances. Most of the players are unfit and when you talk to them they treat everything in a negative manner which has a very bad effect on the younger players, Devapriya added.
I have been handling this team for the past 18 months and unless the selectors bring in youngsters who are now being taught the game at a younger age and will be able to perform better, I cant see the side improving from what it is today. We have been in this situation for a long time and radical changes have to be made if we are to move forward, Devapriya a former Sri Lanka wicket-keeper/batsman and coach for the past 17 years said.
Devapriya has been handling coaching with CCC, NCC, Fingara Cricket Academy before undertaking the role of head coach of Sri Lanka A and then the womens team.
Whilst thanking Devapriya for his services, SLC will start the process of engaging a new coach to take the womens team forward, Ashley de Silva, CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket, said.
Sri Lanka Womens next international engagement is hosting Indian Women in September and then playing in the World T20 in the West Indies in November.

## Title: Dealing with disaster
## Supertitle:

## Date: Friday, June 15, 2018 - 01:00
Dealing with disaster
Sri Lanka braces itself for yet another round of floods; the third in as many years. As floods and droughts become regular occurrences, how should the nation respond
The impact of this years floods is not yet known but likely to be heavy. In May 2017 floods and landslides affected 15 of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka. The drought in 2016 and 2017 affected 1,927,069 people across 17 districts, many of them poor.
Approximately 12 per cent of those affected were poor, nearly twice the national average of 6.7 per cent. In the case of the landslides, this is because the 11 affected Divisional Secretary (DS) Divisions tend to be poorer than the national average. Those affected by the floods overall were also disproportionately poor, with an estimated poverty rate of 8.7 per cent. (World Bank)
If the poor are disproportionately affected by natural disasters it has a negative impact on poverty and therefore has the highest level of priority for policymakers.
Little can be done about the weather but proper risk management can minimise its impact. The Government needs to move from the unplanned and ad-hoc reaction when disaster strikes to a proactive, systematic management of risk, something that may be illustrated by the example of Chile.
The earthquake that rocked Chile in 2010, one of the largest in history that wiped out roughly 18% of the countrys GDP  a massive impact. (The impact Sri Lankas 2017 floods was only 0.4% of GDP.) Yet Chile demonstrated a miraculous recovery. Most countries that suffer catastrophes of that magnitude take years or even decades to recover. Chile did it quickly, how did it do so
Several factors contributed overall to the low casualty rate and rapid recovery.
The Government had decided to prioritise the role it played in managing disasters. First, in minimising damage, because of its history with natural disasters, Chiles Government had developed a strong building code and ensured it was properly enforced. In particular, Chile had a law that held building owners accountable for losses in a building they built for 10 years. Furthermore, while not legally required, almost all homeowners in Chile had earthquake insurance because banks required it in order to get a loan to buy a house.
Second, the disaster response had been well-planned- the number of fires after the earthquake was limited due to the immediate shut down the electricity grid and the local emergency response was very effective. The third factor was education: the overall high level of knowledge about earthquakes and tsunamis by much of the population that helped them respond more appropriately after the event.
After the disaster, any government faces the question of how reconstruction will be paid for. Did Chile wait for aid to arrive No.
Following the quake, because of the sheer size of the disaster, Chile was compelled to increase taxes temporarily. But the policies that ensured that a large part of the homeowner market was insured paid off  it minimised the amount the Government needed to finance. Together these contained the financial ramifications from the earthquake and put Chile quickly on the road to recovery.
Although Sri Lanka never experienced anything like the devastation in Chile, natural disasters in Sri Lanka take a heavy toll on resources and people. Apart from the human cost they disrupt agricultural output (which may affect exports) and increase food inflation. The contraction of economic activity negatively impacts government revenue while simultaneously creating new budget pressures in the form of disaster relief. In the four months of 2017, the government reportedly incurred LKR 1,397 million for the provision of disaster relief (World Bank).
How can risk be managed
Small risks may be managed by households and slightly larger ones at the level of the community but for largest risks governments have a critical role, providing an enabling environment for shared action and responsibility and channelling direct support to vulnerable people.
The problem needs to be tackled across three fronts:
1. Preventive measures that minimise the impact of disasters.
2. Early warning systems and evacuation plans that allow people to leave disaster zones to safer areas.
3. Managing the financial risks from natural disasters.
Preventive measures
1. Floodplain zoning
A flood zoning authority must be created and floodplains (the water channel, flood channel and low land susceptible to floods) must be surveyed. The survey forms the basis of establishing floodplain zones, including delineation of the areas subject to flooding and classification of land with reference to the relative risk of flood.
Specific activities and uses (settlement and economic) in designated areas should be subject to administrative permits and building/land use codes. Eg. Building and design standards must protect against inundation. Restrictions and prohibitions should be based on risk assessments.
The public should be made aware of the dangers of floods and the need to restrict use.
Information about restrictions on construction in flood areas should be easily accessible and information about risk assessments should be easily understood, for example, clear flood maps and, where appropriate, information based on geographic information systems (GIS) should be distributed. Mandatory disclosures of risk could be included for property transfer or rental in areas of risk.
2. Conservation of wetlands
Wetlands are natural sponges that trap and slowly release surface water, rain, groundwater and flood waters. They are important in both flood and drought management so as far as possible natural wetlands and retention areas in the river basin should be conserved, and where possible restored or expanded.
3. Modifying the flood flow: Engineering measures
Diversions, reservoirs, channelisation (increasing the capacity of the channel), bank protection (to prevent bank erosion), dams and floodplain restoration (creating washlands that can safely take overflows) will play a role in minimising impact. Engineering measures must be in harmony with the landscape and nature conservation. A holistic approach covering the whole river basin is needed as localised flood protection measures can have negative effects both downstream and upstream.
Early warning systems and education
Forecasting and early warning systems should be established and guidelines issued on how populations are to act during floods.
Education on measures that can be taken at the level of individual households to either limit the damage when flooding occurs or prevent inundation is needed, eg. elevation of structures, elevated curb stones to prevent water entry from smaller events, reinforcement of foundations to avoid structural damage, moving building contents (and particularly electrical installations) above flood water levels (either temporarily or permanently), dry flood proofing to make areas below flood water levels watertight and temporary or permanent flood walls (ranging from sandbags to free-standing concrete barriers).
Forecasts and related information must be easily accessible and real-time media coverage ensured.
Managing financial risks of natural disasters
The GoSL exposure to disaster risk is through the costs of relief/recovery, reconstruction of public assets, compensation and (re)insurance schemes that provide coverage for disasters.
Several tools are available:
i. Insurance, GoSL already has some cover with the National Insurance Trust Fund but premia can be reduced through risk reduction  eg. land-use planning, flood defences etc. which will also support private insurance, which can top-up overall compensation.
ii. Risk pooling - insurance coverage for a pool (or its full portfolio) of Government assets. Insurance arrangements that cover a broader pool of assets facing more diversified risks can have cost advantages over insuring the assets in a flood zone.
iii. Multi-country pooling (done by several Pacific, Caribbean, African nations) provide small countries with improved access to international insurance markets based on their ability to merge a set of (less) correlated risks.
iv. Catastrophe bonds: bonds where the principal or interest payments are delayed or lost to investors in the event of a disaster.
v. Contingent credit lines with multilateral development agencies can bridge short-term shortfalls.
These are some possible options, careful assessment of the relative costs and benefits of different approaches is necessary. Once zoning is complete, the Government could lead the way in the relocation of some public assets away from areas of risk.
Rethinking agricultural policy
Agriculture is being affected by social, economic and environmental pressures. Current policies which encourage domestic agriculture need to be reviewed in the light of changing the climate, society- fewer people wish to take up agriculture, labour shortages and pressures on land use.
Policies that encourage risky production choices in flood zones or increase vulnerability to droughts and floods should be avoided. Allocation of water rights should reflect sustainable use and will help mitigate the impact of droughts. The Government must understand the impact that disasters have on poverty and recognise the proper role it must play in managing these risks. Ad-hoc responses grab headlines but working strategically to minimise long-term risks-a harder and thankless task, is the way to go.

Deputy Minister vows to rout drug menace
Newly appointed Public Administration, Management, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said yesterday that he would launch a massive programme to eliminate the narcotics menace from the country with the fullest cooperation of his Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the Police Department.
The Deputy Minister, addressing the gathering after assuming duties at his office yesterday, said that drug trafficking, underworld gangs, and other criminal organisations grew in size and strength during the previous regime, but we cannot see such a situation today.
He further said a large number of local and foreign narcotics are available the market and both schoolchildren and youth are largely addicted to them. We will take steps to eliminate this menace, he added.
He said both law and order and public services are major sectors directly important to the people of the country.
I am extremely happy that I have got the opportunity to work with Minister Madduma Bandara who has proven efficiency and a good character as well as many decades of experience in politics. I am committed to taking the vision of this government forward to the best of my ability.
Public Administration, Management, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said that he is happy that an efficient and committed young politician has been appointed as his deputy.
Our mandate from the January 8 election is to bring culprits who rob the countrys wealth to justice. However, when we are working under the democratic framework, the Opposition is trying to blame and obstruct us. If there any crime occurs anywhere in the country, the Opposition is trying to pin the blame on the government.

Does your dog feel guilty  or just embarrassed
Marc Bekoff (University of Chicago)
A few years ago, my daughter Eleanor went for a walk with her boyfriend Tom, whod been staying with us. They took our much-loved golden retriever, Fergus.
When they came back, Fergus padded urgently into the kitchen to find my wife, Jane. He looked at her solemnly, nudged her with his wet nose, then turned tail and led her purposefully to the bottom of the stairs.
We dont allow Fergus upstairs, but he stood there, gazing up and whimpering gently. Jane got the message and ran to find Eleanor, in her bedroom, distraught.
On the walk, Tom had abruptly ended the relationship. It was, effectively, Fergus who broke the news to Jane.
We have a great deal of anecdotal evidence that dogs can be remarkably sensitive creatures, in tune with the needs and moods of their human owners.
But Marc Bekoff, a Professor of evolutionary biology, has gone a step further, explaining not just what dogs do, but why they do it.
For example, we have always vaguely wondered why our other dog, a poodle-schnauzer cross called Finnegan, usually turns round and round before he settles to do a poo.
Remarkably, many dogs, obeying some kind of primal instinct, line up with the Earths magnetic field before they do their business. As for their energetic sniffing of places where other dogs have urinated, again Bekoff offers some fascinating insight.
They can tell whether the earlier dog was male or female, young or old, and can even pick up its sexual urges. He estimates that the average dog will spend at least a third of its walk taking in most odiferous scents and leaving its own.
Dogs are able to communicate basic emotions, such as joy, love, anger, fear, grief, anxiety and even depression. We know that they can suffer from post-traumatic stress and exhibit signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder, often in response to the way the humans around them are behaving.
If your dog does appear stressed, Bekoff might have a musical solution. Rather splendidly, he cites research which indicates that soft rock and reggae have a soothing effect on highly-strung dogs.
Bekoff suggests that dogs also experience forms of more complex emotions, such as jealousy, guilt, shame, embarrassment, pride and empathy.
While he cautions against the tendency to anthropomorphise the canine world, you dont need to be a Walt Disney animator to recognise an almost human level of empathy in a lovely story he tells about a dog called Ruby, who helped another dog, Wicket, cross a frozen stream.
Wicket was afraid to go on her own, so Ruby, who had already made it across, went back and, after ten unsuccessful attempts, convinced Wicket to follow her over the ice.
Of course, the temptation to see what some dogs do as being almost human stems from the assumption that they are inferior to us in every way. Theyre not.
That sense of smell, for instance, is around 40 times more highly evolved than our own.
The real fascination of this book, however, lies not so much in what dogs do better than us, but in the virtues they have that we always considered to be ours alone.
Bekoff offers several examples of a doggie sense of humour and I particular like the story of a five-year-old Bernese mountain dog called Benson who likes to walk up to his owner, look her in the eyes, and, after a comedy beat, issue a loud burp.

Easy Pet Care Tips
1. Keep your dog on a leash every time you go for a walk. Even the best-behaved dog can forget his training if he encounters an unfamiliar smell or sound, another dog, or a squirrel that simply must be chased.
2. Keep your cat inside all year round. Cats do not need to go out the way dogs do, and will lead longer, safer lives if kept indoors.
3. Turn your pet into an easy rider. Take your puppy or kitten for short, uneventful rides so he will become accustomed to the cars sounds and movement.
4. Check your pets water often. All pets  dogs, cats, birds, hamsters  need a steady supply of fresh water.
5. Give your cat water, not milk, to drink. Too much milk can upset Kittys stomach.
6. Remember that dogs and cats have different nutritional needs. So dont feed your cat a steady diet of dog food, or vice versa.
7. Feed your pet a diet thats appropriate to his time of life. Puppies and kittens should eat pet food especially formulated for their growing bodies. Older pets need to beware of weight gain, and may need a different pet food than they enjoyed as younger adults. Discuss your pets changing dietary requirements with your vet.
8. Treat expectant new mothers with care. Pregnant and lactating dogs and cats have special demands on their bodies. Discuss their unique dietary needs with your vet.
9. Get to know your pets eating habits. A sudden change in appetite or thirst can be a sign that your pet isnt feeling well. If you notice something is amiss, contact your vet.
10. Groom your pet regularly. Make it a part of his routine and hell come to expect it, maybe even welcome it as special time spent with you. Whats more, youll notice a decrease in shedding and an improvement in his skin and coat.
11. Make sure that all open windows have secure screens. Frequently, house cats are seriously injured falling from upper-level windows.
12. Only give your dog safe US-made rawhide, rubber, or nylon bones. These store-bought bones wont splinter the way chicken or turkey bones can.
13. Never let your cat play with yarn or string. It could cause internal injuries if swallowed.
14. Dont assume that doggie breath is normal. Bad breath could be an early sign of dental problems. Mention it to your vet.
15. Choose the right spot for your cats litter box. Your cat will be much happier using a box that is in a quiet area and offers both easy access and a little privacy.
16. Never give your pet chocolate. It can be poisonous to both dogs and cats.
17. Learn which common house and garden plants are poisonous to pets. Many plants you see every day  including daffodils, marigolds and philodendrons  can be toxic if your dog or cat eats them.
18. Keep a copy of Pet Pages handy at all times. Accidents always happen when you least expect them. And if your pet requires emergency medical care, youll know who to call.
19. Please have your pet spayed or neutered! This inexpensive, permanent procedure helps reduce behavior and health problems  and prevents unwanted litters. Remember, there are too many homeless dogs and cats already!
