Injured former champion Nibali ruled out of Tour de France, says team
L'Alpe d'Huez, Friday: Former champion Vincenzo Nibali was forced out of the Tour de France on Thursday after fracturing his back in a collision during a drama-packed 12th stage to the summit of Alpe d'Huez, his Bahrain team doctor confirmed.
Nibali, who claimed his sole yellow jersey in 2014, was transported to hospital with a suspected vertebra fracture after coming down hard around 4km from the summit of the legendary Tour climb.
Early reports, later backed up by Nibali, claimed he had collided with a police motorcycle.
However a video which emerged hours after the stage finish, shown on the website gazzetta.it, suggested a bag strap, flag or arm got in Nibali's way as he negotiated his way, shrouded in yellow smoke from rocket flares being set off, through a throng of hyper-excited fans.
Bahrain confirmed he had fractured the "tenth vertebra in his back" and would not start Friday's 13th stage from Bourg d'Oisans to Valence because of "difficulty breathing".
Nibali later confirmed his departure in a message to fans on his Twitter page. "Hi guys, I've returned to the hotel but unfortunately the outcome of the medical report isn't good," he said.
"They confirmed I've fractured one of the verterbrae, so tomorrow (Friday) I head home to begin my recovery.
"Thanks for all the affection you've shown me. See you soon!"
Despite being helped back on his bike, and valiantly finishing only 13secs behind stage winner Geraint Thomas of Team Sky, the crash ended Nibali's bid to stay in contention on the race, which he leaves after climbing to fourth overall at 2:37 behind the British race leader.
Before being taken to hospital in Grenoble, the Italian appeared to blame a police motorbike.
"As the road narrowed, there were two police motorbikes closeby," he said.
"(Chris) Froome accelerated, I followed him. Suddenly, it slowed down in front of me, and I hit the deck.
"I was feeling good, I really believed in my chances. It's a pity. But these kinds of things can happen when there's a lot of people on the road."

Labour market oriented education ensured - PM
The awarding of graduate teacher appointments to the Sri Lanka Teacher Service (2018) required to teach advanced level vocational subjects at national and provincial schools was held at Temple Trees under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Premier said 13 years of continuous education for all students has now become a reality and all children would be able to achieve success in any field they preferred to study disregarding their performances at the GCE O/L exam.
Unemployment has become a burning issue in society due to the absence of labour market oriented education, the PM said.
Wasting our countrys human resource based on their O/L results is a crime.To overcome this situation, the government is dedicated to ensure 13 years of continuous education for all students,the Prime Minister said.
He said the Education Ministry has already introduced a new subject stream to GCE A/L syllabus following the education system in Finland. The project was implemented as a pilot project from October 2017.
If we consider O/L as an examination which decides the higher education or advanced level education, most of the students will have to end their education after 11 years, he said.
According to the agreement signed with Finland, it was necessary to recruit new teachers who can teach vocational subjects. But no such teachers available in the teaching service. So the subject Minister proposed to recruit new teachers who had studied vocational subjects in school.
Therefore, the group of 1,150 teachers who received their appointments will undergo special teacher training in vocational training.
As the first group of vocational education teachers of the country and the Asia, the newly recruited teachers have a responsibility of making this programme a success. The future of this endeavour completely on the success of this first group, the Premier said.
Addressing the occasion, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said all these teachers were selected through a competitive examination.
The 13 years of guaranteed education programme will allow students, who do not pass the GCE Ordinary Level to proceed to Advanced Level, to pursue vocational studies to succeed in future, the minister said.Under the programme 26 new vocational subjects will be introduced for students who do not pass the GCE Ordinary Level.
The government has allocated Rs.5 billion to implement the 13 Years Certified Education covering the entire school system from 2019.

Lankan coach praises efforts of S African bowlers and Maharaj
Sri Lankas acting head coach who is also their batting coach Thilan Samaraweera praised the efforts of South Africas bowlers especially left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj who took a career best eight wickets on the first day of the second Test match at the SSC grounds yesterday.
You have to give credit to South Africas bowlers. The three seamers in this hot and humid condition did well to send down 45 overs. Maharaj was really superb. He bowled good areas and created pressure and delivered some good balls to dismiss our top order, said Samaraweera at the end of the day.
We knew that with the new ball it was easy to score runs. But after lunch we knew it was going to be tough. The one hour period after lunch where they were looking to reverse swing the ball and more spin came to play as well. You have to give credit to the opposition. We had maybe two soft dismissals. They were on the money. The openers and Dhananjaya de Silva were superb. Dhananjaya has gone through lot of tough times and he did well to top score today, he said.
Samaraweera said that it was too early to assess how much of spin there is on the pitch but expected all three Lankan spinners to play a part today. The pitch is spinning, but you have to wait till South Africa bats.. After that I can tell you whether the wicket is spinning or not. At the moment it looks like spinning. Lots of credit for Maharaj, who bowled really well, said Samaraweera.
If we bowled in the right areas, one will spin and one will go straight. That is the beauty of home advantage. When the game goes on it will be hard to bat on the third and fourth innings on these kinds of surfaces. Never underestimate our third spinner Akila Dananjaya he is a quality bowler.
I am sure all three spinners will come to play tomorrow. The last six or seven overs the pitch behaved differently. Their part-time off-spinner was getting a lot of bounce. At the moment we are very confident, but we have to bowl in the right areas and if do that, we can take wickets, he said.
MAHARAJ UNDERPLAYS BOWLING EFFORT
South African left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj underplayed his superb bowling performance of 8 for 116 saying that accolades meant a lot more when a Test match is won and hopefully he will be able put on another similar performance in the second innings and be on the winning end of it.
I am a little bit fatigued, but I should wake up fresh tomorrow after having a lovely meal tonight - probably two meals. It is different bowling longer spells in the subcontinent to what youre used to back home.
Heat plays a massive factor here. Theres a lot of pressure from around you. I was a bit fatigued at the end of my spell, said Maharaj who turned his arm over for 32 of the 86 overs bowled for the day. Commenting on the pitch Maharaj said, I did get a little bit of assistance off the wicket. It is a little bit different here than in Galle, because the ball skids on. Theres a chance of getting lbws and also the top edge when the batsmen sweeps. I also beat some of the batsmen in the air, with the ball dipping on them.
Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath is a master of that dipping ball and an enthralling contest could be on the cards when South Africa bats today. Maharaj said all the hard work he put in over the years is finally paying dividends.
Ive always prepared the same for every Test match. I think it was written in the stars by God that things worked out this way. In these last few days Ive pushed extremely hard just to keep that rhythm going from the second innings of the last Test match. I know that for me personally, I like to be zoned out before a Test, bowling with just Hendo and Prasanna (coaches) after hours aided my performance today.

Several low-income householders, who received credit facilities from the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) in 2017, have ignored the payment of their monthly housing loan premiums.
The NHDA has to receive Rs. 2.8 million as arrears of loans obtained by those who have already built their houses with the financial aid provided by the NHDA, Kurunegala District Office. Accordingly, 3,278 householders of 30 Divisional Secretary divisions in the Kurunegla District have thus failed to pay back their loan installments, said NHDA Kurunegala District Manager N. K. B. S.

Returns third best figures by a bowler against Sri Lanka
Maharaj (8/116) puts the skids under Lankan batting
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj used mostly as a defensive bowler to tie up one end while the South African pacies ripped batsmen out from the other seized his chance to show the stuff he is made of given the attacking options by producing the third best bowling figures by any bowler against Sri Lanka on the opening day of the second cricket Test played at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Maharaj who came onto bowl as early as the 15th over despite South Africa playing three quick men gave a wonderful performance to end the day with figures of 8 for 116 off 32 overs as Sri Lanka winning the toss finished on 277 for nine wickets. It was also easily his career best improving on the figures of 6 for 40 he took against New Zealand at Wellington last year.
Maharaj could still end up with the best figures by an opposing bowler against Sri Lanka if he captures the last wicket today. Only two bowlers (both fast bowlers) have better figures than him  Imran Khan of Pakistan who took 8 for 58 at Lahore in 1982 and Shannon Gabriel of West Indies who took 8 for 62 at St Lucias in 2018.
It was a not a first day total that Sri Lanka would have expected when they took lunch at 93 for no loss. Danushka Gunathilaka and the in-form Dimuth Karunaratne scored fifties apiece as they pieced together the first century opening partnership for Sri Lanka in 21 Tests since 2016.
It was actually Sri Lankas top three batters who contributed to the total with Dhananjaya de Silva also joining the openers with a brave innings of 60 off 109 balls (8 fours) overcoming a painful blow on the right shoulder from a Rabada snorter that caught him in two minds when he had scored 47.
As for the rest of the batting they got starts but failed to carry on and make a big score as Maharaj assisted by the pace bowlers kept the Lankan batting on a tight leash not allowing them the liberty to score freely. Kusal Mendis began confidently but once again fell foul to a shot that he would regret when he played a shade too early and popped a simple catch to mid wicket.
Roshen Silva during his 68 minutes at the crease clearly showed his discomfort against genuine pace. He really needs to work on his technique. Lack of feet movement to get to the ball is whats causing him to swish at balls outside the off stump.
Dickwella plays the way he only knows that is to sweep and attack the bowling. He tried to sweep one too many and ended up top edging a catch to slip. Mathews is badly in need of a big score and one is long overdue from him being the most senior batsman in the team. He scratched around for 10 off 24 balls before edging Maharaj to slip in the first over after tea. But it
was enough to get him across the 5000-run mark in Test cricket making him the ninth Sri Lankan to do so.
The way Maharaj performed would have left a doubt in the mind of South African skipper Faf du Plessis whether it would have been a good idea to have played two spinners. Maharaj was called onto bowl 32 overs in extreme hot and humid energy sapping conditions and he obliged his captain dutifully bowling unchanged throughout the afternoon session capturing 3 for 40 in 15 overs.
To compensate for a second spinner South Africa used part timers Markram and Elgar who between them sent down 10 overs and found appreciable turn. If Maharajs exceptional bowling is anything to go by on how the pitch is playing then South Africa are going to have a tough struggle against the Lankan spinners. Herath and Dilruwan Perera ran through their batting at
Galle capturing 15 wickets between them and Sri Lanka have included Akila Dananjaya, an attacking off-spinner with a lot of variations in their line-up for this Test at the expense of Lakshan Sandakan.
The only wicket to fall to the pacies was Roshen Silvas when he was beaten and bowled by the pace of Rabada. Dale Steyn who opened the bowling was still left striving for that one wicket that would make him his countrys leading wicket-taker in Test cricket. He stands level with another fast bowling great Shaun Pollock on 421 wickets. His 15 overs yielded no wicket for 47 runs.
Sri Lanka leads the two-match series 1-0 having won the first Test at Galle by 258 runs.

McKenzie to shape up Bangladesh's struggling batsmen
DHAKA July20: Bangladesh on Friday appointed former South African batsman Neil McKenzie as their new batting consultant to help shape up their woeful batting unit.
Bangladesh failed to score 200 runs in any of their last six Test innings and were bowled out for 43 in an innings during the ongoing series against the West Indies.
Bangladesh Cricket Board in a statement said McKenzie, 42, who played 58 Tests, 64 one-day internationals and two Twenty20 internationals for South Africa, would work with the Bangladesh team until the World Cup 2019 in England and Wales.
He is expected to join the team in Guyana on July 24 during the three-match ODI series against West Indies, the BCB said.
McKenzie, who acted as South Africa's batting consultant twice following his retirement in 2009, would replace former Sri Lankan batsman Thilan Samaraweera, whose contract was not renewed after the ICC Champions Trophy in Britain last year.
High performance coach Simon Helmot acted as interim batting coach in the last few series but under his guidance the team's batting failed to match up to expectations.
Bangladesh appointed Englishman Steve Rhodes as their new head coach in June and named South African Ryan Cook as the new fielding coach earlier this month.

Merritt leads Barbasol Championship as Lincicome struggles
Washington, Friday: Brittany Lincicome found herself 16 shots off the first-round lead of Troy Merritt at the Barbasol Championship on Thursday, but that didn't dim her pleasure in her US PGA Tour debut.
"She had a smile on her face all day," Sam Ryder, one of Lincicome's playing partners, said of the eight-time LPGA winner, who became just the sixth woman to tee it up on the PGA Tour. "She was just a great sport out there."
Lincicome said she largely managed to conquer her nerves, but a double-bogey at the par-three 18th, her ninth, and a triple-bogey six at the par-three seventh -- her 16th, led to a six-over par 78.
"I was pretty happy with my game over all," said Lincicome, playing this week on a sponsor's exemption. "I just had two bad holes. But I drove it well. I did all the things I said I needed to do, but just my putter let me down today.
"I was a lot calmer than I thought I was going to be, which was a relief. After the first tee shot I was like, 'OK, let's go. We can do this.'"
But the odds were against her making up enough ground on Friday to become the only woman besides Babe Zaharias in 1945 to make a PGA Tour 36-hole cut.
While the spotlight was on Lincicome, Merritt put together a sparkling round of 10-under par 62 at Keen Trace Golf Club in Nicholasville, Kentucky.
"I put my old putter back in play last week and started making some putts," said Merritt, who had eight birdies and an eagle. "(I) felt pretty good on Tuesday, and then felt pretty good in the nine-hole pro-am yesterday. Today just continued hitting the same shots and made the putts and didn't make any silly mistakes. Posted a 62."
Merritt hit 14 of 18 greens in regulation and didn't miss a putt from within 10 feet.
He teed off on 10 and was six-under when he arrived at the par-five sixth, his 15th of the day, where he chipped in his third shot from 11 yards off the green for eagle.
"Kind of fun to watch that go in," said Merritt, who is seeking a second tour win after his victory in the Quicken Loans National in 2015.
He added birdies at seven and eight and had a three-shot lead over Argentina's Andres Romero and Americans Billy Horschel and Joel Dahmen. AFP

Several government Ministers and MPs yesterday urged for a special investigation on previous Rajapaksa regime having paid money to five British MPs including MP Ian Paisley.
State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva alleged that it has been revealed that another British MP was paid by the ex-Rajapaksa regime. This MP has apparently visited Sri Lanka nine times during two months. According to reports, the ex-regime has paid five MPs in the same manner. Paisley had admitted that he accepted the said money. Some reports say that he has been paid Pounds 100,000.
State Minister Niroshan Perera joining said an investigation into this incident should be held immediately to find out how this money was paid and by whom.
UNP MP Mujibur Rahuman also demanded the Foreign Ministry to conduct an investigation with regards to the matter.
It was also pointed out that former Ambassador to Great Britain Chris Nonis and then Minister G.L. Peiris should also be inquired upon with this regard.
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake said the Consultative Committee on Foreign Affairs had been given directives to conduct an investigation on the scandal.

A monumental project
Sri Lanka is primarily an agricultural nation with a proud irrigation-based civilization. In fact, some of the reservoirs (tanks) built by ancient kings still work perfectly, leaving modern engineers astonished at the level of precision and engineering. When foreign and local engineers selected a site for one of the Mahaweli project dams after aerial surveys, satellite geosensing surveys, soil and water flow tests, they found the remnants of an ancient dam at the exactly the same location  which goes on to show the ingenuity and knowledge of our ancient engineers.
The Mahaweli project is the very embodiment of this proud heritage. It was originally planned as a 30-year venture, but the Government of President J.R. Jayewardene accelerated it, given the multitude of benefits to the countrys rice-growing hinterland. There were two objectives of the project  irrigation and power generation. Paddy being a crop which thrives in water, a good supply is needed to ensure a healthy harvest. As the population increased, the demand for power generation also went up. Most, if not all, of the countrys hydroelectricity supply comes from the Mahaweli project. The supply of drinking water was another component.
Given the scale and ambition of the Mahaweli project, it was simply not possible to complete all components of the project within the original seven-year time frame. Moragahakanda, the last in line, was put on the backburner for quite some time and the powers that be were not in a hurry to give the green light to the project. But when Maithripala Sirisena, who hails from the agricultural heartland of Polonnaruwa, was given the Mahaweli Ministry, he lost no time in going ahead with the project, despite the lukewarm attitude of his political superiors. His ascension to the Presidency in January 2015 helped clear all these hurdles and the project was expedited.
On Monday (July 23), the project will mark a major milestone when President Sirisena, in the presence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, inaugurates the process of filling water to the Kalu Ganga reservoir being built in parallel to the Moragahakanda reservoir under the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga multi-purpose irrigation project. A canal will link the two reservoirs. The unveiling of the new granite Buddha Statue built opposite the Moragahakanda Reservoir and renaming the Moragahakanda Reservoir as the Kulasinghe Reservoir after the legendary engineer Dr. A.N. S. Kulasinghe will also be carried out on this occasion. The entire nation must be grateful to the hundreds of people who sacrificed their ancestral lands and houses for the project to go ahead. The foreign donors who stepped into finance the project, including the Saudi Fund for Development, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and OPEC Fund for International Development also deserve our gratitude.
The Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga multi-purpose irrigation project being built at a cost of US$ 1.2 billion involves the construction of the Moragahakanda Dam and Reservoir, along with the separate Kalu Ganga Dam and Reservoir, for irrigation and power generation purposes. The construction of the Moragahakanda Reservoir was completed last year and it was opened on the 42nd anniversary of the commissioning of the first Mahaweli Project at Polgolla in the Central Province by the then PM, Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga project will provide irrigation facilities to 81,422 hectares in the Dry Zone, potable and industrial water supply to Anuradhapura and Trincomalee towns and generate 25 MW of electricity by hydropower while opening up more than 5,000 hectares of new land for agriculture development in Northern, North Central, Eastern and North Western provinces. This happens to be the biggest of the Mahaweli projects. The additional flow of water would increase rice production in the region by 81 per cent or 109,000 tonnes, amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of Rs.267 million annually.
The entire Mahaweli project has rejuvenated the countrys agricultural regions, making them productive again. The long droughts will no longer pose a huge problem to the farmers from now on as water will be available year round. This will benefit not only paddy farmers but also cultivators of other crops. In the light of bumper paddy harvests recorded in recent years, the authorities must formulate proper storage and export strategies. Officials are forecasting 1.08 million tonnes of paddy to be produced in the Yala minor cultivation season, up 18 per cent from last years output of 909,000 metric tonnes.
Sri Lanka has a limited market of just 21 million people and it is vital to find a way to dispose of any excess stocks in the event of a bumper harvest. It is important to grow a few rice varieties that can be marketed overseas, through the research expertise of the Rice Research Institute, with the assistance of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Manila. Incidentally, a delegation from the IRRI was in Colombo recently to discuss more research and cooperation efforts. Such collaborative efforts must be intensified with a view to offering better rice varieties for both local and export markets. Rice is a global crop and we must think globally to take rice cultivation forward.

Neymar rules out transfer move, staying at PSG
Sao Paulo, Friday: Brazilian superstar Neymar on Thursday sought to quash speculation about his future, insisting he planned to remain with French giants Paris Saint-Germain.
"I'm staying, I'm staying in Paris, I have a contract," Neymar told reporters at an auction to raise money for his charitable foundation in Sao Paulo.
Neymar, who became the world's most expensive footballer last year after moving to PSG from Barcelona in a record 222 million euro ($264 million) deal, has repeatedly been linked to a move to Real Madrid.
The European champions have issued a series of statements in recent weeks denying they have an interest in signing the 26-year-old striker.
Speculation of a Neymar move to the Bernabeu has intensified in the wake of Cristiano Ronaldo's shock move to Juventus, a development that has left a vacancy at Madrid for an elite, superstar player.
"In the face of the constant reports linking PSG's Neymar Jr. to our club, Real Madrid C. F. wish to clarify that the club has no intention of making any offer for the player," a Real Madrid statement said last week.
"The two clubs enjoy an excellent relationship and, as such, if Real Madrid were at any stage to consider securing the services of a PSG player, they would approach the club in the first instance."
Although Neymar insisted Thursday he was staying in Paris, reports persisted that a move could be on the cards.
British media reports said Thursday PSG were open to the possibility of selling Neymar.
Madrid president Florentino Perez meanwhile said the club was determined to reinforce its squad following Ronaldo's departure.
"Real has a great squad that is going to be reinforced with magnificent players," Perez said earlier this week.
"We are aware of the level of demand of the team each season. We are Real Madrid and we always want more. We must reinforce the present and at the same time strengthen the future."
Real however have also been linked to a move for Chelsea's Belgium World Cup star Eden Hazard, who indicated on Saturday he was keen to leave the London club. AFP

Vijayakalas controversial statement
OECD to record statements from Ministers, Parliamentarians
The Organized Crimes Prevention Division (OECD) conducting investigations into the alleged offensive statement made by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran yesterday informed Court that they expect to record statements from Ministers and Parliamentarians who participated in the event where the controversial statement was made.
Filing a further report before Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed court that it has sought the Speakers permission to record statements from Ministers and Parliamentarians who participated in the event. As a part of ongoing investigations, Police have recorded statements from 40 individuals including the District Secretaries of Vavunia and Jaffna and journalists.
Home Affairs Ministers Vajira Abeywardana has voluntarily given a statement in this regard, Police said. Addressing an event at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna on July 2, the former State Minister had allegedly said she would like to see the resurgence of the LTTE.
The court had earlier issued an order directing the Department of Official Languages to provide the Sinhala and Tamil transcripts of the video footage pertaining to the alleged offensive statement. On July 6, the Chief Magistrates Court issued an order directing several media institutions to produce their unedited video footage and paper articles pertaining to this controversial statement.
Filing a B report regarding this incident, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division alleged that the former State Minister could be charged under the offences that appears to have been committed under Section 115 and 120 of the Penal Code, violating the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and provisions stipulated under Article 157A of the Constitution.
Article 157A of the Constitution provides Constitutional provisions for prohibition against the violation of the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
Article 157A(1) of the Constitution cites that no person shall, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. The Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed court that Police have commenced investigations into this incident pursuant to a complaint made by Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera.
Child Affairs State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran decided to temporarily resign from her ministerial portfolio following a huge public outcry.

Pakistan crush Zimbabwe, take 4-0 ODI series lead
PYEONGCHANG July20: Fakhar Zaman became the first Pakistan player to hit a double century in one-day internationals as Pakistan crushed Zimbabwe by 244 runs to go 4-0 up in their one-day series.
Zaman smashed 210 not out from 156 deliveries, moving past the previous record for a Pakistan batsman set by Saeed Anwar with his 194 more than 21 years ago.
That wasn't the only record to tumble. Pakistan's openers blazed a world record 304-run stand, with Imam-ul-Haq hitting 113, the triple hundred partnership becoming Pakistan's biggest for any wicket in Od I's.
It also broke the previous record for an opening stand in all internationals, set by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul tharanga for Sri Lanka against England at Headingley in 2006. When the opening partnership was eventually snapped, Sif Ali arrived at the crease and immediately went on the attack, smashing 50 from 22 deliveries to help boost Pakistan to another record: their highest ever total in Odis.
Zimbabwe's response never got going, and they were lucky to avoid a few other ignominious records when they were bowled out in the 43Rd over for 155.
Zimbabwe's 244-run defeat was their second heaviest in Odis, and they avoided that calamity only through a 69-run sixth wicket stand between Elton Waggumbura and Donald Timpano.
But that was as good as it got for the hosts, with leg-spinner Shadai Khan taking four for 28 as Pakistan wrapped up the innings having barely broken a sweat. AFP

We have no plans to shift Galle cricket Ground: Minister Sagala Ratnayaka
The country should decide as to whether the Galle Fort could be preserved as a world heritage or allow the illegal Rajapaksa Pavilion to remain, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday. He also said the government would give its decision on the illegal pavilion within the next two weeks. A ministerial committee has been appointed to look into the matter and it would give its recommendations after the next two weeks. The ministerial committee comprises Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and Minister Faizer Musthapha.
Minister Rajapakshe said the Galle International Ground is not to be shifted or removed. He assured that only the illegal constructions at the ground should be removed as necessary. There have been many private owned and state owned illegal constructions at the Galle International Ground. Most of the privately owned ones have been removed. The construction concerned is the Rajapaksa Pavilion. In 2004, the Master Plan to develop Galle after the Tsunami, suggested that the ground be shifted to Koggala. However it was not implemented.
Minister Rajapakshe said that three of the eight world heritages in Sri Lanka are at risk of being taken out from the world heritages list. The heritage which is at an immediate risk, is the Galle Fort. Then there is the Dambulla Temple and the Sinharaja forest. UNESCO has questioned on the deforestation occurring in the Sinharaja forest. We are already looking into the Dambulla issue. There is a set of rules and regulations that we have to adhere to, concerning a world heritage. If we do not, we would be taken off the list.
UNESCO had not changed its standpoint over the issue as per their communiques we have received from them in the recent times. We have been asked to inform UNESCO within two weeks of our stand over the issue. A report is being prepared. Upon its receipt of that report, we would announce the governments position concerning the matter. Constructing a new cricket stadium in Koggala is timely. In case of the issue in Galle, it is our intention to continue to play cricket in the Galle Stadium, while protecting the national monument of Galle Fort by removing unauthorized constructions, Minister Rajapakshe said.
Minister Rajapakshe refused the then Sports Minister Gamini Lokuges claim that UNESCO initially agreed with setting up the pavilion.
Meanwhile, Sport Minister Faizer Musthapha said that the Galle International Cricket Stadium issue had now turned into a political football. He said that certain politicians are using the matter as a political stage to fulfill their own agendas. He requested everyone to think about the well being of Sri Lankas Cricket Team, which is performing well these days and not to use the Galle International Ground as a scapegoat.
We should protect our national heritage and in this case, the site is known as a world heritage site too. The Ministry appointed a committee to study the issue. On the other hand, our national team has played well on this ground. We should come to a favourable decision concerning national interests, Minister Musthapha said.
Southern Province Development and Youth Affairs Minister Sagala Ratnayaka too rose to speak. He said that there was no such plan to shift the Galle International Cricket Stadium from its present location.
We would not shift the stadium, but we should look as to how we should remove some recent constructions and buildings which threaten the monument. We have a plan to build an international cricket ground in Koggala, but as a government, we do not have any plans to shift the Galle International grounds, Minister Ratnayaka said.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga put forward his point of view on the matter. There were several issues related to this ground from day one. However, we got most of them resolved. When this illegal construction was to be set up, we warned against it. But some persons from Galle and who were attached to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, went on with the project and set this pavilion up. What people such as these, usually do is to spend half the money for the project and pocket the rest of the funds. When this pavilion was to be removed, they went and stuck Mahinda Rajapaksas name on it. So at the end, the pavilion was not removed. I am sure we can get this problem solved with high technology that allows setting up pavilions within 48 hours, Minister Ranatunga said.

Bills presented to House on legislation for discipline against Buddhist monks
Legislation on Buddhist monks discipline was a long standing request of the Chief Prelates and disciplined and scholarly Buddhist monks, said Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
He said the Buddhist Temporalities (Amendment) Bill and Theravadi Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Bill, was presented to Parliament after a thorough discussion with the Chief Prelates and all other stakeholders.
He made these observation with reference to recent remarks by Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa thera, who asked the MPs to object to the above two Bills. The minister pointed out that the two Bills were a long standing request of the Buddhist monks and they were drafted with the guidance of the Mahanayake and Anunayake theras.
Two weeks ago, a Buddhist monk had allegedly strangled a Police Sergeant to death. It was reported yesterday, that a monk who was a University fresher, was beaten by several other monks. The Chief Prelates and other learned and disciplined Buddhist monks wished that this negative trend be arrested, while it was with their blessings that we drafted legislation. Discussions concerning them dates back to 1956. Anybody who objects to this move would be committing a great sin, the Minister said.

For having paid money to five British MPs
Ministers, MPs call for special probe on ex-Rajapaksa regime
Several Government Ministers and MPs yesterday, urged for a special investigation on the previous Rajapaksa regime for having paid money to five British MPs including MP Ian Paisley. State Minister Harsha de Silva alleged that it had been revealed that another British MP was paid by the ex-Rajapaksa regime. This MP has apparently visited Sri Lanka on nine occasions within a period of two months. According to reports, the ex-regime had paid five MPs in the same manner. Paisley has admitted that he has accepted the said money. Some reports say that he had been paid 100,000 in Sterling Pounds.
State Minister Niroshan Perera joining the debate, said an investigation in reference to the incident should be held immediately, to find out how this money was paid and by whom. UNP MP Mujiber Rahuman also demanded the Foreign Ministry to conduct an investigation with regard to the matter.
It was also pointed out that the former Ambassador to Great Britain Chris Nonis and then Minister G. L. Peiris should also be questioned in this regard.
Meanwhile, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake said that the Consultative Committee of Foreign Affairs had been directed to conduct an investigation into the scandal.

Akila to probe Sab. PCs attempt to mislead House
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday, assured that he would commence an inquiry into whether the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council had attempted to mislead Parliament by providing false records concerning schools in the area.
He made this observation following a complaint made by UNP MP Heshan Vithanage.
Vithanage in an oral question, asked Kariyawasam the names of schools which commenced anew since the present Chief Minister of the Province took office. Following the Ministers reply, Vithanage moved to say that, I know the minister provides us the information he received from the Provincial Council. So I dont blame him for this.
But I have a serious doubt about the list Kariyawasam presented. He told that the Amitiyagoda Primary School had commenced anew. The truth is that this particular school does not exist. It had been closed down. Therefore, this list of schools could not be trusted as accurate.

British MP suspended due to using Sri Lanka money for personal use:Dr. Wijeyadasa
British Parliament has imposed a suspension on British MP Ian Paisley not because he had acted in support of Sri Lanka, but because he had used money paid by the Government of Sri Lanka for his personal use, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that disciplinary action had been taken against Paisley because he had violated the rules, regulations and standards of the British Parliament.
Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that certain false media reports have implied that his 30 days suspension was imposed because he had acted in support of Sri Lanka. Such false reporting may negatively influence the diplomatic relations of the two countries, Minister Rajapakshe observed. When Parliamentarians keep recurring the same false story, it will tarnish the image of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Parliament, he further said.
MPs should act with responsibility when making statements on sensitive matters such as these, Minister Rajapakshe said. He pointed out that British MPs are allowed to represent other countries.
Media institutes should also act with responsibility when reporting on matters such as these, without damaging diplomatic relations and dishonouring the reputation of the country, Minister Rajapakshe further added.

Without solidifying proper mechanism to detect crime:
Capital punishment would not bring any positive outcome: Dr. Jayampathy
Enacting capital punishment without solidifying a proper mechanism to detect crimes would not bring any positive outcome to the country, said United National Party (UNP) National List MP Dr. Jayampathi Wickramaratne yesterday (20), in Parliament.
Opening the debate on the Bribery (Amendment) Bill, Dr. Wickramaratne, said that punishment is the final step of the judicial procedure.
Everyone is talking about capital punishment these days. Before meteing a punishment, there are several important steps which should be followed. We talk about punishment, but do not have enough evidence on what had happened before. People say that all Prison officials help drug dealers in prisons. But that is not true, Dr. Wickremeratne said.
He further said that Prisons lack the technology to prevent crimes which coordinate from inside prisons. For example, there is no proper mobile signal jamming system at the Welikada Prison. Behind the prison premise there is a communication tower. When Prison authorities try to jam signals, the general public outside too have to face difficulties. So they oppose it. That jamming system is only for a particular network. Other networks are operating inside prison without any hurdle. Remand and Magazine Prisons in Colombo where the most notorious criminals and underworld leaders are kept, dont have any jamming system at all.
Dr. Wickramaratna pointed out that there are technical systems in the world which completely disconnect electronic devises. These systems should be installed in Sri Lankan Prisons as well.
Apart from that, I have heard that some prisoners hide mobile phones in their bodies. But there is not system to detect them. Airports possess 360 decree scanning systems to detect such things hidden in their bodies. Such implements should be provided to prisons too, he pointed out.

Speaking at the Hotel Show Colombo 2018 at the BMICH yesterday, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the basic requirements of entry into the country must be streamlined. This should include the process of entry and reception at the airport.
We are looking at how we can ease the whole air trafficking system, including the visa service, the Prime Minister said.
Premier Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of increasing the number of tourists visiting the country, thereby bringing in more revenue to the country and improving the peoples income.
For us, in the short term, (tourism)is one of the job creators, the Prime Minister said.
It means a future for Sri Lankan employment. It means a future for Sri Lankan youth, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister noted that the government has taken measures to develop tourism: its joint ventures with Indian aviation, dealing with Sri Lankan airlines, undertaking a project to develop a highway from Colombo to Humbantota.
The Prime Minister who was addressing company and hotel owners attending the Hotel Show, said that more efforts need to be made towards marketing and promotion.
A hotel is not merely a question of bricks and cement, the Prime Minister said and in order to compete with the worlds largest tourist destinations, the industry will need to expand and improve their offerings. If you go to Kandy, Thumbulla, Anuradhapura, what do you do at night Nothing. No cultural activities, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister expressed his desire for Sri Lanka to meet tourism development goals by the 2022 Football World Cup to be held in Qatar.

Promises to fight corruption seek execution
President Maithripala Sirisena has certainly given a good message to the foreign community about the key initiatives taken by this government to break the nexus between power and corruption in Sri Lanka. He showed how the Unity Government led by him elected in January 2015, had removed most of the enormous powers of the Executive Presidency in Sri Lanka.
Addressing the inaugural meeting of the Open Government Partnership Global Summit 2018 at Tbilisi, Georgia, this week, he spoke of steps taken by Sri Lanka to promote the principles elating to Open Government Partnership, by the coalition of unity. He emphasized on the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which strengthened Parliament, and the Constitutional Council, which brought independence to the Chief Justice and judges of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, and the benefits of independence from the Commissions on Police, Human Rights, Bribery and Corruption and the Right to Information.
While the presidential message to the foreign community given from Georgia could be encouraging, the situation here raises much concern about the policies and principles of the government, especially with regard to its pledge to fight the corruption of the previous government, and the expectations of building a much cleaner structure of governance in the country. The differences within the government keeps widening, and the new issues that have come to the fore in recent weeks are causing considerable discontent both within the government, and the wider public, which shows little proof of an effective fight against corruption, while raising fears about the return to a much stronger authoritarian rule in the country.
Hanging debate
President Sirisenas recent statement of his willingness to carry out the death penalty on those convicted of crimes relating to the promotion of drugs, and Cabinet approval given to it, has opened a strongly divisive public debate, moving away from the pressing realities of government, especially issues of economic hardship affecting the people that need urgent attention. This is largely a debate moved by emotion and feelings about capital punishment, with little to do with a properly planned fight against the forces engaged in the promotion of drug use in the country.
The Hanging Question, as headlined in the Editorial Page Hindsight column in the Daily News on last Wednesday (19th), shows the diversity of the debate that has been unleashed, raising the important question whether President Sirisena will be able to follow through with his declared intentions, on the spread of drug related crimes, and the use of the death penalty. He certainly has to take note of opposition to the move by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, and the clear opposition organisations of Civil Society, by the Christian community as stated strongly by the Anglican Church, and the somewhat confusing duality on drugs and the death penalty by the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka.
The noticeable silence by the Buddhist clergy on this matter, which is deeply associated with the core teachings of Buddhism, shows the deeper influence of politics in the thinking on this issue by important sections of the Buddhist clergy.
Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition (JO) has moved to the politics of practicality by stating that the Death Penalty debate unleashed is a political move to hide other burning issues affecting the people. The JO would prefer a situation where its leaders do not have to be divided on this issue, but be strongly united on other issues such as the punishment to be imposed on MP Vijayakala, for raising the LTTE issue, which is the stuff for political action for Sinhala majoritarian strategies.
The JO must be pleased at the divergent role this debate has taken in the public mind and the media, because it moves away from the emerging conflicts within its own ranks, and its leaders, too, over the selection of the next presidential candidate. Such a diversion is welcome when there is increasing criticism on the commitment to a new rise of the Rajapaksa Pavula, in the authoritarian trend at the core of SLPP politics today.
Noose of uncertainty
We read about the names of those death penalty convicts in prison, whose sentences have been commuted, and possibly now await a new sentence from President Sirisena. The prison authorities on the lookout for a new hangman or two have received offers from volunteer hangmen and hangwomen too. The Execution Chamber is being fully restored to carry out the new punishments, after more than 40 years. However, there is no certainty about this hangmans pledge being carried out, whatever the presidential or Cabinet promise.
There is a clear judicial issue the President will have to face before any of such executions are carried out. Those to be executed under the new presidential statement and Cabinet decision are those already sentenced to death for drug related crimes, who have been engaged in such work (or crimes) while serving ones commuted death sentence. There is the need for judicially accepted proof of such new crimes, committed after the committal of the original sentence, which brought them to death row in prison. This will need thorough investigation, as well as explanations of the role of the Prison Authorities in allowing such new crimes to be committed, or how convicted criminals prevented the Prison officials from stopping such drug-related criminal activity.
This is certainly no easy task with the necessity of the complete participation of prison authorities in proving these new crimes. Many who have studied the emerging situation are of the view that it looks like another failure that will mar the record of the Executive Presidency after the 19th Amendment.
The uncertainty of this hangmans noose brings into focus a far wider task this government will have to be faced with in the coming months. It is the action needed to carry out a complete overhaul of the Prison System in the country, taking into consideration the modern advances made in the confining and treatment of prisoners. This also requires more equality in the treatment of prisoners, unlike what takes place today  with the rich and powerful  in politics, governance and business  assured of considerable comforts and facilities that are wholly denied to the average prisoners.
President Sirisena and the Coalition of Unity, amidst its many divisions, certainly has a great task before them, something not thought of by the Common Candidate and the campaign to elect him in 2014/2015  to carry out far reaching Prison Reforms. This is something Sri Lanka should be able to tell the world at international conferences in Georgia or elsewhere in the future  as the new example of prison standards in South Asia.
Hanging over
The Hanging Question would take the pressing issues of politics and governance away for some time. However, the pressures of unaddressed issues in the fight against corruption will be seen in the coming months, as the country moves closer to the next Presidential and General Elections.
The big promises made about a new Gamperaliya or the achievement of economic success by 2050, do not remove from the public mind the pledges of the Common Candidate to fight the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime. While there is pride in the new independence of the judiciary, there are also fears, whether the recusals by judges in particular cases, and the time taken to hold the next hearing (with the possibility of another recusal) is part of strategic thinking to take such cases, and the persons involved in them, beyond the next Presidential and General Election
The opposition candidacy for the next presidential election have two brothers who are debarred from contesting, being US citizens, awaiting nomination by the other brother who is banned from contesting through the 19th Amendment. Political activists in social media are now suggesting that the fraternal disagreements  involving the political future of Namal Rajapaksa  could lead to Rajapaksas wife  Shiranthi  being the next family candidate.
The possibility of such situations to be even considered is wholly due to the failure of both the UNP and SLFP  led by Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena to take the necessary and timely action to bring to book the Rajapaksas and their supporters involved in the corruption of the past regime. The public keeps reading of the slow progress in the moves to bring to justice the killers of Lasantha Wickrematunge and those who carried away Prageeth Eknaligoda. The new independence of the judiciary is taking us far beyond the judicial delays of the past, raising many new questions about the need for new speed in the execution of political promises of those elected by the people.
The debate on the Hangman is giving way to a call to tighten the noose on those who give false promises to the people, and fail to carry out their pledges to society. The forces of civil society and the politically independent public will have to seek to leaders with a new commitment to fight corruption to meet the challenges of tomorrow. Challenges that can give a new meaning to the politics of the future.

The National Centre for treating Thalassaemia patients at the General Hospital, Kurunegala has several shortcomings at present and medical authorities there find it difficult to provide a satisfactory service to patients.
The centre is located in a small building and functioning for over 15 years without a proper building with adequate space. There are not enough service personnel at present to meet the service requirements. In addition, there is no official vehicle to carry out urgent service requirements. This centre has been recognised by the Health Services Department as a well managed Thalassaemia treatment centre. It was opened in 2003 and at that time, about 300 patients were registered. However, by July, the number of patients increased to 1,100. To treat these patients, about 120 pints of blood are needed daily. I appeal to the Health Ministry to direct their attention to this centre promptly to solve the existing service problems, said Dr. Dayanda Bandara, the Consultant who is the Officer in Charge of this treatment centre.

Trump invites Putin to Washington
US: US President Donald Trump, under fire over his Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin, doubled down Thursday by saying he looks forward to meeting the Russian leader again -- with talks already underway for a visit to Washington in the fall.
Trump has come in for bipartisan criticism for what many saw as his unsettling embrace of the Russian strongman this week -- and his seeming disavowal of his own intelligence agencies and their assessment that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election.
The backlash has thrust Trump onto the defensive, leading to days of conflicting statements from both the president and the White House.
But Trump has largely shrugged off the criticism and took aim at the fake news media Thursday for failing to recognize his achievements.
The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media, Trump said on Twitter. The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump's goal was to redirect two countries that'd been on a bad path. There's been a lot of heat and very little light following that press conference, he told Catholic television network EWTN.
I watched the president's interaction with President Putin after their one-on-one meeting ... The President was aiming towards creating a channel for communication and dialogue, and he achieved that, he said, adding he would be very surprised if a transcript from the meeting was released.
In an interview with CNBC television, Trump said getting along with President Putin, getting along with Russia's a positive, not a negative.
Now with that being said if it doesn't work out I'll be the worst enemy he's ever had, he said of Putin.
I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, Trump said.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that meeting may come this fall.
President Trump asked (National Security Advisor John Bolton) to invite President Putin to Washington in the fall and those discussions are already underway, Sanders tweeted. The invitation came as an apparent surprise to the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats when he was told about it during a live interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado.
Say that again Coats asked the interviewer.
OK. That's going to be special, he said, laughing.
Coats also said that three days after Trump met with Putin he does not know what the two men discussed.
I don't know what happened in that meeting, he said.
The two leaders held two hours of closed-door talks with no one else present but the interpreters.
If he had asked me how that ought to be conducted, I would have suggested a different way, Coats said.
Trump on Thursday listed the topics discussed as stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, had a scathing reaction to news that Trump planned to invite Putin to Washington.
Until we know what happened at that two hour meeting in Helsinki, the president should have no more one-on-one interactions with Putin. In the United States, in Russia, or anywhere else, he said in a statement.
The US upper chamber issued a sharp rebuke to Trump earlier in the day, voting 98-0 to oppose any move by his administration to make US officials available for questioning by Russian government officials.
Asked in Helsinki whether he would extradite 12 Russian intelligence agents indicted in the United States for hacking Democratic Party computers, Putin said he could meet the US government halfway. Putin said he would permit the 12 to be questioned inside Russia if the United States allowed Russia to question former US envoy to Russia Michael McFaul and 11 others in Moscow's case against billionaire investor and human rights activist William Browder, the driving force behind Magnitsky Act sanctions on Russian officials passed by the US Congress. Trump initially called it an incredible offer, but McFaul and others expressed outrage and the White House -- just minutes before the Senate vote -- made clear a deal with Putin was not in the cards. - AFP

Border guards of the Lviv and Lutsk detachments and the operative and search unit of the Eastern Regional Directorate have detained 13 illegal migrants - from Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh, the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service has reported.
Border guards spotted six foreigners who did not have any documents with them and watched two people cross the Western Bug River along the border line.
The Border guards immediately informed their Polish counterparts. As a result of joint and coordinated actions by the Ukrainian side, Polish border guards detained two more people. They were citizens of Russia and Azerbaijan, reads the statement.
The report notes that all details of preparations for the violation of the state border were established during verification measures.
In particular, it was established that the Russian and the Azerbaijani intended to send five Sri Lankans and an Indian to the European Union in search of a better life.
At present, Polish foreign colleagues are expected to send the foreigners to Ukraine. The foreigners detained by Ukrainian border guards, after their identification, are to be held accountable for the attempt to break the border.
In addition, representatives of the operative and search unit of the Eastern Regional Directorate received a report about the possible presence of a group of illegal migrants in a private home in Kharkiv.
With the permission of the owner of the apartment, law enforcement officers checked the stated place for the presence of foreigners.
There were four men of Asian appearance without any documents in the apartment.

West Indies World Cup hero Collis King deported from England
One of the 1979 World Cup heroes for West Indies, Collis King, has been deported from England  where he stays with his British wife  because of a technicality regarding his visa application, The Telegraph reported.
King, in the 1979 World Cup final, had rescued West Indies with a 138-run stand with Vivian Richards, helping his team win the trophy for the second time in a row. Kings international career  comprising nine Tests and 18 ODIs  came to a premature end after he left to South Africa as part of the rebel tours.
He then played for several cricket clubs in England across various leagues. At 67, he still plays for Dunnington in Yorkshire and coaches the local players there.
Now But King is stuck in Barbados because of Britains strict immigration laws. His Barbadian passport, according to the report, was confiscated by the Heathrow airport staff before boarding his flight back to the Caribbean  because he was deemed to be at risk of absconding.
I felt like I was treated like a criminal, he told The Telegraph from Barbados. It has really shaken me that after all that time that I cant stay. It really hit me for six.
I have been playing cricket in the UK for many years but I have always come back when my visa stated. I have never stayed longer than I was due to stay. If I had six months to play in the leagues, I would always come back on time. Never once in 44 years have I overstayed my time.
King had applied for a spousal visa last year, which would have given him the right to remain in the United Kingdom. But it was rejected and he was told that for a spousal visa he had to apply from his country of origin and was given 14 days to leave the UK.
Hed restarted the process after he returned to Barbados but after three months of waiting, he still doesnt have a date for hearing.
I was not born a British citizen but I have been going to Britain long enough to feel part of the English set-up. You cannot come to a country for so many years without loving the place. I have been coming and going, loving the country and that is the sad thing, really, he said.

Whats the secret to Croatias footballing success
She needed a passport. Urgently. She, like her countrys footballers, was on her way to Moscow for the World Cup final, to be a witness to a momentous moment in her countrys history.
Its been really crazy, crazy, crazy here during the World Cup, she says, speaking to CNN Sport from her Croatian home. Wednesday it all went on a completely other level. It was just pure happiness, pure celebrations.
It was on floodlit Wednesday night in the Russian capital, of course, that Croatias footballers dug into their infinite reserves of energy to crush English dreams in a gripping World Cup semifinal.
Its victorious team sang on the team bus, chanted outside its hotel, while in Zagreb thousands gathered in the capitals center, filling the sky with plumes of red smoke. The following day, Croatias government all wore the countrys national football shirts to its weekly meeting.
This is the first time its happened to us ever. Not a lot of people had high expectations for this World Cup, some werent even sure wed get through the group stages because the group was not easy, adds Sambol.
There have been parties in every single place in Croatia, either watching together in city squares or in pubs and after the match ended the way it ended there were fireworks, firecrackers, cars driving around honking all the time, traffic stopped. It was amazing.
A country of four million -- one-13th the size of Englands -- had overcome demographic and economic odds to reach footballs pinnacle.
Had Croatia beaten France in Moscow last Sunday, not only would it have been a sensational win over a footballing heavyweight but this Balkan country would have become the smallest to win footballs biggest prize since Uruguay in 1950.
A FOOTBALLING COUNTRY, A SUPERSTAR MIDFIELD
What is the secret to Croatias success at this World Cup First, it should be noted that it is not just in football that the country excels, suggesting theres something in the countrys makeup, in its character, in its attitude towards sports. Croatias men are the reigning water polo champions and at the 2017 handball world championships its men came fourth, while at the 2016 Rio Olympics Croatia was 17th in the medals table, finishing ahead of the likes of Canada (population 36 million), Argentina (population 43 million) and South Africa (population 56 million).
But for all the countrys success in handball, volleyball and water polo, Croatia is a footballing country, much like Brazil, England, Argentina and France. The prospect of breeding brilliant footballers increases when that country is in love with the beautiful game.
Teams do not reach world finals without gifted players and, in Luka Modric, Croatia has a very gifted midfielder widely regarded as the best in the world in his position.
The 32-year-olds intelligence has stood out in Russia and yet, despite being a superior talent to many of those around him, the captain is also willing to suffer for his team. No player has covered as much ground in Russia as Modrics 63km (22.7km when not in possession). He has also scored twice in the tournament.
Outplayed in the first half by England, it was 5ft 5in Modric - his passing, his harrying, his unwillingness to yield -- which dragged Croatia to victory.
Alongside Modric in midfield is Ivan Rakitic, a player who has covered just 0.2km less than Real Madrid star and spends most of his weeks in Barcelona colors, supplying the great Lionel Messi. Two world class midfielders is a boon to any team.
There are others, too: Juventus Mario Mandzukic, Inter Milans Ivan Perisic and Liverpools Dejan Lovren who, according to the player himself, proved himself to be one of the best defenders in the world with his performance against England.
Croats are just naturally talented, Igor Stimac, a former Croatia coach and member of the Croatian team which reached the World Cup semifinals 20 years ago, once said.
Luka Ivancic, chief executive officer of Croatian top division football club HNK Rijeka, told CNN Sport: I think its the talent of the players, the motivation and the hard work, thats something special. And theres something in the character for sure.

Sydney, Friday: Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber will defend her Sydney International title in January in preparation for next year's Australian Open, organisers said Friday.

Kerber, who downed Australia's Ash Barty to win this year's Sydney International final, said the tournament will be a good tune-up for the Australian Open starting in Melbourne on January 14.
"Playing the Sydney International is always a great opportunity to face some top quality opposition," Kerber said in a statement.
"Every single match is really tough, so it's a great way to fine-tune my game after the off-season, and also get used to the weather conditions in Australia, which are quite different to Europe at that time of the year."
The Sydney International will take place at Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre from January 6-12.

MR works hard for his kith and kin
The public rejected the Rajapaksa regime accusing it of nepotism, corruptions and waste of public funds. This country is not for one family, SLFP National Organiser and Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering at the launch of the Seruwila SLFP District Board of Authority recently. Seruwila SLFP Chief Organiser Nalin Gunawardane organised the function. After three and half years, the former President is still working hard to give places for his kith and kin at the forthcoming presidential elections, he said.
The Minister said the SLFP and the country need a patriotic leadership to eradicate nepotism and political selfishness. "Only President Maithripala Sirisena can make the difference that the people need," he said.
The Minister said Maithripala is the only leader who could bring in a bright future based on co-existence, peace, integrity and understanding.
He said the President expressed his willingness to activate the capital punishment to curb the narcotics menace and appointed a commission to reveal the truth regarding the Central Bank bond issue. "These are rare qualities of a true leader," he said.
"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa embraced a parliamentarian at his residence in Gampaha after he was released after arresting for a alleged incident of drug dealing.
It was highlighted in the media, Former President recently challenged that he could get down Udayanga, who was issued red notice to be arrested.
This shows that former President was helping Udayanga evade the law. He is protecting thieves," Minister Duminda said.
The Minister requested the public to understand the difference between the two leaders.
"Maithripala Sirisena is a true leader unlike the other who is protecting the corrupted. Minister Duminda asked the people not to get misguided or deceived by power-greedy, bankrupted political leaders.

Minister Fonseka refutes allegations
No need to obtain underworld security
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka, flatly refuting certain allegations levelled against him by certain media that he is receiving the security of underworld king-pings, said he doesnt need to do so as he receives enough security from the Special Task Force (STF) and the police.
Seventeen police officers, including STF personnel, were deployed to provide security. Therefore, there is no need to obtain private security, he said.
He was addressing the media at the ministry auditorium, on Thursday. When asked why such an allegation was levelled against him, he said it could be a hidden political agenda of some.
Some may want to sling mud at me. Those are baseless allegations, he said.
The minister said he complained about this to the Prime Minister and the subject minister and requested them to take measures against these allegations. A case will also be filed by the ministry claiming compensation of Rs. 500 million against the electronic media organisation, he said. However, the minister pointed out that media personnel should act responsibly without being a cats paw of bankrupt and corrupt politicians. The minister said the Police Commission has failed to achieve its goals when it was formed. However, the situation worsened with the establishment of the Police Commission even though it was expected to give good results, he said.
The minister added that there are some issues with good governance even though this is a good governance government. There is no good governance in the field of law, he said. When asked about the preparation of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to contest as the next Presidential candidate, the minister said Rajapaksa does not know the pulse of the public as he and the members of the Rajapaksa family spent a luxurious life during the last regime.

Once the new constitution comes, there will not be a Presidential Election. Therefore, the Joint Opposition is trying its best to make Parliament disabled and make way for a Presidential Election, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) Leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the party office in Colombo yesterday. He said that it is the sole responsibility of the Prime Minister to get hold of his MPst and protect Parliament. Well organised problems erupted in the country from time to time to make it unstable. Recent issues in the Railway Service is one. This Government should protect Parliament, Dr. Karunaratne said. He said Sri Lanka would lost GSP Plus facility if the death penalty was reintroduced. Before introducing the death penalty, the Government should punish the prison officials who looked after drug kingpins, who communicated with outside to carry out their `businesses. The first task should be to find out how prisoners communicated with outside people while in prison, he said.
Dr. Karunaratne said the Government taking action against persons who insulted Human Rights Commission Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama is admirable and the persons who insulted her, acted like stray dogs.
Their threatening proved that armed forces committed grave crimes during the war. Their actions during the war should be investigated and punished if they had committed crimes during the war, he said.

Absence of SLC domestic inquiry rather intriguing  former SLC official
Whilst we have all seen the ICC verdict on the ball tampering incident and with regards to the Spirit of Cricket that took place in the Caribbean last month, it is indeed intriguing to note that SLC has not initiated a domestic inquiry of its own to ascertain the facts of the case, observed a former Sri Lanka Cricket official.
The harshness of the punishment imposed by ICC only goes to show how seriously the International body has viewed the conduct of our team Management and the Captain. It will therefore be in the best interest of SLCs future Cricket Management and the cricketers, if the SLC like in the case of Cricket Australia who initiated their own inquiry irrespective of
the ICC ruling, get to the bottom of why this should have taken place at all, stated Nuski Mohamed, a former Sri Lanka Cricket secretary and treasurer. Not so long ago in 2013, we were the recipient of the ICC Spirit of Cricket Award, he noted and added: A domestic inquiry is a sine qua non to incidents of this nature and magnitude. Let us hope that SLC even at this late stage will initiate an inquiry not only to implement the ICC punishment on the Cricket Management and Captain, but also to have their own findings on record.

All the Golden Ball winners since its inception
The Golden Ball, one of the most coveted prizes for any footballer, is presented for the outstanding player at each FIFA World Cup. The shortlist is prepared by FIFAs technical committee, and the winner will be declared after the voting by media officials. The Silver Ball and the Bronze Ball are presented to the tournaments second and third best, respectively.
Golden Ball has been awarded since 1982, a total of 9 players have won this award since then. Most of the time the award winners ended in despair, even though they played exceptionally well, they werent able to make their team sail over the line as football is a team game.
This World Cup has some stunning performances and there are many great players who took part and some new world-class players have been born.
The 2018 FIFA World Cup Golden Ball winner was Luka Modric of Croatia.
There are also some controversies as some of the decisions of the committee raised few eyebrows but we will not look into that at the moment. So let us dive into all the players who have won this coveted prize down the years since its inception.
1982, SPAIN - PAOLO ROSSI (ITALY)
The Italian striker won the Golden Ball as well as the Golden Shoe (which was awarded to the tournaments top goal scorer). Rossi scored a total of six goals that were crucial for his sides success. He scored twice in the semi-final against Poland; he opened the scoring in the final, which gave them the lead, and scored a memorable hat-trick against favorites Brazil to progress into semi-finals.
1986, MEXICO - DIEGO MARADONA (ARGENTINA)
This World Cup will ever be remembered as Maradonas World Cup, and he has done everything to lift the World Cup. He scored five goals in the process, two of them in the semi-finals against Belgium, and two of them came against England in the quarter-finals. He also made a crucial assist to Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute of the final against West Germany, which sealed the victory for them by 3-2.
He was best remembered for the game against England, where two of his most memorable moments happened. The infamous one, Maradona scored the first goal against England with the hand, but the referee had not spotted it and the goal stood.
Touted as the Goal of the century, Maradona, with his great dribbling skills scored one of the best individual goals ever. He ran past 60 yards and dummied the defenders in the process and feinted with a movement, in which the English goalkeeper fell on the ground and out of control, before guiding the ball into the back of the net.
1990, ITALY - SALVATORE SCHILLACI (ITALY)
He was not a star before coming into this World Cup, and he got a nod to the team after the final warm-up match against Switzerland, where he was the sixth choice striker after Roberto Mancini, Gianluca Vialli, Andrea Carnevale, Aldo Serena and the Divine Ponytail man Roberto Baggio.
During their first game in that World Cup, they werent able to break down the Austrian defense, which gave the opportunity to a future star, who grabbed it with both hands and scored the only goal of the game.
He went on to score six goals and claimed the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe by beating the likes of Diego Maradona and Lothar Matthaus, but Matthaus lifted the cup and had the last laugh.
1994, UNITED STATES - ROMARIO (BRAZIL)
Romario is known for his wonderful technique and commonly known as genius of the penalty area. He was at his peak before coming into the World Cup, where he was the top goalscorer in La Liga with 30 goals, helping Barcelona to win the title.
His incredible pace and powerful toe-poke strikes are nightmares for defenders. He helped Brazil beat Uruguay to qualify for the World Cup, scoring all two goals in Maracana. He scored five goals and helped Selecao to land the World title after 24 years, so he should thank Roberto Baggio, who blasted his penalty into the sky otherwise the story might have been different.
Johan Cruyff -  Romario was the best player I ever coached, he was an extraordinary player, with extraordinary technique.
1998, FRANCE - RONALDO (BRAZIL)
Another Brazilian bags the award. Ronaldo was more than just a striker. He was ferocious and had wonderful dribbling skills, definitely one of the finest to grace the football pitch.
His name was on everyones lips before the 1998 final; he was almost dropped from the team sheet but reinstated 45 minutes before kick-off. This remained mysterious and his side lost to the hosts France. Even though he lost the World Cup, he won the Golden Ball.
2002, KOREA/JAPAN - OLIVER KAHN (GERMANY)
The German captain was the first and the only goalkeeper to win the Golden Ball. He was commanding, and his frame with his fierce face could frighten any striker, adding that he was prolific in every goalkeeping aspect that makes him one of the best ever.
He kept five clean sheets and made his side progress to the finals. To beat him, one has to have tremendous ability and Ronaldo was nowhere less for that description, who scored two goals past the tournaments best keeper to deny Germany winning that day.
2006, GERMANY - ZINEDINE ZIDANE (FRANCE)
Zizou. The French captain was sensational in that tournament, and he was one of the four players who scored three goals in World Cup final matches.
He was sent off for his headbutt on Materazzi in the extra time that saw Italy win on penalties. Zidane put France ahead early with a neatly-taken penalty, playing his last match before retiring.
2010, SOUTH AFRICA - DIEGO FORLAN (URUGUAY)
Diego Forlan won the 2010 outstanding player award after inspiring his nation to its best performance in a global showdown in 40 years.
He was the tournaments joint top scorer with a tally of five goals that left him leveled against Thomas Muller, David Villa, and Wesley Sneijder. His team ended up in fourth place, but he bagged the best player award for his stylish and spectacular goals.
2014, BRAZIL - MESSI (ARGENTINA)
Messi was regarded as one of the best players in the game. He was arguably the best footballer the planet has ever seen, but few say that he needs to win the World Cup for his country, to be compared to the likes of Pele and Maradona.
That feat came close when he single-handedly drove his team past group stages and Argentina went into the finals. His team lost to eventual champions Germany in extra time.

Lausanne, Thursday: Boxing could still be axed from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo after the IOC admitted Thursday that concerns remain over the sport's governance and management by the International Boxing Federation (AIBA).
"The IOC Executive Board received a report on the AIBA situation and highlighted its significant ongoing concern with a number of key areas... that require further information and confirmation," said an IOC statement.
These areas involved "governance, ethical and financial management".
In February, the IOC said they had been "extremely worried" and "extremely preoccupied" by the nomination of Uzbek businessman Gafur Rakhimov for the AIBA's interim presidency.
"The IOC executive board decided to maintain its position which includes continued suspension of any financial contributions from IOC to AIBA and the right to review the inclusion of boxing on the programme of the 2020 Olympics."
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the situation will be further evaluated at the next meeting of the executive board in Tokyo from November 30-December 2.

China upgrades African connection
Chinas rising stature as the worlds second largest economy is being consolidated by the countrys increasing role as a responsible leader of the international community. With its Belt and Road Initiative it is forging close economic, political and cultural relations with all continents and countries irrespective of their political systems and practices. A case in point is its relations with Africa. On July 19 Chinese President Xi Jinping left on a tour of five African countries  the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Senegal, South Africa, Rwanda and Mauritius.
The visits will promote the further deepening of political mutual trust, mutual development assistance, mutual learning on each others concepts between China and Africa and the building of a closer China-Africa community of common destiny, said Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).
His visit to UAE is the first by a Chinese Head of State in 29 years. It was 9 years since a Chinese Head of State visited Senegal last. His trip to Rwanda will be the first by a Chinese President. In South Africa, which he is visiting for the third time he will attend the 10th BRICS Summit to be held in Johannesburg from July 25-27. The Summit is expected to enhance cooperation among its members in the fields of economy, politics and culture. Besides the BRICS Summit the Chinese President will also take part in the 20th Anniversary celebrations of establishing diplomatic relations between China and South Africa.
His tour will be marked by bilateral discussions with African leaders and the signing of several treaties in each country. It will also boost preparations for the Forum on China - Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) to be held in Beijing in September this year.
China surpassed the United States as Africas largest trade partner in 2009 and is at present fast catching up with the US to become the highest investor too. At present it is the second highest investor with over US $ 60 billion investments.
What happened at Helsinki
All eyes were focused on Helsinki last week when the leaders of the worlds two foremost nuclear powers the United States and Russia  Presidents Trump and Putin met for unprecedented talks.
The Summit hailed by both leaders as a success" is now being challenged by opponents, principally in the United States as a betrayal, a sell-out to Russia and President Trump is accused of becoming a puppet of KGB operative Putin. No words are spared in criticizing Trump.
He is even accused of treason. So what happened in Helsinki is still a debatable point. The entire furor is based on a wrong premise. It reduces to a reaction to an alleged Russian interference in the United States Presidential election in 2016. Russia is accused of interfering in the elections to secure a victory for Trump against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russian hackers are said to have infiltrated the website of Democratic Party and divulged confidential information. In fact, Robert Mueller, the US Attorney investigating the allegation had indicted 12 Russian military officials over the crime.
Russia denies the charges and President Putin told President Trump that US investigators are welcome to visit Russia and interrogate the accused military personnel. However, the US Congress has passed a resolution against such a visit. Incidentally, the Investigating Authority into the election meddling is none other than Robert Mueller who was responsible for misinforming President George W Bush about the existence of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) which led to the Iraqi War of 2003. Such interference, even if it had taken place, is not an extra-ordinary development in global politics.
World powers always interfere in elections in other countries in pursuit of their national interests. The United States has been funding opposition groups in Russia, funding them and even instigating regime change. The US has been caught pants down many a time in manipulating elections in El Salvador, Chile, Nicaragua and a host of Third World countries.
What the world public expects and what the nuclear power leaders are duty bound is to ease global tensions and ensure the reduction of nuclear weaponry and avert nuclear war. It is sad to say that conservative elements linked to Wall Street and the military- industrial complex in the United States are undermining this important objective and prioritizing a relatively minor issue. Prof. Stephen F Cohen of the Princeton University is of the opinion that the mere meeting of the two foremost nuclear powers is worth to improve the deteriorated relations between them. President Trump blamed both Russia and the United States for this unprecedented deterioration.
Taken in that perspective, the Helsinki Summit has been a success despite the lack of concrete progress on specific issues. As President Trump said it is a good beginning. President Putin was also invited to visit Washington and talks are already on way on the matter despite the opposition in the Congress.
In view of the strong opposition President Trump has retraced some of his steps and accepted the verdict of the US Intelligence community on the election meddling issue, in a manner so characteristic of him.
Whatever it is, he has gone far in developing a pragmatic approach to foreign policy issues instead of his election campaign rhetoric. Geo-politics and the compulsion of world public opinion are hard to circumvent.

Cricketers and their superstitions
The game of cricket has seen many superstitious cricketers. No matter how big the cricketer is or the number of runs he has scored or the number of wickets he has picked, he would still continue to follow certain superstitions which he believes would help him to succeed. After a point of time, the superstitions become a part of his game and his teammates too become accustomed to the same.
Here is a look at some superstitions followed by cricketers at the international level:
STEVE WAUGH- THE LUCKY RED HANDKERCHIEF
Steve Waugh was one of the most respected cricketers to have played the game of cricket. Waugh, due to his dynamic leadership skills was an example for young cricketers on and off the cricket field.
The right-handed all-rounder from New South Wales scored 10,927 Test runs at an average of 51.06 and 7569 ODI runs at an average of 32.90.
During his tenure as an Australian captain, he led his team to many famous victories home and away and Australia was a dominant force in Test cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
He also inspired the Australian ODI team and led them to a World Cup win in England in 1999.
Waugh always carried a red handkerchief in his left pocket while batting. The red handkerchief was presented to him by his grandmother and according to Waugh, it brought him luck whenever he carried the said handkerchief while batting.
By the time he called it a day in the year 2004, the handkerchief was totally tattered but Waugh considered it as his lucky charm.
He even presented a piece of the said handkerchief to the Windies batsman Marlon Samuels. Waugh was impressed with the temperament and the talent of Samuels and a part of his precious red handkerchief was gifted to Samuels.
NEIL MCKENZIE- THE MOST SUPERSTITIOUS CRICKETER
Neil McKenzie certainly tops the list as far as the weirdest superstitions are concerned in the game of cricket.
The right-handed batsman from South Africa made sure that all the toilet seats in the dressing room were down before he went out to bat. If that was not enough, Neil also needed to have all the lights in the changing room off before he went out in the middle to play his first ball. And finally, he had to tap his bat on the ceiling before each game.
McKenzie went on to play 58 Tests and 64 ODIs for South Africa and averaged 37.39 and 37.51 in Tests and ODIs respectively before retiring from international cricket in 2009.
SANATH JAYASURIYA- CHECKING HIS CRICKET KIT
The left-handed opening batsman from Sri Lanka changed the dynamics of ODI cricket in the 1996 World Cup by playing attacking cricket in the first 15 overs. Jayasuriya along with his opening partner Kaluwitharana attacked the bowlers from the first over to put the fielding team under tremendous pressure.
The starts given by Jayasuriya in the first 15 overs were extremely vital in Sri Lankas successful campaign in the 1996 World Cup.
Jayasuriya had the superstition of checking his entire cricket kit i.e. his gloves, pads, helmet, bat and even his pockets before facing each ball. He followed this routine in every match he played at the international level.
The veteran scored 13,430 ODI runs and picked up 323 ODI wickets which is a record in itself. Even in Tests, Jayasuriya scored 6973 runs at an average of 40.07.
Jayasuriya is one of the top all-rounders to have played the game of cricket.
MS DHONI- REMOVING THE STRAPS OF HIS GLOVES
While M.S. Dhoni is batting, it is not an unusual sight of watching him remove the straps of his gloves at regular intervals especially when he dispatches the ball to the boundary.
The fans around the world are used to this sight of Dhoni removing the straps of the gloves to tighten the grip. This practice may have been followed by the former Indian skipper to ensure that the bat does not slip from his hand. And after almost 13 years in international cricket, it has become a habit for M. S. Dhoni.
Dhoni has led India to wins in the 2007 World T 20 in South Africa, 2011 World Cup triumph in the subcontinent and the Champions Trophy victory in England in 2017. Dhoni is the most successful wicket-keeper to have played for India in all the three formats.
MAHELA JAYAWARDENE- KISSING THE BAT
The former Sri Lankan skipper was one of the finest middle order batsmen to have played the game of cricket.
During his early days at the international level, Jayawardene had the habit of kissing his bat before he faced every ball. However, with the passage of time, the Sri Lankan kissed his bat only on reaching a milestone i.e. a half century or a century.
Jayawardene has the distinction of scoring 10,000 plus runs in Test cricket and ODI cricket and has scored 11814 Test runs and 12650 ODI runs. He is regarded as one of the modern-day greats in international cricket as he scored runs all over the globe.

No other country could better understand the preciousness of Free Trade than Sri Lanka
A FREE AND OPEN WORLD TRADING SYSTEM, COMMON WEALTH OF PEOPLE
The year 2018 marks the 40thanniversary of Chinas reform and opening-up and the 17th anniversary of China accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
In 2001, China acceded to the WTO, which marked a new historic stage of reform and opening-up and was a milestone in Chinas integration into economic globalization. Over the past 17 years, China has been developing rapidly and making all-round progress. Now it has grown into the worlds second largest economy and largest trading country. On June 28, the State Council Information Office of China issued the white paper of China and World Trade Organization, which gives a full account of Chinas fulfilment of its WTO commitments, explains Chinas principles, stances, policies, and propositions regarding the multilateral trading system, and describes Chinas vision and actions in advancing higher-level reform and opening-up. Accession to the WTO has boosted Chinas development and benefited the rest of the world. It is the valuable experience of Chinas development to create momentum for reform and development through opening up. At the historic starting point of a new era, Chinas door of opening-up will not be closed and will only open even wider.
Chinas development
Chinas development has benefited the whole world, including Sri Lanka.
Cheng Xueyuan. Ambassador of the Peoples Republic of China to Sri Lanka
Since 2002, Chinas contribution to global economic growth has approached 30% on average. The Chinese economy has become a major engine for global economic recovery and growth. China has quickened its pace in modernization, created enormous opportunities for consumption and investment, and generated more jobs for the world. Chinas imports increase by an annual average of 13.5%, making it the worlds second largest importer and a major trade partner of more than 120 countries and regions. Chinas exports have provided high-quality products with reasonable price for businesses and people around the world. China has become the worlds second largest service importer, making significant contributions to stimulating consumption, creating jobs and boosting economic growth in the exporting countries. Taking tourism services as an example, China has been the worlds largest source of outbound tourists for many years in a row.
When it comes to Sri Lanka, the value of bilateral trade has reached 4.4 billion US dollars in 2017. A large quantity of high-quality and inexpensive products made in China such as household appliances, electronic products, furniture and toys have been exported to Sri Lanka, making continuous contributions to improving the living standard of Sri Lankan people. 268,952 Chinese tourists came to Sri Lanka in 2017, which is a continuation of the two countries thousand years of connections through Buddhism. This has made concrete contributions to the development of hotels, catering, tourism services of the local area, and various industries in food, clothing, accommodation, transportation, featured products of the neighbouring regions. These data and facts tell us that if China becomes better, Sri Lanka and the rest of the world will also become better.
China playing an irreplaceable role
The multilateral trading system is a precious treasure that the whole world should cherish; China has played an irreplaceable role in upholding the multilateral trading system.
Trade has existed since the origin of the human being. At the very beginning, the purpose of trade was to mutually exchange needed goods. It is trade that has helped mankind cross one threshold and another to realize exchanges between different civilizations and promote the development and progress of human civilization. Since modern times, all countries in the world, no matter big or small and no matter with strong or moderate production capacity, have given full play to their comparative advantages and gained economic benefits from international trade, through taking advantage of their different natural endowments and the socialized and international division of labour. The generalized benefits of free trade have been proved by numerous economic studies and it is a well-accepted principle by the whole world.
Since its accession to the WTO, China has comprehensively fulfilled its commitments, aligned its policies with international trade rules, and contributed significantly to the upholding and development of multilateral trading system. China has substantively reduced import tariffs. By 2010, China had fulfilled all of its tariff reduction commitments, reducing the average tariff level from 15.3% in 2001 to 9.8%. The country has substantially opened up trade in services. China is committed to opening up 100 sub-sectors under 9 sectors of trade in services and when acceding to the WTO, and by 2007, China had honoured all of its commitments.
China gives great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). We have built an IPR legal system that conforms to WTO rules and suits the national conditions of China and strengthened law enforcement on IPR protection, which has scored outstanding achievements. China upholds the multilateral trading system and promotes free trade arrangements. By May 2018, the country had signed 16 free trade agreements (FTA) with 24 countries and regions. In those free trade agreements, and basically 90% of imported products enjoy duty free treatment.
Chinas door of opening-up will only open even wider in the new era.
Unilateralism and protectionism run counter to the fundamental principles of the WTO. Unilateralism goes against the law of the market and international rules, causes injury to others but ends up defeating oneself. Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air. Next, China will steadfastly promote its continuous opening-up according to the principles set at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Chinas development is beneficial to the international community and China stands ready to provide more public goods to the world. The Belt and Road Initiative was an important move proposed by China to uphold and grow an open world economy. Since 2013 when it was proposed, more than 80 countries and international organisations have signed cooperation agreements with China. From 2013 to 2017, the total value of Chinas trade with other Belt and Road countries exceeded 5 trillion USD, and total investment by Chinese enterprises in these countries exceeded 70 billion USD. By the end of 2017, Chinese enterprises had set up 75 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones in relevant countries, contributed tax revenues worth more than 1.6 billion USD to the host countries and created 220,000 local jobs. Within three years starting from 2018, China will provide 60 billion RMB worth of aid to the developing countries and international organisations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, with a view to developing more projects to improve peoples livelihood. In November 2018, we will hold the first China International Import Expo (CIIE). This is the worlds first expo themed on import and is a major policy measure of China to further open its market to the world. Exhibitors from Sri Lanka, together with those from other countries, will present the charm of Sri Lanka to the huge consumption market of China at the expo. In the coming 15 years, China is expected to import 24 trillion USD worth of goods. An open China in the new era will bring more dynamism to world economic growth and share with the whole world the dividends of its reform and opening-up.
Located at the center of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has acted as a regional trade center since ancient times. Sri Lanka has not only played its role as a central node in promoting global trade development, but also benefited a lot from the free trading system. No other country could better understand the importance of upholding the free trading system than Sri Lanka.
As an ancient Chinese saying goes, When everybody adds fuel, the flames rise high. Now it is the time for all men of insight around the world to join hands to add fuel to the open and equal free trading system and make the flames of human reason and wisdom burn brightly. Let us work hand-in-hand to uphold the open and inclusive world trading system. Sri Lanka will certainly gain faster and better development from the free and open world trading system.

Galle Stadium should remain a Test cricket venue
Galle boasts of a rich cricket heritage with the first school match played at this same venue (then known as the famous Galle Esplanade) as far back as May 1888 between Richmond College Galle and All Saints College Galle.
The first International cricket match was played at the Galle Esplanade in 1952 against MCC. The Galle Cricket Club now 143 years old is one of the oldest and famous cricket clubs in Sri Lanka affiliated to Sri Lanka Cricket as a Controlling Club.
The First Test Match in Galle was played in 1998 between New Zealand and Sri Lanka which Sri Lanka won with former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene scoring a brilliant 167 runs. Sri Lanka has to-date played 31 Test matches at this famous venue with a number of records broken including many noteworthy performances.
The Galle cricket stadium is one of the most picturesque Test venues in the whole world and is in the best located place in Galle town with free movement of vehicular traffic around the stadium overlooking the famous Galle Dutch Fort. It is a haven for tourists who witness international games and roam the Galle Town.
This is a time when the leading Galle schools such as Richmond, Mahinda and St. Aloysius play a dominant role in school cricket. They have produced several National cricketers at all levels in the recent past. It is significant to mention it was under the captaincy of Suranga Lakmal, a proud product of Richmond College, Sri Lanka beat South Africa last week in the First Test played at Galle Cricket Stadium. At a time when Provincial cricket is being mooted by SLC it would be a shame if the game is affected by the loss of a Test venue in the South. The game of cricket has a history of more than 200 years in our country and is an integral part of sport. The Galle Stadium under such circumstances should at all costs be maintained as a Test Venue satisfying whatever
criteria laid by the UNESCO authorities and with the co-ordination of the Government, SLC, UDA and the Galle Municipal Council. A balance need to be struck between heritage and sport through negotiation to retain both aspects important to our beautiful island.
Let us hope that sanity prevails and cricket will flourish in this famous venue for the greater good of the game.

National Export Strategy launched
Government to improve export capacity
The National Export Strategy (NES) will help increase the capacity of the export sector and improve trade performance, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the launch of the National Export Strategy, a five-year plan to increase and diversify Sri Lankas exports and harness Sri Lankas strategic position on east-west trade routes.
The plan aims to make Sri Lanka a trade hub in the Indian Ocean and to assist in achieving Sri Lankas goal of $28 billion in exports by 2022. Developed with the support of the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the European Union (EU), the plan has over 600 public and private sector stakeholders.
This is not only a national export strategy, it is also a jobs and income strategy, the Premier added.
The Prime Minister compared Sri Lankas economic progress to that of other countries in the region. If you look at all the developed countries of Asia, they have done so by becoming export economies. He pointed out that Sri Lanka opened up trade in 1977, but still lags behind countries such as Bangladesh, who opened up later. We have given excuses for non-performance.
We havent looked at why we didnt perform or why we havent given our people more employment, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the development of Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with a number of countries. We have China who is talking over FTAs with us and we are talking about deepening FTAs with India, he said, adding that someday, Sri Lanka will negotiate FTAs across the Bay of Bengal as well.
The NES will support traditional export industries and specifically focus on the development of six sectors: information technology and business process management; spices and concentrates; wellness tourism; processed food and beverages; boat building; and electronics and electrical components.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama assured stakeholders that the NES will positively impact all sectors, not just those listed.
Samarawickrama echoed the PMs sentiment, looking to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan as models.
Rapid development has taken place in those countries by liberalizing their trade policies and improving the ease of doing business, he said. Paul Godfrey, Charg dAffaires of the Delegation of the EU to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, stressed the importance of Sri Lankas curtailing corruption to gain trust from foreign investors.
If the government is to achieve the ambition of Sri Lanka becoming a regional hub, there needs to be clear advantages for businesses basing their services in Sri Lanka, he said. Reforms have not impacted business perspective, Godfrey added.
Arancha Gonzales, Executive Director at the ITC in Geneva praised the government for allocating the proper funds for NES in the national budget of 2018 and for appointing advisory committees under the Export Development Board (EDB) to coordinate implementation.
The commitment of all key public and private institutions, from Hambantota in the south to Jaffna in the north, is a true demonstration of the Sri Lankan commitment to making the Island recognized for its export potential, she said.
The ITC will offer continued support and assist in the implementation of the NES over the next five years. The government also plans to check in with exporters every six months to track progress.

HSBC Future Lions Golf grassroot programme targets 800 new junior players
The HSBC Future Lions Programme which was initiated last year in five island wide locations, namely Welisara, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura and Kilinochchi with the participation of over 300 school children, seems to have almost come full circle said Dirk Flamer-Caldera a member of the Future Lions organising sub-committee.
The programmes in Welisara, Anuradhapura and Kilinochchi continued throughout the year thanks to the generosity of the Sri Lanka Golf Union.
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces as well as the Kandy and Nuwara Eliya Golf Clubs ably took ownership of these programmes and conducted them with considerable success.
Following on a novices tournament was held for the juniors of the Welisara, Anuradhapura and Kilinochchi academies in April 2018.
The team event was won by Kilinochchi and the best individual score came from Anuradhapura. The SLGU takes pride in the fact that four promising kids from each of these three academies will travel to Colombo to participate in the HSBC international tournament due to be played on August 1.
The HSBC Future Lions Programme / The Schools Golf Development Programme will start afresh once more on July 27 with the
addition of three new locations namely, Eagles Golf Links China Bay, Diyatalawa Army Golf Course and Shangri la golf course Hambantota.
MASKreeda, the apparel partner will provide sportswear for the Future Lions programme. Speaking on the sponsorship, Sarinda Unamboowe, CEO/Managing Director MAS KREEDA is happy to once again be a part of the HSBC Sri Lanka International Junior Golf Championship 2018 following what was a very successful kickoff in 2017.
I was proud to see this initiative take flight and have a positive effect on junior golf in the island.
To ensure the further growth of golfing talent we at KREEDA look forward to the prospect of working cohesively with the Sri Lanka Golf Union to increase accessibility and opportunity for junior golfers island wide. I would also like to wish the SLGU the best of luck on this exciting programme IMORICH Premium Ice Cream from Elephant House has once again partnered with the Sri Lanka Golf Union for the HSBC Premier Sri Lanka International Junior Golf Championships as the official Indulgence Partner.

Imran Khans ex-wife spares nothing and nobody in memoir
Imran Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, has a good shot at becoming the countrys next prime minister after the election later this month. While his main rival, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), is under fire from the powerful military establishment as well as the judiciary, Imran Khans party is riding high on a mixture of anti-corruption rhetoric and religious conservatism.
Imran Khans dramatic past includes leading the Pakistan cricket team to victory at the 1992 World Cup and cultivating a playboy image, one that has now come back to haunt him. Last Thursday his former wife Reham Khan released a memoir, titled Reham Khan, that left no salacious stone unturned in recounting her time with the politician.
Reham Khan, a British-Pakistani, tied the knot with Imran in January 2015. The marriage lasted less than 10 months. Tales of drugs, sex and black magic abound in the book, which is quite problematic for Imran Khan given his positioning as a conservative Muslim. That aside, there is much for a watcher of Pakistans politics or a fan of Imran Khan. There is plenty in the book connected to India as well.
BOLLYWOOD FILM ON IMRAN KHAN
Reham Khan claims she invited a couple of Indian producers who had wanted to make a film on her ex-husband. Imran Khan liked the idea but wanted a curtailed narrative, one that stopped at his first marriage.
The book provides no further details about the proposed film and, as is common to the narrative, switches to an excruciatingly banal bit: water seepage in their house since plastering had been done on unprepared surfaces.
BE LIKE MODI (AND MANDELA)
Reham Khans book cover
Reham Khan talks about advising her debonair ex-husband to imitate Narendra Modi. Imran Khan dreamed of being Pakistans prime minister, but she knew it wasnt happening and advised him to keep his nose to the grindstone if he wanted the top job. I would gently and repeatedly give the example of Modi, the Indian Prime Minister, who was Chief Minister of Gujarat for a decade, and then elected to the top job because his seemingly strong governance record, despite all the other negative baggage, she writes.
In another section, Reham Khan says she would motivate Imran Khan with examples of Modi and the iconic South African leader Nelson Mandela.
It was clear that Imran felt it was high time he was given the prize. I would reason with him by saying, But Imran, Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a cell with no end in sight. Narendra Modi was a Chief Minister for 10 years before he became PM. He was voted in despite his radical views because of a good governance track record. Prove yourself in KP [the province of Khyber Pakhtunwa, ruled by Khans party] then look to the centre.
Do you know how old I am he would angrily snarl back at me.
But Hilary Clinton is 67 too. Does that mean she will just give up
I should really have saved my breath. Imran was like an impatient toddler at heart.
RELATIONSHIP WITH A TOP INDIAN ACTOR
Reham Khan recounts Imran Khans rumoured relationship with a Bollywood superstar of the 1970s, providing more than enough detail to identify the actor.
Considered to be one of the sexiest heroines of all time, there had been rumours of Imran and her. We had heard these whilst we were growing up. Imran confirmed to me that they were true. Though Imran was happy to sexually engage with actresses, he and the family clearly thought little of them. He recalled with a smile how his mother had been called by the newspapers, asking about the actress. She had replied, My son would never marry a prostitute! and slammed the phone down.
Imrans stories always painted the women in an unflattering light. He told me how he met her in Bombay, had his fill, and moved on. But, according to Imran, the lady followed him to London and became clingy. Imran said she scared him because she would ask to be slapped around during sex. Apparently, she was used to this kind of violence. Her boyfriend at the time had reportedly hit her in front of his guests at a party in a hotel, and so badly that her eye was left with permanent damage. I would check both these stories with a film producer friend of hers months later, who told me that it was actually Imran who had chased her, and that she had been very financially benevolent towards him. The sexy bombshell of the 70s had described the interaction with our mutual friend rather disparagingly (in her filmy words) as, Naam baray aur darshan chotay (the hype was bigger than the rather small package on offer).
IMRAN KHANS ALLEGED CHILDREN IN INDIA
The relationship with the 1970s superstar was not the only romantic association he had with an Indian woman. Reham Khan claims he has children in India, who have no idea that their biological father is the former Pakistan captain.
He grinned mischievously. There are 5 in total, that I know of.
Five what! I gasped.
Kids, he laughed.
What You have five illegitimate children! How do you know I asked.
Well, the mothers told me, he said.
All Whites
No, some are Indians. The eldest is 34 now.
How Imran Why did the mother not come out with it
Because she was over the moon! She had been married for ages and couldnt get pregnant. She was overjoyed, promised to keep it a secret, and begged to keep it. So I said OK.
And the rest Why did they never speak I fired at him.
There were so many questions in my head. Well, because they were all married and they didnt want their marriages to be destroyed, he said.
PERVEZ MUSHARRAF IS A KUMAR SANU FAN
Reham Khan recounts an event for Pakistanis in the United Kingdom where the former Pakistani president got a bit sloshed on red wine. Musharraf would grab the mic and break into his favourite songs, she writes. The one I remember is the famous Bollywood number Tu meri ashiqui hai.
Given his public image as an upright, no-nonsense guy, Reham says she was disgusted with what she saw.
It is not completely clear which song Reham is referring too  there seems to be no Bollywood song with that exact title  but it might be this Kumar Sanu classic from the 1990 movie Aashiqui.
REHAM KHAN BLAMES BOLLYWOOD FOR HER MARRIAGE
Like all British Asians, Reham Khan grew up on a diet of Bollywood movies. The patriarchy they promoted, she argues, weakened her judgement when marrying Imran Khan. I put my brain to the side at the time of the nikkah, she regrets.
Like many of my generation, I was fed a culture of Bollywood, where the practice of Karwa Chauth (fasting and praying for the long life of your husband) was presented so romantically. The concept of the husband being like a god is promoted in both Hindu and Urdu literature, with terms like Pati Parmeshwar and Mazaji Khuda liberally sprinkled on both sides of the border. The husband is referred to as the Sartaj (crown); the sanctity of marriage symbolised by the Mangalsutra (sacred thread) and the central parting coloured with red sindoor (powder). Widows in the subcontinent traditionally wear only white, to show that all colour in their lives is gone when the husband is no more. These were concepts we had seen a million times over. The woman as a dasi (devotee) is glorified in our culture regardless of our religion. Young, progressive men across the country would be bowled over by my spontaneous declaration in the famous press conference in the constituency of NA-246 (Karachi) in April 2015, only a few months from this moment, where I would refer to my husband as the only jewellery I needed to enhance me. Mera shohar hee mera zewar hai, I would cry out.
WARNING: DONT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU LIKE DAAL MAKHANI (OR DISLIKE ISLAMIC HERESY)
Memoirs should always be frank. But as is clear now, they can also be a bit too frank. Reham Khan describes Imrans fascination with superstitions, one of which involves a curious act  with kaali daal, the lentils used to make the famous Punjabi dish daal makhani.
On a day in November, Id walk into the bedroom to find my new husband lying naked on a white sheet, rubbing kaali daal (black lentils) all over himself. He laughed in embarrassment as he rubbed them on his genitalia. He then stood up and shook the lentils onto the sheet for Anwarzeb, the home help, to take away. I stood there in shock. Imran explained that Ahad, his brother-in-law, had brought a man with him who had recommended the treatment because he believed someone had done some black magic on Imran.
Tales of grown men massaging their private parts with daal is embarrassing enough, but his ex-wifes book hurts Imran Khan politically as well, striking at the heart of his positioning as an orthodox Muslim. His mostly urban supporters wont take kindly to their leader indulging in any sort of black magic, with or without kali daal. To drive home the point, Reham Khan underlines her own Islamic orthodoxy. Imran Khans superstitious beliefs were a huge culture shock for her, she writes, since she came from a family that had always adhered to a strict code of simplicity, as prescribed by the Sharia, and in which biddah is not practised.
Biddah is an Islamic notion of heresy that conservatives often employ to decry the practices of South Asian Muslims they believe have pagan origins, such as visiting shrines or wearing magic amulets, which Reham Kham also accuses her former husband of.
Reham Khan also wields a trope popularised by political Islamists to attack Imran Khan: she accuses him of being associated with active Zionists, through another former wife Jenima Goldsmith, who is of Jewish descent, prompting this angry tweet:
Jemima Goldsmith<U+2714>@Jemima_Khan
On Reham Khan's book I've been assured that it's too libellous to be published in the UK but if it is published here, I will be suing for defamation & breach of privacy on behalf of my (then) 16 yr old son & in relation to the moronic, re-hashed Zionist conspiracy theories. Sigh

Lanka awaits experts report for joint venture
India keen on running Mattala airport
The Sri Lankan government is awaiting a report from experts to finalise its joint venture with India, to run the loss-making Mattala airport in the islands Southern Province, The Hindu reported yesterday.
Once the report is out, the proposal will be taken to the Cabinet for clearance, a top official in the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation told The Hindu .
According to the proposed joint venture between the Airports Authority of India and the Airport and Aviation Services in Sri Lanka, India will own a 70 percent stake and pump in $225 million to revamp and run the airport, while the Sri Lankan side will invest the rest. As per the draft agreement, fine-tuned over three formal rounds of negotiations in Colombo, India will operate the airport on a 40-year lease.
We need to revive this dying airport, which caused a massive loss of rupees 20 billion, Minister of Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva told Parliament recently.
Getting here was not easy for either side, particularly with opposition forces, aligned to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, staunchly opposing the deal that they claim amounts to the sale of national assets to foreigners.
Ever since Mr. Rajapaksa built the airport in 2013, at an initial cost of about $200 million, the facility has been incurring huge losses and has made international headlines as the worlds emptiest airport. In June, Dubais Flydubai became the last airline to pull out of Mattala, Sri Lankas second international airport.
The Mattala joint venture will explore options like setting up a flying school, running a training academy, and re-routing air traffic, because the aim is to somehow make the facility commercially viable, the top official said. However, those at the negotiating table know that it is no easy task.
With a current operational cost of LKR 250 million (roughly $1.56 million) per month, without a single flight, the airport offers little commercial logic. All the same, its proximity to Hambantota, less than 30 km away, where China holds a 70 percent stake in the massive port it helped build, appears to be reason enough from Indias strategic standpoint. - The Hindu
