TBWA\Sri Lanka 'disrupted' at two-day workshop
TBWA\Sri Lanka was disrupted by Robin Nayak, Chief Strategy Officer, Singapore and South East Asia at a recently concluded two-day workshop, in Colombo.
The Sri Lanka team was rejuvenated on Disruption using a live local brief and other simulated cases at the workshop making it hands-on and practical.
The workshop also marked the launch of Disruption Live in the Sri Lanka office where the emphasis was placed on being in line with the TBWA\ Collectives best practice.
With Disruption being the common philosophy and way of working that binds the TBWA\ Collective together, it is also the one thing that differentiates a TBWA office from other players in the market.
With the premise of Disruption being that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is insanity, Disruption creates a focal point for a brand.
At its simplest, it is a way of looking at the conventions that operate within a category and finding a way for the brand to behave differently to accelerate its growth.
The Managing Director of TBWA\Sri Lanka, Renuka Marshall commented, What is exciting is that Disruption is not limited only to advertising or communication.
Anything and everything can be disrupted. The challenge is to know when and how to disrupt.
This paves way for exciting times ahead.
The hallmark of TBWA is that we dont follow cultural and market conventions  we overturn them. We anticipate future trends to determine what could lift a brand, said Robin Nayak.
TBWA\Sri Lanka Chief Creative Officer Subhash Pinnapola said, Disruption has been very much a part of our success. We take pride in developing business-changing, culture defining and effective ideas for brands. The international and local recognition as well as brand success stories reconfirm this.
TBWA\Sri Lanka is ranked as the second most awarded creative agency Sri Lankas and 65th in Asia as per Campaign Brief Asia 2016 creative rankings. The agency has a mix of MNC, blue chip and local clients across varied product categories including finance, insurance, food and beverage, snacks, property, health care, vehicles, etc.
TBWA\Sri Lanka takes pride in building iconic brands in Sri Lanka that generate results for their clients as well as taking Sri Lanka to the world and bringing honor to the country through the numerous awards at international creative awards shows.

They who wish to be obeyed
Collective aspirations of individuals are strong and powerful. They make and break governments. They bring parties and individuals to power and ousted them when their aspirations are not made a reality. The vision of a government should necessarily be based on what people think is right. Moreover, it should definitely meet their overall expectations. Any government or political party can come up with appealing development programmes but nothing will be achieved unless they are implemented.
Transforming the overall ambitions of individuals into the vision of the government can only become a reality if individual parliamentarians execute their respective responsibilities with a strong political will. As a leader, collective aspirations are made a reality through flawless execution as mentioned above. No leader can do a single micro level activity on his/her own. In order to achieve this, they should be able to get things done and make things happen through the cooperation and support of others, be it bureaucratic public sector or private sector. All in all, 99% of any kind of success depends on the flawless execution of plans and activities.
Within the four macro level challenges identified earlier in this article, there are many other challenges that require time and energy, rational and emotional contemplation in order to come up with robust solutions. Certain issues regardless of them being at a macro or a micro level, have been pestering the country for ages. Those affected by these issues say that no one has taken their issues seriously. Those who hold office should be agile in addressing these issues and responsive when the issues are brought to their attention. In order to better manage such issues, every parliamentarian should be objective savvy so that they can quantify the impact and prioritize a course of action accordingly.
Policy decisions
In order to enable growth and achieve the vision of the government, certain policy decisions should be made. This requires changes to the existing regulations and reform in order to meet modern day requirements. Decisiveness in such policy decisions and reforms is a must, in order not to give in to political and social pressures that are coming from multiple parties because what is right is not always popular.
It is easier said than done. Only fruits fall from trees without an effort. Everything else has to be made possible. Leaders should be proactive in looking for the reasons as to why things are not happening the way they are supposed to happen. While the articulation of a vision and its flawless execution are critical, leaders should also be proactive in looking for obstacles that may hinder progress. Be it red tapes, process or policies, if seen as an obstacle it should be proactively eliminated to facilitate execution.
We have learnt that insignificant daily activities can lead to significant outcomes. Therefore relentless focus on achieving respective objectives is key regardless of the changes that may occur.
Politicians are often blamed for being surrounded by the wrong people. These so called wrong supporters are supposed to be the wrong crowd to have around due to various reasons. They may be politically misguided due to the fact that they were supporting a different political ideology or regime or they used to criticize the current government when they were supporting the opposition. They may be known for corruption or various other wrong doings in the past.
Even though the prevailing electoral system encourages being surrounded by the wrong crowd, it is detrimental that political leaders surround themselves with the right sort of people who are capable. When you say the right people they should be politically accurate, believing in an effective political ideology and should have faith in an effective political vision. Moreover, they should be generally accepted by the majority of the general public.
Just being right does not necessarily mean that they are capable. It is very important that the people who are appointed to hold different leadership positions in public enterprises, different ministries and authorities are capable of executing tasks and getting things done by keeping the overall political vision in mind. It is extremely important to have a group of people who are not only capable of executing plans but who also have faith in the political vision of the government.
If change were an easy thing to achieve, things would have been much easier all over the world. The amount of resistance and political pressure that are coming from different parties would have been minimal if it were the case. It is very much important for a leader to be able to influence the key stakeholders across the society at large.
Be it religious leaders, social leaders, labour unions and various other social groups who have received a sense of acceptance among the general public. Unless properly managed, these stakeholders can sabotage or can cause significant delays for much awaited political efforts to develop the country as a whole. Therefore, it is important to maintain regular briefings and educate them on and about the bigger picture in terms of the overall socio economic impact.
Holding broad support
The ability and the charisma to capture and hold the support of diverse groups both locally and internationally is a key trait that a determined and an effective political leader should possess. However this does not mean using bribes and fake promises to keep a strong hold on his/her supporters and well wishers, nor does this mean giving a packet of rice and a bottle of arrack to get the votes of his/her electorate, rather this simply means the ability to be a leader in the true sense of the word by being fair, honest and transparent as much as possible in his/her dealings and activities.
A political leader who is widely supported and loved is supposed to be street smart and know instinctually to get off his/her high horses and approach the people at a grass root level as well as h/she is supposed to be qualified, intelligent, well versed, and literate in English and all the other main languages used locally in order to gain the respect and support of professionals and intellectuals both at a national and an international level.
In order to unite diverse ideologies, different age groups, diverse ethnic groups and socio economic classes in the country, an effective political leader needs to set an example to the general public by treating everyone equally, enacting policies to reduce ethnic, age and gender discrimination.
This means reducing favouritism and eradicating unfair practices such as giving prominence to his/her close friends, family or supporters. Moreover, a sense of clear direction and a high level of transparency, where all of his/her activities are accounted for and carried out in an open manner, will surely increase the support and respect that such a political leader would receive.
All in all, as a nation we have a long way to go in order to be a proud nation led by effective leaders. Such a day is not far from our future only if our leaders are willing and humble enough to look within themselves, accept their weaknesses and be brave enough to empower themselves by equipping themselves with the missing pieces, qualifications and tools. Only then, would we be able to effectively address the challenges that are facing us and be a proud nation led by great leaders

Thisara Perera named in World XI for Pakistan
Faf du Plessis named captain:
The World XI side that will tour Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in September, will be led by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, PCB chief Najam Sethi announced in a press conference on Thursday (August 24). The first two T20Is will be played on September 12 and 13, and the final game will be played on September 15. All the games will be played in Lahore.
The squad boasts of as many as five South Africa players, namely Hashim Amla, David Miller, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir, apart from skipper du Plessis himself. The star-studded 14-member squad will feature three Australians too, in the form of George Bailey, Ben Cutting and wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine. Darren Sammy, who was a part of the Pakistan Super League 2 Final, will lead the West Indian representation along side Samuel Badree.
There is one player each from England, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, in the form of Paul Collingwood, Tamim Iqbal, Thisara Perera and Grant Elliott respectively. The only countries which do not have a representation in the World XI squad are India, Zimbabwe and Pakistan of course.
I am honored to have been appointed as the captain of such a diverse, attractive and well balanced side. Like most of the players, I look forward to my maiden tour of Lahore and play my part in the safe and gradual resumption of international cricket in Pakistan, du Plessis said on the momentous occasion.
All the members of the squad have complete faith in the assessment and judgement of the security experts who have assured that there will be no compromise on the safety and security of all those involved in the series. As professionals, we are being paid to play in the series but the bottom line is that if we dont feel safe, no amount of money can get us there. In this background, we will land in Lahore with nothing except cricket on our minds.
In my career, I have featured in some very exciting matches against Pakistan but to play in Pakistan in front of its passionate supporters, will be a unique experience which I cannot wait to explain. As a player I understand the importance of playing in front of home crowds and that is something I am sure that Pakistani players will relish, du Plessis added.
I am looking forward to the trip to Pakistan. The rehabilitation of my shoulder is progressing well and I am confident of being fit for the matches, said Hashim Amla, who will be one among the five South Africa players in the World XI.
The World XI coach Andy Flower, who was one of the first to get on board, expressed his joy at the prospect of visiting Pakistan and being a part of the initiation of international cricket in the country. I have visited Pakistan in 1993, 1996 and 1998 with the Zimbabwe cricket team. I have enjoyed all my previous tours of Pakistan and look forward to returning to Lahore next month. All the players are satisfied and comfortable with the security arrangements that will be put in place for the series and are happy to be a part of the first step towards the safe return of international cricket in Pakistan.
We now look forward to playing some exciting cricket, so that we can entertain the Lahore crowd who have waited long enough to see local as well as international stars live in their backyard, Flower said.

WORLD XI: Faf du Plessis (captain), Hashim Amla, Samuel Badree, George Bailey, Paul Collingwood, Ben Cutting, Grant Elliott, Tamim Iqbal, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Tim Paine, Thisara Perera, Imran Tahir, Darren Sammy.

Truly Wonderful!
Kingswood Drama Culture ensures that their thespians receive a comprehensive knowledge of Drama. These boys learn of the realities in society and its light and darkness. Their productions such as Everyman, touch on adult themes such as God and Death. Dramatic Moves feature the Dramatists of Kingswood who receive an all- round knowledge on Drama.
Teacher in Charge Chathurika Niyadagala pointed out that there is no better motivator than Drama when it comes to producing an all-rounded character. She points out that it is a good foundation for a stable personality and the students acquire soft skills such as language, discipline and team spirit. Stage phobia vanishes through experience.
She points out that there is never a dull moment. The boys are lively and there are tons of climaxes and only a teacher can understand how really wonderful it is.
Challenging
We have to train the selected characters to get the best from them. But as they are children, its a challenge for us to get the real emotions out. We could achieve this by training them regularly -the scenes, gestures, facial expressions, changing the scenes, voice controlling, actions. But time restrictions have been a bit of a challenge. I always encourage my little gentlemen reminding them to be honest with what they do and do their best. And if they try, they can achieve their goals, said Niyadagala
Team work is the main thing she points out. This is especially true in a stage drama where each character is bounded with the others success, its not an individual item. So you must be aware of this to put out a really good production. The boys have always had it within them. They were the judges of their friends acting, and they criticized each other so they could correct their weaknesses.
Performing a stage drama is not an easy task at all, whether its a comedy, tragedy or a moral play. It has to be authentic, you must be confident and you must make sacrifices. Dedication is important. I must mention our dear Principal, who always encourages us along with the Deputy Principal Madam and Deputy Principal Sirs, the teacher in charge of the English unit, for their support given to uplift the drama unit, said Niyadagala
Meaningful experience
Dramatist Yashodh Ellepola spoke about Drama as a deeply meaningful experience. A very psychological experience.
For our English Day Performance we did a production called Everyman, it was written in the 15th century and it shows that human nature can change. The protagonist goes from the happiest guy on the planet to basically an emotional wreck! That shows us how fragile the human mind is! When I got into the skin of the character I felt like him even off the stage! I remember I was involved in the character so much, that a tear came out of my eye! It was amazing. I was really shaken! As the play went on the character evolved into someone who was calm and gracious. It was amazing because you get to know the character better than yourself! I have no words to describe it! The character becomes you! said Ellepola
A large part of the success of Everyman is due to the talent of the boys. Ellepolas ability to adapt and change character is remarkable. He goes from a psychopath to a very nice guy. His portrayal of these two extremely different people is proof of his talent and his adaptability of the roles. Ellepola who says he is extremely social, took around five days to get into the skin of the character. Working as a team he says it has its share of hardships. But balancing all their studies and activities, the boys pull through.
Drama has definitely benefited Ellepolas life off stage. He has learnt how to control and balance his emotions. He has built up his self esteem. He revels on stage, calling it an awesome experience. All in all Drama has been a real life changing experience for him. He is forever ready to push his limits and raise the bar.
Doing Drama is very important to the life of a student. It teaches you how to behave in society. You can actually learn that from doing drama. You learn how to behave with people. I remember one of our actors was bitter to the very end. He was really negative saying  I cant do this I cant do this, but in the end he became confident and enthusiastic. It bring out what you need in Society, explained Ellepola.
Ellepola is also an announcer and Drama has helped him with his voice. As mentioned above Ellepola is passionate. This passion for tragedy comes from the fact that he appreciates the deeper themes and realities of life.
I like doing tragedies  the sadness and the betrayal of the moment! I really like that. You dont get that anywhere else! It is only in Drama! I am so passionate I am also sometimes the character off stage. Totally submerging yourself in the character is one way of learning your lines and putting up a good performance, pointed out Ellepola.
Learning new things
Dramatist Damsara Liyanage is a young man who is blossoming into the competent thespian he will be one day. A young man in a stage of transition he is growing in confidence every day. Liyanage who has not completely overcome his stage fright is working on it and proves there is no such thing as Instant noodles and Rome was not built in a day.
One thing I have gained through drama is control over my emotions. We have had so much fun working with each other. Our teacher helps us a lot. Initially on stage I was frightened and shocked with the judges in front of me. For me I have gained a lot of things through drama. I improved my English but still I must confess I have not quite overcome my stage fright! But by practicing I grow a little stronger day by day, said Liyanage
The competition in the Drama circuit is of a very high standard and I see some really good performances. Losing that pressure for me is only a matter of time, as time goes on I am able to pull myself together and get my act together.
Really thrilling!
Dramatist Prabash Weerathunga Arachchi feels that it is this hunger to perform that keeps the boys in drama. It is fun and enhances your personality. When in the proper frame of mind Arachchi is able to deliver a classy performance. His frame of mind is not easily shattered. A young man with self assurance he does not trouble his mind too much about a production realizing that at the end of the day he and his team mates will emerge Victorious.
Drama has really developed my linguistic skills when it comes to English. When you are on stage and people are watching, it is really thrilling. To get over stage fright I put chairs in a row and pretend they are people and shout out my dialogue to them. If we consider a typical student, he can improve his social skills by doing drama. It boosts your self- esteem. I am able to get into the proper frame of my mind and make up my mind that I can deliver a good performance. So I have that self- assurance.
When stepping into the skin of a character first you need to understand his emotions and personality. Is he a person who is essentially good or bad What kind of qualities does he have You need to do your homework.
Doing Everyman has made us hungry for doing more dramas. We want to do more and more dramas. Because it has really boosted our self- esteem. We are ready to take on more risks and challenges. It is a bit scary getting up on stage and acting the role, if you dont obsess about it too much I dont think it will affect you very negatively.

Yesterday I Hit A Four..!
Just when I thought I was an old man, and couldnt do any young stuff anymore, I hit a four!
Yes, yesterday I hit a four.
It went right over the bowlers head, past outstretched hands of fielders and hit the boundary line. The crowd sitting to watch the cricket match, clapped gleefully. I saw my wife giving me a thumbs up sign and the commentator telling the bowler not to get fooled by the white streaks on my beard, but I missed my two children.
It would have been nice if theyd seen their father hit that four, and later another boundary and another, and at each stroke that took the ball to the boundary line, I missed the two yells, Come on daddy! Show them daddy!
They were always there, my two girls, not that Ive received many awards, but when I did, they came and stood and cheered, and for those cheers I tried to win the next and the next. And when they went away across the seas, it was like there was no need to hit those boundaries anymore.
But yesterday I hit a four.
Why Lord I asked. Why are you renewing my strength, why are you rekindling my enthusiasm Is there something youre telling me
And as the bowler came to bowl, and I with aged eyes could still see the ball, connect with it, and slam it over the fielders I knew there was a message for me.
The fielders came to me later. The bowlers too: Uncle, they said, We didnt know you played so well!
Neither did I, I whispered, Neither did I!
When my children left it was like a void. Id lived my life, encouraging them on, lifting their spirits, egging them to realize their goals. I had always thought they would achieve much, and they have, but always assumed it would be around where I was. And when they went away, a part of me, a big part crumpled.
But yesterday I hit a four!
It went right over the bowlers head, past the outstretched hands of fielder behind and hit the boundary line. The crowd sitting to watch the match, clapped gleefully. I saw my wife giving me a thumbs up sign, the commentator telling the bowler not to get fooled by the white streaks on my beard, but as I missed my two children, I realized the Lord up there was sending me a strong message, hard and fast like the bowlers ball.
Keep playing, the trees around the field seemed to say.
Win! shouted my daughters across the seas.
I have renewed your strength! whispered a voice above, and with a mighty heave I smashed the next ball to the boundary line and smiled at my wife as she gave me a thumbs up sign.
Its a message for all of us, who feel life is over when our kids grow up or go away: Its just the end of an over, so grip your bat and hit a four, and another and another..! [emailprotected]

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday refuted media speculation and comments made by the former Justice Minister that his department was taken to task during a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently.
In fact it is I who requested a meeting with the Prime Minister. During the meeting which took place at Temple Trees nothing which undermines the respect and integrity of the Attorney Generals Department happened, he added.
Jayasuriya noted the above when inquired about the comments made by outgoing Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on Wednesday that the AGs department had been castigated over several issues during the meeting with the Premier.
The Attorney General described the meeting with the Premier as very cordial and added that speculation his department had been dishonoured was completely false and baseless.

Pickled lady calls it quits
A contortionist who can fit her entire body into a jar no bigger than two foot high and 18 inches in diameter has suddenly announced she is to quit.
Steph Mercury, 22, from Dorset, has been the pickled lady, as part of the Circus of Horrors show for the last five years but is now giving up the job - after getting fed up with the constant aches, pains and bruises.
Steph, who is 5ft 4in tall, joined the circus at 17 years old and said: I have always been flexible since I was a child and did gymnastic and dancing but never realised how flexible I was until friends told me.
I went to see the Circus of Horrors and got chatting to them and ending up becoming part of it. When they suggested the act to me I thought, I can do that no problem but when I saw how small the jar was I wasnt so sure.
The transparent plastic jar is part of the act where the performer must cram themselves in before being cover in a blanket that is removed on stage in a shocking reveal.
Steph often loves to practice her skills by playing pranks on all her friends and family as her talent allows her to hide in small spaces.
Steph said: They get fed up of me hiding in cupboards and laundry baskets now but if they lose me they know where I am. I used to frighten my friend by hiding in his kitchen cupboards and even managed to fit myself inside a gym bag after a cage fighter who came along to the show didnt think I could do it. Its great fun when I go to Ikea because I can hide in all the furniture.
However being squeezed into a jar does come with consequences.
Steph said: I constantly have bruises on my sides and legs from wiggling into the jar, it can also give you back pain if you havent warmed up properly.
I had to perform at a bar opening and spent 20 minutes at a time in the jar, which means there is lots of condensation, and I was soaked when I came out and is not very glamorous. I do an aerial act too, and I want to focus more on that now - I feel as though I need to be stretched rather than squashed up for a change!
The pickled lady act has featured in the circus show since it began 22 years ago but the founder of the alternative circus show is looking for a new lady to not fill big shoes but fill a little jar.

 Lotters killing shows just how dangerous poaching has become, -Prince William
The Duke of Cambridgehas condemned the killing of a wildlife conservationist as a senseless loss. Wayne Lotter was shot in the Masaki district of the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam on August 16.
He helped set up the PAMS Foundation in 2009, which backs conservation work in Tanzania and is credited with helping to arrest thousands of poachers and traffickers.
But his high-profile role in protecting endangered wildlife in Tanzania led to numerous death threats against himself and his family.
In a statement William, who has campaigned globally to end the illegal wildlife trade, said: Wayne Lotters violent and apparently targeted murder shows just how dangerous the situation has become in relation to the big money that is associated with the illegal ivory and rhino horn trades.
Rangers and conservationists put themselves in harms way every day to stop organised criminals destroying Africas natural resources.
Governments and NGOs must win this fight for the sake of all of us, especially those in communities whose livelihoods are being plundered by murderous criminals.
Prince William paid tribute to Lotter and people like him who put themselves in harms way every day to stop organised criminals destroying Africas natural resources
My deepest condolences to Waynes family and all those at PAMS Foundation for this senseless loss.
The foundation said Tanzanian police are investigating.
The foundation said Mr Lotter helped to train thousands of game scouts throughout Tanzania and developed an intelligence-based approach to anti-poaching that has had success in countering wildlife trafficking there.
He is survived by his widow and two daughters.
Poachers have killed tens of thousands of elephants in Tanzania in the past decade.
Mr Lotter had 23 years of professional experience in wildlife management, conservation and environmental management.
On Wednesday last week he landed at the airport of the capital Dar es Salaam and was being driven to his hotel when his car was forced off the road and into a ditch.
Two gunmen got out and shot him repeatedly in the head and body then stole his laptop which is believed to contain sensitive information about poachers. Police say the fact that luggage and his wallet was left behind suggests that robbery was not a motive and that a price could have been put on his head.
He was remembered by friend and fellow leading conservationist Dr Jane Goodall as a hero for the way he devoted his life to protecting Africas wildlife in the face of stiff opposition and personal threats. She said his anti-poaching efforts made a big difference in the fight to save Tanzanias elephants from the illegal ivory trade, adding: If this cowardly shooting was an attempt to bring the work of the PAMS Foundation to an end it will fail.
Those who have been inspired by Wayne will fight on. But he will be sadly missed by so many.
A memorial service is to be held in his home town of Nelspruit, South Africa on Saturday..

16th Gajaba Supercross brings Saliyapura track alive on August 27
The 16th edition of the Gajaba Supercross organized by the SL Army's Gajaba Regiment in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Autosports Drivers Association (SLADA) and with the main sponsorship by CEAT will be held at the Anuradhapura, Saliyapura Gajaba racing track on August 27. This was revealed to the media during a press briefing at the Sri Lanka Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Regiment headquarters in Colombo recently.
Over 200 contestants will compete in 25 events including 12 motor car and 13 motorbike events in this year's Gajaba Supercross. This event is the fourth and final annual CEAT - SLADA Championship event of 2017 and a great enthusiasm has been shown among the contestants to earn more points before the year end. The six-event CEAT - SLADA Championship will not be able to complete its remaining two events before this December. Inaugurated in 1999, Gajaba Supercross is considered second only to Foxhill Supercross and did not conducted in 2000, 2008 and 2009 due to the regiment's strong commitment to appease the terrorist war in the country.
Adjutant General of SL Army, Colonel of the Gajaba Regiment and Gajaba Supercross Steering Committee head Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva reminded the great service rendered to the motherland by the Gajaba Regiment being a major infantry force in the war front. As a result, Gajaba Regiment became the highest casualty regiment due to war with 171 officers and 4090 other ranker deaths, 125 officers and 3637 soldiers partially or fully disabled.
According to Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva, Two main reasons led to the inception of Gajaba Supercross. The main reason was to raise funds to look after Regiment's war heroes and their families and secondly to cater motor sport fans of distant parts of the country like, Anuradhapura, Vavunia and Jaffna. He also revealed in this year alone seven houses are under construction for war hero families.
The 2km gravel track is considered to be the country's fastest track, with larger spectator areas where onlookers are offered a larger scope to view the full track from a one place.
The famous Foxhill track' s architect Hans Ralf and Maj Gen Gamini Gunasekera pioneered the construction of Gajaba track and the funds created by the Gajaba Supercross over the years were also directed to develop infrastructure and training facilities of the regimental training institute.
Organizers have arranged a special spectator stand in memory of late riding maestro Anada Wedisinghe at the Gajaba track and the Anada Wedisinghe Trophy will be awarded to the champion of the Super Motard bike event.
The Best Driver will take home the W.D.G.A Gunasekara Rolling Trophy while the Best Rider will be awarded the Hans Ralf Rolling Trophy. The tickets will be available only at the race venue entrance and priced at Rs. 500 (Grand Stand) and Rs. 100 (normal).
The SLADA president Mahesh Gammanpila explaining the race proceedings said; There will be a great contest at this year's Gajaba Suprecross as record number of 104 car and 134 motorbike entries have been received. "There will be two races in Super Car event as 16 entries have been received. We hope this year's event will turn out a great success," he concluded.
Maliban Biscuits joined in as the food partner and Maliban vice president - Sales and Marketing, Ravi Jayawardena said that they are delighted to join with this event and hope to continue their support in years to come.
CEAT Sri Lanka Deputy General Manager Bishri Latif, Gajaba Regiment Centre Commandant L. H. M. Rajapaksa, Army officials and large number of media personal were present at the media briefing.

Agony and ecstasy of Ministerial portfolios
After a long period of slumber the wheels of the Yahapalana administration, which were grinding to a halt, seemed to have received some impetus from public pressure and is beginning to show some positive movement. The resultant scenario saw the departure of two ministers from the Cabinet, both due to public pressure. However, the similarity ends there. The manner of their departure and the reasons for them are quite different in the two instances.
The first was the resignation, after some initial hesitation, of the worlds best Finance Minister - the affable Ravi Karunanayake. It was principally the SLFP wing in the consensual Government who initiated the move that resulted in the appointment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bond scam.
It must also be acknowledged that they got the support of the Joint Opposition, though it cannot be said that their genuine interest was to see an end to corruption in governance, being saddled itself with a heavy load of corruption and misappropriation of charges brought forward by the public and investigating offices of the State. It was at the Commission proceedings that Minister Karunanayakes conduct came to be questioned. Matters came to a head with the Minister pleading ignorance to facts revealed by other witnesses, which conduct seemed to be far from genuine.
Challenging authorities
The second was the removal of the Minister of Justice  the learned Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, learned not only because of his academic qualifications and legal experience but also due to his self-publicity as a learned man during his election campaign. In this case credit should be given to the UNP wing of the Government, especially its backbenchers in Parliament for being the prime mover of the process that ended in his removal. The manner of their departure, however, was distinctly different. In the first case it was a resignation and in the other it was a removal by the Executive. Minister Karunanayake by his sole act of resignation was transformed from a rogue to a saint instantly. Praises were showered upon him, even by his bitterest critics for being a gentleman par excellence, a paragon of virtue, who restored a glorious tradition. So after all, he can be pleased with his conduct.
In the second case minister Rajapakshe stayed defiantly in office challenging the authorities both party and State playing the role of an unjustly framed up hero amidst the cheers of a lonely JO, whose behind the curtain God Father - the former President himself, unhesitatingly identified him as a village buddy. At a press conference after his removal he said that he was ashamed to be in a Cabinet that sold State property to foreigners. Perhaps he would have forgotten how he happily voted to approve the Hambantota Port Project, which later he criticized and how he identified himself with several other decisions of the Cabinet. May be he developed the faculty of modesty  lajja baya in Sinhala  quite recently after the hullabaloo over his indiscipline inside the party. One may be excused for concluding that his eyes are fixed on a future lofty goal of becoming a super patriot- a la the Rajapaksa brothers.
In a twist of fate a former Minister who resigned earlier was again re-instated in office though his portfolio has been changed. Of course no one knows yet the reasons for his return. This situation may lead to speculation whether the present duo would also return after a lapse of time when public agitation subsides.
It is on record that Minister Amaraweera, a close confidant of President Maitripala Sirisena publicly stated that he would not vote against Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe if a vote of no confidence. Similar statements were made by several other SLFP parliamentarians in the Government. The contempt with which these politicians hold public opinion gives strength to the doubts in the public mind.
Much more has to be done to secure that law and order will prevail over political interference. The two departing Ministers have shown by their example that still political influence and interference prevails despite all the new legislation and the appointment of independent commissions. They are not the sole culprits. Practices and traditions of yesteryear still continue widely.
Personal opportunism
Not only politicians but also a section of the bureaucratic state apparatus is also engaged in breaking the law due to their political allegiances or due to personal opportunism. Financial constraints, harassment of duty conscious officials, shortage of human and material resources etc. paralyze law enforcement authorities and cripple their services.
One charge against Minister Wijeyadasa was his failure to adhere to collective responsibility of the Cabinet of Ministers. How many other Ministers are also guilty of the same abhorrent practice The SLFP is in half a mind whether to continue in office or attempt to form a Government under their leadership - an unrealizable dream in the short term.
With the forthcoming Local Government and Provincial Council elections in mind they play havoc with collective responsibility of the Cabinet and to use a local idiom play the role of bull in a china shop (walan kadeta penna gona wagei).
Not only Cabinet responsibility they also attack the Head of State, who is the President of their party by openly expounding policies not decided upon by the party of its President in an attempt to blackmail him. Noted in this respect are the day-time Miguels and night-time Daniels in it. Of course, it is also a consequence of the peculiar democracy found in that party where anyone could violate party discipline and get away scot free.
Emboldened by the latest developments, the former President now claims that he is still the President of the SLFP. Either he is insane or it is another of his crafty moves. It was under the glitz of the media that he offered the SLFP presidency to President Maitripala Sirisena and accepted the post of an Advisor of the Party. This column has repeatedly reiterated that it was a trap to surround the latter with a fifth column of Rajapaksa loyalists who would sabotage from within whatever President Sirisena decides and make him their prisoner. The Medamulane Vidanes latest statements prove our point.

Amended Local Government Elections Bill approved in Parliament

The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament today with a majority of 120 votes providing for holding the long overdue Local Government elections under a new electoral system.
Following a division called by the Joint Opposition, 120 members voted for the bill, while 44 members abstained.
No member voted against the bill.
The UNP and SLFP members in the Government, JVP and TNA voted in favour.
The Joint Opposition led by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena abstained from voting.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha moved further amendments to the bill at the committee stage of the Bill.
Several last minute amendments proposed by the JVP and Joint Opposition were also accommodated.
The Bill was to give effect to necessary legal amendments to hold the LG elections under a mixed system, a hybrid of the first-past-the-post (FPP) and the proportional representation (PR).
Sixty percent has been allocated to the FPP representation while 40 percent has been allocated to PR representation.
The new electoral system at the LG elections is to be tested and to be extended to Provincial Council Elections and national level elections.
The legislation assures 25 percent quota to female representatives. It abolishes the preferential voting system. Both moves received admiration of law makers as progressive proposals that would usher in a new political culture.
The Bill amended the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (Chapter 262) and provided identification for each electoral ward by giving a name and a number among other requirements. It was done following the lengthy process of delimitation.
The Government facilitated a full day debate on the Bill on Thursday and took up the third reading today.
The Amendments at the third reading took about one and half hours.
The members voted using the newly introduced electronic voting system.
The Parliamentary staff led by Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake helped the members to sort out the minor technical issues that cropped up when the vote was in progress.

Anura Kumara hails Unity Govt.
The Local Authorities Election System introduced under the Unity Government is the only one that considered the views of all parties in the political history of the country, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday. He said that when an election system was introduced in the past they did it with a view to further remain in power.
He added that during the previous regime although the then Minister Athaulla presented the Bill, it was then Minister Bassil Rajapaksa who responded to all the issues queried by the members.
He made these observations joining the second reading debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill.
MP Dissanayake said that the inability to hold the Local Authorities election had disrupted many development projects in the rural level as the Local Authorities had a close link with the ordinary life. He also urged the government to hold the local government election before the GCE Ordinary Level examination in December this year.
He also said the Local Government election could be held early this year only if the amendments to the Bill is passed before September 15 this year. He added that the Chairman of the Election Commission had stated that the local polls could be held before the Ordinary Level examination only if the amendments to local authorities bill is approved before September 15 this year. Therefore the amendments should be approved this week, MP Dissanayake said. The Joint Opposition too is attempting to postpone the polls further by asking for more time to study the new amendments.
MP Dissanayake said that JVP included some amendments to the Bill reducing the deposits to Rs 1,500.
A political party will have to spend at least 25 million for deposits alone according to present form of the election, MP Dissanayake said. High womens representation could be ensured only if the probability of election of women candidates in wards is increased. He also said small parties that get one or two members elected to a local body should not be forced to nominate women candidates. He added that small parties should be made to appoint a woman member only if such party obtains three or more seats.

Artificial water tanks set up for wild animals to quench their thirst: State Minister
During the prevailing drought in Puttalam and Thabbowa area, several artificial water tanks have been set in the Puttalam Thabbowa Abhaya Bhoomi area in order that the wild animals living in the nearby area could quench their thirst.
The artificial water tanks have been set up under the guidance of State Minister Palitha Ranga Bandara.
The State Minister's project is being implemented with the help of Police officers, Wildlife Conservation officers, Forest Department officers and also with the help of the general public.
Due to the drought, the water level in these water storages and small water tanks (Villu) have decreased, while the wild animals face difficulties in quenching their thirst.
Accordingly, to overcome these difficulties faced by wild animals, small water tanks have been dug, while polythene had been spread inside the holes. Water has been pumped over the polythene by bowsers, while water tanks have been set.

Bangladesh declares world-heritage forest pirate free
BANGLADESH: Bangladesh Police declared Thursday that rampant piracy in the Sundarbans was a thing of the past, crediting a gun buyback scheme for reducing crime and tiger poaching in the vast mangrove forest.
Police said more than 130 pirates operating in the forested delta region had surrendered their weapons and ammunition in exchange for cash, legal aid and mobile phones since the programme began just over a year ago.
The scheme had virtually eradicated the lawlessness once rife in the worlds largest mangrove forest, a natural habitat for endangered Bengal tigers, said a spokesman for the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.
Most of the areas in Sundarbans are now pirate-free, Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan told AFP.
So far 132 pirates-turned-poachers from 12 groups have surrendered. They abducted fishermen and were engaged in wildlife poaching in the Sundarbans. The battalion had spent more than a decade cracking down on criminality in the dense mangrove forest, with 117 pirates killed and nearly 400 arrested in sweeps since 2004.
But the buyback scheme, introduced in May 2016, has proved more effective in tackling crime in the UNESCO world heritage site.
Nearly 250 guns and 12,500 rounds of ammunition had been handed over in exchange for legal assistance, cash, mobile phones, winter clothing and gifts to mark the Islamic festival of Eid, Bhuiyan said.
The pirates are not granted amnesty for their offences but are viewed favourably for turning themselves in.

BASL to hold Ranjan in contempt
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has moved to file contempt of court proceedings in the Supreme Court against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, unless he provides evidence to his claim that a majority of the countrys judges and lawyers are corrupt.
The moment people start, without foundation, proof, and evidence, to question the authority of the courts, and the judiciary, the general public will start to lose respect and dignity towards them, Bar Association Deputy President M. U. M. Ali Sabry said at a press conference on Thursday. As a result of this, the entire rule of law will be derailed, he added.
Sabry said that if Ramanayake, the Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, had any information about corrupt judges or lawyers, he should report it to the Judicial Service Commission, the Bribery Commission, or the police.
Without talking to the gallery, go before the law enforcement authorities, he said.
Sabry said that disparaging the judiciary as a whole has become a very disturbing trend in Sri Lanka.

BASL President says no provisions in law to do so
Setting up of special court aiming at a particular family:
Commenting on the setting up of special courts aiming at a particular group or family, the Sri Lanka Bar Association President U. R. de Silva said that there were no provisions in the law to establish special courts to hear cases against certain groups of persons or certain kinds of cases.
But, certain parties with the aim of gaining political advantage, continuously highlights this issue and we are totally against such a move.
He was answering to queries raised by journalists at a press conference organized by the BASL yesterday.
He said there was no need to set up such Courts, as there were seven Courts in the Colombo High Court and seven Judges are going through cases in an efficient manner. There is no backlog of cases at the Colombo High Court. Most of the special cases have now come to the concluding stage. There was a delay as some cases were filed without submitting proper documents. Now, we have strong structures and which would ensure a speedy trial and a speedy hearing of cases in the future.
It is unfortunate that certain suspects are kept for long periods in remand without being indicted by Courts. Incapability and inefficiency of certain Police officers have resulted the delay in indictments," he added.

Basnayaka Nilame says two kapuwas damaging sanctity of sacred place
The Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya D P Kumarage, alleged that two kapuwas (officiating persons) attached to the Kataragama Maha Devalaya were damaging the sanctity of the sacred place by engaging in various malpractices in their greed for monetary gain.
He alleged that one of the priests who had kicked and damaged the door of his official residence, was participating in pooja activities by force.
Kumarage said so at a press conference held at the Oak Ray Hotel in Kandy on August 23, to put the record straight regarding the tense situation which had erupted at the Devalaya premises which led to the cancellation of the 4.30 am pooja recently.
Kumarage said the present upheaval at the Kataragama Devalaya would be settled within the next fortnight as he would take necessary steps to maintain peace and justice at the sacred precincts.
Kumarage said when there was a team of five persons responsible for pooja activities at the Devalaya, two of them were conducting its activities supported by thugs at the expense of the other three.
The two of them were one Somapala Ratnayake and his nephew. His attempt to take action against the two and bring normalcy, led to the recent tension.
He alleged that the two priests were engaged in this high handed action to pocket a share of the money placed by devotees in (pooja trays) as offerings and collection tills.
These offerings were never being properly audited.
Kumarage said the Police had already launched an investigation into the incident and the footage in the CCTV cameras would prove who was at fault.

Carrolls portraits of Alice on display
Victorian Giants: the Birth of Art Photography at the National Portrait Gallery in London from March 1 to May 20, 2018.
Original negatives of model for Alice in Wonderland among National Portrait Gallery exhibition, which includes Oscar Rejlander and Julia Margaret Cameron.
Fragile images by some of the pioneers of Victorian photography, rarely displayed because the prints and negatives are so vulnerable to light damage, will star in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London next spring.
The exhibition will include images by the Swedish photographer Oscar Rejlander, and will be the first time they have been publicly displayed in London since his death in 1875.
Lewis Carrolls portraits of Alice Liddell, the real model for his Alice in Wonderland  including the delicate original negatives  will also feature, as will the less familiar portraits by Julia Margaret Cameron of Liddell as a grown woman.
Rejlander is now much less famous than his followers, but they all learned from him and discussed their work with him over the years.
The Swede has been describe as the father of art photography, and even the father of Photoshop, for his complex montages. These included the epic 1857 Two Ways of Life, which is composed from 30 separate negatives, and had to be printed across two sheets. The work shows one young person choosing the Victorian virtues of marriage and domesticity, while the other rushes towards the more beguiling life of lust, gambling and idleness.
It raised eyebrows in the 19th century because of the number of barely draped females, but Queen Victoria was sufficiently impressed to buy a copy as a birthday present for her husband, Albert.
Phillip Prodger, head of photographs at the NPG, is curator of the Victorian Giants: the Birth of Art Photography exhibition. He predicted it would be an eye-opener for many visitors, illustrating nothing less than a new way of seeing.
When people think of Victorian photography, they sometimes think of stiff, fusty portraits of women in crinoline dresses, and men in bowler hats, he said. Victorian Giants is anything but.
The NPG managed to raise the money two years ago to save an album of Rejlanders work from export, which will be a highlight of the exhibition, along with the series illustrating human emotions which he created for the scientist Charles Darwin.
Rejlander remains a slightly mysterious figure. He is believed to have been born in Sweden in 1813, moved to Rome and trained as a painter. He then moved to England in the 1840s and switched to photography allegedly after a single afternoons training by a former valet of Henry Fox Talbot, another pioneer who invented a means of permanently fixing a photographic image.
When he died in 1875 his obituary in the Photographic News admitted: Of the early life of Mr Rejlander, we have but a brief record, derived from his incidental remarks in conversation. His grave in Kensal Green cemetery, north-west London, was only marked with a memorial stone four years ago.
The NPG exhibition will show his work for the first time with that of Carroll, Cameron and Clementina Hawarden, considered to have create art photography. The did this in part by roping in friends and family to serve as models. In the case of Cameron, passersby on the road outside her home on the Isle of Wight were called upon.
They frequently photographed the same subjects: as well as Liddell, Carroll and Cameron both photographed the actor Ellen Terry, who as a teenager briefly and disastrously married the much older artist GF Watts. Cameron and Rejlander both photographed the picturesquely bearded and cloaked poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.
Hawarden, the daughter of an English admiral and a Spanish beauty 26 years his junior, left no diary and few letters, but was experimenting with photography from at least 1857, including portraits of the eight survivors of her 10 children. She died in 1865 aged 42, her health said to have been damaged by her exposure to photographic chemicals. Rejlander wrote her obituary, describing her as a loss to photography for she would have progressed.
The exhibition will include loans from the Royal Collection, the V&A and Tate, as well the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and other museums in Sweden and Germany.
Prodger described the work of the four photographers as raw, edgy and experimental, the work of the Victorian avant garde, not just in photography but in art writ large.
He added: The works of Cameron, Carroll, Hawarden and Rejlander forever changed thinking about photography and its expressive power. These are pictures that inspire and delight. And this is a show that lays bare the unrivalled creative energy, and optimism, that came with the birth of new ways of seeing.

The MOU, signed recently between the Cathay Pacific Group and Airbus in Toulouse, France, is valued at approximately HK$ 31.7 billion at current list prices. It is intended to see Cathay Dragons single-aisle fleet replaced and expanded from 2020.
The new aircraft, which are scheduled to be delivered between 2020 and 2023, are intended to replace Cathay Dragons existing single-aisle fleet of 23 aircraft, comprising 15 Airbus A320s and eight Airbus A321s. The airline, which also operates 24 wide-body Airbus A330s, serves 56 destinations in Asia, including 28 cities in mainland China.
Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer and Cathay Dragon Chairman Rupert Hogg said: Cathay Dragon is committed to providing customers with a superior travel experience while at the same time enhancing the efficiency of its operations. We look forward to introducing the aircraft into our fleet and expanding the reach of the Cathay Pacific Group to more customers.
The intention to purchase these 32 environmentally-friendly aircraft will allow us to add new destinations to Cathay Dragons network. We also intend to increase frequencies on some of our most popular routes in order to provide our customers with more travel choices and convenience.
John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers, said: The A321neo offers the lowest possible operating costs, longest range capability and most spacious cabin in its class. It will be the perfect aircraft for Cathay Dragon as it builds on its success as one of Asias leading regional carriers.

Charge of the uniformed custodians
The Police Service has been from ancient times a much-respected service in our country. But over the recent past, it appears to have sadly lost its standing in our society. We need to address this problem in our own interest. The Police Service must be upgraded and made a special service like the old Civil Service. The best suitable for the profession must be attracted to join at all levels. We have today the highest level of literacy in the developing world so the catchment area is available so let us restructure the Department, increase salaries and perks and attract the best possible to the Service. If we are to ensure the security of the country we must do the needful.
There has been an unprecedented rise in brutal crime in recent days in our country which necessitates the need to address the problem on an urgent basis. We have had many Police Commissions at various times but there is today a need for the government to re-appoint a multi-disciplinary team to study the problem afresh. It appears to us that there has been a breakdown in relations between the community and the Police. This is an absolutely vital area that we should examine.
We can draw from the experience of many countries which have adopted Community Policing practices. I believe that a unit of the Defence Ministry which was headed by Dr Sanjay Colonne did an in-depth study of this issue but with the change of government in January of this year that unit was disbanded. Our Police Department, however, did continue its training programs with the assistance of the Scottish Police and has been developing Community Policing, for example, the Police organised the following programmes:
To my mind whilst this is a good beginning it is wholly inadequate. In Japan, for instance, they assigned two or three policemen to a particular area so that they become familiar with the residents and the residents with them, as a way of reducing crime.
Community Policing, or community-oriented policing, is a strategy of policing that focuses on police building ties and working closely with members of the communities.
In published texts Community Policing is described as a philosophy that promotes organisational strategies, which support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime.
Community-oriented policing
There is no universally accepted definition of Community Policing. However, it can commonly be described as a policy that requires Police to inherit a proactive approach to address public safety concerns. This type of policing has been utilised in various cities for about the last 150 years. The first form of community-oriented policing is credited to the London Metro Police Department around 1830, as regular patrol areas were assigned to officers, now commonly known as beats.
Community-oriented policing was the cornerstone of the Clinton Administration and gained its funding from the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Ahlin, Gibbs). According to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) of more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies that had been using community policing for at least one year, 62 percent stated they had less crimes committed against civilians, 80 percent stated that they had reduced the fear of crime, and 99 percent stated that they had received increased cooperation from civilians. The overall assessment of community oriented policing is positive, as officers and community members both attest to its effectiveness in reducing crime and raising the sense of security in a community.
Community policing is a philosophy of full service personalized policing, where the same officer patrols and works in the same area on a permanent basis, from a decentralized place, working in a proactive partnership with citizens to identify and solve problems. According to Bertus Ferreira an authority on the subject.
Community policing is a professional management organisation that is structure for the support in the community to create proactive problem solving to address the immediate conditions that give rise to the public safety issues such as crime, social disorder and fear of crime. Community policing has partnerships between law enforcement agency and other organisations like government agencies, community members, non-profit service providers, private businesses and the media.
Government agencies includes probation and parole, public works departments, neighbouring law enforcement agencies, health and human services, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members can include partnerships with neighbourhood association that has meetings, town hall meetings and storefronts decentralized in the community. Non-profit organisations include advocacy of groups like service clubs, support groups, issue groups and community development corporations.
These groups work with individuals that have the same interest in the community. Private businesses have a bigger impact on the community from the health perspective. Private businesses often identify problems that provide the resources which can include security technology for the community. The media represents a powerful organ to communicate with the community.
Public safety
The community policing uses the media to assist with publicizing concerns and solutions that will impact the community. The media can have an impact on the fear of crime, crime problems and perceptions of the police in the community. Community policing recognizes that police cant solve every public safety problem alone so interactive partnerships are involved. The policing uses the public for developing problem solving solutions.
The contemporary community policing movement emphasizes changing the role of law enforcement from a static, reactive, incident-driven bureaucracy to a more dynamic, open, quality-oriented partnership with the community. Community policing philosophy emphasizes that police officers work closely with local citizens and community agencies in designing and implementing a variety of crime prevention strategies and problem-solving measures.
To accomplish these initiatives, it is crucial that officers feel closely integrated with the majority of citizens and agencies in the community they serve. Typically, this means that officers perceive themselves as sharing important community values, beliefs, and goals. It also implies that officers are confident of community support and involvement in their decisions and action.
Many common elements in community-oriented policing include:
* Relying on community-based crime prevention by utilizing civilian education, neighbourhood watch, and a variety of other techniques, as opposed to relying solely on police patrols.
* Re-structuralizing of patrol from an emergency response based system to emphasizing proactive techniques such as foot patrol.
* Increased officer accountability to civilians they are supposed to serve.
* Decentralising the police authority, allowing more discretion amongst lower-ranking officers, and more initiative expected from them.
I do hope that the government would appoint a special Commission to look into the state of the Police Service today. In the meantime I presume that a Police Commission would be established under the 20th Amendment in the very near future and persons such as the Dr. Sanjay Colonne who was so completely involved with this subject when he was serving with the Defence Ministry and retired respected IGPs and retired DIGs would be appointed to this Commission and would work to restore the image of the Service.

Muslim schoolteachers left in chaos
The postponement of Muslim school holiday has made a huge chaos among Muslim schoolteachers. The second term holiday for Muslim schools was supposed to start from August 18 and ends on August 28. But the Education Ministry has put off the date to August 31 and reopening on September 11.
There is a separate school calendar for Muslim schools sent by Education Ministry at the beginning of every year. In the schedules, they have instructed to close the school on August 18. But the Ministrys sudden and unexpected postponement of the holiday has frustrated the entire holiday programme of teachers.
Moreover, there are teachers with pre-arranged foreign trips and medical check-up. They are now facing a lot of inconvenience due to the sudden postponement of holidays. I would like to raise this question from the ministry officials  Muslims in particular - involved in preparing and scheduling the Muslim school calendar as to why not pre-consider this situation on preparing the annual plan.
It is apparently clear that the Hajj Festival falls on September 1 and you could have arranged the holidays accordingly without making this blunder. It has left the Muslim schoolteachers in a pathetic and embarrassing situation.
I kindly request you to be vigilant and careful when you prepare a new annual plan for schools next year.

Conundrum that is Wijeyadasa
The factors spelled out by former Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe that led to his ouster from the Cabinet, is curious, if not contradictory. One of the reasons adduced by Rajapakshe for his dismissal was the Bond scam. He told journalist that since he had given a free hand to the AG's Department, those involved in the scam was in fear of being exposed. He also said that the Bond scam was the biggest ever swindle in the country since the time of King Pandukabhaya, though he does not elaborate on this, leaving the public in the dark if there were Central Banks and governors, three millenea ago.
This is the first time that Rajapakshe had come out on the Bond scam, when he had not been averse to making many controversial statements against the government prior to this. Perhaps, this is an afterthought on the part of Rajapakshe who is presently coming out with fantastic revelations which he had chosen to keep under the wraps all this time, after his ouster from Cabinet. Never once had he provided an inkling or drop a hint on the alleged Bond scam or the involvement of government personages, when he had been making sweeping statements about the government's attitude towards the Sangha and inaction on the part of the government to the alleged destruction of places of Buddhist heritage and archeological sites in the North and East. Now, out of the blue, the former minister has thought it fit to compromise his colleagues in the UNP after being shown the door.
Rajapakshe, while denying any wrongdoing on his part, says the Hambantota Port deal was agreed to by the Cabinet of ministers in violation of the constitution and that the agreement was null and void in law. This is curious indeed. All this time we understood Rajapakshe to be a member of the Cabinet in the Unity Government and an influential one at that, prior to his dismissal. Is he now saying that he too raised his hands along with his Cabinet colleagues, granting the stamp of approval for the Hambantota deal to go ahead Did he, or, did he not, know at the time, that the agreement was in violation of the constitution Did it take his dismissal from the Cabinet for it to dawn on him that this indeed was the case Rajapakshe is already on record stating that there was no more collective Cabinet responsibility, with all the ministers shooting off with their mouths, giving the impression that they (ministers) were free to speak their minds independently. This was all the more reason for him to come clean on this matter and declare that the agreement was, indeed, in violation of the constitution, especially as Justice Minister, instead of doing so now, after losing his portfolio. Didn't this demonstrate that Rajapakshe too was just a garden politician, as the rest of them, although given to pious pronouncements and taking moral high ground on issues.
But the piece de resistance is Rajapakshe claiming that he was a shame to remain in a Cabinet that was "selling national assets". "According to my conscience, there is nothing more shameful than staying in a Cabinet, when the assets are being sold". Well, the Hambantota Port agreement was signed on July 29, nearly one month ago, and to our knowledge nobody in government prevented Rajapakshe from tendering his resignation, on that very day itself, protesting against the 'sale of national assets'. He was also nowhere among the protesters at the inaugural ceremony of the Sri Lanka- China Logistics and Industrial Zone, in Hambantota where it was alleged that some 15,000 acres of land encompassing Hambantota and Moneragala were to be handed over to the Chinese, in January this year.
One would have expected Rajapakshe to have been in the forefront of the protesters agitating against the give-away of an extent of real estate of the country, which, some said was equal to the landmass of Singapore. In hindsight, given the sentiments currently being expressed by Rajapakshe on the sale of national assets" a resignation should have been on the cards. Far from it, he (Rajapaskhe) continued to stay put and in fact was in a defiant mood vowing not to step down when the UNP back benchers were baying for his blood over the breach of collective Cabinet responsibility and the foot dragging on the cases against members of the former regime. On the contrary, Rajapakshe said he would not quit, come hell or high water, and it is only the President who can decide on his fate. This, by an individual who claimed he was ashamed to remain in a Cabinet that sells national assets". Surely he did not need any encouragement to step down. He had all the reasons to take that decision himself.
The former minister says he will reveal his future political journey in due course. He was non committal when asked by journalists if he would be joining the Joint Opposition. Silence, they say, speaks a lot.

Dhoni, Kumar upstage Dananjaya to fashion out win for India
For one moment it looked as if Akila Dananjaya would bowl Sri Lanka to sensational win when he captured 6 wickets for 39 runs in a spell of eight overs, but India had their former captain and the ever reliable Mahendra Singh Dhoni to perform one of his many rescue acts which he is renowned for.
The stage was ideally set for him and he did it with the panache taking on the responsibility to carry India from a precarious 131-7 to a famous three-wicket victory on the Duckworth/Lewis target with 16 balls to spare. It is a win that should go down in the annals of ODI cricket.
Chasing a revised target of 231 in 47 overs after Sri Lanka had scored 236-8, Dhoni who found an able partner in Bhuvneshwar Kumar guided India to victory with an unbroken eighth wicket partnership of 100 off 136 balls.
Kumar displayed his skills as a batsman by mixing caution with aggression to score his maiden ODI half-century remaining unbeaten on 53 when victory was achieved. He faced 80 balls and hit 4 fours and one six.
Dhoni playing a calm and assured role made 45 off 68 balls with a solitary four as he and Kumar frustrated Sri Lankas attempt to snatch a win.
Sri Lanka tried every trick in the book to dislodge the pair but they batted sensibly with plenty of overs at hand to take India to a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
Dananjaya whose previous best was 4/47 against Zimbabwe at Hambantota last month finished with figures of 6 for 54 of 10 overs to take the man of the match award.
India lost seven wickets for 22 runs in 37 balls following the century opening partnership between Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan that at one time looked running away with the match with Dananjaya doing all the damage from one end while the left-arm spin of Milinda Siriwardana kept them tied down at the other.
For Sri Lanka to get anywhere close to beating India they had to bowl them because they had no artillery to defend a total of 236. Although they tried hard with several balls from Malinga, Fernando and Mathews beating the bat they could not dislodge the opening pair Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan who laid the platform with a partnership of 109 off 93 balls.
The pair made run making so easy that they scored at the pace of 6 runs an over with hardly any effort that the 100 was up by the 15th over. The frequency with which they found the gaps on the field was a lesson for the Lankan batsmen.
Sharma reached his 32nd one-day fifty off 43 balls inclusive of three sixes and four fours before Dananjaya trapped him lbw on the sweep. The following over Mathews pulled off a stunning catch at short fine leg to send back Dhawan for 49 off Siriwardana.
From then onwards it was the Dananjaya show as he wrecked the Indian middle order with brilliant piece of bowling until Dhoni and Kumar took the game away from Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankas top order once again failed to put up the required runs on the board. Their four batters could muster only 78 runs in toto.
With half the side out for 121 it looked like Sri Lanka would struggle to get to 200 but a fine half-century from Milinda Siriwardana and his partnership of 91 off 99 balls with Chamara Kapugedera (40) playing in his 100th ODI ensured they batted out the full quota of overs to finish on 236-8 after being invited to bat first.
Siriwardana recalled to the team after being overlooked for the series against Zimbabwe revived the flagging Sri Lanka innings with his third half-century in 18 ODIs. His run a ball knock of 58 comprised two fours and a six.
Jasprit Bumrah ended Siriwardanas innings as well as that of Kapugederas with a spell of three for 14 off three overs that erased any hopes Sri Lanka had of setting India a target beyond 250.
Where Sri Lanka erred in their batting was that they failed to constantly rotate the strike  that is what differentiates good and ordinary sides. There were 41 dot balls in the first 10 overs and overall India were allowed to bowl three maidens.
With the exception of the sixth wicket stand India dominated the innings once again with the Lankan batsmen throwing away good starts.
Niroshan Dickwella was going great guns with 31 off 24 balls that was inclusive of two sixes when chipped a slow ball from Bumrah to Dhawan at mid wicket.
From there on the rot set in as Danushka Gunathilaka (19), Tharanga (9) and Kusal Mendis (19) all fell within a matter of 9.2 overs.
The sweep and reverse sweep that has featured quite often in the Test and one-day series had its plusses and minuses. Yesterday Mendis and Angelo Mathews (20) were both out lbw attempting to sweep straight balls.
Tharanga although he has found himself back in the one-day team is not the ideal number 4. Sri Lanka needs to bring Dinesh Chandimal back at that position. He is no doubt one of the finest batsmen Sri Lanka has within their limited ranks and it is a crime to see him sitting on the sidelines when the team is struggling for quality batsmen.
Tharanga has already been appointed the captain for the one-day and T20 teams and it will be a difficult task to move him anywhere in the order if Chandimal is to make a return. In the circumstances are we to keep playing Tharanga at 4 despite his continued failures.
India lost the services of Hardik Pandya who pulled out of the attack in the 28th over and retired with an injured left knee, but his absence was not felt by India who had enough ammunition in their armoury to keep Sri Lanka down to a moderate total.
India who is having a run of luck not only with the number of victories they have achieved against Sri Lanka on the current tour but also with the toss. They won it for the second consecutive occasion in the series and Kohli had no hesitation in inviting Sri Lanka to bat first.
India with no problems as Sri Lanka facing with their team named an unchanged side while Sri Lanka who lost badly by nine wickets at Dambulla made three changes recalling spinner Akila Dananjaya, left-arm all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana and fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera for Wanindu Hasaranga, Lakshan Sandakan and Thisara Perera.

Immigration and Emigration Controller General M.N. Ranasinghe has confirmed that Geetha Kumarasinghe is the only member of the present Parliament holding dual citizenship.
The Controller General has made this confirmation in response to an application made to him under the RTI act by the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections, said its Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi yesterday.
Hettiarachchi in a press release said the dual citizenship of members of Parliament was a hot topic of discussion and debate in the country in recent times.
As this occupied a special importance, the PAFFREL as a civil organisation and an election monitor, considered it as its responsibility to obtain correct information regarding this controversy.
As such, the PAFFREL submitted an application under the RTI Act to the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration requesting a list of Parliamentarians holding dual citizenship.
The Controller General responding to the request had stated that he obtained a list of names of all Parliamentarians with their dates of birth and NIC numbers from the Secretary General of Parliament and fed them into the computer date system consisting of names of dual citizens and for further accuracy checked with documents relating to dual citizens maintained before setting up the computer data.
All this showed that only Geetha Kumarasinghe had been issued with a dual citizenship certificate number 17096A. the Controller had also emphasized that no one else among the balance 224 members of Parliament had been issued with Dual Citizenship certificates.

Girl narrowly escapes from being molested
A teenage girl bathing in a stream near her house had managed to save herself from a sadist who tried to outrage her modesty by capping the man with the bucket she was using and running back home in her bathing cloth, a report from a village in Kuruwita said.
According to the report, the girl used to be accompanied by her mother when she went to the stream for a bath. But, on this day she had gone for a bath on her own since the mother was preoccupied with some other family chore.
Since there was a high tide in the stream due to the rainy weather she had used a bucket to bath standing on the embankment.
Suddenly a man had appeared on the scene, whom she chose to ignore thinking it was another bather. Suddenly the man had moved closer, held her by the hand and tried to molest her.
Through intuition she had placed the bucket on the mans head covering his face and escaped by making a bee line home in her wet clothes, leaving the bundle of washed clothes behind and reported the matter to her mother.
Although the family members had rushed to the stream to catch the culprit, he had escaped by then.

Indias SC rules privacy is a fundamental right
INDIA: Indias Supreme Court ruled Thursday that citizens have a constitutional right to privacy, a landmark verdict that could have wide-reaching implications for the governments flagship biometric programme.
Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian constitution, and the government has argued that Indias 1.25 billion citizens cannot expect an absolute right to privacy.
But in a brief statement on Thursday, Chief Justice J.S. Khehar said privacy was protected as an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty.
The Supreme Court set up a special bench to rule on the issue after petitioners challenged the governments Aadhaar biometric programme, which has recorded the fingerprints and iris scans of more than one billion Indians.
Aadhaar was set up as a voluntary scheme to streamline benefit payments to millions of poor people and cut fraud.
But in recent years it has become compulsory for a growing number of services, including opening a bank account or paying taxes.
Opponents say that its use for what are effectively essential services means their right to privacy is increasingly being violated.
Lawyer Prashant Bhushan said after the judgement it would likely impact the Aadhaar programme.
Any fundamental right is subject to reasonable restrictions by law. Whether the Aadhar Act imposes unreasonable restrictions will have to be examined, he told reporters outside the court.

India guru rape case: Violence kills three as Ram Rahim Singh convicted

Three people have been shot dead by troops in unrest over the rape conviction of a popular religious leader in north India.
The victims are believed to be Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's followers. Angry supporters are rampaging through Panchkula town.
Reports of mass scale vandalism are coming in. At least two railway stations have been set on fire.
Followers also smashed cars and set media vans alight.
More than 200,000 of Singh's followers had flocked to the city ahead of the verdict.
Thousands of army, police and paramilitary forces have been deployed. They are firing tear-gas canisters and water cannon into the crowd to try to restore control, our correspondent says.
Curfews have been imposed in several areas of the city and across the state of Punjab.
Singh was taken into protective custody by the army following the conviction.
The court is expected to sentence him on Monday.
Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh criticised his counterpart in the state of Haryana for allowing so many of Singh's followers to travel to Chandigarh.
Chandigarh is the capital of both states.
The border between the two states has been sealed, and the capital, Delhi, is on high alert.
Singh had arrived at court in Panchkula, a suburb of Chandigarh, from his ashram in Haryana in a convoy of more than 100 vehicles.
Schools and offices in the area were closed, trains were stopped, roads were blocked and three stadiums were set aside as makeshift prisons in case of trouble, officials said.

Guruge said in a bid to broaden their tax base using RAMIS they would interface 35 institutions in the country and a unique number will be provided to every person and entity in the future which would be linked to the Inland Revenue Department. Hence all transactions will link to their data base and if the department finds that anyone is not paying tax a file will be opened against that person or entity.

Japan conducts live fire drills at Mt Fuji
JAPAN: Japans military began three days of live-fire drills near Mount Fuji Thursday, an annual exercise that comes as regional tensions have flared following a war of words between the US and North Korea.
Around 2,400 soldiers, as well as tanks, field guns and helicopters were deployed at training grounds in the foothills of the iconic mountain, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) west of Tokyo.
Airborne troops parachuted from planes, anti-aircraft cannon were fired and F2 fighter jets whizzed overhead in a display of force by one of the worlds best-equipped militaries.
The drills are meant to prepare Japans Self-Defence Forces to repel an attack on its remote islands.
But North Koreas recent threat to fire missiles at the US Pacific territory of Guam and territorial disputes with China and Russia are also concerning Tokyo.
There are various issues and uncertain factors such as Chinas forceful attempt to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea areas, North Koreas promotion of ballistic missile development and nuclear weapons and Russias display of its presence in the Far East, GSDF Chief of Staff General Koji Yamazaki said in a statement.
The severity of the security situation surrounding our country... is increasing, he added.
Japan has deployed its Patriot missile defence system after North Korea threatened to fire ballistic missiles over the country towards Guam.
Japan has in the past vowed to shoot down North Korean missiles or rockets that threaten to hit its territory.
Separately, Japanese and US military personnel are currently conducting live-fire artillery training in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.

Largest samosa in the world
The world record for the largest samosa was smashed in London on Tuesday by a whopping version of the popular Asian snack weighing in at 153.1 kilograms.
A dozen volunteers from the Muslim Aid UK charity built the giant samosa then deep-fried it in a custom-built vat at an East London Mosque.
Adjudicators from Guinness World Records were on hand to oversee the process and certify that the mega-samosa passed the required tests.
The previous record of 110.8 kg was set by Bradford College in northern England in June 2012.
The samosa was built on a giant wire mesh, and then winched into a vat of cooking oil before being hauled out to be weighed.
My heart was beating really fast, said Farid Islam, 26, the project organiser.
It was very tense. It looked like it was going to slide off. A crack appeared and I feared the worst, he said.
Guinness World Records adjudicator Pravin Patel spelled out the rules.
Its got to be triangular; contain flour, potatoes, onions and peas; be fried, and retain the shape when cooked, he said adding, Its got to look and feel like a samosa; its got to be edible by humans.
The critical record is the net weight. Plus it all has to be eaten. No wastage!
After the team carefully made the triangle-shaped super-snack, it was hauled up to the industrial winch by the biggest men available and slowly plunged into the vat.
Once it was winched out, and after the nervy weigh-in, the independent food safety officer, who had overseen proceedings, gave it the taste test. A simple thumbs-up triggered cheers around the hall.
It was then down to Patel to tie up all the certification and deliver the verdict: 153.1 kg.
Its an absolutely great achievement, he declared.
Organiser Islam said it was a tough challenge.
Initially I thought it would be a piece of cake: stuff it together, tie up the end and fry it, he said.
When I realised there was not a single pot in the country that could hold that weight, we had to get something tailor made.
The samosa took around 15 hours of work and was dished up into hundreds of portions distributed to the local homeless via the Salvation Army.

If you are on a budget or are looking for the most traditional or creative seasonal theme for your company or yourself, you dont need to worry as all your seasonal decorations will be customised as per your requirement and brief.
, No hassle, would be the perfect way of describing what it is to work with Charith and his team at MAIC. We have worked with them for two consecutive years and are going on our third, as they are so very flexible and are able to adapt to any brief or budget. What I like is that they take their job very seriously and seem to evolve year on year in both creativity and professionalism, Damsara Galappatthy, Assistant Manager  Marketing Services from Overseas Realty Ceylon said in a press release.
One of the first things that strike you about the chic decorations created by MAIC is the familiarity of the concepts they create with a mix of both traditional and new age designs. Having worked with both corporate clients and individuals, MAIC is able to churn out something that is uniquely yours whatever the festivity maybe.
Marlon Abeyakoon, Director Operations, Hilton Residences states; First year back after many years overseas, and I was given the task of sourcing a supplier for our seasonal decorations, it was definitely a challenge as in Sri Lanka most things are done by word of mouth, thankfully I got lucky as someone recommended MAIC for the work they had done for the World Trade Centre. Charith from MAIC listened to my brief absorbed everything and came back to me with the most sensational concept for the season. We worked together to fine-tune and finalise the idea according to my budget and they set up the decorations throughout the whole hotel like elves in the most professional and timely manner. I cant say I have anything but high praise for their professionalism and dedication to the job.

Life beyond circumstances
After years of bad policy, new hope for care-After years of bad policy, new hope for care-leavers leavers:
Moses Akash entered the states care when he was two weeks old.
But, just after his 18th birthday, he was homeless, legally required to leave the Fridsro orphanage in Kandy where he had lived his whole life.
Thats the law, he said in a recent interview. When you turn 18, even if you are there, you are not allowed to stay in the place you grew up.
So Akash said he left Kandy for Colombo, with everything he owned in a single bag. He brought that bag with him to job interviews, hoping he would be hired and allowed to stay at his new employers facilities.
Making things worse, he said he was turned away from jobs and turned away from opening a bank account, because his birth certificate was not complete. The section where a fathers name should have been was left blank and Akash said this both confused people and carried with it the weight of social stigma.
But, he eventually started living at a church and got a job at a polythene factory in Kaduwela, washing equipment. The churchs pastor, Damien Dishan de Silva, took Akash into his home and gave him his last name. Now 32-years-old, Moses Akash de Silva runs his own foundation, Voice for the Voiceless, and is trying to change the laws that created such barriers in his own life.
That moment, age 18, 19, was a crucial part of my life, he said.Luckily, for me and I would say it was Gods plan, I had very good people who would help me.
But, a lot of people who come out of these orphanages need advocacy, he added.
There are more than 14,000 children in care homes in Sri Lanka, according to data from the Department of Probation and Child Care Services.
That means hundreds of young men and women, like Akash, are leaving them every year.
The exact numbers of how many people leave state care homes are unknown.
Akash is part of a coalition of organizations pushing key government ministries to relax the laws mandating that youth leave state homes at 18. Theyre also pushing for the government to dedicate state money for a resource center for such care-leavers, and make significant changes to the countrys birth certificates.
There are a lot of easy things that can be done, he said. But, whether the government authority is willing to do that  its a challenge.
Blocked by the law
One of the groups at the helm of this movement is SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka. The international organization operates in 135 countries around the world and its childrens village just outside Colombo houses 153 children and 52 youth in its unique, family-style setting.
House mothers live in family homes with up to eight children and cook for them, help them with school, and take them out on errands. They essentially fill the parental role many of these children lost at a young age.
The organization has operated in Sri Lanka since 1981 and in that time has mainly focused on direct care, rather than advocacy.
However, their own struggles trying to continue caring for their kids after they turned 18 led them to the public sphere, Divakar Ratnadurai, the Deputy Director of SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka, said.
He recounted a story of fighting a court order so his organization could help a 21-year-old girl have housing while she went to university.
We do it, with difficulty, because the rules are blocking us,Ratnadurai said. But, we want the rules to be flexible and the government to also support us, because this is also a responsibility of the state.
Earlier, we were not very much into this type of work, said Kirthi Hettiarachchi, who is the Senior Project Director for SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka.
We were doing a very neutral, you know, very silent job. Now we thought that we have to do something about this problem.
SOS organized a speak-out event in July, where care-leavers, including Moses Akash, shared their stories with government officials like Women and Childrens Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara and Dr. Thusita Wijemanna, MP, who heads the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender of the Sri Lankan Parliament.
After the event, the government leaders promised to start addressing these issues, beginning with changing the format of the countrys birth certificates.
Ratnadurai, of SOS Childrens Villages, said that without the speak-out, where people in power heard care-leavers stories first hand, he believes these changes would not be happening.
Potential for Reform
On Tuesday, the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Women and Gender met, along with representatives of the Registrar Generals Department, to begin discussing the advocacy goals of the
care-leavers movement.
It was fantastic, it was excellent, said Chaturi Jayasooriya, who attended the meeting on behalf of SOS Childrens Villages. According to a transcript of the meeting, committee members agreed to look into setting up a system to provide extracts of birth certificates, which would only contain basic information about the individual. Full birth certificates would exist in a separate database.
Dr. Wijemanna said she was very much in favour of such an extract, because it would preserve the childs right to privacy and dignity.
Members moved for the Oversight Committee to meet on September 19 to draft a proposal to the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General to implement these legal reforms. Committee members also discussed the need to better track the numbers of children in and leaving care every year.
They said that even though such a database exists, not all of the over 400 care facilities on the island have adequate computer capability to keep it up-to-date.
They decided to invite the nine provincial commissioners to a meeting in October to discuss what could be done on the ground to improve the situation.
Finally, they agreed to look into vacant government buildings to house a resource center for care leavers, which could serve as a networking and job center for youth leaving care.
This is just a first step, Dr. Wijemanna said.
Moses Akash said he is hopeful that change may be coming.
He repeated something he said he often tells young men and women leaving state care.
Life is beyond what we see, he said. Life is beyond your circumstances.

'Life insurance  in SRI lANKA still an  obligation, not a must'
Emphasizing the importance of insurance for women, we in LIC Lanka have a stand-alone plan called Divyangana, especially for women, Sen said. In addition, we were also the first to introduce a comprehensive life cover for soldiers during the war and have settled Rs. 26 million worth of claims to the widows and families of deceased soldiers. We also offer a double accident claim for tsunami victims. Further, we have products targeting the youth, ageing population and Sri Lankan expatriates.
Due to these efforts, LIC Lanka has achieved a higher growth than the industry standard last year, as far as Gross Return Premium (GWP) is concerned. As at the end of June 2017, this is 39% and we hope to achieve a target of 50% by the year end, he said.
Q: How difficult was it to get into Sri Lanka
A: Sri Lanka, along with Kenya and the Gulf were among the parent companys first overseas branches. The regulatory environment was good and it was not difficult to enter Sri Lanka.
Q: How is the company formulated in Sri Lanka
A: LIC Lanka Ltd (LIC Lanka) is a joint venture of LIC of India (LIC) and the Bartleet Group of Sri Lanka, a well-diversified conglomerate with interests in tea, money broking, finance and leasing and stock broking.
LIC of India which was set up in 1956 is Indias and the worlds leading life insurance provider and is fully owned by the Government of India. The company has grown from a mere Rs 5 crore capital in 1956 to its present stature boasting of an asset base of US$ 48,350 billion, higher than the GDP of over 75% of the countries in the world (only four countries have a population higher than LICs customers). LIC commands a market share of 72% in India and has been awarded the Most Trusted Service Brand and Most Recognizable Brand for the 7th year in succession.
Although LIC (Lanka) started operation in 2002, in fact it has been operating in the Sri Lankan market since 1956. In 1962, when the Ceylon Government nationalized the Insurance sector, LIC of India had to quit, but continued to establish expertise and talent for the local insurance sector.
Management Development Centre of LIC of India in Mumbai was instrumental in training many Sri Lankan insurance officials who later went on to become the stalwarts of the insurance industry. LIC of India re-entered Sri Lanka as LIC (Lanka) Ltd and is today an established name in the life insurance market of Sri Lanka. LIC (Lanka) Ltd has over 1,900 experienced insurance advisors and 30 locations in the island.
Q : Was LIC Lanka well received by local clients
A: We found out that we needed to change some of our popular products to match the local market and we therefore, re-invented our products which have seen a steady growth.
Q: What are the investments made locally
A: We have invested over Rs. 2.6 billion so far with over Rs. 850 million made last year. There are mainly in Government bonds, (62%) corporate debentures (20%), bank deposits (6.5%) and in other sectors.
Q: What are the future expansion plans of LIC Sri Lanka
A: We are in a mammoth expansion drive. We will invest Rs. 150 million to build our first regional office in Jaffna for which the groundbreaking would be held on September 8. We also see a 10% year-on-year growth in the North East and hope to have more focus in this area. Training plays a key role in staff retention and LIC Lanka regularly sends our senior advisors overseas for training to gain knowledge on how to perform effectively in this evolving market.
In addition, the proposed regional office will also have a training center.
We are also looking to acquire a new office complex in Colombo for our own head office. Our plans for the future also include special corporate business units in selected cities.
Q: What were the recent initiatives by LIC Lanka
A: We launched a new communication campaign Lifeline for life which easily identifies what we stand for as a dedicated life insurance company, which is Life insurance for all Sri Lankans for life which also includes a host of tailormade solutions for corporate customers and their employees as well. Some of these in the product basket of LIC Lanka are Jeevan Ananda, Divyangana, Ashirwada, Aradhana, Niranthara, Prarthana, Swarna, Janatha, Surakshana and a range of other products to suit individual needs that can be obtained through our 30 branches. Soon, we will be introducing other innovative and novel insurance products such as the LIC Group Gratuity and products aimed at expanding the life insurance industry.

A loving home for every child!
Families are where we connect ourselves in relationships to past, present and future generations. Family is where we experience our biggest triumphs and deepest vulnerabilities. It is the fundamental building block of the society and is the foundation for civilization. One learns loyalty, cooperation and trust. Within this smallest unit of the society, people learn to love themselves and each other, to bear one anothers burdens to find meaning in their own life while giving a purpose to the lives of others and to feel the value of being part of something greater than them.
There is a universal desire of oneness among human beings which gives them the need to belong. That is why humans collaborate, support common causes, cheer for sports teams, feel patriotic and build villages, towns and cities. For the fortunate the desire to belong begins with loving parents and siblings in a home which is a privilege. Those who had less than this ideal situation of growing up, still have the capacity to forge families of their own making. SOS Childrens Villages in Sri Lanka provides alternative care for the children who have lost their parental care around the nation thus making them a part of a family.
Deputy National Director/Director Programmes, SOS childrens village Sri Lanka, Divakar Ratnadurai said in Sri Lanka an estimate of 340,000 children have lost parental care due to different reasons.
Some have lost parental care due to unavoidable circumstances such as death, illness, accidents or a natural disaster while others lose family due to poverty and social issues. These children grow up without basic human needs such as food, water, clothing and shelter. They also lack sanitation, healthcare and education. Some children face physical, sexual, verbal or emotional abuse, he said.
We provide the victimized children love, care and education while emotionally stabilizing them. SOS model is based on the belief that every child needs a mother, a safe home, siblings and a stable community. SOS families live together forming a supportive village environment where children enjoy a happy childhood. Every child here receives education and skills training so that they may be successful and contributing members of the society. The village has a kindergarten and a school not only for SOS children but for the residents in the area as well. The curriculum in the school is managed by the government and is in line with local education guidelines, Ratnadurai added.
Four main aspects
SOS Childrens village stands for  a loving home for every child and is a concept of Hermann Gmeiner who set up the first SOS Childrens Village in Austria in 1949. At Present SOS childrens villages is a private, non-governmental child welfare organization that is active in 135 countries. It mainly focuses on providing a family environment for orphaned, abandoned and neglected children and developing comprehensive community based social programmes for disadvantaged families. Gmeiners concept was based on four main aspects: every child needs the care of a parent who establishes a close relationship with each child. The children grow up in a family with girls and boys of different ages as their siblings wherebiological siblings are not separated if possible. The family is a part of a community that functions as a support system.
SOS villages also has youth facilities that enable the children to make the transition to independent living and become responsible adults. At the age of 14 boys are moved into youth facilities while for girls the age of transfer is 18. At the youth facilities they develop realistic perspectives for their future, learn to take increased responsibilities and make their own decisions. However the bond with the SOS mother and siblings is unbreakable and the children are always welcome into their homes,Ratnadurai said.
Sacrifice
In each childrens village, they are cared for by women who have dedicated their lives to being SOS mothers. SOS mothers raise a generation of children as their own and are capable of meeting childrens physical and emotional needs from infancy right up to adulthood. There are SOS aunts who assist the mother when the need arises. The villages are equipped with retirement houses for these mothers who render a valuable service sacrificing and dedicating their lives to raise these children although not biologically theirs, Ratnadurai said.
We are extending our work with families through Family Strengthening Programmes where we assist disadvantaged families to prevent crisis leading to the worst scenario of the children being placed out of home care. We help the mothers to be self-employed so that they can live independently caring for their children, he added.
History
SOS was registered as a charity organization in 1980 and for the past 36 years has supported over 41,000 children in the country. The first SOS Childrens village in Sri Lanka was established with sixteen family houses in Kesbewa close to Piliyandala town. The SOS kindergarten, medical center and the Hermann Gmeiner School cater the needs of many adults and children of low income families in the area. The village supports around 583 children and young adults through Family Strengthening Programmes at present.
The second SOS center was opened in 1985 in Nuwara Eliya and is an example of unity and co-existence among children of Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The third SOS Childrens Village in Mampitiya, Galle consists of twelve family houses, SOS kindergarten, Hermann Gmeiner social centre, youth facility for boys and girls and a home for retired mothers. Around 316 children and adults receive assistance under FSP. Fourth and Fifth SOS villages are situated respectively in Anuradhapura and Monaragala housing hundreds of children while supporting many more low income families scattered around the area. The SOS Childrens Village in Jaffna is home to 95 children including the SOS youth facility. Additional 308 children are supported under the FSP programme.
However SOS childrens villages now need to raise awareness among the public in Sri Lanka regarding the need for funds to protect and care for children under the organization.
During the past 36 years, SOS was mainly funded by international individual donors and other philanthropists mostly living in Europe. With the end of the war Sri Lanka is now considered as a middle income country in Asia and SOS childrens villages international has started to channel more international subsidies to poorer countries in Asia and in other continents. From year 2016 onwards part of our subsidy was syphoned. By the year 2023, SOS childrens villages in Sri Lanka has to be self-sufficient through local sponsorship and donations in order to continue helping children who have lost parental care and who are now loved and cared under SOS banner.
We hope that individuals and corporates will assist our children and that this journey continues benefiting many more children in the country, Ratnadurai said. To sponsor a child or for further information email [emailprotected] or log into www.soschildrensvillage.lk

Luvabella after Annabelle
Its that most irritating time of year (which comes earlier each year) when Christmas present ideas seep into the national consciousness.
One such idea aimed at hitting parents in the pocket is the touted must have kids toy our little ones will be clamouring for come the autumn.
Shes an artificial intelligence doll called Luvabella and she hits the shelves in October - just in time for all those festive wish lists.
Luvabella responds to affection, falls asleep, giggles and talks and sounds like a dream, but may have in fact crossed that fine line between cute and creepy.
With her wide-eyed, knowing stare, there is perhaps something a little unnerving about Luvabella.
Responding to a post about it on Facebook, several parents aired their doubts about her.
One woman wrote: This doll looks like Annabelles little sister! Who in their right mind is going to give this creepy looking doll to their child. I know three kids who will start crying and hit their parents with this thing.
Annabelles little sister is a strong statement, and the critic wasnt alone in her opinion.
Its a must if you want to scare your kids from playing with dolls... agreed another woman.
Citing another famous doll, one Facebook user added, Hello, child of Chucky.
I thought this was a joke, was another lamentation, with people also asking if she had an off switch.
However, a smattering of people seemed to like poor Luvabella.

Man hangs himself after dispute with wife
A man had committed suicide by hanging himself from a beam of the roof of a building at a shopping complex building site where he had been living alone for a period of about four months. He had left his home for the site after a dispute with his wife.
Ratnayaka Mudiyanselage Weerasingha, a 44-year-old father of three residing in Dodamwatte, Mahiyanganaya had previously attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself on five occasions and even attempted to consume poison mixed with alcohol, but failed as onlookers had rescued him.The coroner has recorded a verdict of death caused by suffocation.
During the inquest, Akveediye Gedara Mallika, the wife of the deceased had told the coroner that her husband had been an alcoholic.
My husband earned a living by carrying out odd jobs daily. He used to drink thrice a day. Virtually all of his earning were ruined by his alcoholism. He left home about 4 months ago after a quarrel with me. I was told that my husband was under the influence of liquor at the time he hung himself, she said at the inquest.
Weerasingha used to cut himself with a razor blade or a piece of glass used to look at the bleeding while intoxicated, according to further evidence collected at the inquiry held by the coroner.

Mel B walks off 'America's Got Talent'

When it comes to being a comedian, Melanie "Mel B" Brown thinks Simon Cowell is all wet.
The former Spice Girl threw her drink at her fellow "America's Got Talent" judge Tuesday after he made a joke about her wedding night.
The incident occurred during the live show Tuesday night as magician Demian Aditya attempted an escape trick involving a wooden box, fire and steel stakes.
The trick didn't come off, leaving host Tyra Banks to explain that there had been a technical issue that was not Aditya's fault.
"I kind of imagine this would be like Mel B's wedding night," Cowell joked. "A lot of anticipation, not much promise or delivery."
Brown didn't take kindly to the crack and tossed the contents of her cup at Cowell even before he got the punchline out.
She then walked off the set.
"Mel B is out," Banks told the audience. "This is live TV, y'all."
The show's official Twitter account tweeted that Brown had left the building.
It's not the first time Brown has doused Cowell.
"He should know, if you say something inappropriate he's gonna get like stuff thrown at him,"she told "Entertainment Tonight"afterward. "In a friendly way. I made sure there was no ice in it this time."
Brown returned during the commercial break.
Brown is currently going through a contentious divorce with her husband of 10 years, Stephen Belafonte.

Moroccos Moment of Change
Remembering some of the most cherished moments of world history when wedding bells tolled and two people united in love in magical surroundings
Never before had Morocco's royal family permitted any intimate scrutiny of its personal affairs; rigid control of the media and an unforgiving security service had ensured its total privacy inside Morocco. Few people recalled seeing a picture of the king's wife, nor was the public widely aware of her name (or that of his other wife).
King Mohamed VI, changed all this. The day he married Salma Bennani changed the history of royal marriages in Morocco, hopefully forever. Traditionally, the wife of the king hasn't had a public role to play. Moroccan kings have typically been polygamists prone to secret marriages to wives who remain private figures. King Mohamed VI's own mother is not photographed, and there was no "queen consort" title in Morocco.
Change came when Mohammad, who acceded the throne on the death of his father in 1999, announced his engagement. Not only did he announce that he was marrying, he identified his bride and released a picture of Salma Bennani  a 24-year-old computer expert and qualified engineer from a middle-class family in the ancient city of Fez.
The announcement, as well as his choice of a bride, came as a surprise. Salmas father was a teacher, and her mother passed away when she was just three years old. During her formative years, the princess proved her keen mind by learning four languages  Arabic, French, English, and Spanish. She also became valedictorian at the top engineering school in Morocco, earning a degree in mathematical sciences and a state engineering diploma in computer engineering. But her lack of royal upbringing was no stumbling block for the brilliant future princess.
According to royal sources, it was love at first sight when Mohammed and Salma first met in 1999, when she was still at university. Early on she reportedly set some ground rules for their courtship, insisting on a monogamous union as a condition for accepting King Mohammeds proposal.
The couple married in a religious ceremony in March 2002 and excited many royal watchers by releasing photos of the beautiful ceremony. Upon marriage, Salma was granted the title of 'Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Salma' becoming the first wife of a Moroccan King to be given a royal title. ('Lalla' is a traditional name given in honour to women in high society and royalty).
The wedding took place in the form of a private Muslim ceremony on the evening of March 21st, 2002, at the Royal Palace in Rabat. The bride dressed traditionally, including donning a thick veil for a portion of the event. She let her signature red locks cascade down around her and topped them with a diamond meander tiara.
Since her marriage, Salma has landed on many Best Dressed lists, with a signature look comprised of beautifully appointed caftan gowns and unruly locks of flaming-red hair. She has also been named the Most Beautiful First Lady in Africa and ranked third on the Richest Lifestyle website. Although she does not seek the spotlight often, when she does, her style is ruled by tasteful proportions and rich embellishment.
Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco having arrived from humble origins to become the wife of King Mohammed VIand Moroccos First Royal Highness is the living embodiment of fairy tales and other fanciful myths, millions of young women have grown up with, wishing they could one day become a princess. - Aditha

Stroke prevalence in Sri Lanka is around 10 per 1,000 population. Stroke is a leading cause of disability among adults and the third leading cause of hospital deaths in Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had said.
Minister Senaratne had stated that the National Stroke Centre would be set up at Mulleriyawa Hospital, while similar centres would be set up island wide. A stroke has been identified as the leading cause for paralysis in adults. He had expressed those views after launching the registry of stroke patients which had taken place at the Colombo National Hospital recently.
Minister Senaratne had stated that all State Hospitals offered treatment and facilities for stroke patients and the Health Ministry had now paid attention towards improving their rehabilitation facilities. At the moment, 98 percent of stroke patients in Sri Lanka were able to get their urgently needed CT scans of the brain quickly. Strokes pose a huge impact on the life of the patient as well as his/her entire family.
Therefore people should be educated on the prevention of strokes and emergency management, the Minister had stated.

Says he voted with JO against lease of seed farm:
The two Civil Security personnel provided to the North Central Provincial Council's Joint Opposition Group Member Upali Wijekoon as his personal escort had been withdrawn with immediate effect from 12 noon on August 23. Wijekoon popularly known as War Hero Upali lost both his legs in a LTTE bombs attack which killed Lt. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa and Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne on August 8, 1992.
Wijekoon said the two civil security personnel were provided to him on a request made to the President through the NCP Chief Minister citing his disability. Wijekoon said he participated in a demonstration held on August 21 to protest against the lease of the Maha Illuppalama Seed Farm to a private company and voted with the Joint Opposition group against the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution Draft Bill and he considered this as the main reason for the withdrawal of the Civil Security personnel.
This type of injustice caused to a person who had lost both his legs and managed to save his life from an LTTE bomb which killed 10 other members of his company, was most unbearable, he said.

The President made these remarks while addressing media yesterday at his residence in Colombo.
The President said no one should intervene with the processes not only of the Attorney Generals Department, but also of the special commissions appointed to inquire into certain issues.
The President said legal action will be taken by the Attorney General against the Central Bank bond issue once the report of the Presidential Commission appointed into investigate into the treasury bond issue is finalised.
Unlike various other commissions, the special commission appointed to inquire into the bond issue is progressing well he said.
The President said that unlike on previous occasions, people of the country have placed their confidence on the commission with the appointment of the Presidential Commission to inquire into the treasury bond issue. Further action will be taken by the Attorney General when the Presidential Commissions report on bond issue is furnished.

But, certain parties with the aim of gaining political advantage, continuously highlights this issue and we are totally against such a move.
He was answering to queries raised by journalists at a press conference organized by the BASL yesterday.
He said there was no need to set up such Courts, as there were seven Courts in the Colombo High Court and seven Judges are going through cases in an efficient manner. There is no backlog of cases at the Colombo High Court. Most of the special cases have now come to the concluding stage. There was a delay as some cases were filed without submitting proper documents. Now, we have strong structures and which would ensure a speedy trial and a speedy hearing of cases in the future.
It is unfortunate that certain suspects are kept for long periods in remand without being indicted by Courts. Incapability and inefficiency of certain Police officers have resulted the delay in indictments," he added.

The North Korean spies Ukraine caught stealing missile plans

The images are a little grainy, but in the half-light of a dusty Ukrainian garage, you can sense the unbridled enthusiasm of the two North Korean spies who are photographing what they think are top-secret missile designs.
In a rare window into the opaque, deadly and secretive world of missile technology espionage, Ukrainian security services have given CNN surveillance footage and details of an elaborate sting operation they carried out to snare two North Korean spies in 2011.
The revelations are aimed at dispelling claims that a recent leap forward in Pyongyang's intercontinental missile technology may have been achieved byusing designs stolen or originating from Ukraine.
The claims are made in areport released by analysts at the International Institute of Strategic Studies(IISS) on August 14 which says technology, possibly from Ukraine's Yuzhnoye Design Office in Dnipro, was used in recent North Korean missile tests.
In July, North Korea successfully testedtwo intercontinental ballistic missiles(ICBMs) -- the KN-14 or Hwasong-14. At the time, Pyongyang claimed they were capable of carrying a "large-sized heavy nuclear warhead" as far as the US mainland.
Ukraine has denied any link to North Korea's long-range missiles, and said Russia may instead have provided Pyongyang with the improved missile designs. Russia has denied supporting North Korea's arms program.
An officer with Ukraine's security service, who worked on the 2011 case of the two North Koreans and who we granted anonymity because of his operational role, insisted it was "impossible" North Korea had obtained any missile technology, as he was sure their espionage attempts had all been intercepted.
He said that in 2011 two other North Koreans -- who traveled to Ukraine from the country's Moscow Embassy -- were deported after they were caught trying to obtain "missile munitions, homing missile devices in particular for air-to-air class missiles." A third North Korean, tasked with transporting the actual devices out of Ukraine, was also deported.
And as recently as 2015, five North Koreans were deported for "assisting North Korea's intelligence work in Ukraine," the officer said, without providing further details.
He said, apart from the two in jail, there were no North Koreans left in Ukraine, as those not deported by Ukraine had been voluntarily withdrawn -- many working in alternative medicine centers.
North Koreans guilty of espionage
The two North Korean spies seen on the grainy surveillance footage are currently serving eight-year prison sentences for espionage in the Ukrainian town of Zhytomyr, 140 kilometers (87 miles) west of Kiev.
Ukrainian officials allowed CNN inside the prison facilities to see if they would grant interviews under guard supervision.
The elder inmate is a man in his fifties from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang who is known in court documents as X5. He is gaunt, compared to the fuller frame he had in the surveillance videos, and speaks lightly-accented Russian.
His younger accomplice is a technical expert known as X32.
They are the only such spies in Ukrainian custody, although officials say they have on several occasions intercepted North Korean attempts to access their missile secrets, and as a result in 2016 effectively barred all North Koreans from the country.
The sting
The grainy surveillance video provided to CNN was filmed on July 27, 2011, on a hidden camera set up within a garage to capture the end of a sting operation that was months in the planning.
The two suspects can be seen moments before Ukrainian security service agents burst in and arrest them.
The Ukrainian missile experts they had been courting in the weeks before had informed on them to Ukrainian counter-intelligence agents.
As a result, authorities had detailed knowledge of the information they sought -- "ballistic missiles, missile systems, missile construction, spacecraft engines, solar batteries, fast-emptying fuel tanks, mobile launch containers, powder accumulators and military government standards," according to the court papers from their 2012 trial.
Some of the information related to the SS-24 Scalpel intercontinental ballistic missile, the court papers add. The SS-24 Scalpel, also known as the RT-23, is a solid-fueled missile capable of carrying up to 10 warheads that was launched via missile silos or railroad cars.
The mobile rail missile SS-24 system was banned in the late 1990s under the START-II treaty between the US and Russia, however the ban never came into effect. The design and production of the missile system was most recently held by Ukraine but,according to GlobalSecurity.org, the country ended production of the missile in 1995.
The Ukraine security footage gives a rare window into the elaborate and shadowy world of North Korea's bid to improve its ability to hit the United States and other adversaries with long-range missiles.
The court documents also reveal startlingly human moments during the operation.
The two nervous men continually whisper to each other the material they seek is "secret," and worry the flash batteries may run out on their PowerShot and Coolpix cameras as they photograph the dummy designs.
Speaking briefly to CNN in the jail where he now makes cement railings and iron rods to pass prison time, X5 confirmed he had "partially" admitted his guilt.
The court papers say he insisted his job, as a trade representative in the North Korean embassy in neighboring Belarus, was merely to arrange training in missile technology for North Korean experts -- information he didn't think was classified. He even tried to get one expert, the papers allege, to travel to North Korea and teach there.
Dressed in dark blue overalls and a cloth cap, mixing cement, X5 said he "of course" wanted to return to North Korea, and had not spoken to his family or anyone there since his arrest.
"I am serving my term of punishment. They feed us well here, we work... I don't want to give an interview for the preservation of my safety and that of my family."
He shares a well-lit cell with a TV with eight other convicts, and sleeps in a double bunk bed, with pots of vitamins and toiletries his only obvious possessions.
The second convict, X32, agreed to meet CNN, but immediately declined to be interviewed, covering the camera lens with his hand and walking away.
He has not admitted his guilt and is held in a more relaxed facility where he makes furniture to pass the time.
Denys Chernyshov, Ukraine's deputy minister for justice, said the men had been met once by two officials from North Korea's Moscow embassy, but otherwise had no contact at all with their relatives or North Korea.
"They have asked Ukrainian authorities to be extradited to North Korea to continue their sentence," he said. "But because they are held for spying for North Korea, we obviously declined their request."
Chernyshov added the pair were well-trained.
"To be isolated in another country and culture, with different food even, that brings about a particular stress," he said. "So it is clear these are well prepared, strong people."
However, he added North Korea may not turn out to be that welcoming when they likely travel home in September 2018, at the end of their sentences.
"That their task was unsuccessful, they cannot expect much of a hero's welcome on their return."

## Title: Nuwara Eliya Bird Walk

Nuwara Eliya Bird Walk
Juliet Coombe went on a birding outing to Victoria Park, a glorious 27 acre garden where 90% of the tree species available are those of foreign plants, because it was originally set up as a place of research during Queen Victorias reign and under British Colonial rule.
With a small entrance fee you cant really go wrong for a great bird watching walk with hotel naturalist Ishanda, as Victoria Park is the original template for the Hakgala Botanical gardens 10 km from Nuwara Eliya. Victoria Park is in contrast in the centre of town and therefore walking distance from most hotels, established in the 1840s and it is still the nursery for certain plants in the Hakgala Botanical Gardens. However it was not until 1897 it received its official name to commemorate the 60th Jubilee Coronation of Queen Victoria. If you want to visit the museum to find out more about its origins go right at the main entrance to see the little museum. Make sure you are aware of the opening times as it is owned separately and closes around 4pm most days. Also kids love going on horse rides with the gypsy lads that stand near the main gate.
A waterfall of branches
On entering this lovely, glorified oasis in the city, I am overawed by the diversity of the trees, in size, shape and form; there are around 70 to 80 different species. But the first feature, by the entrance, my naturalist guide from Jetwing St Andrews, Ishanda, takes us to is, of course, the rose garden, very fitting for Queen Victoria, herself once an English rose and a reminder perhaps of her days with the great love of her life, Prince Albert. The garden is a wonderful maze of concentric circles with frame works and pillars all draped with rose-vines. It is best viewed in April when most of the roses are in flow, Ishanda, my very knowledgeable flora and fauna guide from Jetwing St Andrews, tells me. On closer inspection, I notice plastic bundles around countless stems and ask him what on earth they are, not sure whether they are deliberate or some weird phenomenon of littering. They are used for taking cuttings. By attaching bundles of soil half way up the stem, you allow the stem to grow roots of its own that will then enable you to transplant the stem straight into the ground once cut off. Ingenious I am thinking just as he alerts me to the next wonder, an Indian Pitta, a chirpy little fellow with a yellowish breast and bright green plumage on its back.
He bounces off into the undergrowth of a grove of Eucalyptus trees that tower so high you would expect to find bloodthirsty giants in castles at the top of them. Vines have attempted to climb up these majestic trees but got lost half way up and end up entangled in neighbouring trees or giving up altogether and dropping down again like a waterfall of branches. But birds are the real benefactors of these monsters, as they can forage around in safety on the ground beneath or settle in the tops, hundreds of feet away from any predators or interferers. Victoria Park is home to a staggering 80 different species of birds. We promptly see another, the Oriental Asian Magpie, scouting around in the undergrowth, looking similar to magpies from other continents but smaller, sweeter and with a rather proud tail.
The park caters for a wide range of people with its large central well groomed lawn with open areas for recreation, surrounded by beautifully kept and amazingly vibrant flower beds and exotic creations such as the Asian Melaleuca tree with bark that looks like tree leprosy but feels as soft, light and smooth as I dont know what, producing powder that treats skin disorders. We are fortunate enough to hear the tail end of a large group singing session together with musical instruments. That is one of the advantages of it not being a national park, Ishanda tells us, The local people would not be allowed to do this in such a place.
Explosions of beauty
As you move out from the centre you get to the wild borders where most of the birds can hide or go about their business unhindered, unless of course youre a bird on the pull, in which case you might head for what is known as Kissing Corner but, despite the birds being the main draw for tourists, we find the authorities have cut down a number of large trees and cleared the area here such that it would now need to be renamed voyeurs corner if it were to remain an area for such pursuits, on account of its now being overlooked by five storey buildings across the street.
We were not amused by the cut backs as it will affect bird life and Victoria would agree methinks.
However, this is a small blip in an otherwise wonderful visual and peaceful treat. Bright flowers lift the spirits everywhere with exotic offerings like lovers begonias, azaleas blowing their massive pink trumpets all year round, and cannas flowers with their bright yellow and orange furling trumpets. As I look up from these explosions of beauty unsurpassable even to King Solomon in all his glory, Cattle Egrets flutter past on their graceful flight to other places, past screeching Rose Wing Parakeets perching high in Cypress trees adorned with massive growths about their trunks. Many of the trees here also show off vibrant plumage like the Powder hub with its exploding fireworks of pink and white, the aptly named Bottle Brush trees with their bright red flora, the Hibiscus with red furled bells and vines that wind around their host trees decorating them like Christmas trees with pentagonal yellow and white six inch long trombones. Amongst them, if you are watchful and keen eyed, you may find Grey Wagtails, Spotted Doves or the migrating Kashmir Flycatchers, as we did.
Some trees capture the imagination with their curly ferns, all feathery and fluffy, others with their fungi busting sooted wax and whatever you do, dont miss the multiple trunked Ali Bumbums as you leave the park, bidding you farewell as you once again get sucked into the mayhem of motoring just outside the gates of this incredible sanctuary for all creation to enjoy. The next day the naturalist spotted 37 species of birds on the same walk and four of them were migrant, five of them were endemic and others are Victoria Park residents. This birding trip included seeing the Kashmir flycatcher with it bright orange charming call. Ishanda explains as we walk back pass the temple through the busy streets, sun setting over the city of light, snapping away at street food characters he says turning into the Jetwing Saint Andrews Cottage I love Victoria park because everyone can enjoy this magical garden, any age group will love it, any religion, people from any country as here there are no barriers and much to learn from the birds that inhabit this rich oasis of flora and fauna.

SLMC will not vote for LG Election Bill if its anomalies not rectified: Hakeem
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) will not vote for the Local Government Election Amendment Bill if certain anomalies are not rectified, its leader Minister Ruff Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
"We need a firm answer from the the Local Government Minister that the anomalies would be corrected in time to come so that we can tell our people that we have voted with the government," Minister Hakeem said.
"We can't accept the vague answers. If so we will have to abstain from voting."
He was participating in the second reading debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill.
Minister Hakeem said that some wards were carved out in a way that ethnic minorities were affected. "The Samanthrei Pradeshiya sabha with 40,000 voters was allocated 10 members," Minister Hakeem said. "20 members are elected from Dehiattakandiya, which has similar population. How can this be", he asked.
He said his party would be compelled to abstain if anomalies were not rectified before the vote.
EC New electoral register disfranchised thousands: Dinesh
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena complained that the latest electoral register prepared by the Elections Commission has disfranchised thousands across Sri Lanka.
The MP made the observation participating in the debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday.
He requested to take immediate steps to register those who were denied of voting rights.
Gunawardena demanded the Government to articulate the date of holding the long overdue Local Government Elections. We will support to pass the legislation through, but speak out the date you intend to hold the elections, he said.
He requested the Government to facilitate a special discussion on the subsequent amendments the Government is hoping to move at the Committee stage.
There are as many as 50 such amendments. We received them this morning and want time to study. These change the intention of the legislation. The earlier proposed 70 percent allocation for Proportional Representation was reduced. Even the Elections Commission Chairman was unable to predict the result of the proposed amendments. The amendments will clearly lead to chaos, he said.
MP Gunawardena failed to submit any Amendment to the Bill on behalf the JO group despite the repeated requests of Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella to do so, if any. Kiriella questioned the bona fide of JO in demanding to hold the elections immediately while dragging the feet of the Government in passing the legislation.
The JVP submitted four Amendments and we are ready to discuss them. The JO neither submit any proposal nor support our amendments, the minister said.
Focus on air travel by Ministers, MPs during 2015, 2016:
Reports on misusing Air Force helicopters will be submitted to Parliament: Wijewardene
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday agreed to furnish a report to Parliament stating whether the Ministers and MPs who used helicopters of Sri Lanka Air Force in 2015 and 2016 had used public funds to pay for helicopters.
The State Minister, replying to a question by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila, said, "only the President, the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister are entitled to use the Air Force helicopters free of charge".
In addition, the Air Force, on the request of Foreign Affairs Ministry and on the approval of Defence Ministry, provides helicopters free of charge to Heads of State of other countries when they are visiting Sri Lanka.
Any other person who uses the Air Force helicopters, upon the approval of the Defence Ministry, must make due payments for their local air travels, Wijewardene explained.
The Minister, confirming that a number of Ministers and MPs have used Air Force helicopters in 2015 and 2016, said he was not in a position to exactly say who paid for the expenses and for what reasons they travelled by air locally.
The Minister agreed to inform the House after confirming the veracity of that information what Ministers, MPs and officers used the Air Force helicopters from January 9, 2015 to October 31, 2016 and whether those payments had been settled using funds from the Government, State Corporations or State-Owned Companies.
Government had no need to postpone elections: Musthapa
The Unity Government at any stage had no need to postpone elections but it had to be done due to the flaws of the delimitation done during the previous regime, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa said in Parliament yesterday.
He said he had to go for an appeal review process that took one and half years due to the fact that the delimitation was done during the previous regime according to the need of the then Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
"Actually it was not done by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party but on the need of a then Minister," Minister Faizer Musthapa said.
"Although it was the background to the delay for the election, the opposition members levelled various baseless allegations against the government," Minister Musthapa said. "The Government had not at any stage attempted to postpone the elections."
He was participating the second reading debate on the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill.
The Minister said that although Basil Rajapaksa commenced the delimitation in 2012, he had failed to handover the report to the President.
"It had to be handed over to the President during the Good Governance Government," Minister Musthapa said. "They had done it in cool rooms.
So we had to take one and half years to meet the people of ground level to formulate better one that would be accepted by all."
He said that in line with the election pledge by the President, the Government could made the amendment which increase the First Past the Post System to 40 percent and the Proportional Representation to 60 percent while guaranteeing the women's representation at least 25 percent.
"The increase of the women's representation is very progressive, and we request the members not to nominate their wives and sisters to protect the spirit of these amendments and to guarantee the women of the ground level get their opportunities too," Minister Musthapa said.
He said some members of the minority groups are not contended with some of the clauses.
"But everybody should know that former one had been formulated to suppress the representation of the minority groups and this one is more progressive in that context," Minister said.
"So I have to say that Minister Rauff Hakeem's and Rishad Bathideen's concerns would be solved."
Minister Hakeem said the JVP's request of reducing the deposits to Rs. 1,500 would be solved.
The Minister requested all to support the motion to enable to elect a member who is answerable to the electorate.
Vote on Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill today
The vote on Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill will be taken up today.
The Bill was moved for debate in Parliament yesterday by Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
The Bill is to make the necessary legal amendments to hold the long overdue LG Elections under the new electoral system. After experimenting the new electoral system at the LG elections, it would be extended to the Provincial Council Elections and national level elections.
A mixed system, a hybrid of the first-past-the-post (FPP) and the proportional representation (PR) will come into place once the legislation gets through Parliament. It has given 25 percent quota to female representatives and abolishes the Preferential Votes System.
The Bill will amend the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance (Chapter 262) and provide identification for each ward by giving a name and a number among other requirements. The Government is to accommodate about 27 subsequent amendments to the Bill at its Committee stage today. The Government presented the Bill for the first reading on June 20.
Question about DLB redirected to Finance and Mass Media Ministry
A question related to the Development Lotteries Board asked from the Foreign Affairs Ministry was re-directed to the Finance and Mass Media Ministry yesterday by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
The question was posed by Joint Opposition MP Ranjith de Soyza prior to resignation of Ravi Karunanayake from the post of Foreign Minister under whom the two lotteries boards were gazetted. The question was on the Chairman and Director Board of Development Lotteries Board. Minister Karunathilake, observing that the institution has been re-gazetted under the Finance and Mass Media Ministry, said the question would be answered by the relevant minister at a future date.
MP De Soysa had requested to reveal the educational qualifications of the Development Lotteries Board Chairman and the monthly salaries and the allowances of the Chairman and the Director Board.

K. Prabagaran fired an Eagle on the 18th to finish the 3rd Round 2 under, for an eight under par total going in to the final round of the ongoing Sri Lanka Open Golf Championship at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club yesterday.

Anura Rohana is in 3rd place, a further stroke behind. However, the sensation for the day was B G Lalith Kumara who had a scintillating run of six Birdies on the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th and an Eagle on the 8th to be 8 under par playing the 12th hole, at which stage Lalith Kumara was in 2nd place, 4 strokes behind leader Prabagaran.

Loss of Thajudeens body parts:
Two suspects present in Courts:
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court that there is a possibility of arresting former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General made this observation when the magisterial inquiry into murder of Wasim Thajudeen was taken up before Colombo Chief Magistrates Court. When case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky, two suspects, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera were present in Courts. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012.

Secret studio beneath a bridge
Plumber-turned-furniture designer Fernando Abellanas has built himself a studio that acrophobes wouldnt want to visit. Abellanas has constructed his workplace under a bridge in Valencia, Spain, and it perfectly blends into the urban setting.
This under-bridge setup has a chair, a desk, and two shelves, providing all the storage space one could ask for in a regular office.
To access the micro dwelling, the designer uses a hand crank that transports the base to the furniture, bolted to the bridges concrete wall.
Abellanas is keeping the exact location of the studio a secret.
The project is an ephemeral intervention, he told the Spaces, via Curbed. [It will remain] until someone finds it and decides to steal the materials, or the authorities remove it.

Sri Lanka launches inquiry into recent defeats
Colombo: Sri Lanka is launching an investigation into the woeful state of cricket on the island, the sports minister said Thursday, amid a string of humiliating losses and calls for an administrative overhaul.
Dayasiri Jayasekera said he was inviting former administrators, players, sports experts and journalists to brainstorm ideas about how to revive the game, beloved in Sri Lanka.
I am hoping to get all these experts at a single forum and thrash out issues, Jayasekera told AFP.
There is no point in blaming administrators or the players without an in-depth study. The idea is not to apportion blame, but address the deficiencies and rally behind the national team.
He has rejected a suggested clear-out of the cricket board, an idea pushed aggressively by former World Cup winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga following this months 3-0 Test whitewash against India on home soil.
That compounded the misery for the national side after they suffered a humiliating ODI home series defeat against bottom-ranked Zimbabwe and bowed out early from the Champions Trophy in England.
I dont want to interfere in the administration, Jayasekera said. That might lead to isolation by the ICC (International Cricket Council).
For years Sri Lankas cricket was governed by state-appointed boards, before a switch in 2016 to democratically-elected office bearers.
Ranatunga, who wanted a key role in the administration, was defeated at those elections.
The ICC had briefly suspended Sri Lankas voting rights before the 2016 reforms.
Jayasekera said player fitness was also an issue that contributed to Sri Lankas poor showing of late. The sports minister had already caused a stir by labelling the squad too fat and unfit to field five-day matches.
It is hoped the proposed forum, which has asked interested parties to submit written submissions about how to improve the game, will be held within a fortnight. AFP
