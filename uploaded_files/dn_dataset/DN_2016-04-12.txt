MINI entertainment

Just three apples high and blue from head to toe, Peyo's Belgian comic book characters now come in 3D format in Raja Gosnell's movie 'The Smurfs'.
The movie features the familiar old gang of the 1980's television series engaged in a new adventure. While fleeing from their archenemy, the evil wizard Gargamel, half a dozen Smurfs find themselves imported to New York City. With the wizard and his cat in pursuit, the Smurfs take refuge in a young couple's home. The head of the family, Patrick is desperately trying to make things work at his workplace. He is pressured when his tyrannical boss suddenly puts an advertising campaign on him. Back at home his wife, Grace, is expecting their first baby. At the beginning Patrick finds the presence of the little folk annoying but he soon learns that true happiness comes from simple matters which touch the heart.
Central theme

The maincharactersin focus

Faith in your strengths seems to be the central theme of 'The Smurfs'. Even Papa Smurf is surprised that it is Clumsy, his accident-prone son who saves the day when he is able to retrieve the wand from Gargamel and turn its powers on the evil wizard. Likewise Patrick too begins to realize that he has the ingredients for happiness because he possesses a loving family.
There are only a few genuinely funny moments in 'The Smurfs'. One of the few comes from Gargamel's relationship with his cat, Azrael, that is, ironically, more intelligent than him.
This alone brings on a few laughs but it seems ridiculous that the he who claims to be the most powerful wizard in the land, turns out to be too stupid to make use of his powers. In this light the heroism of the Smurfs are overshadowed by the idiocy of the villain. Another humorous sequence occurs when the Smurfs raid the toy store to find a telescope. This half-animation film in which the blue folk scurry about in the human world reminds us of the characters in the 'Toy Story' series and 'Gnomeo and Juliet'. However unlike the two films, 'The Smurfs' is past using mature comic elements or an interesting storyline.
Predictable narrative
This predictable narrative formula is the real let down of the movie.
For instance when Gargamel needs a place to brew his potions in New York, the dwelling is magically presented to him in the form of a shabby old hideout. Similarly when Papa Smurf voices the need to find a book of spells, Patrick instantly recalls an old bookstore which evidently houses the book that they want. There is hardly any time for suspense because the story is scripted in a manner in which the writer is all too eager to provide the solution to the problem and does not have the patience to keep the audience guessing. Furthermore the overuse of the word 'Smurf' in the dialogues annoys rather than amuses.
Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays deliver a tolerable performance as the young couple who befriend the Smurfs. Hank Azaria does well as Gargamel. Sofia Vergara's bossy Odile earns a few laughs. The Smurfs are voiced by Jonathan Winters, Katy Perry, George Lopez, Alan Cumming, Fred Armisen and Anton Yelchin. Frank Welker excels as Azrael.
It is clear that 'The Smurfs' is aimed squarely at a young audience. Though the kids might enjoy the slapstick comedy, the movie is a patience-testing experience for adults.

Green turtles which are a rare species of turtle are now seen on the Gurubewila beach in Weligama drawing a large number of curious crowds.
People in the area who witnessed about 250 hatchlings coming out of a cave on the beach had informed officers of the Mirissa Wildlife about it. Wildlife officials said they quickly caught the turtles and released them to the sea.
These varieties of turtles are seen in Sri Lanka, they said.

UNF received people's mandate not UPFA or SLFP: Kiriella

It was the United National Front and not the UPFA or the SLFP which received the people's mandate at the last general election. This should be borne in mind by constituent parties of the government as well as the so called Common Opposition, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said UNP captured 107 seats at the last election but some people were talking as if the people's mandate was received by the UPFA or the SLFP.
Kiriella made these observations addressing the media after he called on the newly elected Asgiriya prelate Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera at the Asgiriya Viharaya in Kandy and received his blessings on Sunday.
The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena also won the presidency contesting under the banner of the United National Front.
Kiriella said that even though the delimitation of electoral wards was decided on at the residencies of former parliamentarians during the previous regime, the delimitation of electoral boundaries was being done in a transparent and proper manner today.
"The local elections would be called once the delimitation process was conducted in a fair and just manner," the minister said.
He also said the old Bogambara Prison would be transformed into a super grade hotel today.

Shed differences and work for the country: Samarasinghe

This is a government of reconciliation. Its a laudable concept of the President, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister and Kalutara District Development Committee's co-chairman Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
"We should all work in a sincere and genuine manner with a true Sri Lankan identity by shelving all petty differences. Today, this platform itself symbolises this vision. All of us including Panadura UNP organiser Nandana Gunatilleke, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and myself have joined hands to serve the people in the area," he said.
Samarasinghe was addressing a meeting which followed the opening of the second stage of the Panadura public bus stand built at a cost of Rs. 8 million recently. He said it was the SLFP which won the Kalutara district at the last general election.
The minister said he had been in politics for the last 28 year and been a minister on five occasions.
He said he had never acted or spoken in public in an unbecoming manner or disgraced people. Samarasinghe said he had dedicated himself to work for the development and progress of the entire district and the country at large.
The minister said a certain parliamentarian who had even been critical of the President had accepted a deputy minister's post by going in bended knees.
Samarasinghe said he had been termed as a useless person by this same individual. He said he would request that person to be more disciplined and responsible in his talk.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said Pandura is known as a Buddhist electorate.
It was electorates with a Buddhist majority like Panadura, Maharagama and Kelaniya which tipped the scales at elections, he said.

Madura and Jeewanthika does Seetha Devi proud

Two old girls of Seetha Devi Girls College, Kandy will be the captain and vice captain of the Sri Lanka Ladies Team for the World League Hockey Championship which is being played in Singapore from April 11 to 23.
The Captain of the national ladies team will be Madura Dharmaratne and the Vice Captain will be Jeewanthika Keerthiratne. Their appointment to these two top positions is a big honour to the hill capital which has shown tremendous progress in girls hockey with Seetha Devi Girls College showing the way followed by St. Anthonys Girls College and Pushpadana Girls College and now Mahamaya Girls College is making a grand revival.
But the credit should go to Seetha Devi Girls College who introduced hockey in 1991 with M.A.M. Ashroff as its pioneers coach and still continuous to coach them and under his guidance for the last 25 years they have won over 170 championship titles at various age group levels at various tournaments. This is a record which cannot be easily broken with many schools in Kandy, Matale and Colombo playing the game in a big way.
Amiable Madura Dharmaratne is a player pleasant to watch and has fine qualities of leadership. Her choice as the captain is a good one as she is very popular among her team mates with her friendly ways.
Madura Dharmaratne plays in the pivotal position of centre half  a berth she has been occupying in the national team for the past five years from the time she left school and started playing for Sri Lanka Navy. She is good in both attack and defence. When in the sail she sails into the opponents defence and often tears them into shreds or feeds the flankers with good ball to do the scoring. When in defence she has good judgement and anticipation and could be a thorn in the flesh for the opponents attack. Her brilliant play at last years Seetha Devi Sevens for the Navy team she was adjudged the Player of the Tournament. This is her sixth tour of Singapore for various tournaments. At 26 she is a much experienced player. She keeps fit by physical exercises and walking in the village roads. She is essentially a village lass from the village of Danture in the Yatinuwara electorate.
It is great to have reached the highest spot in her favourite game of hockey by captaining the national team. But her fellow villagers may not even know what is hockey except see her walking with the curved stick. Madura Dharmaratne is a wonderful girl and soft spoken.
The Vice Captain of the team is stockily built Jeewanthika Keerthiratne and is the top spot goal keeper of the side. It could be said that it is by a strange quirk of fate that she is playing for the national team occupying this berth as number one in the trade for the last seven years.
She played for the school as a center forward and may be that she just made it to the side. Then one day the schools regular goal keeper was injured during a match and she was asked to be the stop gap custodian of the side. She did such a fine job manning the fortress that the regular goal keeper lost her place in the side. Two years later she found herself playing for the national team as its custodian and she has been holding this berth for the last seven years and is one of the senior members of the national side.
Like Madura, Jeewanthika is also from the village and is from Pilimatalawa and the villagers hardly know hockey. It is through sheer dedication and application that these girls from the adjoining villagers have made it to the national team and are at the helm.

Darin clocks fastest time at Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb

Darin Weerasinghe clocked the fastest time in the 83 year old history of the Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb with a timing of 33.46 seconds to break the existing course record of 34.17 seconds held by hill stormer Nishan Weerasoriya since last year at the Annual Mahagastota Speed Climb organized by the oldest motor racing club in Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Motor Sports Club titled the Mahagastota Festival of Speed and sponsored by Mobil, McFoil, Ceat, Mahindra and supported by Blackpool Hotel and worked off at the picturesque Mahagastota Track on Sunday before a large and enthusiastic crowd.
In breaking the record young Darin Weerasinghe also became the first competitor to time less than 34 seconds - a long way ahead of Bill Fowkes who timed 68.34 seconds in his Austin Trophy way back in 1934 which was the fastest timing at the first speed climb organized by an enthusiastic band of expatriate British Planters to break the boredom on Sundays but since it has gained a lot of status and momentum to be dubbed as the national festival of speed.
The day belonged to Darin Weerasinghe son of the famous Bandula Weerasinghe who is the only racing driver to holy three class records simultaneously and one of them stood for a very long time till the advent of the Japanese cars with the latest technology lowered it a few years back.
Darin Weerasinghe driving behind a Subaru STI 10 in the high powered event of SLGT finding the track conditions much to hiking made a flawless screeching run. It was delightful display with a quick change of gears and did not lose any time at the tricky corners as he had the complete control of the machine.
Darin Weerasinghe is a versatile sportsman as he had represented the country at international meets at Powerlifting and brought gold medals and he was one time holder of the Overall Course record with a timing of 34.348 seconds in 2014 till it was lowered by Nishan Weerasooriya in his Alpha Mitsubishi Evolution in 2015.
Darin Weerasinghe's second run was slightly slower and by that the time had the course record wrapped up. Nishan Weerasooriya did not participate this year as his machine was not ready for the event but was an interested spectator and was happy that his course record was broken and he vowed to return next year and scale down the record further.
Another record to go was the course record for motor cycles was by Ananda Sampath Weerasinghe astride a Ananda Special timed 34.628 seconds to lower his own record for motor cycles 36.364 seconds.
Ever green maestro Rohan de Silva was once again is top form to win the event for Modified Ford Formula 1665 cc giving an object lesson to young drivers what is motor racing and age does not matter as long as you have complete control of the machine. He beat some of the competitors who were half his age. Rohan de Silva now in the twilight of his career has won the most number of events in a Modified Formula and has been the holder of the Course Record on a number of occasions. He was also placed second in the McLarens Formula 1300 cc.
This was also a day in which veteran driver Dhammika Peiris beat his son Kushan in one event but only to be beaten by the little one in the next event.
It was also nice to see the Mason brothers Jeffrey and Rodney driving their Minis and they participated at this event after 25 years. The drivers from the old vintage who participated at this racing event was 74 year old Sumanapala Manpperuma, Kumar Samarasinghe and maestro Rohan de Silva all pushing in their sixties but their love for motor racing will not just keep them away.

Duvindu - first bowler from Central Province to claim 100 wickets

A late flourish by Trinity College's left arm spinner Duvindu Tillakaratne saw him win the race for the first to reach 100 wickets in the Central Province. In all he has captured 106 wickets in the two day matches is the highest number of wickets by a school boy bowler from Kandy and Central provicne during the 2016 school cricket season.
Speaking to this writer Duvindu Tillakaratne son of former Sri Lanka cricket captain Hashan Tillakaratne said that just before their traditional big match against St. Anthony's College he had captured 99 wickets and his skipper Ravin Sayer was on 98 wickets. The big match had to be postponed due to the passing away of Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter and the venue shifted from Asgiriya to the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.
In the second over he bowled he got the much needed one wicket to reach 100 wickets for the season. In the next over Ravin Sayer reached his 100th wicket from the other end. It was thrilling for two bowlers to get 100 wickets in successive overs of the big match. There may be no parallel to this.
Duvindu said that at the beginning of the season he lost his sights of reaching 100 wickets in the season he was not among the wickets and in the first 7 matches he managed around 20 odd wickets and he had a long way to go. It was like reaching the Himalayan heights. Then came the match against Wesley College in which he had a match haul of 8 wickets and followed up with 9 wickets in the next match. He had found his lien and length and was able to bemuse the opposing batsmen.
Perhaps his best match against Royal College played at the Asgiriya Stadium and the match was heading towards a draw. When the mandatory overs began Royal College had 6 wickets in hand and needed a few runs to wipe out the deficit. Wickets started falling and Trinity won by an innings and one run with three overs to spare. This match was a personal triumph for young Duvindu Tillakaratne he captured 1 for 35 and 6 for 55 in the match. In the second innings he was able to break the back bone of Royal's batting.
Duvindu Tillakaratne is already a cricket colours man and his 100 wickets will make him eligible for the prestigious Cricket Lion which will be awarded later this year.
What the father former national cricket captain Hashan Tillakaratne had done with the bat, the son Duvindu had performed with the ball which are contrasting performances.
His tally for the season would have been much more and would have reached the 100 wicket mark much earlier if not for the fact that he did not bowl in three of the innings in the matches played by his school and this was mostly second innings of the opponents.
His season's match haul records is as follows:
Vs Maliyadewa College 1 for 23, Vs St. Aloysius College Galle 5 for 29, Vs St. Anthony's College, Wattala 3 for 25, Vs De Mazenod College, Kandana 3 for 29, Vs. D. S. Senanayake College 1 for 20, Vs. St. Servatius College 3 for 43 (bowled only in the one innings) Vs. Wesley College 8 for 64, Vs. Bandranaike National School 9 for 71, Vs. Dharmapala Vidyalaya 5 for 90, Vs. St Benedcits College 3 for 71 (bowled only in one innigns), Vs St. Josephs College 10 for 131, Vs Dharmaraja College 9 for 74, Vs Ananda College 6 for 71, Vs Issipathana College 6 for 125, Vs Zahira College 5 for 72, Vs St. Thomas College 3 for 93 (bowled only in one innings), Vs St. Peters College 3 for 112, Vs Royal College 6 for 77, Vs Maris Stella College 8 for 122, Vs St. Anthony's College, Kandy 7 for 76.

Trinity Demolish DSS 65-0


Trinity College Kandy totally outclassed D.S. Senanayake College recording a smashing 65 points (11 tries, 5 conversions) to nil victory in their Singer inter-school Under-20 Division 1 league rugby tournament match worked off at Longden Place yesterday. Trinity led 22-nil at the breather.
Trinity are known for their power, but for the first time this season they produced one of the finest passing-rugby scoring some spectacular tries in a match where they even sent in a few of their junior members in the second half to have a go at the tiring D.S. Senanayake outfit.
The high-riding Trinitians were hot favourites to win on paper, but actually it was the school from Borella that dominated proceedings for the first 25 minutes. They held the formidable Trinitians to a nil-all scoreline until winger Ayesha Edirisinghe collected the ball and sprinted his way over for a superb try covering nearly 60 metres. Full back Sanushka Abeywickrema failed with the conversion and Trinity went into a 5-nil lead.
Trinity forwards have been magnificent this season, setting up so many tries off the rolling maul, but yesterday was different; it was nothing but the effect of their coach Irish international Erick Miller that the lads from the hill capital were moving the ball so beautifully. Centre three quarter Avishka Shiek, playing his first season under the Trinity jersey got onto the field and scored three breathtaking tries. He gave a fabulous off load to his winger to open the score for his side before clearing over 60 metres on the right wing after receiving the ball from Abeywickrama to score his second on the stroke of half time. Later in the second half he set up Abeywickrema on the right flank, which was another scintillating try where the Trinity duo exchanged the ball twice fooling four or five DSS defenders. Shiek was probably the man of the match.
Despite the margin of win, the match was far from being one-sided. DSS kept it difficult for Trinitians for most of the 80 minutes, but were punished on the small mistakes they made. Perhaps DSS were a bit too worried about Shiek. The boys from DSS did fail to mark the Trinity centre and hence they created some gaps in their defence. Shiek hit those gaps very well to score a hat-trick.
Trinity got into the act in the second half and scored tries through Abeywickrema, Amith Kulatunga, Kanesha Alwis, H.K. Sanghasinghe, Salindra Alahakoon, Melan Maleish and Rishane Madena with Abeywickrema putting over five conversions to make the final score a runaway 65-0. - WAI

Sri Lanka mens hockey team started their World League first round hockey matches on a winning note when they trounced Myanmar by the big margin of 7 goals to in their opening match played at Penang. Singapore.
Left flanker Abeetha Fernando making his debut for the country in the international scene kept the scoreboard rolling with two good goals which upset the opponents defence. This was followed by two more goals by centre forward Sandaruwan Priyankara. Soon after mid way in the second half Lakshan Nanayakkara. Assanka Welagedera and Harendra Dharmaratne sounded the boards once each to complete the rout.
Also excelling for Sri Lanka in both attack and defence were new comer Anuradha Suresh Shamika Gunawardena, Tharanga Gunawardena and Amila Rathnasiri who fed the forward with the good ball for them to score.
Lankans lases in dismal performance
Sri Lanka Ladies hockey team put up two dismal displays losing their first two matches by big margins in their World League first round hockey matches now being played at Senkhan Astro Turf in Singapore.
In their opening match they lost to Singapore 7 goals to 1 with skipper Madura Dharmaratne scoring the solitary goal for the Sri Lanka.
This huge defeat underlines the contrasting performance of the previous where the Sri Lankans won by comfortable margins of 5 5-0 and 4-0 in their previous tour matches. The last time in an Asian Challengers Trophy match Sri Lanka beat Singapore 3-0.
In the second match of the World League Championship match Sri Lanka lost to not so highly rated Hongkong team by 1-4. Centre forward Madhushan Jayanetti scored for Sri Lanka. This is one match the Sri Lankan stickers had the potential to win and kept their chances of playing in the second round of the World League championship.
But they frittered away their chances.
According to reporters reaching Sri Lanka in their match against Singapore were awarded 7 penalty corners and they did not convert any due to mis-directed hits which were off target. The Singaporeans were awarded penalty corners and they converted five of them in style. This made the difference in the end.

SLC will fully back Kusal's case

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) will take every possible measure to reduce the impending four-year-ban on Sri Lankan opener Kusal Janith Perera, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera told the Daily News yesterday.
"There was no communication in this regard between the ICC and the SLC on Monday. However, we all know that Kusal is facing the risk of a four-year ban. Therefore, the SLC has decided to back the Sri Lankan player and support his appeal," the Minister said.
Jayasekera also added that the Sri Lankan cricketer had to undergo two more tests before the ICC's final decision on the matter. "The final decision, as far as I know, can be expected within the next few weeks," he said.
"We have already hired international lawyers to support Kusal's case and we will bear the expenses. There will be no pressure on the player.
We will not leave him stranded and we are positive about the outcome of inquiries," the Minister added.

Former Zimbabwe umpire Ian Robinson dies at 69

Former Zimbabwe umpire Ian Robinson died of lung cancer at the age of 69, in Harare on Sunday.
Robinson made his international debut as an umpire in the 1992 World Cup and his Test debut in Zimbabwe's inaugural match, against India in Harare, in October 1992. He officiated in 28 Tests, 90 ODIs and three World Cups - 1992, 1996 and 1999.
Robinson officiated seven of his 28 Tests in matches involving Sri Lanka. He was the neutral umpire for the two Tests played in Sri Lanka against Pakistan at P Sara Oval and Asgiriya in 1994. He began his umpiring career in 1975, and was appointed to Zimbabwe's first-class panel in 1978. In 2004, he was sacked by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union without being given a reason.
Apart from his umpiring duties, Robinson served as a ZCU board member for 14 years and an employee of the board for nine. He also served as the board's international cricket manager.
Robinson was appointed to the first international panel of umpires established by the ICC in 1994. In 2008, he announced his retirement from top-level umpiring to focus on his role as ICC Regional Umpires' Performance Manager (RUPM) for the Africa region.
