What you see are intricate designs that comes in three colours, rose gold, a more orangey colour and a dark brown coloured copper which she says blends well with the average Sri Lankan complexion. More importantly is that they are affordable and stylish and some are made with jasper stones. Her jewellery also has embedded in them, semi-precious stones, while some have been created to match batik fabric, an influence that has recently added to her range.
Stunning to look at, stunning when worn are also her pieces made with natural jade and pearls. Ethnic are some, while some have been turned out of wood and plants that have aged. Her creative fingers have blessed the modern range of jewellery with mother of pearls and south sea pearls set in silver and white gold plated.

Indiras beginnings were those of an aspiring airhostess flying the national carrier where she travelled the world. It was during her overseas travels that she took an interest in jewellery, realizing the importance of how it enhanced a womans look! Her career transgressed to being a sales person at the Hilton Colombo. Marriage followed and she travelled the world settling down in Indonesia since 23 years with her husband. With her two sons having left her nest, she realized she had more time to focus once again on her dream which was creating her own jewellery collection.

She has held exhibitions in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, and is frequently contacted to make personalized jewellery for customers, a clientele built over the years.

World Environment Day
Protect the environment throughout the year
Public officials should strive hard to protect and safeguard the environment throughout the year, without restricting their endeavour to World Environment Day only, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was addressing the gathering as the chief guest at a ceremony held at Kegalle Independence Avenue yesterday to mark World Environment Day, which falls today. The President said the theme of World Environment Day this year was Beat Plastic Pollution.
The UN would commemorate World Environment Day today with this theme, with the participation of nearly 200 member nations.
The importance of environmental protection should be imbued in the minds of all citizens from their childhood. We should understand that the environment is a subject entwined with morality, rather than a subject of science, the President said.
Yesterdays ceremony in Kegalle included the handing over of garbage recycling equipment to provincial council and local government institutions and the distribution of prizes and awards to the winners of competitions held to mark World Environment Day.

The 100 day document, not a UNP manifesto - Harin
The 100 day programme was a policy document prepared and promoted by the supporters of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Election in 2015 and not a UNP manifesto, Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said.
Fernando pointed out that the campaign promoted the slogan Maithri Palanayak, Dina Siyakin Aluth Ratak (A Maithri governance and a new country in 100 days) which was a concept of all those who supported the Common Candidate against the former regime.
The newly appointed UNP Spokesman and the Chief of Central Media Unit, Minister Harin Fernando said that the endorsement of a Common Candidate for the 2015 Presidential Election was not an idea that was single handedly marketed by the UNP, but that it was the common demand of all the organizations, movements and campaigns against the previous regime.
This was the first reference made by the UNP to President Maithripala Sirisenas recent observation of the 100 day programme was at a ceremony held at Sri Lanka Foundation.
Minister Fernando was speaking at the launching ceremony of the UNP Central Media Unit and the Sathya (Truth) programme which was held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
The decision to topple Rajapaksa regime was a truthful decision we all collectively took. The truth is that, when the General Secretary of the SLFP Maithripala Sirisena gave up his position to become the Common Candidate, it earned him much respect and credibility. The truth is that, the 100 day programme added value to that credibility of the Common Candidate. The truth is that 100 day programme was not a UNP manifesto but a policy document created by the all those who supported the Common Candidate, Minister Harin Fernando said.
Fernando also said that it the 100 day programme was not a 100% success.
There were some promises that we could not keep. But we kept most of the important promises made in this programme. These include the National Pharmaceutical Policy, the Right to Information Act, 19th Amendment and the Independent Commissions. These are things to be happy about. Fernando said.Speaking of the Sathya (Truth) Campaign, Minister Fernando said that our vision is to ensure that the public is aware of and informed of all steps taken by the United National party to uplift the lives of the Sri Lankan people, and to ensure that any and all news is disseminated in a clear, concise and factual manner, thereby building trust and goodwill between the people and the party.
Speaking of the Code of Conduct of the Media Unit, Minister Fernando said that We will always be truthful.
We consider this as our responsibility. We recognise your honesty. We believe it is your right; the people should know the truth. We accept that it is a fundamental right of the people.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
#25 Giuseppe Meazza
There are some footballers whose legend supersedes them, grows around them, makes them into the kind of implausible superheroes we dream of having in our lives, men made Gods.
Giuseppe Meazza was one of them.
Hell, to this day when an Italian searches for a phrase to describe a rather spectacular goal, he often goes with Gol alla Meazza and finte alla Meazza.
Some of the tales of his skill are astounding. Sample this from famed Italian intellectual/wine critic Luigi Veronelli: I also saw Pel playing. He did not achieve Meazzas elegant style of playing. One day, at the Arena, I witnessed him doing something astonishing: he stopped the ball with a bicycle kick, elevating himself two meters from the ground. Then he landed with the ball glued at his foot, dribbled over an astonished defender, and then went on scoring a goal with one of his hallmark shots, sardonic and accurate to the millimeter.
Ah. Brilliant.
Its added on to by quotes from sources less prone to exaggerated prose, like this from the great Italian manager of the 30s Vittorio Pozzo: He was a born forward. He saw the game, understood the situation, distributed the ball carefully and made the team offense operate. Having him on the team was like starting the game 10 up.
He was the central piece of the great Inter and Italy teams of the 30s, instrumental in the Italian triumphs in both the 1934 and the 1938 World Cup. A controversial figure - thanks to the fact that Benito Mussolini adopted him as the sporting symbol of his fascist governments success and to his absolutely flamboyant playboy lifestyle - his genius on the football arena is rarely disputed. He scored 314 club goals in 511 matches, and a rather astonishing 33 in 53 outings for the Azzurri.
His was a rags-to-riches story, a story that would have made a Hollywood scriptwriter flush with envy... turned down by AC Milan for being too skinny, he was picked up by Inter after a scout saw him juggling a rag ball on the streets of Milan. The Nerazzurri got to work bulking him, and he got to work smashing goals in. Excellent in the air - despite his short stature - he possessed a lethal shot on either foot, and his low of centre of gravity made his twisty-turny style of dribbling nigh on impossible to stop.
None of which meant, though, that he was a model athlete off the pitch... known for his fondness of women and wine, he himself once stated in an interview: Luckily I lived near the stadium, and I managed to get there in a rush. My teammates and the coach looked at me disapprovingly. It was only five minutes before the kick-off, so I quickly changed and joined the team on the pitch. I could hear the Inter directors saying: Well deal with him after the match. Well find out what hes been up to. Luckily I scored a hat-trick so afterwards no one said a word!
For Italy, few have scored more important goals. He walked away with the Golden Ball in 34 and in 38 was the aging playmaking pivot around which Pozzo built the team that stopped everything in front of them - including a seemingly unstoppable Brazilian juggernaut in front of a French crowd desperate to see Mussolinis fascists lose. With Meazza on the pitch, though, that was always unlikely.
The best player of his time, and one of the greatest footballers of all-time, Giuseppe Meazza effortlessly dances his way into our list of 50 Greatest Players in World Cup History. - sk

W. T. J. S. Kaviratne
Outstanding journalist
Countless are the codes of conduct, charters and statements made by media and professional groups outlining the principles, values and obligations journalism, yet rare are the media personnel who uphold and practice such ethics.
Late W. T. J. S. Kaviratne, our senior journalist, was one such rare individual who advocated and followed the core principals of ethical journalism. He, at all times during his career in the public information sphere, aspired to be a responsible newsman and writer, mainly in print and electronic media.
However, Kaviratne, the veteran media man with loving and placid mannerism and conduct, is no longer with us. His sudden demise on Saturday (May 26) shocked us all, leaving eternal grief in our hearts and souls. He leaves behind his beloved wife, two daughters and son.
He served as the Lake House Ambalangoda Special Correspondent since 1977, chiefly contributing to the Daily News. He was a determined contributor to the newspaper, with a special aptitude in writing feature articles.
Kaviratne was also a popular and respected teacher of English who served at the Ambalangoda Devananda College for a long time.
As a journalist, late Kaviratne continually worked for the benefit of his fraternal journalists. He always struggled for the rights and privileges of his fellow media men and women, for which he formed the Southern Province United Journalists' Association. He was the founder president of the forum, which he held until his demise.
His funeral took place at the Batapola Public Cemetery on Monday (28), with the participation of a large number of people, including a host of regional politicians, community leaders and the media. The public, who came to know about the demise of this veteran journalist, came to his residence at Ilukpitiya, Batapola, in large numbers to pay their last respects.
Southern Provincial Councillor and Balapitiya United National Party (UNP) Chief Organiser Asoka Dhanwansa De Silva, delivering a funeral oration, said the demise of journalist Kaviratne was an intolerable loss for the public as he was a peoples media man who dedicated his life for the welfare of the public.
Late Kaviratne was a remarkable, public-spirited media personnel who instinctively worked for the unity and harmony among all communities in the country. He organised activities and events with the participation of other fellow journalists to promote goodwill, cooperation and mutual understanding among our diverse community, De Silva said.
He was an acclaimed journalist who won a number of accolades for his resourceful media contributions. I wish he attains the Supreme Bliss of Nibabana, he added.
Ambalangoda Devananda College Past Principal Dharmasiri Ginige, Media man Gnanadasa Ranmuthu and Sahsi Kaviratne also addressed the event.

Kandiah Ganesh
Versatile public servant
I first made my acquaintance with Kandiah Ganesh in 2002, during the latter part of his public service career, which was early in mine. He was then, the Vavuniya Government Agent and I, the Presidential Spokesman for President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
Ganesh was one of the key officials who were instrumental in assisting the then newly-elected United National Party (UNP) coalition government to secure a ceasefire agreement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and bring about a required respite from conflict and a five-year-long Norwegian-facilitated effort towards a negotiated conflict transformation.
Ganesh was no paper-pusher. Committed and hard-working, he went over and above the call of duty during the difficult period of the armed conflict, during which he served with distinction in the affected areas. He was a part of a small group of senior government officials, natives of the North, who carried out many programmes to ameliorate the suffering of civilians during the long civil conflict and to ensure them as much of a normal civilian life as possible, regardless of their plight.
I began to work closely with Ganesh since 2004, as the Director-General for Rehabilitation. With the Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) in force, Ganesh, who was by then the Jaffna Government Agent, was my escort as well as translator during our working visits to the Vanni, which also entailed formal engagements with the LTTE under the CFA arrangements. After the boxing day Tsunami of December, 2004, Ganesh was a key official who facilitated the immediate humanitarian response into the then Uncleared/LTTE-controlled and Tsunami-affected Mullativu district as well as the subsequent rehabilitation process.
I was privileged to have worked again, closely with Ganesh, after the advent of the current Maithripala Sirisena/Ranil Wickremesinghe Administration in 2015, during what was his last public service position, when with special Cabinet approval, he was recalled from retirement and appointed Director-General of the Resettlement Authority, of which I was the Chairman. The Resettlement Authority was a key part of the resettlement of Internally-Displaced Persons (IDPs), following the release of private lands held by the military after the elections of 2015.
Ganesh, with his intimate knowledge and long experience in the North, was invaluable in the resettlement process.
He had the unstinting support of the government officials in the North, all of whom were his juniors earlier and he was also widely-respected in the military and security establishment, with whom he had extensively dealt with on civilian and government affairs, during the period of the conflict.
Ganesh was part of a rare and possibly dying breed of senior public servants, who served in the best traditions of an apolitical and professional civil service; who was trusted by all sides of a polarised political society and who served selflessly and with integrity. He is an example for younger generations of civil servants to emulate and is certainly a hard act to follow.

Offences under the Excise Ordinance
Are Police authorized to institute legal action 
At present, the authority of Police in instituting legal actions under the Excise Ordinance, is being debated and the majority Magistrate Courts entertain the plaints, filed by Officers in Charge of Police Stations, whereas the plaints are not accepted in some jurisdictions on the ground of non-empowerment of Police. Therefore, the article endeavours to analyze the legal provisions and the case laws related to the contemporary issue concerning excise offences with the role and the functions of Sri Lanka Police.
Sri Lanka Police
The concept of policing in Sri Lanka started with the Dutch ruling and the Dutch appointed paid guards to protect the Colombo city in 1659. Thereafter, police functions came to be clearly defined by the British with the regulation No. 14 of 1806. Subsequently, Police Ordinance was enacted and the Ceylon Police Department (Force) was established in 1866. However, after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution, Police Department has been re-named as Sri Lanka Police in 2016.
Empowerment of Police
Deputy Inspector General of Police Ajith Rohana
The absolute term of Police is the section 56 of the Police Ordinance, which states:
Every police officer shall for all purposes in this Ordinance contained be considered to be always on duty, and shall have the powers of a police officer in every part of Sri Lanka, It shall be his duty;
(a) to use his best endeavours and ability to prevent all crimes, offences, and public nuisances;
(b) to preserve the peace;
(c) to apprehend disorderly and suspicious characters;
(d) to detect and bring offenders to justice;
(e) to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace and
(f) promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued and directed to him by any competent authority.
Furthermore, the section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, has empowered Police officers as peace officers to take actions to prevent cognizable offences. In addition to the Police Ordinance and the Code of Criminal Procedure act, several legal statutes including Excise Ordinance have empowered Police to perform duties with the issues of public order and preservation of peace.
The Excise Ordinance
It was enacted by the British rulers in 1912, and this has been the law of the country with 21 amendments and Gazette Notifications promulgated by the minister time to time, for a period of 105 years, concerning the offences related to excise matters. The section 2 of the Ordinance defines the excise officer; means a Government Agent, Assistant Government Agent, or any officer or other person appointed or invested with powers under section 8; The section 8 of the excise ordinance deals with the powers of the minister and he can appoint;
(a) Any person other than the Government Agent to exercise all or any of the powers and to perform all or any of the duties of a Government Agent in respect of the excise revenue, either concurrently with or in exclusion of the Government Agent, subject to such control as the Minister may direct;
(b) Officers or persons to perform the acts and duties mentioned in sections 33, 35, and 48 (a);
Members of Police; Are they Excise Officers
In pursuance of the power vested in the Minister by the aforesaid section 8(b), Excise Notification No. 509 dated 9.2.1963 had been issued by the Minister and published in the Government Gazette of 22.02.1963. Accordingly, the Minister had ordered that the powers and duties of an Inspector of the Excise Department under the section 37 of the Excise Ordinance shall be exercised by all officers of the Police Force throughout the island and also the Minister had appointed all officers of the Police Force to perform the acts and duties mentioned in sections 33, 35 and 48(a) of the Excise Ordinance throughout the Island.
In view of the above provisions, the minister has given powers to Police in respect of the sections 33,35,37 and 48 (a) of the Excise Ordinance, and the sections 35 and 37 embody the sections 46 and 47. Therefore, the following powers are vested in Police in terms of the gazette notification.
* Power to enter and inspect places of manufacture, bottling, and sale  Section 33
* Cases in which offenders may be arrested, and contraband liquor and articles seized without warrant  Section 35
* Power of excise officers to search without a warrant  Section 37
* Illegal import  Section 46
* Illegal possession  Section 47
* Fails to produce such license, permit, or pass on the demand of any excise officer  Section 48 (a)
In terms of the above provisions Police have been dealing with the offences since 1912.
How a sudden controversy, AROSE REGARDING Police Powers under the Excise Ordinace
The controversy of police powers under Excise Ordinance was highlighted, after the judgments of Supreme Court FR cases; Everard Anthony and Others vs. Sub Inspector Anandasiri and Others and Udugama and Others vs. Chandra Fernando and Others. Both cases contended the similar facts but Udugama case has been reported as 2011, 1 SLR 192 and therefore the facts of the Udugama case is discussed in order to ascertain the contemporary legal impact that has been arisen in the present context.
According to the petition of Udugama Case, the 3rd petitioner, (the salesman) has been arrested for allegedly selling arrack to a customer (a Police decoy) to be consumed on the premise. The 3rd petitioners (1st and 2nd petitioners are the owners of the liquor shop) position was that there was no such sale as alleged by the police and in any event, the sale of liquor for consumption in the premises is not an offence for which the police officers are empowered by law to arrest any offender or to take any action under the Excise Ordinance.
In the judgment of His Lordship Justice Gamini Amaratunge, the legal issues that were sought be resolved are mentioned in the following way;
The position of the petitioners is that police officers do not have power or authority to detect violations of the conditions of the license issued under the Excise Ordinance.
In view of the position taken by the petitioner, what this Court has to decide is whether police officers have powers to detect violations of the conditions of a license issued under the Excise Ordinance
The petitioner argued that Police have no powers to file plaints in terms of the section 52 (1) of the ordinance which states; No Magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence punishable-
(a) under sections 46, 47, or 50, except on his own knowledge or suspicion, or on the complaint or report of an excise officer; or
Finally His Lordship has concluded the judgment, stating that; although the Police have the power to detect and apprehend a person who had committed an offence under Section 46(g), in view of the provisions of Section 52(1) (a), the Police have no authority to initiate proceedings before a Magistrate against an offender. Such offences, commonly called technical offences, have to be referred to an excise officer.
In view of that finding, the 1st and the 2nd petitioners assertion that the respondents have violated their fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14(1) (g) fails. For the same reason the 3rd petitioners claim that the respondents have violated his fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1), 13(1), 13(2) and. 14(1) (g) also fails. This application is therefore dismissed without costs.
The judgment was delivered in favour of the Police and the procedure adopted by the police was approved at the raid. However, it was held that police have no powers to initiate proceedings in court without a certificate of an excise officer for the offences of the section 46 (g) which are called technical offences.
The situation after the Udugama Case
After the judgment of the above case, a controversy has been created in several Magistrate Courts about the acceptance of plaints under the Sections 46 and 47 of the excise ordinance filed by Police, specially in the cases of confiscation of vehicles which have been involved in the offences.
The defense attorneys made submissions on the basis of police powers as per the doctrine of the judicial precedent relevant to the Udugama case. In a case of the Kaluthara Magistrate Court, the Magistrate had confiscated the vehicle in refusing the submission of the defense. Thereafter the respondent had filed a revision application in the provincial High Court. Police have no power to file cases.
Another case was reported in the Provincial high court of Matara on relatively similar facts and it has also been held that Police have no powers to file cases;
In addition to the above high court cases, the cases filed by police in Magistrates Courts of Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Deiyandara, Hingurakgoda and Galgamuwa, had been challenged under similar circumstances by the defense parties.
The Police Submission
The Police have been making submissions on the following facts;
The concept of Judicial precedent has been generated from the legal maxim called Stare Decisis which means when court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases, where facts are substantially the same or also the maxim expressing the underlying basis of the doctrine of precedent, i.e. that it is necessary to abide by former precedents when the same points arise again in litigation or a doctrine requiring that judges apply the same reasoning to lawsuits as has been used in prior similar cases.
Accordingly, Police argued that the legal issue in the Udugama case was; whether police officers have powers to detect violations of the conditions of a license issued under the Excise Ordinance Therefore the Ratio Decedendi which means the ground of the decision and the point in a case which determines the judgment, is that Police have no powers to file plaints under the section 46 (g) of the ordinance which are commonly called technical offences.
The police emphasized that other facts in the judgment of the Udugama case are Obita Dictems which means words of a prior opinion entirely unnecessary for the decision of the case, or Something said by a judge while giving the Judgment that was not essential to the decision in the case and it does not form part of the ratio decidendi of the case and therefore creates no binding precedent.
Moreover, the case of Lister Pinto Vs. OIC Wellawatta has been decided by the Court of Appeal in respect of police powers under the excise ordinance in 2010 before the judgment of the Udugama case. In the Lester Pinto case, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew has held; The contention of the learned President Counsel was that the learned magistrate could not have acted on the plaint in terms of Section 52 of the excise ordinance as it was not a report filed by an excise officer. Therefore, the most important question that must be decided in this case is whether the OIC/Wellawatta could perform a function as an excise officer. I now advert to this question. The minister under gazette No.13529 dated 22.2.1963, issued in terms of Section 2 and 8 of the excise ordinance authorizes all police officers to perform the functions of excise officers assigned to them under section 37 of the excise ordinance. Section 37 of the excise ordinance covers offences committed under the excise ordinance. Thus when OIC Wellawatta filed the plaint under Section 46(a) of the excise ordinance, he was in terms of the gazette No.13529 dated 22.2.1963, performing the functions of an excise officer. Therefore it was lawful for the magistrate under Section 52 of the excise ordinance to have acted on the plaint;. Accordingly, the petition has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
However the accused petitioner Lister Ponto, had submitted an appeal to the supreme court against the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The decision has been delivered on February 7, 2014 and His Lordship Chief Justice Mohan Peiris has held: having carefully considered the Judgment of the magistrate court of Mount Lavinia as affirmed by the judgment of Court of Appeal dated 31.03.2010, this court is of the view that this matter is not a fit matter in which this court should interfere with the findings.
Hence the Supreme Court has upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal. This decision came after the decision of the Udugama case. Therefore Police made submissions in the Magisterial Courts that the decision of the Udugama case is confined to the offences of Section 46 (g) of the ordinance which is called technical offences and the other facts of the judgment must be considered as obiter dictems which are not bound by the inferior courts.
It was made further submissions that Police have powers to detect and file plaints under Sections 46 and 47 (except 46g) of the ordinance in terms of the judgment of Lester Pinto of the Court Appeal case which was affirmed by the Supreme Court subsequently.
Before the excise notification 509 of 1963, the same issue has arisen in the cases of Cicilin Perera vs Samaradiwakara and Perera vs. Nagoor Pitche and in both cases, the court has decided that the Police officers who were appointed in terms of the powers vested in the minister, must be considered as excise officers within the scope of Excise Ordinance.
Do the Police have powers
In view of the above facts, certain magisterial courts held that Police have powers to institute legal action, but some courts have decided that police have no authority in filling plaints.
Hence a legal clarification is required from the superior courts in respect of the issue in which the officers appointed by the minister in terms of the Sections 2 and 8 of the excise ordinance and the Ratio Decidendi of Udugama and Lester Pinto cases.
Therefore, the decision made in the Matara Magistrate Court Case No.1933 which was mentioned above (held that police have no authority), has been appealed to the Court of Appeal under Case No CA/ML/RV/09/2017 by Hon. Attorney General and the authority of Police would be determined accordingly.

Ariya survives roller coaster round to win US Womens Open
Miami, Monday: Ariya Jutanugarn survived a back-nine meltdown to win the 73rd US Women's Open on Sunday and claim her second career major title in a playoff.
Ariya frittered away a seven-shot lead with nine holes remaining before parring the fourth playoff hole to edge South Korea's Kim Hyo-joo and become the first player from Thailand to lift the trophy.
"I feel great," Ariya said. "I am really excited. I'm really honoured to join the list of winners before me."
The 22-year-old from Bangkok parred all four playoff holes at the Shoal Creek, Alabama course for her second win of the 2018 LPGA Tour season to go with the Kingsmill Championship.
"After you have a seven-shot lead and end up with you having to go to a playoff, I had no expectations," she said.
"If I have a playoff then I'm going to make sure I do my best every shot because I felt like I didn't commit on the back nine. I felt like I had a last chance to make myself proud."
She finished with a one-over par 73 and a 72-hole total of 11-under 277. South Korea's Kim closed with a five-under 67 to force the playoff and had two long putts to win in the extra session but couldn't get them to fall.
Both parred the third playoff hole and they returned to the par-four 18th, where Ariya's superb bunker shot left her with a tap in for the win.
"I have a lot of confidence in my bunker shots right now," said Ariya, who also won the 2016 British Open.
She had appeared to be headed to victory hours earlier, after a birdie at the ninth hole moved her to 16-under and a seven-stroke lead.
"On 10 I just didn't feel comfortable to hit the three wood and honestly I shouldn't have hit the three wood, but I did. After that I kinda played a little bit scared," she said.
She righted the ship in the playoff which went to a sudden death format after the two-hole aggregate start failed to produce a winner.
Not only does Ariya become the first Thai to win a US Women's Open title but she is the first champion from a country other than South Korea or the US since Sweden's Annika Sorenstam in 2006.
Kim, chasing a second major title to go with her 2014 Evian Championship, had five birdies in her bogey-free round.
"I feel very good about how I played, especially that I did not have a bogey today in the final round. That, I am extremely happy about," Kim said. AFP

Australias Callum Ferguson follows up his 192 with 159 for Worcester

Berg also struck early with the ball, taking 3-46 in Glamorgans 227 all out. Colin Ingram top scored with 64, but spinners Mason Crane (4-46) and Brad Taylor (2-51) claimed regular wickets. Warwickshire boosted their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages with a thumping nine-wicket win against Leicestershire at Edgbaston. Batting first, Leicestershire were bowled out for 207 as Olly Stone and Aaron Thomason both took three wickets.
Mark Cosgrove (60) and Colin Ackermann (57) were the only batsmen to make an impression for the visitors.Jonathan Trotts 102 not out and Sam Hains unbeaten 69 took Warwickshire to 211-1 with 12.2 overs to spare. Former England batsman Trott has now scored two centuries in three days, following his innings of 100 in the win over Durham on Friday.
Essex kept alive their chances of reaching the knockout stages and ended those of Sussex with a four-wicket win at Eastbourne.
Tom Westley (88) and Adam Wheater (60) made half-centuries as Essex chased a target of 282 with 12 balls to spare.
Earlier, Laurie Evans 107 not out off 117 balls along with Jofra Archers unbeaten 33 off 18 balls in the closing overs pushed Sussex up to 281-7.

Barrels  of uncles  plus bevies  of aunties
Ah, the Asian concept of an uncle or aunt. That ever present honorific relating to an older relative or someone quite unrelated. Close friends of your mum and dad are your beloved aunts and uncles. And many Asians love them more than the very blood relatives they are supposed to love. In Sri Lanka uncle or auntie, is pretty much used in place of the more formal Sir or Maam. It is, after all, a show of respect for your elders.
Now, for certain, your parents best friends are your uncles, unless of course they happen to be your aunts. But they are without a trace of any blood connections, not even second cousins three times removed or profess any such relationship. So they are simplified to uncle or aunt. It is very much an Asian figure of speech, as most East Asians and Southeast Asians call any elder stranger uncle or aunt as a sign of respect. This extends to family friends and close acquaintances, even without any blood ties.
Conversely, if you are very young, your true companions uncles and aunts are likely to be yours as well, through contagion, and their parents may be uncle and aunt to you. In tradition-bound Sri Lanka, Confucian attributes, such as filial devotion, border on the reverential. And many of these features such as deferential affection towards parents, elders and strong family and societal relationships still do exist among the majority of the population.
In the north of Sri Lanka I am called Ungle, which carries a slightly different inflexion from the young southerners Uncal. They are both a far cry from the lower-middle class Brit who would distinctly address his mothers brother as Ankkil.Theoretically, any male is an uncle to anyone younger than he.
Some of the uncles are so far removed from your family tree that you have to go all the way to Adam to establish a relationship. Your next door neighbour, your fathers colleague, a passer-by on the street who happens to wear a watch just when you needed to know what time it is, and of course your blood-uncles. So you see, relatively speaking, it should be easy to understand that kinship or non kinship included each one of them is a bona-fide uncle in his own right.
Sri Lanka probably has the largest number of uncles per capita in the world. That is why ethno-sociologists have a field day studying this institution. However, it confuses the hell out of them as to why a Sri Lankan uncle is adverbed. For instance it is always Gaston Uncle, never Uncle Gaston. Also, uncle-ness is not associative, mathematically speaking. Your uncles uncle could be your own father. Figure that one out yourself!
I have worked and lived in several Southeast Asian nations including Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong and have done a couple of shorter stints in some neighbouring countries too. I do not profess insight into every Asian culture, but I am guessing the trend is pretty common, if not universal, across the region.
Chinese and Indonesians do it. Malaysians and Filipinos do it. Indians and Sri Lankans do it. Now if you are reading this and had lived or had grown up in an Asian country this will not be news to you.
But it is quite radically different to the norm in the Anglo-Saxon world. To most Westerners the titles refer to the brother of ones father or mother or the husband of ones aunt.
Of course, there are limits on whom you can confer these titles on. Once you get that dream position at that blue-chip company, calling your CEO Uncle would be unlikely to go down as a stellar career move. And make sure that the person is substantially older than you before you start calling them this. No one likes to be reminded that they are getting old, so 30 something women are often less than pleased to be called auntie by 20 something Bimbos.
Most younger Sri Lankans would hold back from calling their friends parents Mr and Mrs as a bit too business-like. But calling them by their first names would be overly familiar and downright disrespectful. Perhaps it is part of our cultural perspective emerging here, because Sri Lankans in similarity to many other Asians, are and always have been overly status-conscious. They would not address an older person by their first name without prefacing it with a respectful signifier of their status.
I remember the look on the faces of two British couples visiting my grandparents estate when my younger brother and sister addressed them as Auntie and Uncle. I do recall that their faces expressed equal parts surprise and delight. Naturally I am quite used to it and find it rather endearing myself. Although I harboured fears when I was around 30 something that I was getting old enough to have the title applied to me.
Most Sri Lankan kids have this weird concept that their Gaston Uncle is a super hero who wears his under pants underneath his pants. And that Hollywood got it all wrong with Superman. They accept the other similarities such as Clark Kent and their Uncal Gaston being in the same journalistic profession.
The most harrowing experience of growing up is when you realise one day that you too have suddenly become an uncle or a grand-uncle to Cuckoo, Chukku or Pippu.
At first you try to deny it. But ours is a small universe and the way Sri Lankans copulate and populate no one is immune to this. Once you become an uncle, your lifestyle changes and now you have to be more responsible and uncly, or avuncular.
Uncles of the opposite sex are called aunties or anties in Sinhala parlance. Aunts are usually appendices to the uncles. They smile a lot, talk a lot and spend most of their useful lives in preparing copious amounts of yummy food. No, they are not called anties because they are anti-uncle. Poker-playing womens libbers will anti-cipate upping the ante with a full house of uncles. But dont ever dare mention the family or gay names of uncles, because the Western world might then imagine they are all aunts!

CICT saves storm-ravaged MV Theseus
A container carrier that sustained damage in tropical storm Sagar in the Gulf of Aden, nearly 2,000 nautical miles from Sri Lanka, has been turned around in just 36 hours by Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) when it arrived in the Port of Colombo.
The 369-metre, 14,424 TEU MV Theseus, operated under Ocean Alliances Asia-Mediterranean service by Evergreen Line, was en-route to Colombo on its weekly scheduled call after Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, when the storm hit. Some of its containers were washed away while others were crushed, scattered around or left hanging along the stacks.
On receipt of a distress call, the operations team from CICT boarded the vessel for a pre-inspection and developed a comprehensive action plan with a dedicated team of ship-to-shore gantry operators and experienced stevedores, after which vessel was brought alongside the CICT berth, by the pilots of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
The salvage operation commenced with an inspection of all damaged containers by a professional surveyor. Thereafter, the CICT team launched the simultaneous lashing and unlashing operation, which involved unlashing the damaged units, lashing adjacent containers to secure them and discharging the damaged units.
After CICTs efficient operation which was completed in less than a day and a half despite the harsh weather conditions, the MV Theseus was swiftly despatched to its next stop in Singapore.
This was the third such salvage operation carried out by CICT in the past three years. In 2015 CICT completed a complex salvage operation for the weather-damaged MOL-Cosmos and in 2017 aided in the salvage of the Panama-flagged MSC Daniela which caught fire 120 nautical miles west of the Colombo Port.
Commending and thanking CICT for its role in the salvage of MV Theseus, Preethilal Fernando, Executive Director of Hemas Maritime (Pvt) Ltd, the agent in Sri Lanka for Evergreen Line said, The positivity showed by your team from the inception is truly commendable and we admire the team work, planning and operational flexibility demonstrated by the team. With such operations, we are confident that CICT will be a catalyst in fulfilling the countrys vision of being a maritime hub in the region.
CICT is proud to have been able to provide its expertise to MV Theseus at a time of need, and is also thankful to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority for providing the safe navigation and berthing and un-berthing of the vessel, said Catriona Jayasundera, General Manager Marketing and Commercial at CICT. We are also happy to contribute to the Port of Colombos growing reputation for operational excellence.
Recently adjudged the Best Container Terminal in Asia in the Under 4 million TEUs at the Asian Freight, Logistics and Supply Chain (AFLAS) Awards, CICT, which commenced operations in July 2013, manages the Colombo South Terminal of the Port of Colombo, the first and currently the only deep water terminal in South Asia equipped with facilities to handle the largest vessels afloat.
In four years of operation, CICT has brought some of the largest vessels plying the Asia-Europe routes to Colombo. Of these, Milan Maersk (20,568 TEU), MSC Maya (19,224 TEU), Mogens Maersk (18,300 TEU), MSC New York (16,652 TEU), CMA CGM Marco Polo (16,020 TEU), Edith Maersk and EMC Thalassa Hellas (each 14,000 plus TEUs) and their sister vessels are now regular callers at CICT.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (05-06-2018)]
THE SUFFERING OF CANCER PATIENTS
The following thoughts are in reference to the letter of Joe Perera which appeared in these columns. He writes about the suffering of cancer patients at the Cancer Hospital. As someone said, If you want to know what hell looks like, go and visit the Cancer Hospital at Maharagama! He ends the letter with a plea, for someone to cure those unfortunate and helpless Cancer patients. It is most unlikely such a person exists though there are isolated incidents of such things happening. Even the Buddha and Jesus did not do so except in isolated incidents. Whether they could but for some reason they didnt is a matter of conjecture.
As such, I feel that the only consolation is to see whether one can at least be able to be in a state free of the suffering of the pain of having Terminal Cancer. In this context, D. Weeratungas article in the Citizens mail on How to cultivate human goodness gives a point. He starts with the statement We believe suffering is caused by ignorance. It is not clear whether he has confirmed this statement experientially in himself. If the answer is Yes, he should be free from all the suffering from pain as he has presumably eliminated ignorance which he says is the cause. If this is so, he could tell us how he came to this state.
In this context, Ramana Maharishi who lived in India about 80 years ago confirmed in His amazing life that indeed such a state is possible. One can hardly believe the incidents that happened in His life except for the fact that His life was recorded on a day-to-day basis and is available for anyone to see at His Ashram in Arunachala, Tiruvannamalai, South India. In His later life, He contracted Sarcoma, and excruciatingly painful form of cancer and an external growth appeared on His right arm. Not only was He immune to the pain but He was unaware of the growth on His arm.
Over the years, I myself have followed His advice on the path of Self Inquiry (Atma Vichara) in my meditation. I have had and I am having amazing experiences which makes me feel that not only such a state is possible but how such a state can come about. Of course, as the saying goes The proof of the pudding is in the eating until I verify such a state as an experiential fact, it will remain a theoretical possibility only.
If one is prepared to go through the suffering of physical pain (without complaining), that is inevitable for all of us, it is only a matter of time before when the uncompromising viciousness (Cancer Hospital, Maharagama) of Karmic Retribution  cause-effect - will act, then there is no problem. But if one does not want to do so, then one should attempt to reach such a state before the inevitable suffering descends on us. Of course, we have no control over the pain that will surely come to us one day, sooner or later but our only option is (if at all) to be in a state immune to the suffering from that pain.

Cut this from your diet to lose belly fat
One of the most common questions people ask these days is how to lose belly fat. Belly fat is actually the most dangerous type of fat - besides aesthetics, large waist lines are indicators of - disease.
According to Express.co.uk, weight loss can be a slow process, but there are foods and exercises dieters can try to speed things.
As well as eating the right foods, it is important not to eat the wrong foods, and studies have shown there is one type in particular that should be avoided.
Sugar and foods high in sugar have been linked to type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.
Many studies have shown a relationship between high sugar intake and increased abdominal fat.
In a study conducted in 2009, a group of researchers observed a group who drank sugar-sweetened drinks with their meals over an eight-week period.
Their diets didnt otherwise change, but they put on an average of three pounds. However, this wasnt all, as participants were found to have significantly increased abdominal fat too.
But how to actually cut out sugar and lose belly fat One of the most popular diets for those trying to cut out sugar and lose belly fat is the keto diet.
A man recently revealed his before and after pictures after losing more than five stone following a keto lifestyle.
Fighting belly fat is 80 per cent healthy diet. Reduce calories by filling yourself up with protein, vegetables, whole grains, and replacing bad habit snacks with good ones.
A great trick is a sprinkle of cinnamon in your morning coffee or oatmeal - the spice has been shown to help stabilise blood sugar. It also slows the rate at which food exits the stomach, which helps you feel fuller longer.

Death-defying cheese rolling race
A champion cheese chaser has smashed the record for the most wins in Gloucestershires death-defying cheese rolling race.Chris Anderson, 30, says he now has nothing to prove after scooping his 22nd Double Gloucester cheese in 14 years.
The professional soldier, who doesnt even like the taste of Double Gloucester, tumbled down Coopers Hill in Brockworth to get his hands on an 8lb wheel of the cheese.He broke the record held by fellow dairy-devil Stephen Gyde, who boasted 20 cheeses before retiring in 2009 to focus on being a father.
Anderson won the first and third of three races on Monday, with thousands of spectators turning out to watch the centuries-old tradition.
It is unclear how many people took part in 2018s event, but the chase is said to attract at least 40 competitors a year.
Heavy rain over the past few days meant the hill was extremely wet on Bank Holiday Monday.
Anderson, who only likes cheddar cheese, skipped the second race but won again in the third despite tearing his left calf muscle in the process. He said afterwards: The kid next to me was pulling my shirt all the way down.
Ive got nothing to prove now, Im happy. There was a bit more pressure this year as there were a few more locals running and as we saw one of them was a bit dirty. When asked about the secret to his success, he replied: Just run and try and stay on your feet.
Anderson will not be competing next year because he will be on holiday.
The chaser has put his body on the line on his long road to success, having suffered a broken ankle in 2005 and bruised kidneys in 2010.
He has dedicated his victories to his wifes nephew Arthur Bace, who suffers from the rare genetic disorder Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia.
Nathan Anstey, 30, travelled all the way from Melbourne in Australia to take part in the event wearing just a pair of budgie smugglers.
He said: Last year was the first time I did it and I knew I had to come back. Its a no-brainer. Its the most exhilarating thing you can do.
Explaining his risque costume, Anstey said: Its an Australian thing, the budgie smugglers, and the crowd absolutely love it.
The womens race was won by Flo Early, 27, who picked up a Double Gloucester for the third time having won in 2008 and 2016.
Four cheeses weighing about 3kg each and three smaller ones, weighing about 1.5kg, are used. The unusual event has been celebrated for centuries and is thought to have its roots in a heathen festival to celebrate the return of spring.

Dwayne Bravo first bowler to concede 10,000+ runs in T20s
Dwayne Bravo has been one of the most sought-after players in the T20 format. The Trinidadian has plied his trade for various franchises in tournaments around the world. He has played for as many as 19 teams in his illustrious career. The 34-year old has quite a few records under his belt. Bravo is second on the list of most matches played by a cricketer (391) in the shortest version.
However, with 427 wickets under his belt, the Windies all-rounder is the leading wicket-taker in T20s. Subsequently, he has turned out to be a standout performer for whichever team he went on to represent. His T20 career started way back in 2006 and is still going great guns. Bravo recently completed his stint for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the prestigious Indian Premier League (IPL).
CSK released him prior to the auction of this seasons event but brought him back using the Right to Match (RTM) card. Albeit Bravo picked up 14 wickets in 16 matches, he had his difficult times in the league. His slower deliveries became too predictable and consequently, he leaked quite a bit of runs.
He was once taken apart by Andre Russell and Harshal Patel which landed his team in dire straits.
He is among CSKs most expensive bowlers with an economy of 9.96. In the event, he conceded 533 runs and became the first ever bowler to conceded 10,000 runs in T20s.
Bravo is currently standing at 10,287 runs in 1254.2 overs at an economy of 8.20. The all-rounder hasnt played for his national team since the Windies T20I series versus Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) back in September 2016.
Bravo is not getting any younger and with the emergence of youngsters, he has to refurbish his skills in order to prolong his career.
His next assignment is expected to be in August when he will take the field for the Trinbago Knight Riders (TKR) in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). - crictracker

England to face Ireland in four-day Lords Test in 2019
England look set to host Ireland for a four-day Test match next summer, with the fixture slated to take to place at Lords in July during the short gap between the end of the home World Cup and the Ashes series that follows it.
The England and Wales Cricket Board has confirmed that talks are under way for a game that, though shortened in length, would still have full Test status and would see 98 overs scheduled to be bowled each day.
For Ireland it provides another chance to show their credentials since they were elevated to the top table last year, having given Pakistan a scare during their inaugural Test in Malahide last month before succumbing to a five-wicket defeat.
England will be able to give their all-format players vital exposure to the red ball before taking on Australia, with the first half of their summer dominated by 50-over cricket; the World Cup, which begins on 30 May and runs until the final on 14 July, is preceded by a five-match one-day series at home to Pakistan.
Though the Ashes dates are yet to be published  only the five host venues of Edgbaston, Old Trafford, Headingley, Lords and the Oval are confirmed  there are expected to be around 17 days between the World Cup final and the first Test.
Four-day Tests, which have been publicly endorsed by the ECB chairman, Colin Graves, were given the green light by the International Cricket Council last year before South Africa and Zimbabwe contested the first since 1973 in December.They will not, however, be used for the ICCs new nine-team World Test Championship that begins in 2019. The Ashes series in England will be the curtain-raiser for this competition, in which teams will play three series at home and three away over a two-year cycle  not all plays all  before the top two meet in a final in 2021.  theguardian

Environment decides existence and extinction: President
The whole meaning behind the wide gamut of knowledge offered to us within the past century is that the environment is the prime aspect, which decides existence or extinction of the future of the human civilization, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in his World Environment Day message.
The message stated: The era which arrived after the scientific renaissance, identified as the development, which offered a competitive lifestyle filled with material abundance, severely destroyed the live connection between man and the environment. We, Sri Lankans who inherited a sustainable mundane lifestyle based on agriculture, embraced a materialistic lifestyle without any critical understanding. We have to logically understand that from the calamity of mosquitoes and insects to natural disasters such as floods, avalanches and landslide, and all the health problems that we are victimized to, including non-infectious diseases, are catastrophes brought on ourselves through the so-called development process.
We cannot celebrate the World Environment Day, avoiding this dilemma of development. The theme for Environment Day this year, Lets avoid the environmental pollution caused by plastic waste comes on stage as a result of this.
This theme forces us to move forward towards an environment-friendly way of life by understanding deeply the threats caused to the environment through our lifestyles, instead of praising the environment by exaggerated artistic expressions.
Understanding that man is also just one creation of Mother Nature and with the comprehension to get close to nature, I warmly welcome everybody to join hands with all the friends of the environment who are marching towards celebrating World Environment Day.

Fertilizer for farmers
The government of Sri Lanka has introduced a number of policies and programmes to increase paddy production since Independence and the Fertilizer Subsidy programme is one of them. It was initiated in 1962 (that is, at the onset of the Green Revolution) and has been in operation for more than five decades. The main objective of the programme is to induce farmers to adopt high-yielding varieties with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in rice in the country, as well as to ease the burden on farmers budgets.
In 2016, the methodology of granting the subsidy was changed and the Fertilizer Cash Grant (FCG) programme was introduced and implemented during the cultivation seasons from Yala 2016 onwards. The main objectives of introducing the FCG programme are to eliminate the overuse of inorganic fertilizer, to enhance the usage of organic fertilizer, and to allow the farmer to make effective decisions with regard to the application of fertilizer, such as identifying the most suitable quantities of fertilizer required for their fields by conducting a soil test.
Cash instead of fertilizer
Prior to the introduction of the FCG programme in the Yala 2016 season, the Fertilizer Subsidy programme was in force from 2005 to 2015. Under the Fertilizer Subsidy programme, three main fertilizers - urea, TSP and MOP - were issued as straight fertilizer and a farmer was eligible to get the subsidy for five acres or two hectares or less per season. Fertilizers were issued on the basis of recommendations given by the Agriculture Department and all fertilizer recommendations were based on agro-climatic zones and irrigation schemes (major irrigation, minor irrigation and rain fed irrigation). Therefore, quantities were issued according to the land extent and respective fertilizer recommendation.
Under this scheme, the subsidy was granted for both paddy and other crops. Paddy farmers had to pay Rs. 350 per 50 kg bag and it was compulsory for them to contribute to a crop insurance scheme by paying Rs. 150 per 50 kg. For other crops, a 50 kg bag of straight fertilizer was issued at a price of Rs. 1,250. The fertilizer was available in the open market too at a price of Rs. 1,250 per 50 kg.
With the change, farmers are entitled for a cash subsidy of Rs. 25,000 per hectare per year subjected to a maximum of Rs. 50,000 per year, under the FCG programme. Accordingly, a farmer with two hectares will receive Rs. 25,000 for the Yala season and Rs. 25,000 for the Maha season. In contrast to the Fertilizer Subsidy programme, the cash grant is purely based on the land extent. The maximum retail price of a 50 kg bag of straight fertilizer, that is urea, TSP and MOP, is Rs. 2,500 and farmers are expected to buy the available fertilizer according to their requirement from the cash grant they receive. Farmers who are cultivating potato, onion, chilli, soya bean and maize are also entitled to this cash subsidy and they will get a cash subsidy of Rs. 10,000 per hectare per year per farmer.
What do farmers think
In 2017, the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) conducted a Farmer Survey to ascertain farmers responses towards the FCG programme and this article presents the main findings of the study.
A sample of 270 paddy farmers from six districts (Anuradhapura, Ampara, Kilinochchi, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa and Matara) was interviewed for the study. The sample represented major, minor and rain-fed irrigation schemes and the low-country dry and intermediate zones and the low-country wet zone. The FCG programme has been implemented since Yala 2016 and at the time of the study, the farmers had cultivated Yala 2016, Maha 2016/17 and Yala 2017. Therefore, they shared their experiences with respect to these three consecutive seasons.
The majority of farmers interviewed for the survey were landowners and the majority of the farmers in Anuradhapura, Ampara, Kilinochchi, and Polonnaruwa had paddy farming as their main income source. However, paddy farming was not the prominent income source in the Kurunegala and Matara samples.
The majority of farmers have not experienced a significant change either in their cultivated extent or with the harvest as a result of the introduction of the FCG programme. Yet, a few farmers had experienced a decrease in the cultivated extent and harvest. The delay in getting the cash grant and the insufficiency of the grant to buy the required amount of fertilizer were the reasons for the decrease.
Similarly, the majority of farmers have not experienced a significant change in usage of organic fertilizer from inorganic fertilizer with the introduction of the FCG programme. The majority of farmers said that they had difficulties in using organic fertilizer though they would like to increase its usage. The main difficulties mentioned by the farmers in using organic fertilizer were the difficulty in finding enough, lack of space, time to prepare, lack of raw material to prepare, requirement of large quantities and lack of knowledge of the preparation and the importance.
Did it work
Farmers opinions with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of the FCG programme and the previous Fertilizer Subsidy programme were studied and the main points highlighted by them are presented in the two tables.
This reflects that better control over time of buying, place of buying, quantity of buying and quality of buying are considered as advantages of the FCG programme. All the disadvantages are related to the delay in providing and the insufficiency of the grant and the non-availability of fertilizer in the market when required.
On the other hand, the advantages highlighted by farmers with respect to the previous programme also could be achieved with the FCG programme, if the implementing errors such as not providing on time, non-adequacy of the grant, and non-availability of fertilizer in the market could be corrected. Further, though the majority of farmers stated that they did not get the grant at the time they required it, the majority had applied the required amount on time. Nearly two-thirds of farmers had used their own money to buy fertilizer, followed by those who had obtained loans from informal sources, purchased on credit from fertilizer vendors without any interest, or purchased by pawning jewellery.
In addition, with respect to the preference, 48 percent of the entire sample of paddy farmers prefer the previous Fertilizer Subsidy programme and 38 percent prefer the Fertilizer Cash Grant programme, while 14 percent do not prefer both programmes, suggesting a new method. Of the farmers who suggested a new method, they preferred any other method that could provide good quality fertilizer on time. Therefore, it can be noted that the farmers are not strongly accepting or rejecting the previous programme or the Fertilizer Cash Grant programme.
The main four reasons for the preference of the cash grant were the possibility to buy when needed and in the quantity they needed; the possibility to buy when needed from any convenient place; less time consumption; and the possibility to buy any good quality brand as per the choice.
On the other hand, the reasons to prefer the previous programmes were its cheapness and ease in getting fertilizers to the field; receipt of the required amount of fertilizer totally; receipt of fertilizer on time; and guarantee of applying fertilizer on the field and less chances of misusing the money.
Cash Grant programme
Therefore, from the findings it can be noted that the Fertilizer Cash Grant programme is not entirely a failure. However, there were implementation errors such as it not being provided on time, non-adequacy of the grant and the non-availability of fertilizer in the market. On the other hand, officials who implemented the programme also were of the view that the Fertilizer Cash Grant programme was more desirable than the previous programme as they were now able to complete their responsibilities with much ease and care and with high accuracy and transparency and could implement it with less time and with limited corruption.
Further, the administrative costs of Cash Grant programme were much less, because it has high initial fixed costs, but modest subsequent annual costs. In addition, the FCG programme is a more environmentally friendly concept as overuse of inorganic fertilizer could be minimised with the new programme.
Therefore, in this context, the FCG programme is more desirable as a concept, which provides benefits to all stakeholders - farmers, the government and implementing officials. It helps to minimise the negative environment hazards as well.
Therefore, if the implementing errors such as not providing it on time, non-adequacy of the grant, and non-availability of fertilizer in the market could be corrected, the Cash Grant Programme would be more desirable for the country and for the farmer community.

Yan Oya resettlement programme finalisation delays
Filling of reservoir postponed for a year
The construction work of the Yan Oya reservoir has been completed, but due to the delay in the finalisation of the resettlement of destitute families, the reservoir-filling process is being postponed for another year. The reservoir bears a water capacity of 149,000 acre-feet and the government invested Rs. 36 billion for the project.
It was learnt that so far, the Forest Conservation Department had not received permission from the Central Environmental Authority, to release alternative lands for resettlement and cultivation, in place of those that were acquired to accommodate the Yan Oya Reservoir Project.
This unwarranted delay was caused due to the non-availability of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report which was due to be submitted by the Mahaweli Consultancy Bureau, according to Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake. He had requested the Irrigation Department Secretary to pay attention to acquire the relevant report released, in order to avoid further unrest among the public. In terms of the projects land officers reports, 114 and 108.4 hectares of land located in Urewa and Wahalkada, came under Anuradhapura district, respectively and 26.3 hectares in the Malporuwa and Kajuwaththa areas situated in the Trincomalee district, were suggested for resettling destitute families. In addition, 1,369 hecares of land in the Kumbukwewa, Bandagewewa, Issanwewa and Omarakada areas of the Anuradhapura district and 336.8 hectares in the Moragama and Indulhitiyawa areas belonging to Trincomalee district, were to be released as alternative muddy lands, thus making the total landscape yet to be released 1,369.9 hectares.
Anuradhapura Government Agent Wanninayake told the Daily News that families whose ancestral lands were acquired, were agitated sans livelihood-empowerment programmes as well as due to problems faced in housing construction, resulting from the denial of essential facilities for which they were entitled.
Project information sources revealed that compensations for 3,816 plots of land extending over a landscape of 4,169 hectares acquired for the reservoir too, had so far, not been provided.
The delays in the execution of the EIA Report is unjustifiable. It would be reasonable if a short period was required to complete the processing of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report in terms of the Act, but lagging behind by a few years, is unacceptable, Wanninayake said, adding that if the Yan Oya reservoir had been filled as envisaged and targetted earlier, farmers in the Horowpothana and Padaviya areas could have been provided with irrigation water for cultivating around 25,000 acres of land during the prevailing drought.
In the meantime, it was understood that newly-appointed Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake had submitted a report to President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to the strategies to be adopted to accelerate the resettlement, compensation payments for land and the granting of livelihood support allowance to destitute families until the project reaches its conclusion.

'Foreigners received land during previous regime'
It was during the time of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime that maps were redrawn to handover land to foreigners without any proper examination or procedure, Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
He said so responding to a question raised by a journalist after he opened a new electricity supply scheme at Bibulawela, Kamburupitiya, recently.
The journalist queried whether a project designed to vest local land to foreigners would be implemented under the Sri Lanka  Singapore Free Trade Agreement as alleged by the Joint Opposition.
Minister Ratnayaka said, we have never planned or redesigned any maps to handover land to any foreigners. Such things only happened during the previous regime. The Sri Lanka map was redrawn only during the time of the Rajapaksa regime. They began the Port City project and tried to grant outright ownership of land to a foreign country. When we came to power, we redesigned that agreement to clarify the position regarding that land which is Sri Lankas property.
The minister said a country marching towards development needed to sign trade pacts with foreign countries to ensure a market for local products. When there were bilateral trade agreements, both countries received special concessions for their exports. Therefore, we should be geared to profit from such trade agreements.

Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe made a clear promise to the Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to issue the gazette notification on abolishing the SAITM parallel to absorbing SAITM students to the KDU, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA Central Committee was happy with solving the SAITM issue by absorbing qualified SAITM students to the KDU. But this should be done without violating guidelines of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
According to Dr. Aluthge several other decisions were made during the emergency meeting of the GMOA Central Committee yesterday. The GMOA will commence an island-wide trade union campaign including huge protests next week if the Finance Ministry does not give an appointment for a discussion on the tax policy that harms professionals.
They decided to take all possible legal and trade union action against the illegal campaign launched by the `civil society against the real civil society in Sri Lanka.
The GMOA will monitor the responses of authorities towards several other demands of the GMOA and will take suitable trade union actions, Dr. Aluthge said.

Gotabhayas Viyath Maga economy questioned
State Minister Harsha de Silva yesterday expressed his concern over the Socialist Market Economy promoted by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in his Viyath Maga Movement.
Dr. De Silva questioned if Gotabhayas socialist market economy implies that it promotes the kind of economy that was introduced in China in 1990s.
A main concerns raised over the socialist market economy introduced in China is that all the dividends earned by the public sector going to a fund owned by the Communist Party of China. The dividends are not sent to the Treasury but to a political party. So the question who owns the countrys economy rises. Dr. De Silva said.
Dr. De Silva pointed out that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa did not define what he meant by a socialist market economy. If this is the kind of economy Viyath Maga promotes, Dr. De Silva questioned, if the Rajapaksas are trying to take the public assets of the country under control of their family or a political party headed by them.
Contrary to what Viyath Maga promotes, State Minister Harsha de Silva said. the UNP promotes a Social Market Economic policy primarily based on efficiency and social justice.
Dr. De Silva was speaking at the launching ceremony of Sathya (Truth) Campaign and the UNP Central Media Unit held at Sirikotha yesterday afternoon.
Meanwhile, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera also made several observations on Viyath Maga. He sees Viyath Maga as a Vipath Maga (a way towards destruction). He also said that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa  if left with any kind of self-respect, should leave Sri Lanka and go back to his motherland without causing disturbances in the country.
Minister Samaraweera said that the electricity bill of a luxury house built near the Menik Ganga is directed to former Defence Secretarys name. If the house is not owned by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, why would the Ceylon Electricity Board issue the bill under his name, Minister Samaraweera questioned.
Minister Samaraweera also said that it has been alleged that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa used army officers to build this palace of a house, while he was the Defence Secretary of the ex-regime.

The Viyath Maga is not (our path) Nanayakkara said responding to a question raised by a journalist about the programme at the Socialist Alliance Press Conference held at the N.M.Perera Memorial Centre, Borella yesterday.
Nanayakkara said he could not agree with the views expressed by some speakers at the recent Viyath Maga conference and said several in the joint opposition agree with him. The Parliamentarian said former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa should be made the Prime Minister. He said the President should decide in this regard.
Nanayakkara said the economic policies of the government have failed and people are undergoing many difficulties .
He said that under a JO government, the economy will be resurrected and peoples living standards improved.

I left Trinity with a win and in good terms - parting head coach Lote Raikabula
Former New Zealand All Blacks seven a side rugby legend cum Trinity College Kandy head coach Lote Raikabula parted ways with Trinity College Kandy rugby team and left to the United Kingdom last night.
Lote as he is very popularly known among the rugby fraternity in the world, in his very first year as head coach brought fame and honour to Trinity College first XV rugby team last year by enabling them to finish third in the Singer inter-school league rugby tournament. They lost only to Royal College and St. Peters College.
Speaking to the Daily News a few hours before his departure, Raikabula said, I am taking another commitment in the UK and I have left Trinity in peace not being pushed like one of the Sri Lankan local media mentioned. Its all false. We won the Wesley game and I was the head coach. The school sent me off with a final assembly with honour.
I left Trinity with a win and I left in good terms with them. The postponing by a week of the schools league rugby tournament clashed with my commitment in the UK. The commitment I agreed to is for a long term. So I cant turn them down. I wish Trinity rugby all the very best in their upcoming future matches, said the 34-year-old All Blacks player who appeared in more than 60 tournaments since his debut in 2006, 20 of which were for the winning New Zealand All Blacks seven-a-side teams.
With five IRB Sevens World Series medals, a Rugby World Cup Sevens title and two Commonwealth Games gold medals scoring over 100 tries, he is arguably one of New Zealand Sevens most successful players. He also played Rugby Union for Hawkes Bay and Manawatu in the Air New Zealand Cup.

I will rebuild SLFP  Prof. Piyadasa
The newly appointed SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said he was confident that he would be able to rebuild the SLFP from the bottom up in a productive manner and in a short time, under the new reform process begun under the able leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He was addressing a press conference after assuming duties of his new post at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo, yesterday. Minister Duminda Dissanayake who earlier relinquished the post of General Secretary, assumed duties as the partys new National Organiser at the same ceremony.
Prof. Piyadasa said since the countrys leaders at the time it gained independence failed to fulfil the aspirations of the people, the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike formed the SLFP to fill that void. After forming a peoples movement by rallying the five forces, the Maha Sangha, physicians, farmers, teachers and workers together, he gave it leadership and put forward a programme to heed their voice.
Thereafter, it was the SLFP which was responsible for making the free education system meaningful, strengthening the production economy and protecting the agriculture sector. The SLFP also masterminded the Paddy Lands Act which strengthened the farming population. It was the SLFP which brought the small-time farmer, technician, and businessmen to the forefront of the economy.
The SLFP, which is a people-based party, would show its gratitude to the masses by reforming and rebuilding it to gain power once again. He said they hoped to resolve all complex problems in a short time under the new office-bearers appointed on a temporary basis.
The newly appointed SLFP National Organiser Minister Duminda Dissanayake said they would all lend their unstinted support to the newly appointed SLFP General Secretary to introduce new party reforms. They were confident of the success of this transformation. He said their detractors were expecting the SLFP to be torn apart on Sunday. But ultimately all their hopes were shattered, since the SLFP was a party strong enough to weather all storms.
The SLFP reforms were being made with the objective of ensuring the re-election of President Sirisena at the next Presidential Election and also ensuring the partys victory at both the forthcoming Provincial Council Election and the General Election.
He said he would request all SLFPers to rally round the party, eschewing petty differences and personal enmities. Since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too has been appointed to the Party Advisory Committee amidst all problems, everyone was interested to see whether he would accept it.
He said the new Party General Secretary Prof. Piyadasa has given the party support from behind the scenes from the time of the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
SLFP Vice President Angajan Ramanathan, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanne, Parliamentarian W.D.J. Seneviratne, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and several other ministers, MPs, provincial council and local council members and their families were also present on the occasion.

The prevailing windy conditions are expected to worsen within the island and around the sea areas during the next few days, while the ongoing showers and cloudy conditions in the South Western regions would also continue further, the Meteorological Department said yesterday.
Accordingly, showers or thundershowers would occur at times in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North Western provinces, while fairly heavy rainfalls above 75 mm could be expected in some areas, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces.
The Meteorological Department further stated that showers or thundershowers may also occur in a few places in the Ampara, Badulla and Batticaloa districts after 2. 00 p.m., with a possibility of light showers in the Anuradhapura district.
Fairly strong winds up to 50 kmph could be expected over the Southern Province as well as the Moneragala, Matale, Nuwara Eliya and Polonnaruwa districts.
Naval and fishing communities were also advised to be vigilant during the next few days, starting from June 6, due to the active South West Monsoon. Windy conditions at sea are expected to strengthen during the next few days.
Showers or thundershowers would occur at several places in sea areas extending from Mannar to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle.
Sea areas extending from Puttalam to Kankesanthurai via Mannar and the sea area extending from Matara to Pottuvil via Hambantota, could be rough at times, as wind speeds could increase up to 60 kmph.

Influenza patients dwindling
The number of influenza patients reported in hospitals such as Kamburupitiya, Matara and Karapitiya had significantly reduced. Not a single patient had been admitted to these hospitals as of June 1, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference held at his office in Colombo yesterday, he said all required medical equipment, drugs, and especially children's ICU beds have been provided to the required hospitals to treat influenza patients.
Rs. 30 million was allocated to the Southern Province Health Services Director to buy the required equipment and drugs.
The only way of preventing the influenza virus infection is by keeping a good personal hygiene. This is the preventive method in the world. No country completely relies on flu prevention vaccines. Therefore, people should follow the advice of doctors and health authorities to protect themselves from the virus, he said.
Consultant Epidemiologist Dr. Samitha Ginige said there is no vaccine or drug to prevent virus infections and the only way to prevent is by keeping a good personal hygiene. Wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowded places etc. can help prevent infections. The droplets that spread the infections can travel for about one metre. Keeping sick children at home without sending them to school, tuition, and daycare will help prevent complications, he said.
People in high risk categories such as older people (above 65years) or very young children (below 2 years), pregnant women, lactating mothers, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases, persons who had undergone major surgeries recently, etc. should seek medical treatment for influenza from a qualified doctor, he said.
Consultant Virologist attached to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha said Influenza A virus was found in most samples tested since May 1 and a total of 159 samples (swabs) were received from the Karapitiya hospital while most of them were of children. This condition is a common phenomenon during this season (May, June, July) every year. Adino virus and RSV are also found. The Adino virus can exist in children's phlegm even for a few months, he said.

Injured Serena withdraws from French Open
Paris, Monday: Serena Williams announced her shock withdrawal from the French Open with injury on Monday just minutes before her scheduled fourth-round clash against long-time bitter rival and fellow Grand Slam icon Maria Sharapova.
The 36-year-old said she had suffered a pectoral muscle injury in her third-round win over Julia Goerges and cant serve at all.
The 23-time Grand Slam champion added that she would stay in Paris for scans on the injury to find out how long she will be out of action.
I unfortunately have been having some issues with my pec, my pec muscle, and (it) has unfortunately been getting worse to the point where right now I cant actually serve. Its kind of hard to play when I cant physically serve, she explained.
She was unable to say whether or not she would be fit for Wimbledon which gets underway in four weeks time.
Im beyond disappointed, added three-time Roland Garros champion Williams who was playing in her first Grand Slam since winning the 2017 Australian Open while two months pregnant.
She was also in just her third tournament of the year after giving birth to daughter Olympia in September.
I gave up so much time with my daughter and time with my family all for this moment. So its really difficult to be in this situation.
The shock withdrawal came just minutes before she was due on Court Philippe Chatrier to face fierce rival Sharapova.
Williams has not lost to the Russian since 2004, winning the last 18 matches.
It had been the most eagerly-awaited match of the tournament, coming just two days after Williams had blasted Sharapovas autobiography for being 100 percent hearsay when it came to references about her.
Sharapova, the champion in Paris in 2012 and 2014, goes on to play a first quarter-final at the Slams since losing to Williams at the same stage at the 2016 Australian Open.
It was in Melbourne that Sharapova tested positive for meldonium after which she served a 15-month doping ban.
The Russian will face either 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza or Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine for a semi-final place.
I was looking forward to my match against Serena and am disappointed that she had to withdraw, said Sharapova in a statement.
I wish her a speedy recovery and hope she returns to the tour soon.
Mondays bombshell announcement was the first time in her 20-year career that Williams had pulled out during a Grand Slam event.
Despite her well-documented fall-outs with Sharapova, Williams insisted she had been looking forward to the match.
I love playing Maria -- its just a match I always get up for. Her game matches so well against mine.
Despite playing just four matches in 2018 before Roland Garros, Williams played doubles in Paris with sister Venus.
They had been knocked out on Sunday by Andreja Klepac and Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez with the American sisters getting a 6-0 bagel in the final set.
Serena had gone into that match wearing her striking all-black catsuit but she admitted she had had to tape her serving arm to try and protect the injury.
Every match has been getting better for me. Physically Im doing great.
I sacrificed so much to be at this event. I can only take solace in the fact Im going to continue to get better.
And I had such a wonderful performance in my first Grand Slam back. I just feel like its only going to do better.
However, her status for Wimbledon where she has been champion seven times, will only become clear once she has had an MRI.
I made a promise that if Im not at least 60 percent or 50 percent, then I probably shouldnt play, she added.
The fact that I physically cant serve at all is a good indication that maybe I should just go back to the drawing board and stay positive and try to get better and not get it to a point where it could be a lot worse. AFP

INSEE Cement to expand in SL with US$ 20 mn investment
INSEE Cement will invest over US$ 20 million to increase cement production in Sri Lanka.
This is in addition to their investments of $ 200 million made so far in the last two years. Chairman INSEE Cement Sri Lanka Paul Hugentobler said that their main aim is to build three Ready- mix cement plants in Peliyagoda, Ratmalana and a third out of Colombo.
Speaking to media yesterday in Colombo he said that their new grinding station is being built in Galle and it would be ready by August. We invested US$ 50 million for it and out of this we spent US$ 5 million for environment concerns.
The Chairman also added that they will invest on a new wood replacement product to the Sri Lankan market which is a first for the industry. He also identified their new TECH application centre also as a key investment. This is a US$ 25 million investment.
Commenting on the current price of cement he said they want a revision soon as their production costs are escalating. We also observe a dip in demand due to oversupply which we expect to reverse when the Colombo Port City project construction gets off next year.
Commenting on the acquisition of Holcim by Siam City group of Thailand he said it was a very smooth takeover since the two companies knew each other. Subsequent to the takeover we had new Board and went for a new branding, INSEE CEO Nandana Eknayake said.

LHI completes coastal protection consultancy project in Southern France
Sri Lankan engineering consultancy company - Lanka Hydraulic Institute Ltd (LHI) has yet again created headlines for its successful completion of a coastal rehabilitation project in Bormes les Memosas, Southern France.
LHI has been serving international markets for over three decades and the grown trust has yielded CorintheIngenierie: a renowned French engineering consultancy company to commission LHI for the rehabilitation work.
This project comes soon after the completion of a fully fledged commercial fishery harbour in SidiLadjel, Algeria. The project also goes on to the record as the second coastal stabilization work received from France after LHIs famous beach restoration project in Cannes in 2013.
Port of Bormes les Memosas experienced damages to its breakwater from extreme Mediterranean waves, needing a large scale structural revamp.
The project team investigated applicability of the latest and most eco-friendly ECOPODE concrete armor units on the breakwater slope under extreme wave conditions via conducting a series of physical model tests at LHIs hydraulic modeling laboratory.
A larger emphasis is placed over assuring structural and public safety from raging waves of return periods upto 100 years. As stated by Dr. Sanjeewa Wickramaratne, senior engineering manager of LHI, this work is a fine example of Sri Lankan expertise being fruitfully utilized in foreign soils.
The company maintains a state-of-the-art hydraulics laboratory with capabilities in engineering design, field measurements, physical/ mathematical modeling; and carries out consultancy work for both domestic as well as overseas clients in the Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, East Asian, African and European Regions. During its 34 years long journey, LHI has contributed enormously to the coastal and water sector with more than 400 consultancy projects completed worldwide.
A significant feature of LHI is that all projects are handled in-house using Sri Lankan expertise. Key project staff consists of five PhD and five MSc qualified senior engineers having ample international and local experience, backed with a technically proficient supportive staff.
LHI undertook 20 major projects last fiscal year including 2D (Flume) physical modeling for coastal protection in Fujairah, UAE, and a coastal engineering study for K. Bolidhuffaru Resort Development Project, Maldives.
Cynosure local projects include feasibility study and detailed engineering designs of Myliddy fishery harbour in Jaffna and anchorages at Dehiwala, Balapitiya, Rekawa and Mawella. Helping out Coast Conservation Department, LHI also completed a detailed bathymetric survey and a sand properties study from Mount Lavinia to Galle.
In addition, the company offered its numerical modeling expertise for the development of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Colombo, and a tourism and recreation development project attached to Dedduwa Lake.

Local Health sector to be worlds best: Dr. Rajitha
The Budget allocation to the Health Ministry during the previous year, was Rs. 285 billion, though Rs. 500 billion had been spent by the Ministry to develop the Health sector during that period. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had also appreciated the efforts of the Ministry, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a meeting with the health officers, which was held at the Dambulla Weera Denzil Kobbekaduwa Base Hospital, last Friday. Provincial Health Minister Bandula Yalegama participated as well.
Further, the minister said that in 2015, the central government had provided Rs. 900 million to the Central Province, while it had increased up to Rs. 6.9 billion during in 2016. In the meantime, Rs. 2 billion had been provided by the central government to the Provincial Health Ministry, to develop the Health sector. Dr. Senaratne said, My ambition is to promote the Health service in the country as the worlds number one. All facilities would be provided to district-level hospitals in order to provide medical facilities for all patients. Currently, heart and cancer patients could obtain proper facilities to cure their diseases from state hospitals. During the previous regime, it was overpriced.
He said the prices of essential medicines had been reduced considerably, adding that it was a boon to patients.
Modern facilities would be added to all hospitals and in addition, 15 new hospitals with all required facilities would be constructed countrywide, with assistance from western countries, Minister Dr. Senaratne said.
Thirteen CT scan machines and 350 ambulances would be imported during this year, he said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne added that the Matale and Dambulla Base Hospitals would be developed soon, with the addition of modern facilities within next two years. Furthermore, the Dambulla Hospital is to be shifted to a new location and a modern building complex would also be set up there.
A sum of Rs. 1.45 billion had been allocated from the French and German governments, for the development of the said two hospitals, the minister said.

Mahindra to dominate EV landscape
The fast evolving EV landscape is witnessing new breakthroughs, new products, new techs being tested and deployed at a rapid pace.
A few years back, Mahindra was just a tractor and MUV maker in India. The Average American would have still lived with the same perception, if Mahindra Automotive North America ( MANA ) had not come up last November. MANA is the first investment in an automotive manufacturing plant in Detroit in the last quarter century.
In 2015, Mahindra acquired the legendary 88 Year old Italian Design house Pininfarina. It surely was the wake up call for the west, as a supposed tractor & MUV making company bought the house which designs Ferraris, Maseratis & Alfa Romeos. Coming back to Mahindras Electric Hypercars, these Bugatti Chiron Challengers shall have the badging of Pininfarina, the unfulfilled wish of the Pininfarina patriarch and founder Battista Pinin Farina.
Mahindras focused EV journey began the inorganic way when they acquired the Reva Electric Car Company from the Maini family in 2010. The Mainis were handed over the Reva after working tirelessly on it for 10 years. In 2014, Mahindra racing ventured into Formula E racing as a founding member, the only team from India. As the MRF Tyres Ad punchline used to go, 20 years back, The Tyres we race are the Tyres you Buy. Mahindra had acquired Pininfarina in 2015 for US$ 28 Million. Their presence across IT, Tech, Automotive, Power, Cleantech, gives them acumen, experience and wings to go seamless across the world.
In April this year Mahindra & Mahindra entered into a joint venture with Ideal Motors Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of the Ideal Group, to assembly automotive vehicles in Sri Lanka.
This is a leap forward for the Industry, adding value to the meaning of Made in Sri Lanka and opening broader opportunities for national growth, said Founder Chairman of Ideal Motors, Nalin Welgama.
In the national budget proposalsfor the year 2018, the Sri Lankan Government has taken positive steps to promote the Electric Car segment, discouraging IC engines (Internal Combustion Engines) which are running on fossilfuels.
Hence our alliance with Mahindra & Mahindra who are being recognized as the leading EV manufacturer today is of enormous importance and significance to Sri Lanka and all of us at Ideal Motors are proud to be part of this revolution!, said Welgama.

A more English literate Sri Lanka
Reports indicate that 1.5 billion speak English and yet, only about 360 million people speak it as their first language. English is by far the most commonly studied foreign language in the world, followed by French at a distant second.
The EF English Proficiency Index (EF EPI), prepared an international education organisation, attempts to rank countries by the average level of English language skills amongst the adults. According to their most recent edition released in November 2017, the Netherlands has emerged with the highest English language proficiency with a score of 72. In fact, the only non-European nation in the top ten is Singapore at number six.
Sri Lanka has very low proficiency of EF EPI score 47.84 positioning us in 61 out of 80 countries. Malaysia is in high proficiency with EF EPI score 61.07 placing them in 13th position.
Malaysian experience
It is interesting to study briefly how Malaysia reached proficiency in English within a few decades after their independence. Perhaps, we may be able to pick up few lessons from them.
English was the major language in Malaysia prior to its independence from the British in 1957. Then, immediately after the Independence, in concurrence with the Article 152 of their Federal Constitution, Bahasa Malaysia (BM), was stipulated to be the national language. All national schools were instructed to use BM as the medium of instruction for all subjects, except English.
According to many sociologists, this decision has caused the beginning of the deterioration of the standard of English language in Malaysia. The drastic decrease in the amount of exposure to English for the students was deemed a setback for Malaysia in its ambition to achieve its Vision 2020 objective.
By early 1990s, the government realised that in order to move forward towards industrialisation and globalisation, Malaysians must be proficient in the English language. By the mid-1990s, the government was gradually urging tertiary institutions to offer technical areas in English. At the same time, Dr. Mahathir, then Prime Minister, made repeated public statements assuring that such usage would not threaten the status of the national language.
Beginning January 2003, English began to be used as the medium of instruction for the teaching of Mathematics and Science subjects in all government schools. By 2009, the first batch of students sat for public examinations in English for Science and Mathematics.
There were reactions from many quarters but the government stood firm by their decision. The Government maintained that it was critical for students to be competent in the language.
In 2013, the English Language Standards and Quality Council was set up to focus on the foundation and structural changes to help raise the standard of English in the country. The result is a Roadmap for English Language Education Reform in Malaysia spanning 2015 to 2025. This roadmap is a time-tabled implementation plan for the systemic reform of English language education in Malaysia. The goal is to bring about transformation of the existing English language education system not only in Malaysian schools from pre-school to postsecondary, but also at tertiary level, and English language teacher education.
The road map also gave due attention to the urgent need to develop English-proficient and self-directed graduates. A paradigm shift is thus required for undergraduates to move away from a culture of passive formulaic learning to embracing self-directed, autonomous learning.
The Roadmap proposed the adoption of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) - an international standard that focuses on producing learners who can communicate and interact in any language, (in this instance, English). It was as a move to firstly, allow the government to view the English proficiency levels of Malaysian graduates on an international scale and to set appropriate targets for the next decade. Secondly, the CEFR provides a common denominator for reviewing and aligning English Language curricula, pedagogy and assessment in universities, while still allowing individual universities to maintain their autonomy.
The first stage of cascade training for thousands of English teachers in the country on the CEFR began earlier mid-2016. Relying on cascade training as its central training paradigm helped distributing to the big numbers of teachers, as its principle is that you train a trainer to train other trainers who then train others. Not only this exponential multiplication of learning helped development process and cut training time, it also preserved the training resources and maximise skill distribution.
The roadmap also included a joint initiative with Cambridge Assessment English. It is one of three exam boards which form the Cambridge Assessment Group, a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge.
The Roadmap provided the framework for the execution of the plans proposed in the Malaysia Education Blueprint (MEB) 2013-2025, for the future of their education system. It is also significant to note that the Roadmap has utilised the findings of the Cambridge baseline study on the teaching of English language in their schools.
Malaysia has now a clearly focused plan for English language teaching which fully aligns with their Ministrys language teaching policy.
Sri Lankan experience
When the British took over Sri Lanka in 1815 they provided schooling entirely in English but only to an elite who were expected subsequently to become administrators in the civil service. The vernacular schools continued to function in Sinhala and Tamil principally in the rural areas.
In 1942 a special committee was appointed with C.W.W. Kannangara as chairman to report on the status of education in the country. Among the recommendations for providing lasting value to the nation given in the report, which was published in 1943, were that (a) education should be free from the Kindergarten to the University, (b) the mother tongue should be used as the medium of instruction in the Primary Schools, (c) English  as a second language - should be taught in all schools from standard III.
The policy of using the mother tongue at the primary level was implemented in 1944 was later extended to the post primary level in 1953. A complete change-over was achieved in the mid-1960s with Sinhala and Tamil becoming the media of teaching in the university too.
The success of the teaching of English as a Second Language in schools depended on the availability of teachers having a good command of the English language as well as appropriate training in the teaching of English as a Second Language. In the absence of either of these, the teaching programme has become unproductive as is evident in our schools today.
There is convincing evidence to substantiate the view that the teaching of English as a compulsory Second Language is a failure in spite of much publicity being given to this programme very often for political advantage.
The original policy of recruiting only teachers highly fluent in English with a sound command of the language as well as with a professional training was noticeably relaxed.
It is quite obvious that Malaysia is far ahead of Sri Lanka when compared with the initiatives taken to develop English education in the country. We had neither long-term strategies nor a solid road map to achieve a set target.
It is high time we wake up and start promoting the teaching of English in schools as a practically useful Second Language. To achieve such an objective, the prior need has to be the diagnosis of the prevailing shortcomings in the English teaching programme and the taking of the necessary steps to remedy them.
In the writers opinion, our first priority, taking a leaf from Malaysian experience, should be the preparation of a English Language Blueprint for 2019- 2030. And for its framework, we need to build a Roadmap for English Language education reforms for that period.
For a start, it may be worthwhile for our educational authorities to take a look at the report titled The teaching of English as a second language - Impact study and evaluation prepared by Sri Lanka / Norway/ UNESCO/ funds-in-trust programme in 1993.

Music  with a message
Zaghloul Bangsajayah is a man of few words. But when on stage with his band members, the audience is psyched to see them perform. When they are on stage the one thought on everyones mind is  Wow this band is smoking! Melodies features Killfeed where the lyrics create that rock ambience.
We started off within the walls of Wesley College in 2009. The five of us from the initial line up were eager to start a band after we experienced some live performances of some major bands at that time. Our first ever live performance was Battle of the bands in 2011 which was held at the Overseas School of Colombo and then we took part in TNL Onstage 2012, said Bangsajayah.
Four American bands-Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer-are credited with pioneering and popularizing thrash metal and they have come to be called the "Big Four of Thrash". Thrash Metal has a huge history. In Europe, the earliest band of the emerging thrash movement was Venom 1979. So as you can see initially Killfeed had a lot to live up to. These bands are huge. Thrash Metal is intense and exciting carrying with it a lot of aggression.
Initially we started off as a Thrash Metal Band, and now with time our style of music has changed and we are experimenting by incorporating some of the different genres into our songs. We are inspired by international bands like  Metallica, Megadeth, Kreator, Death, Kamelot, Anthrax, Lamb of God, Iron Maiden. Locally, Stigmata and Tantrum are two major bands that inspired us, explained Bangsajayah.
Thrash Metal lyrics often deal with social issues. For Killfeed their lyrics are often based on Life and Society. Their music comes out of their life experiences. Thats what makes their audience say  wow this band is smoking! Their music really pack a punch. Their music runs deep and it is diverse because they themselves are diverse coming from different backgrounds.
Most of our lyrics are based on Life and society. Our lives as a whole is the greatest inspiration to write lyrics. Music is a universal language. We are all from different races and communities. But then music is the only thing that helps us share a message as one. And that is where we find peace, points out Bangsajayah.
Bangsajayah says that they are constantly trying to raise the bar and keep on trying to achieve a much higher standard from where they are now. They are always trying to better themselves. Take their act and performance to the next level.
We would like to make more music, and grow heights as local artistes in Sri Lanka. And release more singles and albums and cater better songs by day. We would like to thank Suresh from Stigmata, Andrew Obeyesekere, Tharaka Seneviratne, Tennyson Napoleon, Javeen Soysa, Akila Pieris, and everyone else who have been there and guided us through our journey, stated Bangsajayah.
The name Killfeed was randomly suggested by a friend when they were struggling to figure out a name. Now Killfeed is a household name in houses where metal is the way! Right throughout they never gave up. Their commitment would have been the main reason for their success. As is the usual way some of their critics told them they would not make it in the industry. But they did!
We stuck to what we believed. And worked toward our dreams, there have been embarrassing moments, some quit, and many told us that we will never be known. But still we kept doing what we loved. And here we are, said Bangsajayah
The message that Bangsajayah wants to give out is that to succeed you need to identify what exactly you want. If you believe that music is right for you then by all means go for it! Music is exciting and rewarding. It is exhilarating.
If you believe that music is your way you will never be disappointed, said Bangsajayah.

Muthumudalige Pushpakumara
I managed to interview this affable ex Sri Lankan cricketer Muthumudalige Pushpakumara at the Colts Cricket Club where he is the Head Coach. His school cricket career blossomed in a brilliant way and culminated in him being the Schoolboy Cricketer in 1998/99 season
. Besides winning the main award, Pushpakumara had a bagful of awards coming his way for the wonderful performances with both bat and ball that season. He was also picked as the Best Bowler, Best Allrounder and Best Fielder in the all-island contest. He scored 650 runs with 122 not out against St. Sebastians as his highest. He captured 63 wickets with his off spinners and held 26 catches. Thilan Samaraweera is the only other Schoolboy Cricketer who achieved this feat stated the modest Pushpakumara.
It is interesting to note that Chamara Silva from Royal College Panadura was adjudged the Outstation Schoolboy Cricketer in the same year. If one tried to draw similarities between the two both of them Blossomed and withered, through no fault of their own. Pushpakumara was in consistent form was picked for a few Sri Lanka squads and always had to do the duties of the drinks waiter. He was not guided in the proper manner and more or less became a tourist on those tours. What a waste of talent he was modest enough not to point his finger at any particular player. Chamara Silva was a revelation, raw talent blatantly ignored for reasons best known to the guys up above then.
Pushpakumara according to reports came from a working class back ground in Maligawatta and climbed the ladder through sheer guts and with no malice for those who crossed his path even then. He was always the happy go lucky guy also at home with his siblings.He had a penchant for Hindi music.
At this instant I would like to go down memory lane and see what the papers said about Muthumudalige Pushpakumara.
Malintha, Pushpakumara scores 50s in drawn game reported Saadi Thawfeeq
The two-day game between a BCCSL Colts XI and England ended in a draw at the De Soysa Stadium, Moratuwa yesterday but not before SSC wicket-keeper batsman Malintha Perera and Ananda College captain Muthumudalige Pushpakumara had made their mark by striking contrasting half centuries.
Sri Lanka inflict first Under 19 series defeat on England since 1996 reported Saadi Thawfeeq
It was Muthumudalige Pushpakumaras superb century in the second test at Northampton that saved the series for Sri Lanka and restored lost confidence in the players bringing about a complete turnaround. Sri Lanka were only 97 runs on with four wickets in hand when Pushpakumara played his remarkable knock of 135.
Colts ride high - takes first innings points from SSC reported Lal Gunasekera in the Sunday Observer March 31st 2002.
It was the four-day Premier Division 1 Super league cricket tournament final at the SSC ground Maitland Place yesterday.
The main highlights of yesterdays play was the 81 made by Muthumudalige Pushpakumara. He faced only 9 deliveries and slammed ten boundaries and a six. These two batsmen (Kulatunga and Pushpakumara) made 79 runs for the seventh wicket.
Pushpakumara was involved in another fine 59 run partnership for the eighth wicket with Eric Upashantha who made 27.
Youth receives tremendous boost
Under 19 all-rounder Pushpakumara in Sri Lanka team to Pakistan (Daily News Thursday January 20, 2000) - by Saadi Thawfeeq
Youth received a tremendous boost when Muthumudalige Pushpakumara, the Sri Lankan under 19 World Cup cricketer was included in the Sri Lankan team of 16 players named for the tour of Pakistan next month.
Chairman of selectors Sidath Wettimuny said that by picking Pushpakumara, his committee was adhering to their policy of blooding youth where ever possible.
We were looking for an all -rounder and I think Pushpakumara has the potential to become one, said Wettimuny. Pushpakumara (18) a student of Ananda College and off break bowler. He was picked the best schoolboy cricketer last year and was also the best bowler, fielder and all-rounder.
Summing up Muthumudalige Pushpakumara was a schoolboy prodigy earmarked to be another Mahela Jayawardene, Sidath Wettimuny, Roshan Mahanama leave alone Aravinda de Silva or Arjuna Ranatunga.
What went wrong Where did he lose his bearings. From the interview I had with Pushpakumara although he never pointed fingers at anyone, I gathered that there were no proper guidelines for a rookie to follow, was he there just to make up the numbers At the end of the day, my opinion was that he did not gather much value from those tours other than gathering dust. This was then, what of now Your guess is as good as mine.
Although Muthumudalige Pushpakumara lost his way a bit as a cricketer he has a well-planned strategy for his club.
The Colts Cricket Club where Pushpe has cricketers in the calibre of Angelo Mathews, Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Kusal Perera, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Nuwan Kulasekara and many other top notch players under his purview. Pushpakumara has a high regard for Angelo Mathews as a captain and noted that his experience counts a lot.
Now with Chandika Hathurusinghe orchestrating the orchestra from the top we should see some positive vibes in the future.

Neymar thrilled to be back, at 80 percent
Liverpool, Sunday: Brazil star Neymar said he was very happy to have made a goal-scoring comeback in a 2-0 friendly victory over Croatia on Sunday, but insisted he was only firing at 80 percent.
Its been three months that Ive been injured, said Neymar, with the World Cup to start in Russia in 10 days.
To come back and do what I love the most, playing football, and furthermore to score a goal, is an immense joy. Im very happy.
The Paris Saint-Germain forward appeared as a half-time replacement for Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho as the Selecao stepped up their World Cup preparations.
And Neymar needed just 23 minutes at Liverpools Anfield ground to prove how important he is to Brazils hopes of a sixth world title.
Receiving a pass from Philippe Coutinho, Neymar cut into the area, beating Sime Vrsaljko and Duje Caleta-Car with impressive close control and dribbling, before burying a shot into the roof of the goal, via the crossbar, from the edge of the six-yard area.
But he added: I still feel a little pain, but thats normal when you spend so much time not walking.
I feel at 80 percent of my capacity. After his goal, Neymar made sure to head to the Brazil bench to embrace team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar, who operated on his foot fracture three months ago. AFP

Buddhika Ekanayakas life is inspiring and carries with it a powerful message. Even though he was born with a deformity, he has not let that prevent him from achieving his dreams. Buddhika has no arms or hands. Instead he has two stumps. Yet what he has achieved in his life is remarkable. His powerful message is that nothing is impossible and one should never give up.
If Ekanayaka can write, draw, use a cell phone, send SMS, use a lap top, play musical instruments and operate his own business then one has to raise the question  why cant we with two hands and legs achieve what we put our mind to
This is the message that the motivational program Jeewithaya Aran wishes to convey. This program is the brainchild of Kasun Pushpakumara who is the presenter of this program. And Buddhika Ekanayaka is its star who shines brightly. Daily News met up with Pushpakumara who explained in detail what exactly this program is.
This program is called Jeewithaya Aran which is a motivational program which is music related.
This program is based on the life of Buddhika Ekanayaka, who will appear on this program wherever and whenever it takes place. Buddhika has no hands. He was born with this deformity. However he can do everything the rest of us can do. Even though he has no limbs, he can write, draw pictures, use a lap top, use the cell phone, send SMS, play the Octopad and the Keyboard. He has educated himself and even does his own business. This is because he believes that nothing is impossible, said Pushpakumara.
This is the message of Jeewithaya Aran that nothing is impossible if you have determination and will power. What you need is drive. Buddhika sings songs related to his disability while showing the audience in his programs what he can do without properly functioning limbs.
If someone like Buddhika can do what he can do without limbs, then why cant the rest of us overcome the obstacles we face in our life What kind of a difference are we making in the world We have successfully done this program in schools, tuition classes and institutes. Now we plan on playing at Isurupaya auditorium.
We have also been invited to perform at Angunakolapelessa prison. We are doing this program free of charge because we sincerely want to promote the idea that nothing is impossible if you have the will power, stated Pushpakumara
Pushpakumara pointed out that Buddhika has triumphed in life and that his mother loves him very much having wept over him.
Buddhika even sings about this. Anyone who witnesses the performance can feel the pain and appreciate the strength of Buddhika. Anyone who sees this can appreciate the fact that you can accomplish anything you attempt. You just need to have faith in yourself. In this program Buddhika will show his prowess. At the Scholarship exam the cut out mark was 121. But Buddhika scored 149. So we tell little children that the reason they do not achieve is because they do not know that they can. Buddhika believes in himself which is why he can do what he does, explained Pushpakumara.
This purpose of this program is to remove and destroy all self- doubt. With his will power Buddhika also has the talent. This too has played a part in his victory. He is a courageous person.
Come and see our program and you will be amazed. Please call us on 071 909 606 7. And see our program transform lives, added Pushpakumara.

Present Govt. transformed country into a mature democracy - Mangala
The present government deserves 100% credit from the people for establishing a mature democracy in the country within the last three years, Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday. He also said that despite many persons criticizing the government for being weak, the same traits they identify as weaknesses are the characteristics of a mature democracy.
I dont believe even in the 1950s there was a democracy as what we have now. Anybody can criticize or write against this government. There is freedom to hold public protests just like in democratic countries. Within these three years, two Cabinet ministers stepped down from their posts. The Prime Minister was summoned before a Presidential Commission and he willingly gave evidence before the Commission. There was freedom to bring in a No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister as well. This is what democracy is.
"This is not a weak government. Strikes, disagreements and head changes are not weak characteristics of a government. What we have here is a mature democracy now. Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
Drawing from the investigation presently carried out against the US President Donald Trumps election campaign, Minister Samaraweera said it is the similar class of democracy that prevails in Sri Lanka at present.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking at the launching of Sathya (Truth) Campaign and the UNP Central Media Unit at Sirikotha yesterday morning. UNP Ministers including Gayantha Karunatilake, Harin Fernando, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, State Ministers Eran Wickremeratne, Ajith P. Perera Dr. Harsha De Silva and UNP backbenchers were present at the occasion.
Minister Samaraweera further said that the present government has taken all initiatives to strengthen the reconciliation process . He pointed out that Sri Lanka cannot be economically developed if the ethnic groups in the country live in tension and disharmony. The present government has made an enormous contribution to the countrys reconciliation process.
"President Maithripala Sirisena has visited Jaffna 17 times during his term of office so far and the Prime Minister has visited Jaffna on 12 occasions. Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
The Minister also said that fake news have become the biggest threat to democracy in Sri Lanka as well as in the world.
He further said that certain groups were trying to portray truth as untruth and vice versa. While pointing out that the previous regime was a government that feared the word Truth, Minister Samaraweera said that the Truth campaign begins as a national movement that brings truth to the people.
He requested not to drag the country back to the dark era where the previous regime thrived.

Preserve environment without restraint: PM
On 05th of June every year, World Environment Day is celebrated across the globe to highlight the importance of environmental conservation.
The environment, critical to the existence of both living and nonliving things on earth, must be preserved at all times and everywhere without restraint, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his World Environment Day message.
The message stated: We have experienced severe natural hazards and disasters in the recent past as a result of urbanization, inadequate development projects, destruction of natural resources, and switching from an environment-friendly, traditional lifestyle to a more complex lifestyle with many requirements.
As a nation and as individuals, we can actively take part in addressing environmental challenges by changing our attitudes and even through small gestures that show our inborn respect for nature. Careful consumption of natural resources, proper dumping of waste, tree plantation and environment-friendly gardening, and polythene and plastic reuse are just some of the measures that we can take in our day to day lives, to protect the environment.
The theme for 2018 is beating plastic pollution. In Sri Lanka, we announced a ban on polythene that took effect from 1st of September 2017 in a bid to find a sustainable solution to solid waste management. Furthermore, we need to introduce and promote biologically degradable polythene and plastic, at the same time, encouraging small and medium-scale entrepreneurs to producing more environment-friendly alternatives to polythene.
As humans, we are bound to protect our environment. We are a product of our environment and the demise of the environment would be commensurate with our own demise. Therefore, on World Environment Day, we shall commit ourselves to the protection of our ubiquitous partner, the environment.

Presidents Secretary should be summoned to Parliament: CHR, CaFFE
The Centre for Human Rights and Research Sri Lanka (CHR) and Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE) yesterday said the Speaker should summon Presidents Secretary Austin Fernando to Parliament to inquire him of individuals including politicians who received financial gifts, donations, aids and funds.
CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said the Speaker was vested with powers through the Constitution to do so. He said the Speaker was urged to inquire of the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond Issuance of the Central Bank since none except the Presidents Secretary and the members of the Commission saw it.
He was addressing a press conference held at the CaFFE Head Quarters, Rajagiriya.
He said the original copy had 6,700 pages and around 5.000 copies of the same were concealed from the public.
Thennakoon also said parliamentarians cannot face the public because 118 members were alleged to have taken funds from Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius, CEO Kasun Palisena and from their affiliated companies.
He said a move to conceal the names of these politicians are underway, but they are easy to reveal. Even the Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena could reveal those names, Thennakoon said.
He also said that some argue Rs 12 billion was frozen by the Central Bank. But no loss has been incurred as estimated.
If the money was frozen, where does this nearly Rs. 1,300 million come from Tennakoon asked.
Actually the corrupted money is nearly Rs 33 billion. Several members call us and inquire if their names are in the list because they may have received money from various people for the election campaign, Tennekoon said.

The President's former chief of staff and the former State Timber Corporation chairman, both of who were nabbed in a bribery scheme last week, have been further remanded in custody until June 19th.
The accused in question, I.H.K. Mahanama and P. Dissanayake, respectively, were first arrested in May by officials from the Bribery Commission, who caught the men in the act of accepting a Rs. 20 million bribe from an Indian businessman in the parking lot of a high-end Colombo hotel.
Allegations claim that Mahanama and Dissanayake had solicited the bribe, originally totalling Rs. 540 million but bargained down to Rs. 100 million after negotiations between the parites, from the businessman on the condition that the two would aid the businessman in obtaining the proper approval required to attain certain machinery and building space he needed for projects.

President's new role for LG bodies
President Maithripala Sirisenas plan to transform Local Government institutions to be focal points for the moral development of the people is to be welcomed, albeit with some reservations. Addressing a workshop attended by newly elected local government representatives held at Polonnaruwa over the weekend, the President said all this time Local Government institutions operated only for the purpose of physical resources development. It was his intention to make these institutions centres contributing towards the creation of a good disciplined society by ensuring the moral and spiritual development of the people. In furtherance of this objective a series of moral development workshops will be held for the benefit of local government representatives at provincial level shortly to establish a conducive Local Government institutional structure in the country, the President stated.
At the outset we expressed our reservations as to the success of this project. To guide the people on the moral path it is incumbent that the elected LG representatives be shining examples of moral crusaders and persons with unquestioned integrity. They should be in a position to persuade the people on the lines suggested by the President. In short, they should be in a position to inspire the people to lead disciplined and moral lives free of crime and vice.
But have we got the necessary material among our elected LG representatives who will be able to lead from the front, so to speak, in this endeavour It was only the other day that a recently elected LG member from Anuradhapura was arrested by the police for dealing in stolen goods. It is now being revealed that one of the suspects in the shooting of national cricketer Dananjaya De Silva's father, Dehiwela Mt. Lavinia Municipal Councillor Ranjan De Silva was a defeated candidate, at the Feb. 10 poll. The former chairman of the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha is currently serving a life term for the murder of a foreign national while another ex-PS chairman is similarly doomed to spend the rest of his life in prison for the murder of an Estate Superintendent.
How such types will fit into the roles of guiding and advising the people to tread on a moral and righteous path is, indeed, difficult to fathom. Besides, how they will fit into such educative programmes like workshops too is beyond comprehension. For, there certainly cannot be that many LG councillors among the current crop with even minimal learning, a good majority of them, school dropouts, from every appearance. The quality of some of these candidates could be judged by the fact that their posters put up during the election campaign identified them by their aliases rather than by their real names.
This brings us once again to the perennial question that is bandied about ad nauseam among all right thinking members of the public with regard to malaise affecting all elected bodies in this country starting from the supreme legislature to the pradeshiya sabhas at the ground level -the quality of our elected representatives.
It is undeniable that all political parties nominate thugs and undesirables to contest elections and the recent LG poll was no exception. According to media reports there was a liberal sprinkling of underworld figures and drug dealers that adorned the nomination lists of all political parties. It is the end result that matters to the party leaders who opt for characters who can muscle their way to obtain victory for their parties. The uncouth behaviour and language used by some of our parliamentarians bear this out in ample measure.
More often it is the progeny, or, kith and kin of such types who adorn the lower tires of government such as the provincial councils and pradeshiya sabhas which invariably are the finishing schools for the juniors to take over when the time is ripe for their papas and mamas to leave the House by the Diyawanna. It is natural that some of their traits rub off on the offspring resulting in the indiscipline that we see all around, be it the parliament, provincial councils or the pradeshiya sabhas.
Hence, it is incumbent that the Augean stables be cleaned if the new role suggested by the President for the local bodies is to have any meaning. All would be representatives from parliament down words should be vetted in order to weed out the scum. Ideally, parliament should hark back to the days when it was adorned by men and women of social acceptance and good standing who were beacons of propriety and moral standing. This was the time parliament debate was marked by good humour and sharp wit where the parry and thrust dominated.
Ideally, the two major parties should give the lead in this connection. Parliament should be a place for professionals, academics and intellectuals, like in the case of Singapore, if Sri Lanka is to achieve her development goals. This would also have an impact on society at large. This country cannot afford to meander along in this fashion where mediocrity is allowed to reign on all fronts. The cleanup should begin from the local government level, if the President's well intentioned transformation is to take place.

Print  pick!
Of all genres, poetry should be the most neglected genre in this country. Composing poetry is not proper investment even in the aesthetic market. Using English medium is even worse. When a certain community neglects poetry, it tends to miss so much. That is happening in Sri Lanka now.
With internationally acclaimed poet Jean Arasanayagam bagging the 2017 Gratiaen Award, we can rest content: poetry has attracted some attention.
English literature of this country has been a cornered subject mostly confined to an elitist class who speaks in that language. When the majority shies away from a certain language, its literature cannot reach for the upper ledges. Circumstances attendant on Sri Lankas English literature are no different.
Things are changing, thankfully. If there was a time when bookish customers scoured the bookshops for Jane Austen, Nicholas Sparks, Ian McEwan and the like, that phenomenon is witnessing a gradual about-face. Shehan Karunatilleke, Lal Medawattegedara, Vihanga Perera, Malinda Seneviratne, Elmo Jayawardane and the like have launched moving the bookshelves.
And who deserves kudos for this trend
No one in particular. But the Gratiaen Prize has played some part in that mission. The Prize has grown up over the years with a substantial amount of criticism levelled against it adding up to its maturity. What the State Literary Award, with its share for English fiction, could not achieve for years, the Gratiaen could accomplish single-handedly.
That is something that the Gratiaen Founder, Michael Ondaatje, could rejoice over especially as the Prize celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Incidentally, Ondaatjes initial source of inspiration, Man Booker Prize, celebrates its 50th milepost this year as well. Unlike the Gratiaen, the Man Booker Prize has a tough competition in Britain, of course, with a host of other literary prizes.
Why a literary prize, after all Are they an essential requirement for the growth of the literary landscape Or are they an impediment to the literary growth Whatever the answer is, we cannot control the existence of literary prizes.
Popular fiction hardly needs any market push. The classics need a push with some force. How do you differentiate between classics and popular fiction Popular fiction could not be always the pulp fiction, while classics should not be always the Jane Austen type. The popular/classics division should not bar our reading habit. But we require that to justify the literary awards, especially as both the Gratiaen and the Man Booker Prize have chosen the classical works. As for the definition of modern classical work, a hint of definition comes from an interview with Shehan Karunatilleke published in Roar.lk.
The question is posed to Karunatilleke: Speaking of Anthony Burgess, it was he who came up with this division of the A writer and the B writer. The A writer is primarily a storyteller. The B novelist is a language stylist. Where would you fall
Karunatilleke responds: Youd like to fall in the overlap. But I think Im guilty of being a B novelist, a language novelist. I do spend a lot of time crafting prose. I mean, its a difficult thing to do, and I do enjoy beautiful writing which doesnt necessarily have a plot. But the storytelling, the plot, I find harder. The beautiful sentences come easily to me. I revise all the time. Sometimes too much. Ill first write it to the end. For example, I wrote this in the morning, got to the end of it. Its a mess, but I got the main purpose of that scene down. Ill probably spend this week, as a procrastination method almost, and go back and do the editing and revising. Then Ill leave it and move on.
Sometime back in these columns, Ashok Ferrey expressed a similar sentiment with the term overwrought to describe the similar writing exercise.
Most classics are an offshoot such overwrought or overwritten exercises. They may not reach a wider audience like the popular books since the latter is more given to plots and storytelling. Thats where they need some encouragement like a literary award.
Founded by Michael Ondaatje, a Sri Lankan-born Canadian novelist in 1992, had the first award ceremony in 1993. That Ondaatje set up the Gratiaen Prize with the money he received as the Booker Prize for The English Patient is now known to almost everyone.
The Gratiaen Prize accepts printed books and manuscripts in a range of genres including fiction, poetry, drama, creative prose and literary memoir. Entries can be submitted between December 1 and 31 every year. These are assessed by a panel of three judges appointed by the Trust who are required to short-list three to five entries. The short-list event (open to the public) is usually held in April and hosted by the British Council, Colombo. A cash prize of Rs 200,000 is awarded in recognition of the best work of creative English writing.
When Tissa Abeysekara received the Gratiaen Prize for Bringing Tony Home it did not receive much public attention. Abeysekara passed away leaving his legacy as an eminent artiste but least known for his English novel. But the situation was different when his daughter, Charulatha Abeysekara, bagged the award. That was subject to the more public limelight.
The prize money of the Booker Prize was originally 21,000, though it was raised to 50,000 later in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the worlds richest literary prizes. Bernice Rubens was the first female author to secure the Booker Prize for The Elected Member. Alice Munros The Beggar Maid, shortlisted in 1980, is the only short story collection that remains to be shortlisted. Before 2001, the long list of nominees was not publicly revealed.
Whether the English language has a particular word for those who buy books but not read them or not, we are yet to know. But the language can certainly borrow a word from Japanese: Tsundoku. That is the fate usually prevalent with the classics. You buy the book for its cover and to show off the status, but hardly interested in reading. If the literary prizes will change that trend will remain a question.

Progress of Sri Lankan ornamental fish industry
Sri Lanka being an Island near the equator being a tropicalized country, which is evergreen for all 12 months surrounded by the Indian Ocean and ribbons of rivers flowing down to the sea like an unfolded fan from the middle up country top mountains, by nature we are blessed with water species, specially fish varieties, topping the attention of other continents towards ornamental fish of highest standards of quality.
The ornamental fish industry in Sri Lanka in early 1930s being not aware of the treasure the country possessed had imported ornamental fish as pet lovers and relief for mental stress and illnesses of patients.
Later in 1950s Sri Lankan exporters finding the value of the nature gifted item  the ornamental fish  ventured into the export market, the colourful aquarium fish with striking species of guppies, swordtails, Platys, barbs, tetras, angels, gouramies and catfish. Out of these freshwater species exported from Sri Lanka, about 60  70% consists of famous fancy guppies, highly recognized in international markets due to the strength and diversity of the particular fish species when compared to other exporting nations.

There are about 250 species of marine fish and more than hundred species of marine invertebrates to choose from. However, the restrictions being placed on the export and sale of wild caught species with the increasing concern of conservation Supplies mainly come from Natural environments eg. wild caught marine fish and invertebrates and from captive breeding. The major diving sites to catch ornamental fish in Sri Lanka are Kalpitiya, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Bentota, Weligama, Tangalle and Trincomalee.
A conducive climate and the availability of coral reefs, sand bars, lagoons around the country as well as inland water bodies such as streams, rivers and reservoirs provide the ideal ground for breeding of marine, brackish water and freshwater species in Sri Lanka. This is the very reason why Sri Lankan ornamental fish are in high demand and are exported all over the world. Marine fish and invertebrates are collected by experienced scuba divers without the use of any chemicals and carefully quarantined to guarantee the best quality when they reach the customer.
A Majority of ornamental fish production targets the export market, however, those not up to international quality standards are sold at the local market. There are around 45 established exporters in this sector.
Key markets supplied to are the USA, Japan, UK, Germany, France, Middle East, Korea, South Africa etc.
The Scuba divers adheres to Governments rules, exporters to proper quarantine practices, The Wild Life Act is implemented, and training programs are conducted for breeders and fish farmers. Researches and development are in process for new varieties by National Aquatic Resource and Research Agency and National Aquaculture Development Authority. The Sri Lanka Export Development Board is currently developing quarantine facilities for exporters to ensure minimal health issues in ornamental fish exports.
The relevant Government Authorities penetrate that for the Dollars to fall into Sri Lanka by this industry that the newly constructed road system and highways, the airport in Hambantota and Island-wide information and training centres are well provided. Also, sees to the Health Certificate from the Dept. of Animal Quarantine), Certificate of Origin (Dept.of Commerce), GSP Form A for Marine Fish or Plants (Dept of Commerce), Permit for Restricted Species (Dept. of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Water Quality Certificate from NARA/ITI are obtained before sailing beyond the horizon.
Sri Lanka won 30 awards for the best and new varieties of various species at the Aquarama 2013) International Ornamental Fish Competition held in Singapore indicating the professionalism in fish breeding.

Pug with no eyes has her very own guide dog
An adorable pug who has no eyes gets to run around without any problems thanks to having her very own guide dog.
Nine-year-old Rosie was born with just one eye but had it surgically removed in 2015 due to having a permanently blocked tear duct.
The blind pup, who was rescued by Jadie Cooley when she was one-and-a-half, bounced back just one day after her surgery  going on walks and navigating furniture with the help of her furry friend Diesel.
Now Rosie always stays close to 13-year-old eurasier Diesel who was also rescued by Jadie when he was nine years old.
The pugalier, a pug and Cavalier King Charles spaniel mix, uses her smell to follow Diesel everywhere  even when he leads her astray.
Carer and dog walker Jadie was advised by people to put Rosie down when she started suffering with her sight, but she refused, saying that Rosie was a resilient pooch  and is now proof of what a great life blind dogs can lead with the support of a loving pack.
The 26-year-old said: I broke down when I went to pick Rosie up after her operation.
It was such a shock seeing her with no eyes even though I knew it was coming. I was sad for her. But after just a day she was getting around like she normally would. She gets around the house  although we cant really move any furniture. And she loves going on walks. She just follows around Diesel. Hes like her seeing eye dog. Theyre a pair of sweet oldies. Theyre a funny looking couple but theyre great together. Theyve always been so close. Diesel does lead her astray sometimes and takes her off to places she shouldnt really go. Then you see the panic on her face when she realises shes too far away from me. People told me before Rosies surgery that maybe the best thing would be to just put her down but they have all regretted it now theyve seen how well shes doing. She is an example of how dogs can cope with losing their sight. She does great. Shes a bit unsure about coming down the stairs in the garden so I built her a ramp and she just splays her front legs and slides down it.
Jadie, who is a carer for her 43-year-old mum Lisa Ross, says that since Rosie lost her sight, her smell has become even more heightened  and she now knows where absolutely everything is and can sense another dog walking on opposite street from her.
A lot of people say to me Im sure she can still see but shes got no eyes so she definitely cant, said Jadie.
Rosie has always been really playful but it is a struggle to find toys for blind dogs so I cut a hole in a tennis ball and put a little bell in there so she can hear it. She loves it.
Odd couple Rosie and Diesel share their home with two Brussels griffon pups Mei, 13 months, and Hanzo, one.
Jadie said that while Diesel and Rosie have their age and wisdom in common, the youngsters do their bit by keeping things fun.
And the dog lovers mum has her own furry foursome  one-eyed pug Lily, four, two-year-old pug Luna, leonberger Blaze, six, and Brussels griffon-pug cross Eddie, 11 months.
All eight dogs love nothing more than spending time together and going out for long walks with Jadie. As well as having Diesel to follow around, it is also having the support of her mishmash pack of pups that keeps Rosie so happy and energetic since losing her sight.Jadie said: Rosie was born with one eye but the tear duct was blocked so her eye wasnt getting the lubrication it needed. It was slowly getting more and more worn down. Her eyesight was going and it was really hurting her. Diesel used to sit and lick it all the time to try to make her feel better. It was really sweet. After a few trips to the vet, I decided to go ahead with the surgery. It was an easy decision to make because I just couldnt watch her suffering anymore. She is such a great dog, everyone loves her when they meet her. She is a lovely little thing. I got her from a rescue but I dont know about what she went through in the past. She was actually a surprise from my mum. I just came home one day and she was there. And Diesel was actually in a seven-day kill shelter in Ireland but we saved him. We didnt know anything about him at all but he arrived in a week and he is such a good boy. Rosie and Diesel have been close ever since we got them but all eight of the dogs are the best of friends. We have always had lots of dogs  were a bit dog mad. Because Im my mums carer, I take my four around to see hers a lot and they all go on walks together.
He adds, Sometimes the younger ones get on Rosie and Diesels nerves but they definitely keep them young. The older ones will join in with playing when they fancy it. Without the pups I dont know if Rosie and Diesel would still be here.

Railway union threatens to strike
The Railway Technical Service Trade Union Committee states that they will halt train services for seven days if a written plan is not provided to resolve the salary anomaly issue. The deadline for the submission of the written plan by authorities was scheduled for yesterday.
The Railway Technical Service Trade Union Committee previously staged a 48-hour token strike from May 29 based on three demands including a 12.1 salary increment.
A Cabinet paper was approved before to meet the salary anomalies of the technical officers and they were raised from the primary position to the secondary position. This created a conflict among the staff when the technical officers did not follow the orders of the senior officers. Later, we managed to move on to the next level by getting a Cabinet paper approved and along with it a part of our salaries were increased. The current strike which is carried out by the Railway Technical Service Trade Union Committee is to increase their salaries as well, said the President of the Station Masters Union and the Convener of the Operating and Supervisory Service Managers Union Janaka Fernando.

Rs.80bn allocated for Gamperaliya project
Rs. 80 billion has been allocated to the Gamperaliya project which is focused on village development, Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
Gamperaliya which is a rapid development project will be launched in August this year. The project aims at rapid development in villages in the next 18 months of the governments term. Minister Samaraweera said that the government will also launch the Enterprise Sri Lanka Loan Scheme on June 22, 2018.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka Loan Scheme is one of the main proposals made in the budget to help entrepreneurs. The Minister was speaking at the launching ceremony of the UNP Central Media Unit and the Sathya (Truth) programme held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters last afternoon.
Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasa who was also was present on the occasion along with other UNP Ministers, State Ministers and backbenchers addressed the gathering.
Minister Kariyawasam said that the UNP will take measures to grant Samurdhi relief to around 150,000-200,000 persons who were deprived of the facility due to political victimisation. Minister Kariyawasam pointed out that these people were deprived of Samurdhi relief solely because they were UNP supporters.
Thus, he said, the wrongdoings will soon be corrected and all those who were deprived of their Samurdhi benefits would receive it.

Saluting stalwarts
Cinema artistes of yesteryear had a memorable experience on May 15 when they gathered at the National Film Corporation (NFC) to acknowledge their increased monthly allowances.
The allowance these senior artistes received was increased to Rs 5000 through an order given by Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
A set of senior cinema artistes representing the fraternity had the privilege of receiving their allowances from President Maithripala Sirisena who graced the occasion with the ministers Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Higher Education and Cultural affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
In 1987 President J R Jayawardene introduced the concept of offering an allowance to senior cinema artistes. The amount was increased to Rs 2000 in 1998. This was further increased to Rs 5000 on May 15, 2018 after 20 years.
Alexander Fernando of Saradiyelge Putha fame was the first to receive his allowance pack from the President. He gestured with joy to his fans in the audience while being escorted back to his seat. Joe Livera of Karate Joe fame who has gracefully aged was next in line and he was followed by the rest of the artistes.
Alex and Joe both were wrestlers before entering Sinhala cinema as actors. Alexander Fernando has represented Sri Lanka as a wrestler at the Commonwealth Games held in Perth, Western Australia in 1962.
Film songs Usi Usi None (Hithamithura) and Yanavita Parae (Yakadaya) blended with Alexs performances are still very much popular among people in the country.
These senior artistes who sweated to add value to Sinhala cinema for decades were happy to mingle with their fans after the event.
Prior to the event the President unveiled a photograph of the late Dr D B Nihalsinghe who was the first CEO/General Manager of the Film Corporation when it was commissioned in 1972 by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
With Nihalsinghes leadership towards implementing the Governments Cinema Act, the local cinema industry thrived at that era.
NFC Chairman Sitendra Senaratne in his speech expressed regret for the long delay in unveiling a picture of Dr D B Nihalsinghe at the NFC premises. He commended Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandaras initiative of increasing the monthly allowance for the cinema artistes of yesteryear.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe under whose purview the NFC now functions said with the blessings of the President he is determined to implement the committee report submitted to the President by stakeholders of the Sri Lankan cinema to uplifting local cinema.
Artistes are unofficial legislators. After Shakespeare did Merchant of Venice the whole of Europe, India and our country was compelled to change legislation for the betterment of the people and a just society. Artistes are magically endowed with such power, said the Minister.
He said any country must protect its artistes.
NFC must evolve to develop the local cinema industry. A long term strategy would be to fine-tune school and university curriculums to encompass means of appreciating art, he added.

Samsung crossed indian Rs 50,000 crore business in India
Samsung India crossed the Rs 50,000-crore sales milestone in 2016-17 as per the just published company filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), consolidating its position as the countrys largest pure-play consumer goods MNC.
The Korean giants total income, including turnover and other income, grew by 15.5% to Rs 55,511.9 crore in FY 2017 from Rs 48,053 crore in the previous year despite the Chinese companies making serious inroads into the Indian smartphone market.
In fact, Samsungs mobile business in 2016-17 was higher than the combined sales of the top Chinese and Indian smartphone makers together, including Xiaomi, Oppo, VivoNSE 0.00 %, Micromax and Intex in the year under review. It was almost three times that of Apple India.
Samsungs smartphone business grew sales by 26.7% to Rs 34,261 crore, while the home appliance business grew by 12% to Rs 6,395.6 crore. The companys television business remained stagnant at Rs 4,481.2 crore even though Samsung retained market leadership.
The companys net profit, however, grew at a faster pace of 38% to Rs 4,156.2 crore (Rs 3,010.4 crore) which industry analysts attributed to more focus on premium models across smartphones and consumer electronics which have higher margins.
Samsung, in its filings, said the Make for India initiative, through which most of the products were designed and developed with the Indian consumers needs in mind, has been a huge success and a big factor behind the growth.
All the businesses at Samsung India improved their gross profitability with the television business more than doubling it and home appliance business almost trebling it. The mobile phone business was the largest contributor to gross profit having grown by 44% in FY17 at Rs 5,005.9 crore.
A Samsung India spokesperson said calendar year 2017 was a record year in terms of sales, both mobile and consumer electronics, on the backdrop of robust growth in 2016-17. We continue to see strong growth for our businesses and expect to cross $10 billion in revenues this year in India, he said.

SDB to call EOI for Dedduwa next week
The Southern Development Board (SDB) will be calling for Expressions of Interest (EOI) next week to develop the proposed Dedduwa tourism zone.
A highly placed official told the Daily News, SDB is working on the process at present and the EIA and financial feasibility study will also be completed within the next few months.
Located to the east of Bentota, Dedduwa is an area rich in water bodies, marshy lands and paddy fields and a dream of biodiversity enthusiasts.
The government plans to work along with the private sector  bringing in responsible investors and investments to Dedduwa which is being touted as the islands biggest tourism project. The plan is to transform a large swathe of the wetlands of Dedduwa into one of Asias top three up-market tourism zones, the official said.
The project to be launched by the Southern Development Board and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) will be in line with Mayakoba in Mexico- a well-known global tourism zone with a series of interconnected resort islands, making ample use of the locations natural ecology.
Tourism is one of the thrust areas identified by the government for economic development in the provinces. In this context, key tourism corridors including the Trincomalee/Pasikudah corridor, the Batticaloa/Arugam Bay corridor, the Moneragala/Ella corridor, the Chilaw/Kalpitiya zone and the Dedduwa Lake/Akurala beach will be developed to give a fillip to the industry.
The Dedduwa Lake project covering 1,800 hectares of wetland lies to the east of the present Bentota Holiday Resort. The development plan provides it to be linked by the re-opening of old waterways to Madhu Ganga, 20 kilometers to the south and also developing the area surrounding the Dedduwa Lake. The project will include the development of boutique hotels and water based tourism activities, while safeguarding the environment in the area.
Through the Dedduwa project, the government plans to create high-end jobs for the youth, in keeping with the requirements of the future and also to ensure economic development benefiting the communities along the river bank instead of looking at only the communities of the coastal belt. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has discussed about this project on many occasions since the projects outline was announced in the Vision 2025 report. The PM has stressed that the project should be environmentally successful, sustainable and viable one that this country can be proud of.
The governments plan is to get more visitors with high spending power. With the fast developing economies in India and China, we expect, an increasing number of up-market tourists to visit the island over the next few years. The tourist arrivals are estimated to increase by almost three-fold to 4.5 million by 2020. The tourism industry remains a major foreign currency earner in the economy contributing over USD 3.5 billion in earnings through over two million tourist arrivals.
The Vision 2025 stated, The country needs a transformation in the tourism strategy to increase investments and employment. Poor coordination between Government ministries, institutions and stakeholders have hampered the progress of the industry.

A secret vote will be taken up in Parliament today to elect a Deputy Speaker, Parliament Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekara said.
He told the Daily News that ballot boxes and other arrangements necessary for a secret vote will be facilitated today.
The SLFP has proposed the name of National List MP Angajan Ramanathan, while the UNP has decided to field Monaragala District MP Ananda Kumarasiri for the Deputy Speaker post.
The Joint Opposition has decided to propose the name of Gampaha District MP Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle.
The post fell vacant following the resignation of Thilanga Sumathipala, who crossed over from the Government to the Opposition with another 15 SLFP MPs on May 8.
As per the initial UNP-SLFP agreement in 2015, the post of Deputy Speaker should be given to an MP from the SLFP. The TNA at a Party Leaders Meeting held on May 22 reportedly objected to the nomination of MP Ramanathan for the post.
If Dr. Fernandopulle is elected to the post, she will be the first female Deputy Speaker in the Sri Lankan Parliament. The election of the Deputy Speaker will commence soon after the oral questions round in Parliament when it meets at 1 pm today.
Parliament Assistant Director (Administration) Janakantha De Silva pointed out the last secret vote was taken in April 2004 to elect the Speaker when the names of both W.J.M. Lokubandara and D.E.W. Gunesekara were proposed for the post. The sittings went on till around 11 pm and three rounds of vote had to be conducted as it was a tie at the previous two occasions, he recollected.

SLIM inaugurates Strategic Brand Management Diploma for 2018
A Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) is the foremost strategic branding qualification in Sri Lanka introduced by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing.
DSBM students are bestowed with the knowledge on theories of Branding and how to apply that knowledge on the Brands that they work on. A unique and integral part of the SLIM DSBM program is that students have to carry out a practical brand unveiling session as their integrated assignment.
The 12 month part time DSBM program is ideal for young executives interested in branding, trainee brand managers and professionals/marketers in the corporate sector as well as entrepreneurs ho want to develop brands to the nation.
SLIM had the first inauguration of the Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) for 2018 at SLIM Home, which was attended by a cross section of prospective DSBM students and personnel in the corporate sector.
SLIM President Pradeep Edward, the CEO of Lanka Hospital Diagnostics, said that DSBM endows necessary skills in marketers to build valuable brands by utilising internationally proven, innovative branding strategies and best practices.Branding not only helps position products and services but also individuals. One specialty of SLIM DSBM is that the students are able to experience practical aspects of learning.
SLIM Vice President Education, Suranjith Swaris shared a special message with the prospective students. In his speech, he demonstrated the power of branding and its manipulative effect on consumers. Branding is a vital tool which marketers can use to surpass competitors and have an edge over rival products. Brands such as Fedex, Coca Cola and Nike have made unique reputations.
They have become top-of-the-mind brands, while earning reputation and recognition. As the National body for Marketing we want you to develop many brands to the Mother Nation.
Lanka Grills Proprietor Remo Issac Rajamoney who is a SLIM-DSBM past student attending the inaugural session made an insightful presentation on how the DSBM programme helped him to excel as an entrepreneur and start his own brand, Lanka Grills.
SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake expressed, We enhanced the practical value and real world application of DSBM by identifying industry needs to ensure that we produce marketers who could cater to the demands of modern marketing and branding.

Speaker receives previously unreleased sections of Bond Commission report

This morning, sections C350 and C360 of the Bond Commission report were handed over to Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya by the President's Secretary.
The president made the report public back in January but a significant part of it, including the aforementioned sections, were not released. The release of these sections comes after
Sections C350 and C360, part one and two of the "Forensic Report on Communication Information Analysis", are said to contain phone records that the CID collected of conversations between individuals connected to Perpetual Treasuries Limited. Allegedly implicated individuals include Perpetual Treasuries owner Arjun Aloysius, politicians, religious leaders, members of civil society, and journalists.
The release of these sections comes after pressure from various groups including the Campaign for Free and Fair Eletions (CaFFE) on the Speaker and the President's Secretary to do so.

Speaker stresses on the need for Constitutional change
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday stressed on the need to move ahead with changes to the constitution in order to ensure a sustainable peace and prevent armed conflict in future.
Addressing the International Steering Committee of the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict held at the Ramada, Colombo, on the Importance of Prevention rather than Countering Armed Conflicts, the Speaker asked for a consultative bottom-up process which would also involve changes to the constitution; establishment of permanent peace, empowered independent institutions; law reform; adopting good governance practices; and the nurturing of a society that respects individual rights, and acknowledges and appreciates the importance of resolving problems through means other than conflict  that is, through consensual approaches and democratic means, in a spirit; of tolerance, accommodation and compromise  are essential to ensure prevention and non-recurrence of conflict.
He further explained that the National Unity Government after 2015, had taken a victim-centric, consultative and bottom-up approach to reconciliation and healing, with the clear objective of ensuring non-recurrence of conflict, but the challenges along the way were many.
The current constitutional reform process, the Speaker said was a bottom-up and all-inclusive process aspiring to address problems of the minorities, ensure the equitable and just sharing of power and resources among all people of Sri Lanka, and address discriminatory provisions in the existing constitution.
It is hoped that a new constitution will address social inequalities and deliver on a promise of social justice. The Tamil National Alliance, the main Opposition Party in Parliament is an active participant in these processes. We have thus come a long way since the end of the conflict, and representatives of all communities are active stakeholders in shaping Sri Lankas future.
The key however, he noted, was to have all take individual ownership in preventing conflict,
Parents, teachers, the media, religious leaders, business leaders, trade unionists, community leaders, politicians, and each and every individual human being have a role to play in ensuring the prevention of conflict at a micro and macro level. It is not something a Government alone can do at national level, through top-down approaches, regulations, orders, strictures and censorship.
To seek ways to ensure that each human being is driven by his or her conscience to care for others, to be concerned about others, to respect others and treat each and every one with dignity, and share a vision of a better class room, a better school, a better community, a better work place, a nation, and a better world where every human being is considered equal; and his or her individual rights are respected, valued and upheld; where development is sustainable and inclusive; and the rule of law is impartial, he said.
We in Sri Lanka are still looking for answers observed the Speaker as he spoke of the importance of international organisations and other stakeholders look for ideas, and methods and tools that schools, communities, States, media organisations, as well as individual citizens can use to identify and respond to warning signs as a way to pre-empt the eruption of violence. Learning from each other, and sharing best practices can be important in this regard.
Ending on a positive note in Sri Lankas journey towards preventing conflict he highlighted the example of the JVP, a political party which was the protagonist in the 1971 and 1987 uprisings was now acting as custodians of democratic values and institutions and watchdogs against corruption.
I believe the JVP stands as resounding proof of the transformative power of individuals and organisations when an opportunity is granted for this kind of change and reform, the Speaker said.

Avengers: Infinity War
Superhero overdose !
Superhero fans were in for a treat as Marvel unspooled 2012s Avengers. The success of the Joss Whedon direction spawned 2015s Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2018s Avengers: Infinity War.
The latest movie is a bigger and more ambitious project. However as the saying goes that too many cooks spoils the broth, too many superheroes, action, plots and cinematic features inserted into one production causes a lot of confusion.
Two parallel plots drive Avengers: Infinity War. These two plots are destined to collide by destiny itself. Thanos, the Mad Titan, on a quest to unite the six Infinity Stones, which, when embedded in the Infinity Gauntlet, gives the owner the power to kill half the universe with a snap of his fingers.
Like almost all the other Marvel villains Thanos too believes that he is bestowing kindness on living beings by wiping out every weak race from the universe. Thor is the first avenger to enter the picture as he encounters Thanos plan abroad his ship with Loki. He escapes from his enemy to be rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy. They team up to find a way to stop Thanos. Meanwhile another team  Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spiderman  go after Thanos after being warned by his arrival by Bruce Banner, and a couple of Thanos henchmen.
A third party is at work in Wakanda as Steve Rogers brings together the Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, Bucky and TChalla. Their task is to defend Vision who is in possession of the Mind Stone, the last piece of the puzzle that Thanos wants to get his hands on.
Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo Avengers: Infinity War should be commended for its special effects. The details of the characters are finely brought out in the visuals so that they seem larger than life to the viewers. The biggest drawback is probably in packing too much details, characters and incidents into one movie. This not only causes misunderstandings but also flows along at a lazy pace with many loopholes.
The biggest strength of the movie is the characteristics developed by the previous Marvel movies. Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther, Black Widow, Captain America, The Hulk, The Guardians of the Galaxy etc have become some of the most well loved characters in the Hollywood scene by now. Therefore they have a great fan following. Marvel enthusiasts flock to theaters to catch even a few seconds glimpse of their favourites when they have been included in a production.

Tug-of-war for Rajanganaya Project continues
As a result of the tug-of-war between the Irrigation Ministry, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and Rajangane farmer organisations, consequent to recent farmers protests in the Thambuttegama town, the realisation of the proposed Thambuttegama Drinking Water Supply Project had been hindered.
Following the said protests opposing the proposal to utilise water from the Rajanganaya reservoir to feed the project, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) suspended all proceedings of the drinking water project on the directions of Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake.
However, at present, as the Anuradhapura GA had withdrawn his directive, the matter has been left to be settled among the concerned parties.
The Chinese Government had offered a loan valued at Rs. 19 billiob for the project and on November 27, 2014, Cabinet approval had been granted for the project. The construction work of the said project had been granted to China Engineers Ltd. and the contractor was offered a 20-percent advance prior to the initiation of the construction work related to the water purification plant.
The proposed water source, the Rajanganaya reservoir, possesses a capacity of 85,000 acre-feet. The Irrigation Department Director-General, in his letter dated March 24, 2015 and bearing No. 7000/WM/MS/ANU, had granted approval for the intake of 44,000 acre-feet of water per year from the said tank. This approval had been re-confirmed at a progress review meeting held at the Irrigation Department Secretarys office on January 12, 2018.

Tuisova fires Fiji past Blitzboks for London title
LONDON, Sunday - Toulon winger Josua Tuisova scored a try to help fire Fiji to a 21-17 victory over arch-rivals South Africa to claim the London leg of the World Rugby Seven Series.
With just the Paris leg of the Series to play, next weekend, Fiji now stand atop the standings on 167 points, with the Blitzboks in second on 160. New Zealand sit in third on 133.
"There were a lot of new boys in the squad but we performed as a team, that's why we overcame South Africa today," Fiji skipper Jerry Tuwai said.
Fiji beat Canada 40-7 in the quarter-finals before seeing off Ireland 38-12 in the semis, while South Africa edged New Zealand 14-5 in the quarters and England 29-19 in their last-four play-off.
Fiji's hopes of a fourth straight tournament win took an early blow when Sevuloni Mocenacagi was yellow carded from the kick-off for taking Justin Geduld out in the air.
South Africa immediately made their numerical advantage count, Stedman Gans scything through the stretched defence for the opening try, Geduld converting.
Fiji did well, however, to absorb the Blitzbok pressure when a man down, and showed just why they average just 23 passes per match such is the efficacity of their strike power.
Tuisova, also part of the Fiji team that won Olympic gold in Rio in 2016 but not a regular on the circuit, muscled his way past some weak defence for a try, converted by Amenoni Nasilasila, to pull the Pacific islanders level.
Paula Dranisinukula was the final recipient of an amazing display of off-loading rugby started by Semi Radradra, crossing for Fiji's second try with Nasilasila making no mistake with a conversion in front of the posts.
The Boks hit back when Ruhan Nel expertly took a high pass one-handed and rode a tackle by Dranisinukula to cross in the corner, Geduld missing the extras.
But Fiji responded perfectly, Jasa Veremalua skilfully exchanging passes with Josua Vakurunabili to go over for Fiji's third try, Nasilasila's conversion taking the Fijians out to 21-12.
Bok Zain Davids bounced through a couple of desperate tackles for a fine individual try to set up a dramatic finale, but Fiji won the restart and safely ran the ball out to seal the win.
"I found it tough today but I got help from the boys and was hanging in there. I know we trust each other and finally we get the win," said free-running Fiji back and man-of-the-final Radradra, who is quitting Top 14 club Toulon for Bordeaux-Begles next season.
Ireland, a "non-core team" in their maiden Series appearance, marked a remarkable weekend by edging England 21-19 to take third place.
Jordan Conroy scored a first-half brace of tries for the Irish, including one from 90 metres out, before Dan Bibby hit back with two of his own.
England speedster Dan Norton then took his record career try tally to 295 when he crossed early in the second half.
But Conroy showed all his gas by sprinting away for his hat-trick, Mark Roche nailing a tricky conversion to seal a memorable win.- AFP

Use of flu vaccine debated
A panel of scholars and experts has been appointed to look into the possibility of introducing the flu vaccine, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference held at his office in Colombo yesterday, he said other countries use preventive methods of maintaining personal hygiene to control infections and no country relies on flu vaccines. The vaccine is different from the vaccines included in the National Immunization Programme which are 100 percent reliable with single or double dozes.
Consultant Virologist attached to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha said the vaccine is only 40 to 70 percent effective and it should be given more than once or twice because the influenza virus changes from time to time within a short period. The vaccine included three viruses but the exact strain existing in Sri Lanka at a given time should be investigated through scientific research to make the vaccine match with the virus. The vaccine has side effects similar to any other vaccine.
The scholarly panel includes pediatricians, gynecologists, virologists, epidemiologists, and representatives from the Medical Supplies Division etc. The panel will decide whether to use the vaccine or not, when, to whom and how, the doctors said.

## Title: Water ATMs for commuters at Mumbai railway stations

Water ATMs for commuters at Mumbai railway stations
Water vending machines, or water ATMs, at railway stations across the city are catching on despite the challenges: supply of running water at some stations, or people unwilling to pay
Mumbai: On platform no. 1 at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), people queue up behind a stall, some of them with empty bottles. As sweat trickles down many a brow, the lines grow longer by the hour. Sujit Paswan has been manning the stall for the past six months. People prefer this because they pay only for the water they need. Moreover, it is cheap. For India rupee 8 you get one litre, which otherwise you get for Rs. 15 or Rs. 20, Paswan said.
His is one of 178 water vending machines, also known as water ATMs, across 100 stations on the Mumbai suburban railway network. According to Pinakin Morawala, spokesperson for Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the implementing agency, the idea is to ensure that every station has at least one water vending machine to dispense affordable, clean water. We conducted an extensive survey, which lasted nearly eight months, to identify sites for the machines, Morawala said. The machines charge Rs.1 for 300 ml of water, Rs.3 for 500 ml, and Rs.5 for 1 litre. A one-litre plastic bottle costs Rs.8.
The first such machine was commissioned at Khar station in April 2016. The stall set up by Hi Tech, a water solutions company, is being operated by Jyoti Pawar and her son Aashish.
In the first few months, people were wary of the service and would argue with us, saying we should not charge them. This has changed, Pawar said. Over the years, Ms. Pawar said, not only have more people started using the service, but they now come from all strata of society. Earlier, only office-goers and daily commuters used to come. But now, daily-wage labourers and homeless people, who live around the stations, too take water from our stall.
Other than Hi Tech, Fontus Water and JanaJal have received the licence to operate water ATMs at stations. The decision by the IRCTC and the Centre to install water ATMs has given the sector a boost, Parag Agarwal, CMD of JanaJal, which commissioned 99 water ATMs across stations, said.
Running water
The IRCTC floated tenders with clusters of stations, which included a combination of big and small stations, with regard to passenger footfall. The vendors pay the IRCTC an annual licence fee, and water and electricity charges.
The companies either use reverse osmosis (RO) or ultra filtration technologies, depending on the quality of source water. Where the total dissolved solids (a measure of organic and inorganic substances in a liquid; an indication of chemical contaminants) is high, JanaJal uses RO for their water purifiers and at stations where it is low, ultra-filtration.
RO results in waste water, which the Railways uses to clean platforms. At stations like Kalyan, it is used to water a garden, Mr. Agarwal said.
The booth at the CSMT is operated by Fontus Water, which has 38 machines across stations. The system, COO Hariharan Subramaniam said, depends on running water at stations. If the water supply is cut off, the machines stop working. At Mumbra, where JanaJal operates a machine, Mr. Agarwal said, the locals followed up with the Railways to ensure that running water is made available to the water ATM.
Installation costs vary between Rs.8 lakh and Rs.10 lakh, and maintenance costs range between Rs.25,000 and Rs.30,000 per month.
According to JanaJal, maintenance costs go up if the water quality is poor. The quality of water is mostly good in the city. However, at stations on the outskirts such as Nalasopara and Roha, the TDS is high, which increases the cost of maintenance, Mr. Agarwal said.
A key challenge, Mr. Subramanium said, is to drive behavioral change among consumers. Consumers The Hindu spoke to, however, said they choose vending machines over the water huts provided by the Railways, where one gets drinking water for free. It is way more hygienic than the water huts. People use it like a wash basin and there is no provision for cups, Meghna Patil, a Kharghar resident who travels every day to CSMT for work, said. Santosh Bhoir, a Diva resident, said, People spit gutka and paan masala (in the water huts) and many wash their hands and faces with this water. Moreover, we dont know how regularly the tank is cleaned. The fact that the vending machines have operators who provide glasses instils faith, he said. Other consumers said vending machines have reduced their dependence on bottled water.
Demand is good, especially in summer. Mr. Paswan said, on an average, his booth brings in Rs.1,600 to Rs.1,700 a day, but in summer, the collection can go up to Rs.4,000. Ms. Pawar said in summer, there is greater demand for chilled water. In summer, people often argue with us as the water is not chilled enough. Operators at busy stations said because of the continuous demand, the water does not stay in the chiller long enough for it to get chilled.
Meeting a need
In some areas that lie on the outskirts, like Diva and Mumbra, water vending machines are a source of drinking water for local residents as well. There is shortage throughout the year, but it gets acute in summers, Mantosh Maitya, who has been living in Diva for the past five years, said. Fontus Water, which operates the water vending machine at Diva, dispenses nearly 15,000 litres, on par with much larger stations such as CSMT, Dadar and Thane.
The situation in Mumbra is similar, where residents routinely queue up at the water ATM, operated by Janajal. According to its operator Zunjar Gawli, the locals often demand plastic bottles. While things have improved, there needs to be more awareness. On a daily basis, I have customers fighting over the nominal charge of water, with many refusing to pay, Mr. Gawli said. According to Ms. Pawar, despite the general awareness, there is still someone who haggles about price.
Paper, not plastic
With the plastic ban set to come into force, the IRCTC has decided to replace the plastic glasses with paper glasses. It has asked all the operators to clear their stock of plastic glasses and bottles. For a short period, Mr. Gawlis stall ran out of plastic bottles, leading to arguments. Plastic bottles are popular here. I have requested many of them to bring their own bottles. Some regulars have done so, while others continue to be stubborn, he said. IRCTC officials said they are formulating a policy where a person will be able to return a plastic bottle within a set time period.
Mr. Maitya said with the initiative growing in popularity, the IRCTC should increase the number of vending machines. Very often, the rush is so high that we risk missing our train.
Bhageshwar Mukhiya, a Bhandup resident, cited another issue: The demand is especially high on island platforms where trains from both directions halt. Nobody is going to cross a platform just for water.
Mr. Mukhiya often fills his bottle from the Railways water hut at Ghatkopar since the vending machine is on another platform. If people were aware and used the water huts as they are supposed to be used, there might not have been a need for vending machines, he said.

Zverev and Djokovic into French Open quarters
PARIS, Sunday: German second seed Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic edged closer to a possible French Open semi-final clash of generations, with the youngster edging out Karen Khachanov and the former champion seeing off Fernando Verdasco in the last 16 on Sunday.
The 21-year-old Zverev claimed his third successive comeback win in five sets to reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final, beating Russian Khachanov 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Djokovic eased past Spanish veteran Verdasco 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 and will play in the last eight at Roland Garros for a record 12th time.
Zverev produced some stunning tennis in the closing stages of a dramatic fourth-round victory and will next face Dominic Thiem who reached a third successive quarter-final in Paris by seeing off Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-2, 6-0, 5-7, 6-4.
World number 38 Khachanov has now lost at the last-16 stage at Roland Garros twice in a row, while Zverev ended his wait for a maiden major last-eight appearance at the 12th attempt. "Well, I'm young, so I might as well stay on court, get some practice and entertain you guys," smiled Zverev, who is bidding to become the first German man to win the French Open since 1937.
"Me and my brother (Mischa) are guys that spend three, four hours a day in the gym, lifting heavy weights, on the treadmill. It paid off today."
The world number three, as he did in his wins over Dusan Lajovic and Damir Dzumhur, battled back from 2-1 down in sets to force a decider, before securing an impressive victory that featured 63 winners and 17 aces. Thiem, the only man to beat Rafael Nadal on clay this year, held off a short-lived Nishikori revival on Court Philippe Chatrier to set up the meeting with Zverev.
"I think that's the matchup most of the fans in Germany and Austria were hoping for when they saw the draw," he said. "He's an amazing player. I mean, probably now the third-best after Rafa and Roger (Federer). So it's going to be an amazing challenge for me."
Djokovic, seeded 20 after a year of struggles with an elbow injury and mediocre form, was never in trouble against an erratic Verdasco, who needed treatment for a badly blistered left foot at the end of the second set.
The 12-time Grand Slam champion took the first two sets by a single break of serve and raced through the third as 34-year-old Verdasco ended with 48 unforced errors.
"I felt pretty good physically today, had no problems to go the distance in long rallies, and I won in three sets against a player who is in form, especially for this surface," said the 31-year-old after his 200th clay-court win.
Former world number one Djokovic will face Italian surprise package Marco Cecchinato in his 40th major quarter-final.
The world number 72, who had never won a Grand Slam match before this week, stunned Belgian eighth seed David Goffin 7-5, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. US Open champion Sloane Stephens cruised past Estonian Anett Kontaveit 6-0, 6-2 to book a last-eight spot for the first time.
Stephens, the 10th seed, had previously made the fourth round for four successive seasons and will next play either Australian Open champion and second seed Caroline Wozniacki or Russia's Daria Kasatkina.
"Obviously... making the fourth round four times or whatever is pretty good, but to finally get over that hump of quarter-finals feels very nice," said Stephens.
Wozniacki and 14th seed Kasatkina will return to Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday with the Russian leading 7-6 (7/5), 3-3, after their match was halted when darkness fell. American 13th seed Madison Keys also reached her first Roland Garros quarter-final with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Romania's Mihaela Buzarnescu.
