BEST SERVED COLD

Leonardo DiCaprio has an Oscar finally in sight! Director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu has finally presented the Titanic star a challenging role in which he is able to prove his acting proves rather than glide through the scenes using his blond good looks!
Vengeance, as they say, is a dish best served cold and that is exactly what The Revenant signifies. The opening scene itself sends a chill through our bones. We are taken to a campsite in which furred beasts are massacred. It is something out of a nightmare that Gonzlez Irritu has created and promises that more gruesome scenes will follow.
The next major set piece in the film depicts DiCaprio's bearded tracker Hugh Glass's near-demise at the paws of a wild bear that takes him for a threat to her cubs. The scene is one of the finest in the movie simply because the bears behavior is questionable here. It is a wonder whether the animal knows what she is doing when she snared Glass, puts a paw on his head while pressing hard on him and drooling all over him. Though the visual effects are a little jarring in a movie that's otherwise entirely practical, nature red in tooth and claw has rarely been captured like this on screen. It's a devastating bout of savagery that leaves Glass with bones broken and skin rent open in an awful manner.
Glass is left for the dead by his company and keepers. He is lifelong enemies with John Fitzgerald. Glasss son is murdered by Fitzgerald and Glass is on hot pursuit for revenge. However the odds are stacked against Glass.
The imagery is sublime. Primal landscapes straight out of an Albert Bierstadt painting and weird wastelands pulled from Glass' subconscious unfold on screen.
The supporting cast: Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Lukas Haas, Dave Burchill, Melaw Nakehk'o, is terrific. Poulter in perticular looks on the verge of tears at all times. Hardy emanates menace as the half-scalped villain of the piece. But the movie belongs to DiCaprio for his raw performance. He may have uttered only a handful of dialogs but his torn throat and courage has the viewers rooting for him with all their heart!
The Revenant is not for everyone. Only those who can stomach it should watch it. It is a powerful trip but make sure that you mind and spirit is ready to endure it. Unapologetically cruel and startlingly realistic with its violence, The Revenant will test your emotions.
Sadly, like Fitzgerald and destiny, the film can't escape its own deadly script. Rich imagery and lithe camera movements are thwarted almost at every turn by unconvincing details and leaden dialogue. The film can't be seen outside the context of its Oscar ambitions.

ETCA agreement not even drafted still: UNP

The UNP yesterday brushed aside as unwarranted criticism levelled against the proposed Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between Sri Lanka and India, claiming that it has not even been drafted.
UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara told the media that some opposition political elements and organisations with vested interests were trying to create apprehension in the public mind using something
which is not even in existence as yet. It has not even been drafted. So, how could these political elements and organisations keep criticising it.
This shows that they are misleading the public and trying to seek petty political mileage using the issue, he added. Bandara said there has only been some preliminary discussions over the issue. He said proposals for such an agreement will only be finalised after discussing with intellectuals, entrepreneurs and all relevant sectors.
The MP said this would be done in a very transparent manner which ensures maximum benefits to the country.

FBI admits phone mistake in San Bernardino case

US: In the chaotic aftermath of the shootings in San Bernardino, California, in December, FBI investigators seeking to recover data from the iPhone of one of the shooters asked a technician in the California county to reset the phone's iCloud password.
That apparent fog-of-war error has foreclosed the possibility of an automatic backup by the phone to the Apple iCloud servers that might have turned up more clues to the origins of the terrorist attack that killed 14 people.
"The county and the FBI were working together cooperatively to obtain data, and at the point when it became clear the only way to accomplish the task at hand was to reset the iCloud password, the FBI asked the county to do so, and the county complied," said David Wert, a spokesman for San Bernardino County.
The Justice Department disclosed the misstep in a court filing on Friday, which is part of a larger, high-stakes battle over whether the government can use the courts to force Apple to create software to help it unlock a customer's iPhone - in this case, one used by Syed Rizwan Farook.
Farook, a county health worker, and his wife were killed in a firefight with police hours after the December 2 attack.
"This was happening hours after the worst terror attack since 9/11, and there were still credible reports of a third shooter," said a federal law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
"It was a very dynamic time, and the number one priority was figuring out what happened and if there were more attacks coming."
According to senior Apple executives, the FBI's first call to Apple for help came on Saturday, December 5, at 2.46am. With a subpoena, the bureau obtained subscriber data and other details.
On Sunday, the FBI, with a warrant, obtained data from Farook's iPhone that had been backed up to iCloud. That backup contained information only through October 19 - six weeks before the attack.
The same Sunday, the FBI asked the county for help in retrieving data from the phone, Wert said in an interview. "So the county said we could get to the information on the cloud if we changed the password or had Apple change the password," he said. "The FBI asked us to do that, and we did."
It is not clear why the FBI needed to reset the password if it was able to obtain the backed-up data from Apple. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nonetheless, by resetting the password, the county, which owned Farook's phone, and the FBI eliminated the possibility of seeing whether additional data beyond October 19 might be recovered from the phone through the auto-backup feature, experts said.
The FBI in a court filing said Farook "may have disabled" the auto-backup. But, tech experts said, there might be other reasons the phone did not back up: It was not near a Wi-Fi network it was familiar with, such as his home or workplace, or it was not turned on long enough to back up. With the password changed, it is impossible to know.
The Justice Department on Tuesday got a federal judge to order Apple to build software to override an auto-wipe feature on the phone that deletes data after 10 failed tries to enter a password.
The FBI could then try to crack the phone's password by "brute force", making many attempts without risking the wiping of the data.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the firm would challenge the order, warning that it would set a "chilling" precedent that could lead to more invasive requests for data.
On Friday, the Justice Department fired back, charging that Apple's stance was motivated by "marketing"concerns as it promotes itself as a protector of consumer privacy.

IS increasingly using children in suicide missions

US: The boy appears to be no older than 12. He hugs his father, climbs into an armored vehicle packed with explosives and then kisses his father's hand before departing on a mission that ends in a fireball on the horizon.
That attack in Aleppo last month was one of at least 89 cases over the past year in which the Islamic State employed children or teenagers in suicide missions, according to new research that indicates the terrorist group is sending youths to their deaths in greater and greater numbers.

The father-son sequence was memorialized in propaganda photos released last month by the Islamic State, adding to an expanding collection of online eulogies that provides insight into how the organization uses children in combat operations and mass-casualty attacks on civilians in Iraq and Syria.
"The Islamic State (Islamic State) is mobilizing children and youth at an increasing and unprecedented rate," according to a report to be published Friday by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. A copy was provided to The Washington Post.
The study describes the Islamic State's use of children in suicide attacks as part of a broader strategy to cultivate a generation of school-age militants indoctrinated in the group's ideology and completely inured to its extreme brand of violence.
Since its emergence as a dominant force in Syria, the Islamic State has frequently cast children in roles designed to shock outsiders.
A video released last month showed a child in an Islamic State headband pressing the button on a remote control, detonating a bomb strapped to a car containing three accused spies.
But the new study is the first comprehensive catalogue of cases in which the Islamic State used children in missions where they were expected to die. Roughly 60 percent of the victims were categorized as "adolescent," meaning ages 12 to 16. None were older than 18, and some were as young as 8 or 9, according to researchers at Georgia State University who were involved in the project.
At least 11 children or adolescents were killed in Islamic State operations in January, compared with six in the same month a year ago, according to the report, "Depictions of Children and Youth in the Islamic State's 'Martyrdom' Propaganda."
The use of children in combat has often been a sign of desperation, as was the case in Nazi Germany in the closing months of World War II. But researchers said that the Islamic State is not being forced to rely on underage fighters because of dwindling adult ranks.
Instead, they said that the group seems to employ children for reasons including their propaganda impact and ability to evade detection, as well as a system of values that regards even young lives as subordinate to the cause of re-establishing a "caliphate."
"It is striking that children are being integrated into the IS war machine not as substitutes but as soldiers and suicide attackers fighting alongside adult [militants]," said Charlie Winter, a senior research associate at Georgia State and co-author of the report. Winter said that the practice could intensify if the Islamic State loses territory and fighters.
"We know that there are a lot more [children] being recruited than eulogized," Winter said.
"As the military situation becomes more difficult for ISIS in the months and years to come, we'll see more instances of youths being used on the battlefield."
The vast majority of the children and teenagers used in suicide missions were from Iraq or Syria, where the Islamic State controls an area the size of West Virginia, according to the report. But others came from the Middle East and North Africa, and at least four were from Western nations, with two from Britain and one each from France and Australia.
The list of underage fighters killed between January 2015 and 2016 was assembled by examining Islamic State propaganda releases that generally did not disclose victims' real names or ages. Instead, researchers categorized the youths as adolescent or pre-adolescent based on physical characteristics or other clues.
Of the 89 cases cited in the report, 36 were killed after carrying out operations in which they drove vehicles packed with explosives. Eighteen took part in teams who carried out Kamikaze-style assaults on enemy positions, firing weapons and then detonating suicide belts. Only two cases involved suicide attacks on civilian targets.
Other terrorist groups, including Boko Haram, have tended to conceal their use of children in suicide attacks because of public scorn for the tactic, said Mia Bloom, a professor at Georgia State and a co-author of the report.
The Islamic State, by contrast, "is absolutely advertising it and making it routine," Bloom said, citing not only the group's use of children in attacks but also widespread evidence that children routinely attend public beheadings and screenings of propaganda videos showing other children being employed in suicide missions.
"It's about changing what is considered right and wrong, and making children almost immune to the horrific nature of what they're seeing" Bloom said. "It hardens these children and makes them more ready and psychologically available for things they'll do in the future."
The researchers did not include the images and videos they examined in their published report, citing privacy issues and a desire to be sensitive to families of the victims. But the study, which was funded through a grant program backed by the Pentagon, refers to images that have been widely circulated online.
Among them are the slide-show-like sequence of the father and his son in Aleppo, as well as an image of a child "wearing his baseball cap back-to-front, sitting atop what appears to be a fairground ride" before he was eulogized as a "martyr" by the Islamic State's media wing in Raqqa, Syria, the group's de facto capital.
The toll has grown since the report was completed. Winter said that five new eulogies for youths were released by the Islamic State on Thursday.

Iraqi artist imagines life in a bomb suit

IRAQ: The man in the bulky bomb disposal suit waved at a gaggle of awed children as he walked down a Baghdad street and sat outside a small cafe to drink tea.
But there was no bomb to defuse on Rasheed Street that day, and no armour inside the black suit to protect him from explosives.
Iraqi artist Hussein Adil designed the mock bomb suit -- complete with huge helmet and visor -- himself for this performance.
"We had to make this one because there aren't many bomb suits in Iraq," he said. "We have to be one of the countries in the world that needs them the most."
Adil, a wispy 20-year-old with a wild head of tight curly hair, is one of an ever growing number of Iraqi artists looking for new ways of tackling the violence they grew up with.
The inspiration for his "bomb suit happening" was the death last year in a suicide car bombing of his close friend Ammar al-Shahbander, a much-loved journalist.
Adil, Shahbander and two other friends were heading to a cafe to drink tea in Baghdad's Karrada district when an important call came in on his mobile phone.
"I told them to go ahead, that I would follow them in five minutes," Adil said.
He heard an explosion moments later. After searching for them for hours, he found one of his friends with a head injury in hospital and was told that Shahbander had been killed.
Two weeks later, he dreamt that a bomb would go off near a square in central Baghdad and, after waking up, immediately called his friends and his father to tell them.
An explosion rocked the exact spot later that day.
"My friends called me to ask me how I knew, it was a very strange thing," he said, adding it was then that he started looking for ways to express his angst through art.
Baghdad has been rocked by hundreds of car bombs over the years, sometimes several in a day during periods when violence peaked.
Those blasts and other attacks have killed tens of thousands of civilians and left many residents with deep trauma that remains when violence ebbs, as is the case now in the city.
Adil thought of a simple performance, during which his friend Muslim would go about normal daily activities in Baghdad wearing a bomb suit.
"I thought, why isn't there some kind of outfit that can protect us Other approaches produced no results so I looked at individual solutions," Adil said.
The decrepit charm of the once glorious Rasheed Street's ornate arcades and derelict theatres provides an odd backdrop for the dark figure casually walking in full mock ordnance disposal gear. As they saw Muslim trudging along, arms asway and head ensconced in a massive ballistic collar, some passers-by seemed alarmed or amused.
Others barely turned their heads to look.
"I suppose they have their reasons for doing this kind of art, but personally I don't see what it's going to change about what our country is going through," said Abu Ibrahim, a local shop owner.
Followed by his friend Adil, Muslim walked into buildings to chat with people, ordered tea at a cafe and inquired about prices at a tailor's shop.
After two people helped him out of his bomb suit, Muslim spoke of the many thoughts that rushed through his mind.
"I knew it wasn't a real suit... but at one point I actually felt it was protecting me and started imagining all the things I could do," he said.
"I could feel people looking at me. Some were laughing, some were perplexed and others looked like they wanted to try it on."
Adil will repeat the performance in various locations of the capital and wrap up his experiment with a photo exhibit.
"I wanted to show the public what we have come to... and plant this question in their heads: what if we all looked like this"

Joint Oppn. on a journey of hypocrisy: Kiriella

A party should be formed with certain principles and a clear vision, if not there is no survival, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. He said the Joint Opposition had no such vision and were embarking instead on a political journey of hypocrisy.
He was speaking during the inauguration of the First Stage of the Rural Road Development Project in the Galagedara Electorate of the Kandy District on Sunday, which intends to develop the Alagalla-Pattapola, Weligodapola-Dedunuptiya, Alotuwa-Ihalagama and Aludeniya-Paragoda roads, at an estimated cost of Rs. 480 million.
The minister said the Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that it was once known to be, and had instead become extremist.
"Back in the day, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party had three Secretaries-General; a Sinhalese, a Tamil and a Muslim. It was a Party based on central principles and policies. Today there is no Opposition," he said.
He said the former President had handed out limitless ministerial and deputy ministerial portfolios during the previous regime, but the19th Amendment had limited this practice.
"Although the Opposition MPs shout at us in Parliament, during the lunch break they ask us if they could join the Government. If we were able to give ministerial portfolios to the remaining 45 MPs in the Opposition, there would only be about 10 remaining in the Opposition," he said.
The latest charade carried out by the Joint Opposition is breaking coconuts for the Gods to fulfill their wishes. These acts should be carried out by virtuous people, not the people who put General Sarath Fonseka behind bars, deposed the Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayaka and introduced the white van culture. Even the gods were angered by this deed, which is why the wallet of a MP was lost during the ceremony," he said.

Joint Opposition MP warns of tough action

Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Ranjith De Soysa warned of tough action if their demand to be recognized as an independent group is rejected by the Speaker.
De Soysa said that the group has already requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to recognize them as an independent group and afford them the privileges given to an individual party.
"We have spoken to him 13 times, and submitted written requests regarding the matter. We expect him to recognize the joint opposition as an independent group. But if he doesn't we will take stern action," he said. De Soysa said that they have not preplanned a course of action in the event their request is rejected by the Speaker.
"But we will take stern action," De Soysa warned.
We headed the request of the Prime Minister and the Speaker last time and cooperated with them to hold a good debate. Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition is to meet at 2 p.m. today.

US pulls out B-1 Bombers from ISLAMIC STATE fight

US: The US has decided to pull out B-1 bombers, one of the most dependable American weapons, from the battle against Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq for upgrades. Commander of US Air Forces Central Command Lt Gen Charles Brown Jr said the fleet of B-1 Lancer bombers had been sent back to the United States from their deployment in the Mideast.
The four-engine bombers are due for upgrades to their cockpits, a process that will keep the jets stateside for an undetermined amount of time, Brown told reporters at the Pentagon via a video link from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The B-1s have drawn praise for the amount of weapons they can carry, their accuracy in using those weapons and their reliability during the campaign against ISIS.
Brown was quoted by CNN as saying that other US and coalition aircraft would pick up the B-1s' missions during the upgrades.
"We actually have plenty of capacity with other platforms. We lose maybe a little flexibility. The B-1 is a workhorse. The fact that it can carry as many weapons as it can and stay airborne as long as it can, it does provide a great capability," he said.
Brown said the air campaign against ISIS will continue and the B-1s will likely be part of it again. "They will be back, I fully expect," he said. B-1s from the 28th Bomb Wing out of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, home to 27 of the bombers, flew 490 sorties against ISIS in a six-month deployment that ended in January. They dropped 3,800 munitions on 3,700 targets. - NDTV
