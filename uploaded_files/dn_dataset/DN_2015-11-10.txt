Aung San Suu Kyi hints at big victory in poll
MYANMAR: Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has hinted at victory in Myanmars first free elections for decades despite an unexpected delay in the release of the results. In her first comments after Sundays elections, Suu Kyi told a crowd gathered at the National League for Democracy (NLD) party headquarters in Yangon that the results would not be announced as soon as had been expected, but I think you all have the idea of the results.
It is still a bit early to congratulate our candidates who will be the winners, she said. I want to remind you all that even candidates who didnt win have to accept the winners, but it is important not to provoke the candidates who didnt win to make them feel bad.
The south-east Asian nations election commission had been due to reveal preliminary results at 9a.m on Monday morning but delayed. The final result is expected today.
A big crowd of supporters of Suu Kyis NLD party had gathered on Sunday evening at the groups headquarters in Yangon, formerly Rangoon under the British empire, to cheer, dance and wave red flags.
As many polling stations counted into the early hours of Monday morning, there were signs that the NLD was set for a convincing victory.
House speaker and former ruling party chair Shwe Mann conceded defeat in the central Bago region. Other districts showed NLD gains although it was hard to tell if they represented the rest of the country.
The official Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper ran its Monday headline as Dawn of a New Era and said turnout was estimated at 70%, with 30 million eligible voters.
Were leading the race but we cant say for sure well win two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. That would enable us to form an independent government without forming a coalition, said NLD senior official and spokesman Han Tha Myint. The once-outlawed NLD is expected to win the popular vote, although the Nobel peace prize laureate, who spent much of the past quarter-century under house arrest, is barred from the Presidency by a junta-drafted Constitution.
Yet a key concern, that the army generals would annul the vote as they did when Suu Kyi won a landslide in 1990, was rebuffed in the capital, Naypyitaw, where military commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing said there was no reason not to accept the election results, according to the media.
The 2015 polls were observed by around 10,000 election monitors, including many from the European Union and United Nations, and early indications from monitors suggested a largely transparent process.
The Army has also enshrined its power in the constitution  reserving 25% of Parliament seats  keeping the most powerful ministerial portfolios and banning Suu Kyi from the presidency as she has foreign family members. Her late husband was a British academic and she has two British sons.
Jason Carter, grandson of former US President Jimmy Carter and an international election observer, said monitors would release a full evaluation including the political context in which this election is occurring on TuesdayThe incumbent Union Solidarity and Development Party would need far fewer seats as it backed by of the military. Some 91 parties have contested the election in a country of around 51 million people. - AFP

Changing mans nature
In the past, deceitful political leaders misled people with lies and omissions. They used manipulative behaviours to achieve their personal goals. The Buddha advised his followers: You should not accept my words without examining them out of respect and regard for me.
The Buddha taught us to observe: the course of wisdom (pragna) and practice compassion (karuna); to be conscious of the fact that we are subject to old age, decay, impermanence, sickness and death; that out of ignorance and pride we ridicule the unfortunate, the poor the sick, old or dead; that we should not look down upon the ill-fated ones or laugh at the man who is limping on the road because he has reaped what he had sawn  the effects of his own action in this birth or previously -the Karma. Karma literally means all that thought, word, and deed. The Buddha explained I declare, that volitions is karma.
The Buddha also preached Karma is action. Vipaka - fruit or result is its reaction. It is mentioned in Sanyutta Nikaya According to the seed that is sown. So is the fruit you reap there from, Doer of good will gather good. Doer of evil, evil reaps. Down is the seed and thou shalt taste the fruit there of. Accordingly, our own acts, good or bad, bear their own results.
The Buddha preached we should guide our lives righteously and earn our living virtuously to improve our life styles. We should also understand the pain of our fellowmen and empathize because Karma is a law in itself. We Sri Lankans have become so avaricious and it has no limits. It is a pity the majority, whether they are educated or not, they act blindly for selfish gain having totally disregarded religious, cultural, ethical and human values.
Karaniya Metta Sutta
We should also have no misgiving to treat everybody alike with respect and civility. It would be good for our politicians to take that to heart. All are our own brothers and sisters. Buddhism and other religions too teach us kindness, equality, sharing, love, affection, sympathy, giving and most importantly to be humane in all our dealings. The Buddha in the Karaniya Metta Sutta taught that Let none deceive another, despise any being in any state! Let none by anger or ill-will wish harm to another. It also goes on to say Let him cultivate the boundless good towards the entire world, free from ill-will or enmity.
An email, a timely one, received from a friend when I was writing this article is reproduced below:
An anthropologist proposed a game to the African tribal children. He place a basket of sweets and candies near a tree. And made them stand 100 metres away. And announced that whoever reaches first would get all the sweets in the basket. When he said ready steady go Do you know what these small children did They all held each others hands and ran towards the tree together, divided the sweets among them and ate the sweet and enjoyed them. When the anthropologist asked them why did you do so They said Ubuntu which meant  How can one be happy when all others are sad Ubuntu in their language means  I am, because we are! A message for all generations. Let all of us always carry this attitude within us and spread happiness, wherever we go  Let us have Ubuntu LifeI am because we are.
Nelson Mandela, the first Black President of South Africa made sure that everyone clearly knew his goal - to unify the country and to end apartheid rule. He was a man who was true to his words and dedicated to progression, equality and peace. President Maithripla Sirisena too having announced his mission to the people is facing resistance similarly in his effort to eradicating corruption and establishing good governance. President correctly took the leadership of the party and got all his party men on board his ship. President has assured in no uncertain terms that he will serve one term and that he has a mission to be accomplished in the interest of the country and its people.
President introduced the 19th Amendment because he was one person who believed that the executive presidency had been one of the root causes for the present predicament. We must appreciate that an institutional framework has now been put in place with truly ambitious plans to take the country forward for the benefit of the people. The creation of Executive Presidency and the 1978 Constitution was the brainchild of JRJ. He however announced several plans including the improvement of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte to be the administrative capital. It was unfortunate that such impressive plans had to be abandoned. The war which intensified gradually was the excuse.
Self-interested politicians
I was personally aware there were proposals made to the former President JRJ to abolish Executive Presidency in the interest of the country before he departed from politics. Unfortunately, there were other aspirants who did not wish to do so. They saw to it that presidency continued. This is a message for the present government too. Wheels within wheels.
My greatest fear is that if the present trend continues it will be disastrous again. In other words, should the general public abandon the civic responsibilities and let organized political gangs and other perpetrators overrun the system in the name of democracy for their personal gain. We now need competent, magnanimous leaders, with foresight and vision, who behave responsibly by their constituents. We have had enough of self-interested politicians. They had destroyed our beautiful country. We need fresh air to come alive. You cannot leave everything in the hands of unscrupulous politicians alone. George Bernard Shaw had said He knows nothing and thinks he knows everything. That points clearly to a political career. This no doubt applies to a majority of our Sri Lankan politicos.
We must therefore ensure freedom, rule of law, good governance, democracy and human rights to all Sri Lankans in order to restore the basic human values in them. We should go all-out to strengthen and rebuild a divided nation. Let the politicians not deceive the masses anymore by telling dishonesties and escape without telling the truth. Blind shortsighted hostile politics should be replaced with love, understanding, sincerity and push the country to successfully overcome:
* Misuse and abuse of political power
* Corruption, fraud and bad governance
* Violation of human rights
* Misuse of perks, benefits and privileges
* Failure to curb growing violence and criminal acts
* Poverty related issues
* Unemployment
* Reduce governments top heaviness
and excessive recurrent costs
* Inefficiency and poor service delivery
to the general public
Being a democracy, we should now allow the citizens to speak their minds and shape their own and their childrens future. We have experienced regime-sanctioned hooligans always losing their battle in the face popular democratic vote. It could be either politicians or bureaucrats the will of the people should be respected, honoured and strengthened. If not, we have the right as citizens to be critical and demand change.
Charles Dickens said subdue your appetites, my dears, and you have conquered human nature. Human beings are not essentially evil.
In the past, the rulers appreciated that it is far better to maintain moral values, the culture and the religion. However, we now live in a politically fragmented and a disconnected culture where - politics are dreadful, religion is hated, economy is exhausted. It is embarrassing that there is no broad consensus among political leaders that true reforms should be introduced.
Religious leaders
President in a speech therefore said people must give up the practice of being war-like. He added we should learn to be loving, friendly, courteous, respectful and become non-violent. The spirit of peace, kindness, charity and better understanding among all communities should be strengthened. We should also learn to go beyond the boundaries of castes, race and feed the hungry, spread love and affection, lift the down trodden and extend a helping hand without being selfish to those in need.
The Buddha preached us to follow the middle path and avoid the two extremes and had spelt out very clearly that the greed is the root cause of all problems. We need to cultivate and strengthen cooperation and greater understanding among all communities. In fact, there is a serious threat to our country unless we could unite as ONE NATION.
We should build up a forum for all religious leaders to work together in the interest of the country and its people. The Buddha preached The way is not in the sky; the way is in the heart. We should seek the support and assistance of the religious leaders to restore our lost and distorted humanity by inculcating habits such as:
a) Healing the wounds of war which lasted several decades
b) Removing the feeling of insecurity with your neighbour
c) Developing human values and virtues and
d) Guiding the political leadership to conform to the best practices in governance
Sri Lanka no doubt is going through a difficult time.
The past regime failed to achieve viable democratic aims to proclaim the will of the people, which should be the basis of the authority of government. As we know, nominal democracies that maintained the outward appearance alone have been changed by the voters at elections again and again. This is a lesson for the present government too.
I quote: There is a need for financial reform along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an economic reform to benefit everyone.
This would nevertheless require a courageous change of attitude on the part of political leaders.  Pope Francis. May I add we now need to learn from our past mistakes and not live in it!

Dreaming of magical things at 21
I know I am grinning the same way the characters of Kuda Hora are grinning from the framed photo on the wall as I sit in a comfortable straight-backed chair in the comfortable den if I may call it that, of my favorite writer. It is only 9.30 in the morning, and I am amused because I realize someone has already got an appointment before me, with the legendary author and illustrator of childrens books whose fame has reached every corner of the globe.
I am amazed at how much he has to say as he talks non-stop, never allowing any of his companions to utter a word. Suddenly Im on my feet, for she is here before me. So lovely to see you, Puthe, says Sybil Wettasinghe, greeting me with a hug. Waving her hands towards the window of her study she dismisses the chatter-box, he is a bit angry with me today because I got late to give him his breakfast. He, of course is the Thun Iri Appu who appears on the rooftop next to her study window every morning. She says she spends hours watching her guests who drop in to have breakfast with her. Apart from the chattering squirrel the others guests are, four red-vented bulbuls and a few babblers who drop by, later in the morning.
Can you believe I am eighty-eight she asks me, seating herself in the rocking chair by the window: the kind we usually see by a burning fire on a winter evening when children gather around their grandma begging for a story. But this is not winter, a ray of sunlight falling on the brown carpet, tells me so, and the only child around is inside my heart waiting ever so eagerly to hear a story, perhaps the one about the cabbage and the cucumber who went for a bath!
I shake my head in answer to her question. No. I cant believe she is eighty-eight. Dont look so incredulous, she chides. I dont feel I am eighty-eight. Age is nothing to me. Even though I turned eighty-eight (Saturday before last), I still have the mind of a child.
And so, we move towards our topic. What would she do if she was twenty-one, today A slow smile brightens her face. A sparkle comes into her eyes. I would live my life exactly the way I lived it when I was twenty-one! she proclaims.
The reasons are simple. It was when she was twenty-one that she had had the most wonderful, the most eventful time of her life! Having started work at the Lankadeepa when she was seventeen, by the time she was twenty-one she had joined Lake House, first as an illustrator of the paper called Janatha, later to broaden her horizons working with legendary editors like Denzil Peiris and Tarzee Vittachi, for everyone at Lake House wanted my illustrations. She confesses everyone thought she was a wonderful artist and she enjoyed basking in this new found glory.
I didnt lose my head though, she assures me with a twinkle in her eye.
Love too, was hovering in the air when she was twenty-one, leaving memories in her heart she would no doubt love to rekindle if she were to turn twenty-one again. He was very handsome, tall, fair, a man of few words. I was his opposite, dark and short. But for some reason he was attracted to me. She recalls it was while she was in her early twenties that Don Dharmapala Wettasinghe had started to court her, by giving her presents such as the beautifully illustrated Aesops tales and The Rubiyt of Omar Khayym. Yet, he had never told her what he felt for her, even though he would have found many a chance to do so, as he too was working at the Lake House, as the Chief Sub Editor. She remembers he was fond of her work and would often comment, I love your pictures, all those beautiful lines and beautiful colours... Looking back at her youth today, she realizes he must have meant something more as well when he praised her illustrations. Things moved onto a different level when, one day, he asked her if she would like to have a cup of tea in the canteen. She agreed and, after they finished the tea, he asked her if he could drop her home. It wasnt as if he had a car to take me home, she muses. He meant could he take me home by bus!
These are the things she would love to recapture if she could be twenty one today. Especially that memorable moment when he first touched her hand one evening when she was working late: she remembers how he had simply kept his hand on hers for the briefest of seconds and walked away. She didnt know it then, but many years later, he would grasp her hand with all the energy he could summon as he lay dying at the age of 63 in a private hospital in Colombo.
As he breathed his last he slowly let go of her hand, as if to indicate that the life they began together the day their hands first touched had now come to an end. She didnt cry that day. She came home from the hospital and wrote a poem instead: a poem that forms the epilogue of her biography The Story of Sybil Wettasinghe, by Vijita Fernando.
No, she insists, even if she was twenty one today, she would still not embrace modern technology. I use the computer only to send and receive emails, she says sans any traces of regret. I am proud to say I write all my stories by hand. There is something mechanical in a computer...something that stops my thoughts from flowing.
And this is all that matters: keeping all those thoughts flowing: turning them into stories and pictures: a process which culminates in the joy she feels when she receives letters and phone calls from children who have read her stories.
There are children from Bibile, Mahiyanganaya, Galle, who write to me, or come to see me to tell me they read my stories. Parents from Japan, Denmark, Germany send me emails or call me to tell me their children refuse to fall asleep unless they hear one of my stories. No award can replace the joy I feel when I get to know children love what I create.
Her age might change, but Sybil Wettasinghe knows she herself will never change. Im unchangeable. She is certain of this. Whether I am twenty one or eighty eight I will always be a true villager. The girl who went to the village school in Gintota and listened to the stories her grandmother and mother narrated, on moonlit nights when the entire village gathered in their garden, still lives within her.
Thus I leave her, seated in her rocking chair, grateful for the glimpse she had given me of her life, of the child in her who will remain the same whether she is twenty one or otherwise, who she feels is her guiding light forever reminding her of the enchanting wonderment, mystery and charm of the fantasy world of little children.
The last poem in her autobiography, A Child in me sums up her life so completely. A child and a grown up, live as one, in perfect harmony within me...together they dream of magical things...
As I walk away I glance up to see Thun Iri Appu peering down at me from the rooftop. Tring, tring, he seems to say, Sybil Nanda is our very own, magical friend. I believe him.

Emerging as a true artist
Music  the link that connects this world with just a click of an on/play button  connects you not only to the feel of that music but to the person who puts it out as well. So much is expressed in the words, the melody and feel of a song.
One man who is making a sensation in the music hub of Colombo and Australia was dubbed by Daily Mail UK as the next Justin Timberlake. Julian Simonsz needs no introduction as Colombo has already chosen him as the Best Male Artist at the recently concluded Yes FM Home Grown awards 2015 and will also hold his first ever solo show in Sri Lanka on February 27, 2016.
Julian wowed the judges (Kylie Minogue, Ricky Martin, Will.I.Am and Joel Madden) at the Voice Australia Season 3 show. All four judges turned as he began to sing and after going from one person to the other he finally chose Will.I.Am to be his coach.
TnC got together with him during his brief stay to know more about who he is.
Growing up I was brought up into a very musical family. My grandparents actually met through musicso naturally my uncles, aunties and all my cousins had music around them at all the get togethers naturally. I guess as I decided to further my education I didnt really go down the music path, Julian began telling his story.
Music was something that was always little bit in the background. I was more in Creative Arts so I did a Bachelor of Industrial Designing and I realized later that I really didnt want to pursue that. Before that I did a little bit of production at home  I bought a basic home studio set up where I would muck around and make beats etc.
Then I found this course  bachelor of Sound Production/Audio Engineering at SAE Melbourne and I realised I wanted t o learn the technical side because I always wanted to become an audio engineer. My main focus in music was the vocals even thought I played a little bit of instruments here and there. In Australia this industry is very tough and expensive  especially if you want it done professionally. I guess it got to a point where two three years I finished the course  I was about to get married and I was 28 at that time  for me I felt like my life was starting to fall into place and I had direction. That was the time I thought it was now or never, Im going to audition for something. Throughout the years I was not very confident about myself. I was really shy and it took me years and years to even sing in front of Nelu.
Voice Australia
There were 10,000 entries that were allowed and out of that there was a process of narrowing it down until it got to a number where there was couple of auditions in front of the Executive Producers and CAO of Universal Music of Australia. By then they had broken the number into 150 which was the blind audition and was televised. Out of those 150, 9 of them who performed had the chairs turned around by the judges and I was lucky to be one of the 9.
For years and years I watched the Australian Idol, X Factor and then the Voice and as you watch them you are like I wish I was on the show. And finally to be on it and be in front of Will.I.Am and have the opportunity to work with someone so elite  it was an honour to see the man in flesh. Im still taken back every time I think about it  its like a dream. Kylie Minogue is the most adorable person ever.
Choosing Will.I.Am was done strategically. Even prior to the audition I was like fingers crossed if anybody turns around  its a blessing. I had to try so hard to not stop singing when they turned around and I was about to like cry. Kylie was the first one to turn around and this changed my whole judgment. Then my mind was going all like what do I doI want Will.I.Am but she turned first. Will.I.Am for me was someone I idolize as an entrepreneur and a man of many talents. I wanted to emerge as an artist, I produce music as well and I run two other businesses  I just wanted to learn as much as I could.
Prior to the voice, I did a couple gigs here and there - and its hard to make a name and back then I didnt have any social media accounts like Facebook etc  I was against all that. A year before the Voice I created my own Youtube channel which gained a good response. This encouraged me more and even to have comments by random people around the world listening to music encouraged me to do the Voice, Julian adds.
I had been working on music but I never released that because that was something like years of mucking around. But the show really gave me that push and the platform to emerge as a professional artist. I was actually the first to release my music from the show. As soon as the contracts were done I had already worked on my EP and it was ready to go. I didnt want to use other people or artists to gain anything.
Wife to manager
Apart from his music life, Julians love life has a story too. Nelu and Julian actually knew each other from the time they were 2 or 3 years old. Her family migrated to Australia when she was 2 years old.
My grandfather got a phone call and was told that there is a family coming over there from Sri Lanka and could you please look after them until they settle in and find their way. We became family friends but then they moved to the other side of the city and we lost touch up until were 15 years old at my grandmothers funeral. I didnt even who she was and soon we became best friends for a long time and well the story goes on.
They went overseas for the first time and they did a Euro Trip. They ended up in Paris on the last day of their Euro Trip.
I had organized for us to walk our way up to the Eifel Tower and fortunately to set the mood at Midnight  the lights turn off and white sparkles just come and it was perfect timing and was the time to pop the question.
Nelu always had a thing for event managing. Within the Sri Lankan community in Melbourne she used to host a lot of functions. She was a natural at doing that and she had a passion for it, he stressed.
The Julian Simonsz band
The Julian Simonz band consists of four guys  Nick, Michael, Gareth and James. Its a different bunch of boys who are very talented. I worked with a production company called MSquared and I met the two boys Michael Best and Michael Paynter. Michael Paynter was on Season 2 of the Voice. That production company co-wrote and produced my EP. Michael Best is working under them now but prior to that he was Michael Painters best friend. Hes the one who produced two acoustic tracks for me. Michael Best, Gareth and James are in a band while Nick is a master of any instrument.
Sri Lanka is going to see something special as these boys are incredible, Julian adds.
So Sri Lanka, I guess you guys need to mark February 27, 2016 as you are definitely going to witness a concert by a musician who will definitely keep on making you ask for one more! So save it and be there!

A GIANT enslaved
Recently I received an electronic link on the plight of Sri Lankan elephants, particularly those captured, tamed and put to work in various ways. The main theme of the widely circulated u-tube was mans cruelty to this magnificent beast that happens to share this land with us. It was a shameful indictment of the country, of a people unable to appreciate a precious gift of nature.
It is said that we have about 5000 elephants in the wilds today. Their fate, bad as it is with fast receding jungles and often fatal conflict with humans, is still much preferable to the fate of their brothers in human captivity. For the mighty elephants, born to be free, captivity is a story of miserable bondage.
If the argument is based on who got here first, then of course the elephants win by several centuries. They pre-date the Homo sapiens whose migration to these parts was later. This was their land before we claimed it. For a long time the two species co-existed with little conflict.
We were only hunter gatherers then. Later, when humans evolved and began to use draft animals the elephant became a prize possession. Eventually they began to be used in ceremonial/cultural ways, becoming a symbol of power, pomp and majesty, evidently qualities much valued, especially when given the realities of a small and troubled country the prevalence of true power or genuine majesty is doubtful.
The attempt at the display of power and majesty in such primitive ways only undermines the idea, conveying the very opposite, a people with no power, mediocre, superficial and fickle. Even though the modern mans access to machinery and engines has made the exploitation of animals of burden meaningless, time consuming and even expensive, it still is very prevalent in the country.
Overloaded bullock carts are a common sight on rural roads. After pulling the heavy burden for a few years, the unfortunate bull is inevitably sold to a butcher.
In the old days the heaviest tasks were of course reserved for the elephant. Most of the constructions of the past were made possible only by the pulling power of these majestic beasts. Fortunately for the elephant, todays construction industry has outstripped the need for elephant power.
In the cities they are not a factor in that sector anymore. But that does not mean that the elephants are now released from their burdens. Other, and even more damaging tortures, have been thought up by their human masters.
Heavy chains on poor animals feet
In the important tourist industry elephants have become a showpiece. If it is just that, knowing the importance of the tourist dollars, we cannot raise serious objections. But practices such as elephant rides are surely objectionable. In some hotels the elephants work long hours carrying its human cargo. Needless to say everything in this form of activity is designed only with humans and dollars in mind. No consideration whatsoever is given to the well being of the animal. For instance, the seat placed on the elephants back is extremely heavy. They invariably result in injury to the elephants skin and perhaps even permanent damage to its back. No living species will willingly carry such a burden, from sun rise to sun set, seven days of the week. But that is often the plight of the elephants put to work in tourist centres.
Even in the so called elephant sanctuaries the handling of the elephants is crude and rough. There is no indication of consideration or kindness for the captured animal. With metal prods the elephants are urged on in shrill tones by their mahouts most of who appear to interpret their task in the crudest terms.
It is impossible to conceive of any concern on their part for the elephants welfare, leave alone animal psychology. The whole thing is managed only by the use of heavy chains on the poor animals feet and merciless use of whips and metal prods. Almost all captured elephants have festering wounds on their feet, caused by the heavy chains.
A most damnable use of the elephant in this society is at the Peraharas or processions. While the occasional use of elephants in such pageants, with due consideration for the animal, maybe overlooked, the manner in which they are used in some of the Peraharas cannot be forgiven. For an animal meant to roam the jungle tracks freely, there surely cannot be something more traumatic than to be chained and prodded painfully in the midst of a frenetic throng, the deafening noise from drums and other instruments, endless crackle of the loudspeakers and the fiercely burning torches. That such brutal torture of a captured animal passes off for a cultural activity among a people is telling of their basic instincts.
Cultural events
One of saddest aspects of these Peraharas, essentially cultural events, is their association indirectly with religious functions and rituals, particularly Buddhist occasions. There is no other religious teacher who has espoused as much kindness to all living beings as the Buddha. In the scheme of things all life forms are deserving of kindness if not active support. Man cannot claim a pre-eminence in the order of things or a natural right to exploit weaker species. But this is not what is happening today. In places of worship we see elephants in heavy chains, to be displayed to the tourists. Ritualistic practices of certain monks may even convey a sense of religious endorsement of the exploitation of elephants at occasions such as Peraharas or processions. This has now become so pervasive that an uninitiated visitor may be excused for assuming that the elephant has a special place in Buddhist teachings.
But Buddhism is not meant only for countries where elephants are to be found. The dismal following of the doctrine in this island are giving this sublime philosophy a reputation totally undeserved. They do this at their peril. For it is said that the elephant is a noble creature with a long memory.

Maldives lifts state of emergency
The Maldives government announced on Tuesday an end to a state of emergency, which was imposed last week after an alleged attempt to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen.

Maldives lifts State of Emergency with immediate effect, the foreign ministry said on Twitter.

Pleased that this matter has been dealt with so swiftly. Country back on a more normal footing, foreign minister Dunya Maumoon said in a separate post.

Yameen imposed the state of emergency last on Wednesday in a move that gave wider powers to police and armed forces to arrest and suspending freedom of assembly and movement.

The Maldives, a popular destination for honeymooners, has been rocked by political unrest in recent months, which reached new heights last week when vice president Ahmed Adeeb was impeached.

Adeeb, whose predecessor was also impeached in July, has been accused of high treason over an explosion on the presidential speedboat in September that left Yameen unhurt but injured his wife and one of his bodyguards.

Megacities hit hard by surging sea levels
France: Large swathes of Shanghai, Mumbai, New York and other cities will slip under the waves even if an upcoming climate summit limits global warming to two degrees Celsius, scientists reported Sunday.
A 2 C spike in Earth's temperature would submerge land currently occupied by 280 million people, while an increase of 4 C -- humanity's current trajectory -- would cover areas lived on by more than 600 million, the study said. Two degrees Celsius warming will pose a long-term, existential danger to many great coastal cities and regions, said lead author Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central, a US-based research group.
Sea level rises corresponding to these 2 C or 4 C scenarios could unfold in two hundred years, but would more likely happen over many centuries, perhaps as long as 2,000 years, according to the research, published by Climate Central.
Capping the rise in Earth's temperatures to 2 C above pre-industrial levels is the core goal of the 195-nation UN climate summit in Paris from November 30 to December 11. The most effective way to slow global warming is to slash the output of the greenhouse gases which drive it. But even if emissions reduction pledges -- many of them conditioned on financial aid -- submitted by 150 nations ahead of the Paris summit are fulfilled, it would still put us on a pathway for a 3 C world, the United Nations has warned.
Achieving the two-degree goal remains a serious challenge. Strauss and colleagues apply on a global scale the same methodology they used for a recent study that focused on temperature-linked sea level rise in the United States, published in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
That study concluded that both Miami and New Orleans are doomed to crippling impacts.
In the new report, the country hit hardest by sea level rise under a 4 C scenario is China.
Today, some 145 million people live in Chinese cities and coastal areas that would eventually become ocean were temperatures to climb that high.

The names Bond James Bond..
A suave, smart, sophisticated, eloquent, absurdly charming, utterly ruthless assassin who oozed testosterone-fuelled heterosexual pheromones from every pore. - Piers Morgan 007, the quintessential spy! We all know him, some of us probably want(ed) to be him. Whatever he does, be it drinking a vodka martini, caught in the midst of combat, or trying to get information from the antagonists wife, he does it with such a flare, and with such charisma, that it leaves you wondering, I wish I could do that. Honestly, I am a big fan of Mr. Bond. My favourite actors who have taken the role are Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.
When I was about 8 years old, I saw my first Bond movie (Casino Royal), and as any small boy would think, the experience cannot be described in words. This was Britains finest secret agent, with all the spy filled galore you could imagine. It was Daniel Craigs debut as Bond, he wasnt well received by some, but he took some time getting used to. He brought out the ruthless and realistic side of Bond, which most audiences werent used to seeing.
Secret agents
His creator, Ian Fleming, served in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II. According to Ian, Bond was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types he met during the war, James himself being a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming got the name James Bond during his stay in the Caribbean. it was the name of an author of a bird book (Field Guide: Birds of the West Indies). He says that he chose the name because he wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name he could find.
James leads an interesting lifestyle. He was well dressed, Oxford educated, a master gambler, good with women, and even better with guns. Q, or Quartermaster, always supplied Bond with gadgets to suit every occasion. He always had fancy cars, which could drive themselves. They had bulletproof windows, well equipped with military grade weapons and so on. He had the craziest gadgets you could think of: a dagger in his shoe, Deadly Rolexs and Omega wristwatches, belts with grapple hooks, and Smart Phones before they existed.
Bond himself was quite the man. If youve ever watched the older movies, youd see that he rarely gets hurt, and never gets too extreme in fighting. Youd probably never see a human side to him either. Thats what I really like about Craig coming into the series. He brings about the raw character, without any icing on top. For once Bonds car isnt equipped with unrealistic gadgets, it is very much penetrable. He himself only carries a smartphone and his signature Walther PPK pistol.
First mission
Casino Royale was his debut novel, and in it is Bonds first field mission. He had just acquired his double o (007) status. As the story follows, Bond, like all humans, falls in love with somebody, Vesper Lynd, to the point where he hands over his resignation to M, and they both settle down in Venice. Bond met Vesper as part of his mission. But to his dismay she betrays him at the end, and as she cant deal with the guilt, Vesper commits suicide, leaving Bond heartbroken. Well he is human too, and is susceptible to all the feelings that come with being human, and after Vesper, he has resorted to only having casual flings with women he meets.
Personally, I like following the new (modern) Bond universe rather than the old one. In the old one, Bond does get married and unfortunately his wife dies during their drive to the honeymoon, as depicted in On Her Majestys Secret Service 1969 with George Lazenby.
When Pierce or Sean engage in a fight or anything of the sort, it always stayed clean and Bond doesnt get hurt much. But with Daniel, you get to see the emotions of Bond, what this so-called super spy goes through, the struggles, and the problems.
He isnt invincible, he makes Bond more rational, as he does get hurt (very much), he does bleed and the fights get very violent.
Shooting skills
The last movie Skyfall, which came out in 2012, also marked the 50th Anniversary of Bond. Daniel reprises his role as Bond and somehow loses his shooting skills, and ends up failing both his physical and psychological examinations. And towards the end you see the final face-off at his family estate Skyfall, in Scotland. Bond, M and Kincade (the Skyfall gamekeeper) face off against Silva and his men, using just booby traps, one or two hunting rifles, and brains.
James Bond is a universally loved hero. Hes an artifact from the Cold War (as said by M), master of all traits, lover and a fighter, and he has evolved to fit the modern era without succumbing to being Politically Correct. Bond epitomizes everything awesome.
This super spy has been portrayed by seven actors on the big screen, all of whom have added their unique style to the character. In my opinion the best is Daniel Craigs avatar. With the release of Spectre, Im looking forward to seeing the British spy whom we all love back in action.
Personally I still wouldnt mind being a spy, hear that Mi6

Overseas, Spectre rakes in $117.8 million
James Bond and Charlie Browns gang re-energized the North American box office after a dismal few weekends.
Spectre launched to $73 million from 3,972 theaters, the second-biggest opening for any film in the iconic spy franchise, and one of the top showings of the year to date. Still, some had expected the tentpole to approach $80 million domestically. Overseas, Spectre also dominated, grossing $117.8 million from 76 markets for a global weekend take of $190.8 million and early worldwide total of $300 million. It placed No. 1 everywhere.
The Peanuts Movie, looking to launch a new family film franchise, opened to $45 million from 3,897 locations, a solid start considering newer generations arent necessarily familiar with the late Charles M. Schulzs famous comic strip. Overall revenue for the weekend is expected to clock in at $162 million, a record for the first full weekend of November. Thats good news for Hollywood following a string of high-profile misses.
Peanuts only launched in a few foreign markets this weekend, including China, where it opened to a poor $2.8 million amid fierce competition. Fellow Fox title Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials and Universals Everest also debuted in China, earning $19.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively. (There were also two Chinese films that debuted.)
Spectre  James Bonds 24th trip to theaters  couldnt match the $88.4 million domestic debut of Skyfall in November 2012, a series best, but beat the openings of Casino Royale ($40.8 million) and Quantum of Solace ($67.5 million). All four films star Daniel Craig as 007.
Sony, MGM and Eon Productions, partners on the tentpole, say Spectre faced more competition domestically than Skyfall, which had the weekend to itself in terms of new releases. Its a fantastic start, said Sony worldwide distribution president Rory Bruer. On every continent  including Latin America, Asia and Europe  it is breaking Skyfall records.
Spectre outperformed Skyfalls opening in Mexico ($4.5 million), Brazil ($2.9 million), Russia ($5.8 million), Hong Kong ($2.4 million) and Malaysia ($2.3 million). It opened to a massive $20.1 million in Germany  on par with Skyfall  nabbing the biggest Saturday of all time. Spectre has yet to open in China, Japan, Australia and France.
And, after making history in the U.K. with the biggest opening of all time, Spectre fell just 29 percent in its second weekend of play there to jump the $100 million mark and put it ahead of Skyfall. Hollywood Reporter

Agora
Pointless spectacle
Sleepy is a term which best describes Alejandro Amenabars Agora. This bland epic centers around free thinkers in the ancient times. Set in Alexandria, Agora opens to its protagonist, Hypatia, teaching science to a group of youth. The movie highlights her struggle to save the knowledge of the ancients and her attempt to remain neutral with her students who come from all walks of life: Jewish, Christian, and Pagan. Agora also delves into heliocentric model of the universe.
Agora recounts the last days of Classical Antiquity in Roman Egypt. The movie unfurls just before Alexandrias legendary library was destroyed. Despite the sad fact that much of Agora is, in some way or another, concerned with marauding Jesus freaks, their religious beliefs are ultimately a very prominent red herring. Religious differences necessarily lead to arbitrary conflicts, as in the way that members of the pagan gentry mock and eventually set out to lynch their Christian brothers before they themselves wind up being attacked by hordes of the feisty monotheists, who have the Roman government and army supporting them.
Romantic intrigue
The Alexandrian library was destroyed because nobody listened to reason, which in this case is conflated with science. The forces of unreason, in this case proto-crazy Christians, are to blame and the eggheads were right all along. Sadly, knowledge of Aristarchuss heliocentric model of the galaxy doesnt make Agora watchable.
Listless romantic intrigue is another feature in the movie. Though it adds some interest to the plot, our curiosity fades away quickly. It lacks the conviction needed in a movie of this nature where new theories come to light and science and morality come to the fore. Though the underlying message is that it is philosophy, not religion, which is the great communicator.
Confrontations with angry Christian mobs that stones Jews because the Good Book tells them to is though provoking to a certain extent. However that aspect too gets lost in the sequences that follow. Nobody heeds Hypatias sage advice except for her father and her suitor, Orestes. However Hypatia has little time for men. She ridicules Orestes while her other love interest, her slave Davus, is mocked too. She is too obsessed with trying to find the earths place in the universe. Davus is torn between his faith and his love for Hypatia. Hypatia forgives him for his transgression against her and frees him as a slave.
Plot strands
Amenbars camera swoops through a city in tumult, rendered with hand-built sets as well as CGI, as Hypatia and her students are drawn into the maelstrom. Some characters are too thin to tie up the plot strands.
As a result of this, the ending is nowhere near as powerful as it should have been. It is unfortunate that a talented actress like Rachel Weisz had not given much to do but look good in a toga. Agora is high minded and ambitious. But it lacks the essence which is needed to make it an ace movie. Pointless!

Romanian President meets protesters as fire toll mounts
ROMANIA: Romania's president appealed for protesters support on Sunday in reforming the country, as the death toll rose to 45 from a horrific nightclub fire that brought down the government.
Klaus Iohannis was met with shouted slogans and whistles from demonstrators seeking profound change as he paid a visit to the capital's University Square, the focal point of nearly a week of protests.
It is only together that we can make this change, neither you alone, nor I alone can do it, Iohannis told the several hundred-strong crowd on the sixth consecutive night of demonstrations.
Thousands of Romanians have taken to the streets in mass anti-government protests since the deadly October 30 blaze at the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest, which also left scores injured.
Many viewed compromised safety standards at the club as emblematic of a wider problem with rampant corruption in one of the European Union's poorest nations.
Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who had been under pressure for weeks as he goes on trial on corruption charges, quit on Wednesday, saying it was right for top officials to take responsibility for the tragedy.
Among the latest victims of the fire to succumb to their injuries on Sunday was the drummer of a local hard rock group, who had been on stage when the inferno broke out and who was about to be transferred to a Swiss hospital for treatment.The fire broke out when fireworks let off during a rock band's performance triggered a blaze and a stampede as panicked revellers tried to flee.
Initial investigations suggest numerous breaches of the safety rules at the club, including a lack of emergency exits and the fact that flammable materials were used for sound insulation.
The club's three bosses, detained since Tuesday on manslaughter charges, did not have the authorisation to host concerts, let alone pyrotechnic shows.

Russia, China are challenging the world order  US Defence Sec
US: The US military do not seek a new Cold War but it is determined to oppose the rising global powers  Russia and China  to protect the US-dominated international order, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said.
Carter accused Russia of nuclear saber-rattling and violating sovereignty of US allies at the Reagan National Defence Forum in California, AP reported Saturday.
He put Russia and China in the same league as Islamic State (IS) when listing Americas top-ranked bogeymen.
Terror elements like IS, of course, stand entirely opposed to our values. But other challenges are more complicated, and given their size and capabilities, potentially more damaging, he said.
Some actors appear intent on eroding these principles and undercutting the international order that helps enforce them Of course, neither Russia nor China can overturn that order. But both present different challenges for it, he said.
Russia and China are challenging American pre-eminence and Washingtons so-called stewardship of the world order as they reassert themselves on the international arena as serious military powers, he said.
According to Carter, their challenging activities can be seen at every possible level, be it at sea, in the air, in space  or even in cyberspace.
Most disturbing for the US official, however, is what he called Moscows nuclear saber-rattling, which in his view raises questions about Russian leaders commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons.
He may be referring to a recent Russian reaction to US plans to deploy advanced nuclear bombs at the Bchel Air Base in Germany, part of a joint NATO nuclear sharing program which involves non-nuclear NATO states hosting more than 200 US nuclear warheads.
The Kremlin then said the new US nukes deployed in Europe would destroy the strategic balance in the region and force Russia to take similar measures.
Although, in this contest, the US appears to be pushing Russia toward arms race, Carter thinks the other way.

They say diamonds are a girls best friend. However for Glenda Parthipan, celebrity perfumes spell passion!
Many know her for her enthusiasm to dress up but what even her close friends do not know about this lady is that she has a rare hobby  collecting celebrity perfumes.
Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Katy Perry, Beyonc and Justin Bieber all stand proudly on Glendas shelf, cherished and preserved in their own unique aroma.
All of them are gifts given to me by loved ones. The first in the collection was the J Lo perfume which I got three years ago, said Glenda, the founder and managing director of Emphasis, a leading PR and Event Management company in the city.
A true socialite, Glenda is a familiar face in all the top events happening in town, even if she is not part of the organizing committee. Many pictures of her in alluring attire and accessories have been splashed across all the main newspapers and magazines in the country. Many have oohed and aahed over the vibrant colours of sarees and dresses matched with enthralling accessories she carries off effortlessly.
It is a personal feel good factor to be wearing one of these branded perfumes along with an outfit. It completes the look and compliments the one who wears it beautifully, Glenda says.
She added that she does not have a special favourite in her collection. She loves all of them since each comprises a different fragrance and goes with diverse moods. Some have identified the perfume she wears and this has often given a boost to her happiness.
It is an age-old enterprising streak among celebs to cash in on their global fame and image by launching fashion and lifestyle merchandise under their name. Clothes, accessories, shoes, bags and cosmetics are some of the products which have the names of globally well known faces. Perfumes are one of the items that many celebs vie to give their name to. Not only are they one of the most elegant products in the market but who wouldnt like to associate themselves with such a divine smelling product For fans, it is just a matter of taking home a piece of their favourite celebrity, albeit just their name on the tag.
While many actors before her endorsed perfumes, celebrity Sophia Loren launched her own brand under her name in 1981. The iconic beautys perfume was floral with dominant notes of jasmine and rose. Bling and drama queen Elizabeth Taylors White Diamonds is one of the top selling perfumes in the world ever since it made itself to the market in 1991. Other best sellers include Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, Diavolo by Antonio Banderas, Homme by David Beckham, Heat by Beyonce and S2 by Shilpa Shetty.

Brangelinas vanity project By The Sea
Sink or swim 
The first American reviews have arrived for By The Sea, the third directorial outing of Angelina Jolie Pitt (this is the actress has used her husbands surname on a billing), which was screened at the AFI Film Festival in Hollywood last night.
Written, directed and starring Jolie Pitt, and featuring Brad Pitt opposite her, it focuses on Vanessa and Roland, a married couple who stay at a French hotel and try to get through their inability to engage and writers block respectively. The programme notes to the film at the AFI Film Festival said it was inspired by European cinema and theatre of the 1960s and 1970s, and early reviews have had trouble with the films slow pace and lack of incident. The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy, in the most damning of its reviews, said By The Sea was the kind of vanity project you dont see much of anymore.
Is By The Sea Brangelinas own version of the similarly sun-kissed Swept Away the notorious 2002 flop starring Madonna and directed by her then husband Guy Ritchie
Alonso Duralde - The Wrap
Angelina Jolie Pitts reputation as a competent filmmaker wont be entirely undone by her third directorial effort, By the Sea, but neither will it be enhanced [it] plays like an unconscious parody of [...] any number of other 1960s European dramas about beautiful people having existential crises on yachts and in villas If By the Sea werent so aggressively humorless, it might almost qualify as camp.
Tim Gray  Variety
After the premiere, one partygoer said, Good for her, she got this movie made. Yes, absolutely good for her. But awards voters may feel thats reward enough People will love or hate the film, but it does exactly what it set out to do. All the work is commendable, including the performances by the two leads, cinematography by Christian Berger, costume design by Ellen Mirojnick and music by Gabriel Yared.
Todd McCarthy - Hollywood Reporter
Met with a tepid response at the opening night of this years AFI Film Festival, this languid piece of would-be art cinema will prove once again that even the biggest names in the world wont draw an audience to something that, in and of itself, has no reason for being.
Tim Grierson - Screen Daily
By The Seas decidedly languid air may keep the film from connecting with mainstream audiences, who will balk at the deliberate pacing and strong scent of ennui.
Also adding to the commercial hurdles, the movie doesnt look likely to garner rhapsodic reviews or award-season nominations, further hampering its word-of-mouth potential.

Sri Lanka a very giving nation according to survey
Sri Lanka has been ranked 8 in the World Giving Index 2015 a global view of giving trends conducted by the Charities Aid Foundation. It was ranked 9th in the top 20 countries in the 4 year (2010-2014) World Giving Index, with score and participation in giving behaviours of each country.

The survey which was conducted on 135 countries looked into how each country volunteered time, assistance to those who needed it as well as donated money.

Myanmar was ranked 1 in the survey while the United States was ranked 2, United Kingdom was ranked 6. Further Sri Lanka received a World Giving Index Score of 56% while, Myanmar scored 66 and USA scored 61%.

However Sri Lanka came in second in Volunteering Time Score with 48 % in the top 20 while Myanmar scored 50%, the United States scored 44% while the United Kingdom scored the lowest in that segment with 32% in the top ten. In another segment of the survey, the Donating money score Myanmar scored 92% while Sri Lanka scored 59%.

It was further reported that following a religious philosophy was also a factor in driving donations, with two countries with a Theravada Buddhist community ranking 1 (Myanmar) and 8 (Sri Lanka).

Further in the WGI report released in 2014 it was noted that ; Nine out of ten people within Myanmar follow the Theravada school of Buddhism, 8 under which the lives of the Sangha (ordained monks and nuns) are supported by dana (charitable giving) by lay followers of the religion. This clearly translates into a strong culture of charity, with Myanmar ranked first for donating money and 13 percentage points ahead of the second placed country. Sri Lanka, another country with a strong Theravada Buddhist community, 9 also ranked within the Top 10 of the World Giving Index (placed 9th). According to the survey 69% of Sri Lankans follow Theravada Buddhism.

It was further noted that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country did not in most part affect the giving behaviour as only few countries with a very high GDP and considered developed nations making it to the top 20.

Stop character assassinating Soysa, urge family members
The family of Guinness record holder and night club owner Wasantha Soysa called upon social websites to stop character assassinating Soysa by trying to depict the main suspect in the killing as a hero.
Addressing a press conference held at Soysa's Panorama Club in Anuradhapura, they said certain websites were trying to portray a wrong picture about Soysa depicting him as a person who engaged in illegal and unauthorised activities. Soysa's son Gisara said he would challenge anyone to prove that his father had assualted him or her during his career.
He alleged that certain media institutions criticised and ttacked his father even before his body was brought home. Gisara said he was thankful to the Police for taking steps to apprehend the culprits behind the murder within a week. Soysa's daughter Sharmini said family members were in deep mental distress over the wrong picture created about their father by certain sections of the media.
Soysa's sister Nirupama Rajapaksa said her brother engaged in business activities since 1997.
"He engaged in business according to the country's laws and regulations paying all taxes and other dues promptly. Despite this, some sections of the media were trying to portray him as an illegal businessman," she said.
Soysa's brother, Anura Soysa attached to an Australian University said he regretted to see certain sections of the media trying to portray his brother as a criminal and the main suspect in the killing as a hero.
"Certain sections of the media are trying to engage in sensationalism without trying to recheck information to seek the truth," he said.

On target infantbambino piss-tolero!
So what is it about little boys You know I have nothing against them. I used to be one. In fact, some would say that I never really stopped being one. But the things they do and say make me want to blush!
Yes boys decidedly are an intriguing bundle of contradictions. They grow into men, but at some level, boys remain boys. They never shed their fetishes - be it games, gadgets or girls.
My paternal aunt Therese was the last to marry among my Dads siblings. Until she did and had two girls of her own she took it upon herself to parent us De Rosayro boys. Now raising an untamed bunch of hellions was no easy enterprise. She often lamented that raising the family boys had been like raising wild animals. Some days were better, some days worse, but all days were wild.
There were times she would chase us around the garden like a bounty hunter, capture us and drag us to the washroom where she would soak us and scrub the dust and grime off us with sadistic glee.
My little sister and the younger girl cousins would witness the roundup drama with a perverse delight while chanting the sexist nursery rhyme: Frogs and Snails and Puppy Dog Tails... That is What Little boys are made of. When she had done with us we were all glowing and a couple of complexions lighter. That was when she would hug us and say: Filthy but adorable, naughty yet angelic, strong yet helpless.
She always referred to us as paradoxes, heaping hugs and kisses on us and treating us to some of her super delectable pastries and cakes. Aunt Therese was a great raconteur and never failed to recount the story of how she had taken me for Sunday mass when I was four and a half. It seems she had slipped me a coin just as the ushers were coming round for the collection. I pocketed it. When they neared the pew where we sat I was supposed to have uttered these immortal words: Do not pay for me Aunty Therro, I am under five. She says that everyone within hearing distance had gone into titters.
Although she looked after a mixed menagerie of nephews and nieces before making her own contribution of two girls to the clan you could tell she missed the presence of the boys. She would often complain that those who had girl only households were not aware of the fun they were missing in this department.
My brother two cousins and I were booted off to a junior military cadet school at Diyatalawa during the school vacation. But two days later we were all back at home. It turned out that the military did not generally approve of rebellious rapscallions raising the commanding officers boxer shorts on the flagpole before morning parade.
A really funny thing happened recently when I was asked by a niece whether I could take her turn at the school her son attended for playground duty.
I agreed and was keeping a watchful eye on them when a group of four-year-olds came up to me and said that an angry child had and had used the C word on them.
I figured this was quite a serious infringement of language law in the school so asked them to send the lad over to me. He came over looking anxious and I asked him if he had any idea why I had called him over. After a few moments of him telling me how the others had been annoying him, I interrupted and asked if he had used bad language
He admitted that he had. So I went further and asked: Did you use the C word Again he replied that yes he had. I then gave him a talk about using bad language in the playground and how I would have to punish him for using it.
He replied meekly that he knew he was going to be in trouble, then suddenly burst out that he did not know Crap was such a bad word ! Trying hard not to laugh I asked the others if that was the word they had heard. And yes, they confirmed it was. So I told him that on this occasion I would not punish him but to desist from using such language again. He apologised and ran off, leaving me fit to burst with laughter.
My Aunt Therese always referred to her nephews as My boys! She once wrote to my mother: My boys have been a source of entertainment since the day they were born! I mean, literally! But that Gaston of ours has always been the over the top kid. He is usually the centre of attention, because he commands it.
The letter went on to remind my mother about my birth: In the middle of pushing, we had to wait 30 minutes for him to take a nap in your womb. The nurse said he was probably tired! Yeah right, who was not tired Minutes old , we heard this screaming coming from the nurses. We all freaked out because we thought something was horribly wrong with our brand new baby. The doctor asked what the problem was and they tell him our beautiful, innocent child had christened them, if you get my drift.
Aunt Therese would embarrass the masculine runts in the family by quickly making everyone fully aware of the power of number one. She said that she would carry us home from the hospital completely bundled. Upon removal of the diaper, liquid would hit the target with unerring accuracy. She boasted that she had learned to duck the unwanted baby shower facials. Being an aunt to a horde of beastly little boy bounders from the time they were infants conditions one to know when to get the heck out of the overflow.
She quipped: Boy, oh boy! What long-range piss-toleros my boys are!

Deepavali the Hindu Festival of Lights
Triumph of good over evil
Today is the festival of lights in the Tamil Hindu Calendar; Deepavali.
Celebrations and pujas will be held throughout the day at temples and homes while the night time would be reserved for the lighting of lamps and firecrackers. The festival celebrates the triumph of good over evil, in the form of Lord Krishna vanquishing the demon Narakasura.
Hence this festival is celebrated with lights to showcase the ushering in an era of light after an era of darkness.
Narakasura according to South Indian and Sri Lankan Hindu mythology (there are other versions in other regions of India), is said to be the son of Mother Earth (Bhudevi) and Lord Vishnu in one of his incarnations as a boar (Varaha). He had boons and blessings from both his powerful parents forecasting that he would be a mighty and invincible warrior who would live a long and victorious life. Unfortunately, he fell into bad company and used the prowess invested in him for the propagation of evil rather than good.
Lord Vishnu
Having conquered the whole of earth, he then set his sights on Swarloga (heaven), making even that place hellish for its inhabitants. Indra, the king of heaven could not withstand the demons onslaught and sought the help of Lord Vishnu. Vishnu promised to take care of the matter in his incarnation on earth as Krishna.
Thus it was, long years later that Lord Krishna took on Narakasura who had been plaguing earth and heaven for eons and subdued him, eventually killing him. Before he died, Narakasura is said to have repented and asked that his death anniversary be marked; hence Deepavali.
The people of Earth and the devas (celestial beings) of Heaven are said to have celebrated with firecrackers and light as soon as Narakasuras death was announced, and the tradition continues to this day.
Hindus observing this festival today would have got up before sunrise to have a traditional oil bath, complete with organic home-made shampoos of arappu or shikakai (in rural villages, this is still the practice. The shampoos are made of ground local herbs). There will be much making and distributing of sweetmeats and savouries during the day.
People would have spring-cleaned their houses over the previous days in anticipation of this event, which is supposed to harbinger brightness and prosperity. Hindu temples all over the country will be thronging today with people decked out in fine new clothes carrying puja baskets. Even those who dont attend temples regularly will be making a point of paying their respects to God today.
Hindu houses
The rows of lamps lit for Deepavali is not so much a facet observed in Sri Lanka as it is in India. Here, it is the festival of Karthikai Deepam (dedicated to Lord Murugan) that is celebrated as the festival of lights, more prevalently. Karthikai Deepam this year is falling a few days from now on November 25.
Nevertheless, Deepavali which is much celebrated in India as the festival of light, is gaining prominence in Sri Lanka too with many Hindu houses now lighting rows of lamps in the evening. Firecrackers will be going off throughout the night, a facet that worries many elderly people and animal lovers. Youths all over Sri Lanka love to celebrate with firecrackers; vendors of the crackers would have been doing brisk business over the past few days. These are undeniably colourful and cheerful aspects of the celebrations but their side-effects also need to be considered. Pet owners out there, be careful of your pets well being today.
A community of people are happy and celebrating. May their happiness and well-wishes rub off on everybody. In this celebration of light over evil, may all beings be happy.

By expressing his views fearlessly on National, social and political problems displayed a great sense of learning. During the past several years he rallied the entire civil society behind a great struggle to strengthen and protect democracy and take the country towards a new direction.
The effort taken by him to socialise his ideas including the eradication of communalism helped to bring about far reaching changes in the political culture in this country. He not only played a leading role in the field of the progressive struggle but also stood for the religious harmony in this country.
His untimely demise was a great loss to all communities and religions in this country. May the Ven Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera attain the eternal bliss of Nibbana!

From Victoria Beckham to Erdem: the British Fashion Awards nominees
Victoria Beckham and Jourdan Dunn are among those in the running for gongs at this years British Fashion Awards
Hidden in the small print of the list of nominees for this years British Fashion Awards comes official endorsement of Victoria Beckhams entry into the top tier of the industry: Beckham is one of the three candidates for this years top gong of womenswear designer of the year.
Beckham has twice previously been awarded brand of the year, in 2011 and 2014, and is a three-times nominee for the same award, but this is her first shot at the main prize. Seven years after her first collection, it represents acknowledgment of her label as a creative force as well as a commercial one.
JW Anderson, the 31-year-old Northern Irish designer who has been a trailblazer in the burgeoning trend for gender-neutral fashion, putting skirts on men as well as mens shirts on women, was fittingly rewarded for his efforts with nominations in the categories for both womenswear and menswear designer of the year, a double coup that reflects how influential his androgynous aesthetic has been. Christopher Kane is the third nominee in the womenswear category, while E Tautz and Tom Ford join Anderson on the menswear shortlist. Although Ford is not currently staging shows in London, his label is eligible because the business is based here.
The high profile of the Alexander McQueen label in the same year that the Savage Beauty exhibition staged a record-breaking run at the V&A is echoed in a nomination for brand of the year. Models in the running for a prize include Malaika Firth, Jourdan Dunn and Georgia May Jagger, which is good news for diversity.
One notable absence  and one that the brand will be hoping to rectify at the 2016 awards  is Mulberry. Once an omnipresent name in British fashion, Mulberry is currently running a low profile, but it is expected to present a new collection by recently arrived creative designer Johnny Coca in February.
Four names have two nominations apiece: Kane, Ford, Anderson and previous womenswear designer of the year Erdem. The winners will be announced at a ceremony at the London Coliseum on 23 November.
