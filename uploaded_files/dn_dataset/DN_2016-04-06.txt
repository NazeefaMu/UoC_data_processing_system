UNP Working Committee reshuffle only after amendments to party constitution - Prof. Marasinghe
Whilst rumours of a UNP Working Committee reshuffle are on the cards, Head of the Strategic Political Bureau of the UNP, Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said that it would only be possible after amendments to the UNP constitution have been introduced.
'It is not likely that such an event would take place soon,' Prof. Marasinghe said.
Last week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would introduce a new constitution to the UNP by September this year as the country itself looks towards a new constitution.
He also emphasized on the need to groom more second and third level leaders in the UNP.
The Prime Minister however is to leave on a three day visit to Beijing on Wednesday to work on several trade agreements with China. Several newly introduced positions to the Working Committee are rumoured to face some change.

Brathwaites exploits buoy Delhi Daredevils

Carlos Brathwaites assault on Ben Stokes on Sunday (April 3) not only overwhelmed West Indian fans, it also had a few people in the Delhi Daredevils team management purring in delight as their INR 4.2 crore pick for this years IPL stole the limelight at the Eden Gardens. Brathwaite, an allrounder, also excelled with the ball in the final, returning figures of 3 for 23. However, it was his batting that had prompted the Daredevils management to shell out a fortune for the player. The team think-tank was swayed after watching his hitting skills on Youtube.
It is ironical that the 27-year old shot to fame on Sunday with his batting, something that had became his second skill as he moved up the ranks in domestic cricket. He has 88 first-class wickets at an average of 22.93 in 38 matches while he has scored 1471 runs at an average of 27.24 with just one century. Brathwaite started off as a batsman in junior cricket but made it to the West Indies team last November riding on his skills with the ball primarily.
Hemant Dua, Daredevils CEO, hopes Brathwaites overnight stardom will help the fans connect more with a team which has been languishing at the bottom of the table over the past two seasons. Be it David Warner, Glenn Maxwell or Andre Russell, Daredevils have a history of unearthing talent from other countries and giving them a platform. But often, the franchise has also let go of the services of these very stars after just a season or two. I dont want to comment on the past. But we hope we build a strong base for the future this time, Dua told TOI on Monday.
Brathwaites new-found stardom and the price paid for him will have the team management under pressure to play him in every match in IPL. Every player will play on merit. The price tag means nothing here. It was his (Brathwaite) day and he performed in the World T20 final. In T20, as West Indies have shown, every other player has to come to the party in every match, Dua reckoned.

Sarfraz Ahmed named Pakistan's T20 captain

Flamboyant wicketkeeper batsman Sarfraz Ahmed has been named as the new captain of Pakistan's Twenty20 International (T20I) team, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced via a media release on Tuesday (April 5). Sarfraz takes over the reins of the side from incumbent skipper Shahid Afridi who stepped down after the team's lacklustre World T20 campaign in India.
Calls for elevating Sarfraz to a leadership role gathered steam in the wake of the national team's ignominious Super 10 exit in the showpiece T20 event. The 28-year-old had impressed as captain during the inaugural season of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), guiding an unfancied Quetta Gladiators to the final of the tournament.
While Sarfraz's appointment was along expected lines, the timing of the announcement is a touch surprising considering Pakistan's next T20I assignment is only in September.
"I spoke to Sarfraz this morning and conveyed to him that he was our natural choice for this position. His appointment is open-ended.
I wish him good luck in his new role," PCB Chairman Shaharyar Khan said.
Sarfraz, an experienced T20 player, has scored 1375 runs at an average of 28.06. He has also represented the national side 21 times, scoring 291 runs and effecting 11 dismissals. The aggressive batsman began 2016 with a string of good scores on the tour of New Zealand and in the Asia Cup but his position in the lower middle-order restricted his contribution to a measly 21 runs from 17 balls in three innings at the T20 World Cup.

Aravinda takes responsibility for Sri Lanka's poor display

The Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Selection Committee Aravinda De Silva said that he takes responsibility for Sri Lanka's poor display at the world Twenty20 tournament which concluded on Sunday in India. There were a lot of internal problems in the national team which may have resulted in Sri Lanka's inability to enter the semi-finals.
Aravinda made these remarks while addressing a seminar on Sri Lanka Cricket and its future at the National Library Services Board auditorium yesterday. Replying to an allegation made by Lasith Malinga that he was forced to play in the Twenty20 World Cup, De Silva said that he had received an Email from Lasith Malinga that he was in good health which was the reason why he selected Malinga for the tournament.
Aravinda said that the new selection committee headed by him and comprising Kumar Sangakkara, Romesh Kaluwitarana, Lalith Kaluperuma and Ranjith Madurasinghe was appointed just one day before the deadline for naming of the team for the tournament. We knew that a team had already been selected for the T-20 World Cup but made a few changes to strengthen the team so as the chairman of the selection committee he is taking responsibility for Lanka's poor display.
The former selection committee had picked Dinesh Chandimal as the captain but Chandimal had suggested that Mathews is more suitable to captain the team to the former selection committee but they had rejected it which resulted in a dispute in the team.
When selecting a team for the tournament the captain and coach should be consulted but the coach did not know till the last moment who the captain was.
There was no player in the batting line up who was able to step up the scoring rate. After they arrived in India the team realised that a leg spinner was necessary taking the condition of Indian pitches which are favouring spinners.
Former Sri Lanka Cricket captain and Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga said that a National Policy should be adopted to develop sports in the country. He also said that the coach and the captain of the National Cricket team should not be changed after a new administration takes over. Our duty is to prevent the decline of Sri Lanka Cricket.

Rahul Dravid as head coach of India

The Indian cricket board's advisory committee, comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman, has approached batting legend Rahul Dravid to enquire if he would be interested in taking over as chief coach of the senior national side. Dravid has been in charge of India A and India U-19 squads for almost a year.
The ever-dependable former No. 3 batsman, it is learned, was asked about his availability if such a proposition were to be made in the near future. "Rahul has said he will give it a thought," said a source in the know of the developments. BCCI is keen to have a man who can show the way forward to a bunch of talented young batsmen in the side, especially where Test cricket is concerned. Sources say should Dravid agree to take up the challenge, he is likely to be given a free hand and a long-term contract, possibly extending to the 2019 World Cup.
There is no clarity, however, on ex-cricketer and commentator Ravi Shastri, whose term as India's team director ended with India's campaign in the ongoing World T20. Shastri, it is learnt, is keen on continuing to work with the Indian team but highly-placed sources say he is not being considered for the role of the head-coach. The advisory committee will meet on Tuesday (April 5) to discuss the issue of the chief coach.
Dravid is presently the mentor of the IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils. Before this he led the India Under-19 team to the World Cup final in Bangladesh in February. While playing for Rajasthan Royals earlier, Dravid had also taken up the role of a mentor for the franchise, a job in which he continued even after quitting the game.
BCCI's present mindset can be seen in the backdrop of having watched Dravid seamlessly blend with youngsters across all formats of the game.
Further, with India scheduled to play 18 Test matches between June 2016 and March 2017, a proven-hand like Dravid  a veteran of the game with 164 Test matches and 344 ODIs behind him, makes all the more sense to the board right now.
Neither Dravid nor any of the three-member advisory committee members were available for comment. The board had earlier contacted former Australia batsman Michael Hussey to take up the challenge but the arrangement failed to work out.
In the meantime, BCCI is likely to continue with the services of assistant coach Sanjay Bangar, bowling coach Bharat Arun and fielding coach R Sridhar for now. TNN

Defeated politicians spreading communalism - Mangala

When an attempt was made to expose the misdeeds of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the people who criticised Geneva are headed for the same destination to express their views, which is a joke, declared Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
The minister expressed this view addressing a gathering at the Athaullah Auditorium in Akkaraipattu recently.
Relations of missing persons comprised the gathering. National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganeshan, Jaffna District Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran were also present.
The meeting was preceded by a procession from Alayadivembu DS division to the Athaullah Auditorium.
Minister Samaraweera said those who were defeated by the people are now touring the country spreading communalism and breaking coconuts. Since this did not work, they are now going to Geneva in search of white coloured Gods. "Unlike the former government we who gave various promises, we are dedicated to address the genuine grievances of the people and do the needful. We will not ignore the prime needs of the people".
"We are not afraid of those disgruntled politicians who are trying their level best to topple the government. We will in the near future find solutions to all the problems confronted by the people. We are making necessary arrangements to find out the whereabouts of the people and pay compensation to them wherever necessary".
The minister said they are prepared to do a thorough search of those people who went missing and also make necessary arrangement to pay compensation to their families . They have also appointed a commission to look into the grievances of the families of missing persons .
"Please place before the commission all your grievances," he said.

Amaraweera positive of joint SLFP May Day rally

Fisheries Minister and United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera is positive of the harmonisation of party members on one stage at the upcoming May Day rally.
The minister said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had taken a decision to hold the May Day rally in Galle at the request of party members although Colombo and Badulla were also nominated.
"As far as I know, no decision has been taken by the Joint opposition to hold the May Day rally separately and I hope that the party would not be split into two while holding the May Day rally. If a party member claims that SLFP members in the Joint Opposition are planning to do so, that would be considered as his personal opinion, as a majority of the party members have agreed to hold the rally united under one single party," Amaraweera said.
The minister added that if a party member wants to hold a May Day rally separately, it would directly benefit the United National Party (UNP).
"Hence it would be considered as a statement made with some other intention which is not supportive of the party. No true party member would initiate such an act, " Amaraweera added.
"We have also conducted 12 unofficial discussions with leaders of other parties under the UPFA including Communist Party leader D.E.W. Gunasekera and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardena. They have agreed to get on stage during the May Day Rally," Amaraweera said.

UNP reshuffles senior posts
The United National Party (UNP) has once again reshuffled some senior posts to introduce young blood into the party.
Several old posts in the party have been abolished while introducing new ones. The changes were proposed by UNP leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Working Committee Meeting yesterday. The post of National Organiser has been abolished.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage who held the post has been appointed party Senior Vice Chairman.
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando lost his post as deputy national organiser. Party sources said Fernando may be appointed as Estate Workers' Union chairman.
"My duty is to guide young people to organise the party. We all are now in the government and have more responsibilities. The responsibility of the party should go to the young. Our leader is organising the party accordingly," Gamage said commenting on his appointment.
His wife, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Dr. Anoma Gamage will head 'Lak Vanitha'- the party's women's wing.
Sources said the party leader had also proposed that Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam be appointed as Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya chairman in addition to his role as party Deputy General Secretary, Kavinda Jayawardena as National Youth Front chairman and Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene as Assistant Secretary of the Party and while being in charge of Buddhist affairs.
UNP MP Joseph Michael Perera told the Daily News yesterday that the party leader has proposed these changes to the Working Committee but the abolishing of the national organiser post will only come into effect after it is approved at the National Convention.
The National Convention will be held in September when the UNP is to also discuss a new Constitution for the party. The last time the UNP adopted a new Constitution was in 2010 where Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa was appointed Deputy Leader. In 2014, the Prime Minister introduced the posts of Senior Vice Chairman (Ranjith Madduma Bandara), Assistant Leader (Ravi Karunanayake), Deputy General Secretary (Akila Viraj Kariyawasam), Treasurer (Eran Wickremaratne) and Deputy General Secretary- Elections (Thalatha Athukorala).
UNP MP Kavinga Jayawardena also confirmed that International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe and Lankaputhra Development Bank chairman K.H Lasantha Gunawardena have been newly appointed as members to the UNP Working Committee.
As the newly appointed National Youth Front chairman, Jayawardena said the ideas of the youth were important for the future continuity of the party.
He said they planned to organise a grassroots youth movement to build the next generation of UNPers.
