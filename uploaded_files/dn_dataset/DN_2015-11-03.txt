Referee D Nimal aims to be top gun once again
Now players have good discipline
Rugby refereeing is not for the meek or faint-hearted since a single mistake may be blown out of proportion.
It requires courage and determination for someone to continue serving the game with unbridled joy despite facing tremendous odds.
Dharmapalage Nimals rise to stardom from CR and FC ground boy to top gun is a fascinating story in Sri Lanka rugby folklore.
A man who has never forgotten his humble beginnings, Nimal is growing in stature while keeping his feet firmly on the ground to face the challenges ahead.
Nimal has become a regular at the Lanka Lions Inter-School Tag Rugby Sevens tournament, taking charge of the Cup final between Isipathana and Trinity held in Sharjah recently.
One of four officials who flew in from Colombo for the 11th edition of the tournament, both Nimal and Gamini Indrasena, praised the high standard of tournament and discipline of players.
In Dubai, all players are highly disciplined. The tournament was also well organised, said Indrasena, a former Havelocks player, who also officiated at the Dubai Sevens for four years.
Nimal, a referee for the past 24 years,wants to prove he is still the best in the business.
I have shown that I performed well during the school season. Im hoping to do the same in the club season by refereeing well, said the 43-year-old who was on the verge of quitting three years ago.
That was when he was suspended following a blunder he made during a match between Army and Up Country teams.
I admitted making a mistake. But it kept coming back to me and I wanted to give up, said Nimal who also courted controversy after blowing a Bradby Shield match between Royal and Trinity.
However, having grown up in adversity, Nimal is a fighter.
I took it up as a challenge not to be defeated by that incident. I wanted to prove that I wanted to become a better referee for another two years, recalled Nimal who officiated the Asiad final between Japan and Chinese Taipei in Chinese Taipei in 2006.
No mean feat for someone who studied at Jawatte Central and never played rugby but was infatuated with the oval ball. It also begs the question why more national players prefer coaching than refereeing.
We are saying they (national players) are needed for good of the game but they are trying to avoid. They can also enjoy the game while refereeing. National players take up refereeing and then begin coaching because it is more lucrative, observed Nimal, himself coach of Carey for the past 18 years.
We are trying to promote young referees. In about three years we will have good referees, added Nimal reiterating the need for former national players to take up refereeing.
He reminded those who throw brickbats at local referees that mistakes happen even at the World Cup.
A referee has only two eyes. We do our task in all earnest and enthusiastically. Sometimes referees make small mistakes but please dont put blame on the referee, said Nimal who felt it was coaches who incite players to go against referees.
It is coaches who start attacking referee with their actions on field or when they start shouting on field that the referee has made a wrong decision. And players follow suit by challenging decisions, pointed out Nimal.
After playing for more than one hour, a coach should not blame referee for one mistake. Coaches are responsible for training and tactics. Players have to be blamed if they fail to execute the game plan, he added.
However, Nimal noted a change in attitude of player behaviour during the recent past.
Now players have good discipline. This year, school and club players accepted referees decision when a penalty is awarded. If they respect referees, there would not be any problem. Earlier, they used to yell at the referee and players start fighting among each other. Now when a penalty is given they go back, said Nimal who wants to be the best.

Accolades for veterans
Two veteran musicians who have made their mark in the Sri Lankan music field H M Jayawardena and Thissasiri Perera were felicitated recently at Nelum Pokuna named as Miyasi Theerthaya.
A gamut of artistes sang their hearts out in the evening songs H M and Thissasiri created for them.
Among these artistes were Prof Sanath Nandasiri, T M Jayaratne, Amarasiri Peiris, Bandara Athauda, Edward Jayakody, Divulgane, Kasun Kalhara, W D Ariyasinghe, Sandhya Bulathsinhala, Charitha Priyadharshini and Shashika Nisansala. Mahinda Bandara directed music while Pandit Amaradeva and Nanda Malini too added colour to the occasion.
H M - Thissa felicitation committee comprised with Musicians Navaratne Gamage, Lal Ananda Abeydheera, Ajith Dharshana Jayaweera were behind the scene supporting the endeavour.
H M Jayawardene is a musician whose prowess in music composing was kept on par with maestro Premasiri Khemadasa at times.
In the decade of 70 when a certain song was aired over radio in a silent night one would wonder the music composer and melody maker of the song was Khemadsa. But he would later find H M Jayawardene as the creator of the song. H M was thus known for his haunting melodies and music compositions.
Thissasiri Perera is no exception. His music composing talent is very well known by people in the sphere. "A music type was created by the duo H M and Thissasiri that is in line with the folk music genre in the country. While H M hitting the limelight Tissasiri confining to his shell did his marvels silently over the decades", said Lal Ananda Abeydheera. Navaratne Gamage said Thissasiri's knowledge in music composing is extraordinary.
"He gave me strength and courage to tread on the music path when I came from the drama field. He gave me great advises and tips to sustain my abilities and progress in the field" said Gamage.
"Miyasi Theerthaya felicitation program could be treated as rectifying a national responsibility that has been neglected for a long period", said literary whiz kid and poet Ratnasiri Wijesinghe.

Chastity, thy name is woman!
Are females often bound to committing adultery Are they a weak species who roam in this blue planet and beyond Goddess Paththini brings answers to all these queries. She represents all womenmotherssistersdaughters in this universe who dedicate their lives towards love. Purity and Chastity of a woman is a significant aspect in the disposition of Goddess Paththini.
Prof Sunil Ariyaratnes newest film revolves around birth of Goddess Paththini. The film made in the Blockbuster genre and named as Paththini is produced by Milina Sumathipala. The film trailer, website and collection of songs from Paththini were launched at the Sumathi Court auditorium in Bambalapitiya.
Jagath Sumathipala said his father late U W Sumathipala entered the cinema world by producing Unnath Dahai Malath Dahai featuring Vijeya Kumaratunga. His pursue continued with Ahasin Polowata, Ganga Addara, Duwata Mawaka Misa and Uppalavanna. Ahasin Polowata became the best film in the third world at the Cairo international film fest. Ganga Addara had the privilege to bag highest number of awards locally at the Sarasavi film festival which is a record yet to be broken.
People in our country can still recall songs Upul Nuwan Vidaha and Ganga Addara Maa in Ahasin Polowata and Ganga Addara sung by Milton Mallawarachchchi and Vijeya Kumaratunga.
Sumathi films associated with women centered plots throughout and Paththini is an extension of that trait.
Prof Sunil Ariyaratne speaking at the occasion said a heavy budget was allocated to make the film. He said Paththini revolves around an ancient Indian heroin named Kannagi.
Sri Lankan and Indian contexts value a girls virginity very much. Lal Hegoda once took a picture of a set of delicately stacked clay pots in hazardous vicinity and called it Virginity.
Paththini worshipping tradition was brought to Lanka by King Gajaba. Prof Jananatha Obesekera wrote a comprehensive volume of 600 pages on Goddess Paththini. The Cult of Goddess Paththini was printed by the Chicago University. I wrote Paththini script by associating all these sources, said the Prof.
Paththini the movie will be screened in the EAP circuit from January 31 in 2016 the day that coincides with the sixty ninth birthday of Sinhala cinema.
Local blockbuster films
Prof Ariyaratne said Paththini was made in the blockbuster genre and it will provide filmgoers value for their money. He said the National Film Corporation does not believe in locally made blockbuster films thus NFC uses the same spoon to serve all films alike. They treat Lantin Signor and Paththini alike, said the Prof.
The Profs interpretation on the subject however is questionable. NFC has a responsibility towards safeguarding the industry by handling distribution according to a strategy. Thus NFC may be pampering films like Lantin Signor, Suhada Koka or Gindaree for that matter at this juncture because these types of low-budget films are able to earn profits by screening within this country.
Currently local cinema is in dire straits. Thus the best means of keeping the industry breathing air is to make films that have the ability to penetrate this market which is flooded with mega Hindi, Tamil and Hollywood films. To penetrate a market a product has to be competitive and heavy budgeted products face the challenge when it comes to pricing. The filmgoer will pay one standardized amount to purchase a ticket to see any film across the board.
On the other hand NFC until the distribution network is strengthened is not in a position to allocate comparatively a greater number of halls for a particular cinema. Thus NFC is compelled to striking a balance at this very moment.
Paththini and 70s decade films
With the dawn of 1970 decade local films were made to eat into the market segment of viewers who were addicted to Hindi and Tamil movies. This tactic really worked and Gamini Fonseka became local Rajesh Khanna, MGR or Shivaji Ganeshan while Jothipala and Milton Mallawarachchi became Muhammad Raffi and Kishore Kumar.
Prof Ariyaratne would have used the same tactic in making Paththini. A Hindi blockbuster film like Jodha Akbar in the present context is so popular among local audiences. Even Jodha Akbar tele-serial now being shown on a TV channel has attracted young and adult local audiences. Prof Ariyaratne would have adapted the technique of Jodha Akbar to make Paththini with the object of attracting the same set of viewers to Paththini. If he had done so it is a smart act.
Jagath Sumathipala announced Paththini will be shown in Australian cinema halls and discussions are underway to follow suit with few other Asian countries.
Puja Umashankar, Uddika Premaratne, Aruni Rajapakse and Vinu Siriwardena with a gamut of other artistes have teamed up to make Paththini a reality.
Music composing is by Dr Rohana Weerasinghe. Nanda Malini, Amarasiri Peiris, Nirosha Virajini, Kasun Kalhara, Uresha Ravihari, Saman Lenin and Damayanthi Jayasuriya do the singing. Lyricists are Prof Sunil Ariyaratne and Dr Praneeth Abhayasundera.
Channa Deshapriya has handled the camera while dance choreography is by Chandana Wickramasinghe.
Paththini is produced by Dr Milina Sumathipala and co-produced by Jagath Sumathipala and Thilanga Sumathipala. Production coordinator is A D Ranjit Kumara.
Story rebuilding, script, dialogues and direction of Paththini is by Prof Sunil Ariyaratne.

Happy potter
Matilda Yasawathi, a 74-year old professional potter, has won number of awards and certificates including President's Gold Award in 2008.
Ishara Mudugamuwa
Electrically operated potter's wheel, introduced as an alternative to traditional Sakaporuwa, whirls in rhythmic twirls, while Matilda moulds the pile of raw clay into an artistry of a clay article in a subtle way.
"I have been doing this for as long as I can remember. I learned to make these clay articles when I was schooling. That was in the 1950s," says Matilda, an award-winning master potter while she turns the potter's wheel.
It is interesting to watch how she works. The earthenware takes shape in the hands of Matilda who works with patience and dedication, fashioning the clay placed on the Sakaporuwa (wheel) into an article within seconds.
"From raw clay to finished product, we follow steps such as preparing clay, throwing, forming, trimming, applying guru and polishing, drying, engraving and firing. That has been established over the centuries by potters. Each step in the overall pottery process is an art in itself and every piece of pottery we make is handcrafted.
"Small Kabok stones found in river beds called guru gal is crushed and made into a liquid which is painted on a clay vessel. Once it is dry, a spoke from an umbrella is used to scratch the design," Matilda explained.
"I draw what I like. If I make a mistake, there is no way you can erase it," she added.
Matilda Yasawathi, a 74-year old professional potter, has won number of awards and certificates including President's Gold Award in 2008. She is currently working for the Government Pottery Workshop of the Department of Industries in Western Province, located in Bandarawatte, Biyagama.
Weerasekerapura in Biyagama, a village famous for its artisans of pottery, is Matilda Yasawathi's home. Around 20 kilometers away from Colombo is the hamlet of Weerasekarapura in Biyagama. Driving through the narrow pathways of the village on either side of the road, one witnesses a photogenic landscape of paddy fields, and a cluster of potters practicing earthenware and clay works.
Stacks of finely crafted pottery neatly arranged in stockpiles in front of houses are a common sight that greets anyone who leisurely walks down the road. Making earthenware has been the sole bread and butter earner of the Weerasekarapura villagers for generations.
Inhabited by about 160 households, the village is native to the traditional potter community. Potters of Weerasekarapura, practice this timeless handcraftsmanship as their primary occupation. Gurulettu (earthen vessels used to store water), flower pots, Meti pahan (lamps) are some of the traditional products people master here on potter wheels.
The process of production is usually organic containing mostly natural ingredients, ultimately hand-made and shaped with no mechanical excesses. The basic raw material clay is procured in tractors from fields. Potters normally excavate clay from the riverbanks in the vicinity. But today potters have to face various hardships to find clay due to legal barriers.
Other raw materials required are 'Guru Gal' (small red colour stones) for making the distinctive red colored designs. Firewood, cow dung, bricks, broken pots, are materials used to make 'natural' or 'traditional' ovens for firing earthenware so as to provide this easily broken produce, with high durability.
"There was a time when there were about 168 families in our village doing pottery. But today only about 10 families engage in this business," said K Upali, another master potter from the village.
Pottery being an age old handicraft in Sri Lanka, the roots of the Sri Lankan pottery industry can be traced back to the first century BC. Sri Lanka is dotted with various pottery firms, big and small especially in Galle, Matara, Kegalle, Kandy and Kurungala.
"The pottery industry in Sri Lanka earlier provided mass employment along with betterment of the living standards; both the village and city people comprise the work force of the industry. But unfortunately the art of pottery-making may soon be a thing of the past," says Upali.
It is a small family-run home-based business. Slightly off the Biyagama Road at Bandarawatta Junction, in a long shed behind their home, Upali sits at his 'wheel' turning out pot after pot while his wife applying Guru and polishing them.
"We are facing much difficulty because clay needs a permit now," laments Upali, "earlier our clay pit was always filled with clay. But today we cannot find enough clay to fill it. We have a good market for our products. But we cannot cater this market demand due to the lack of clay." He also added that the quality the final products based on the quality of clay that we use. Unavailability of quality clay has been resulted to the post production losses.
"Last month I lost Rs.10,000 due to the post production damages," said Upali.
Electric potter wheel which was introduced by a Japanese company makes their works easy and efficient. "Earlier, while I made the pots, Upali would turn the wheel," his wife explains of the days when the wheel had to be operated manually. Now only one is needed because they have switched to electricity," She said.
W Jayaweera, another master potter who has been successfully engaged in pottery industry for the past 35 years said that the government assistance is very much needed to do this business and he urged from the relevant authorities to reduce barriers to employment especially legal barriers.
Officer in-charge of the Production and Training centre of Clay Articles located in Bandarawatte, Biyagama, K.A.Weerasena said that the number of potters in the area has gone down because of the low availability of raw materials and young people opting to work in the garment industry.
"Present generation does not like to continue pottery industry as they belong to a particular caste and they do not want to make it public. So they also ask their parents to stop this traditional industry," he said.
When contacted by the Daily News, an Industrial Promotional Officer of the Department of Industries, Western province P.G.Manjula Priyadarshani said that the Production and Training centre of Clay Articles provides designs and service facilities for the individual traditional potters in this village to continue their industry apart from the usual production of the centre.
"We also plan to introduce short term training programmes for young people those who are willing to engage in pottery. We have also introduced new products and designs such as handmade ceramic jewelry production.
We provide drying and firing facilities for villager, at the training centre." She also added that the country's first ever dedicated Pottery Museum has been set up at the Production and Training centre of Clay Articles.
It houses a collection of fascinating pottery items catalogued into 'household items', 'vessels for religious purposes' and 'red clay products for construction.'
"A large number of locals and foreigners especially schoolchildren and university students visit the museum daily. Those who visit the training centre and the museum do not forget to visit the village too. As a result of that the traditional potters in the village would be able to find better market opportunities for their products," She added.

Injured Stokes cant bowl in third Test
England all-rounder Ben Stokes will not bowl any further in the third and final Test against Pakistan after injuring his shoulder, the team spokesman said Monday.
The 24-year-old fell on his right shoulder during the first day's play in the third Test in Sharjah on Sunday while taking a catch and had to walk off the ground in great discomfort.
The England team management had a scan of Stokes's shoulder on Monday before announcing he will be further assessed.
"He (Stokes) has been ruled out of bowling for the rest of the third Test. We will make a decision on batting as and when depending on circumstances. There will be a detailed diagnosis on Tuesday," said the spokesman.
"Its a right shoulder injury and the specialist will be looking at the scan overnight. Our doctor will then talk to him. There is definitely no chance of him bowling. If we need him to bat we will make the decision whenever."
Stokes bowled 11 overs in Pakistan's first innings of 234 without taking a wicket.
England replied strongly with 222-4 after day two, trailing by just 12 runs with six wickets intact.
England will be hoping for a big lead and that Stokes can contribute with the bat in their bids to level the three-match series after losing the second Test in Dubai.
The first Test ended in a draw in Abu Dhabi.

Kiwis take aim at 30-year drought
Highly-rated New Zealand swing pair Tim Southee and Trent Boult will look to put the hosts new-look batting lineup to the sword at the Gabba from Thursday as the tourists chase their first series win in Australia for 30 years.
Without a series triumph in Australia since the halcyon days of Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe in 1985, the Black Caps clearly sense a weakness in Steve Smiths untested team following a raft of retirements.
The post-Ashes departures of former skipper Michael Clarke along with stalwarts Shane Watson, Chris Rogers, Brad Haddin and Ryan Harris have forced selectors to redraft Australias batting, but there are questions over the replacements.
Apart from Smith and his deputy David Warner, the rest of Australias batsmen can muster only a combined 29 Test appearances between Joe Burns (two), Usman Khawaja (nine), Adam Voges (seven), Peter Nevill (four) and Mitchell Marsh (seven).
That makes the Australians vulnerable, particularly if speedsters Southee and Boult get their act together on the bouncy, seaming Gabba pitch.
That might be easier said than done however as Australia reign supreme at the Brisbane ground where they have not lost a Test match since 1988, to Viv Richards mighty West Indies.
The Black Caps have lost six and drawn one of the seven Tests in Queensland since their last win at the Gabba in 1985 when they went on to take the series 2-1.

Mystery of Voyager 1's journey into space solved
US: Scientists have answered why NASA's Voyager 1, when it became the first probe to enter interstellar space in 2012, observed a magnetic field that was inconsistent with that derived from other spacecraft.
Voyager 1 sent back several different indications that it had punched through the edge of our Sun's massive protective bubble inflated by solar wind - the heliosphere - after a 35-year journey.
But the magnetic field data gathered by the spacecraft was not what scientists had expected to see.
"There are still naysayers out there regarding Voyager 1 crossing through the heliopause - the edge of the heliosphere," said astrophysicist Nathan Schwadron of the University of New Hampshire and lead author of the paper. "And the reason for this doubt is that when the spacecraft supposedly broke through the heliopause we should have seen some sort of distinctive shift in the magnetic field from one medium to the other," Mr Schwadron said.
Adding to the mystery, researchers found that the magnetic field direction observed in local interstellar space deviated by an angle of more than 40 degrees from what was expected.
Some scientists posited that this deviation was an indication of Voyager 1 still being embedded in the solar wind inside the heliopause.
Mr Schwadron and colleagues solved the discrepancies using triangulation of four different datasets gathered by other spacecraft, including the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission that in 2009 discovered a mysterious "ribbon" of energy and particles believed to be associated with the interstellar magnetic field.
The scientists discovered that Voyager 1 - like an orienteer through the outer solar system - measures the magnetic field moving the needle on a compass with cardinal directions provided by the IBEX ribbon.
The ribbon centre is the direction of "true magnetic north" for the pristine interstellar magnetic field.
The study shows that the initial direction of the magnetic field observed by Voyager 1 is deflected by the heliopause, like an elastic cord wrapped around a beach ball.
Therefore, the spacecraft is moving through a special region of space where magnetic fields are rotated away from true magnetic north.
This means that while Voyager 1 did cross the heliopause in 2012, it is still travelling through this "muddied" magnetic field region and won't reach the "pristine" region of interstellar space until at least 2025, researchers said.
"Our analysis confirms two things for the first time: that the centre of the IBEX ribbon is the direction of the interstellar magnetic field and, secondly, that Voyager 1 is now beyond the heliopause," Mr Schwadron said.
Scientists now know they will need to wait at least another decade before Voyager enters the region of interstellar space that is beyond the reach of the Sun.

Sisi rubbishes IS claims as 'propaganda'
EGYPT: Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has dismissed as "propaganda" claims by a branch of the Islamic State group that they were responsible downing a Russian plane, the BBC reported Tuesday.
His remarks came as a top US intelligence official said it was "unlikely" IS had been involved in the Kogalymavia airline disaster over the Sinai peninsula that killed 224 people on Saturday.
"When there is propaganda that it crashed because of ISIS, this is one way to damage the stability and security of Egypt and the image of Egypt," Sisi told the BBC. "Believe me, the situation in Sinai -- especially in this limited area -- is under our full control," he added. "All those interested in the matter are welcome to participate in the investigation." Experts say the fact that debris and bodies were strewn over such a wide area points to mid-air disintegration of the aircraft.
On Monday, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he could not rule out IS involvement in Saturday's incident, but thought it "unlikely".
"We don't have any direct evidence of any terrorist involvement yet," he said.
Earlier Monday the airline said the plane had come down due to "external" factors and ruled out any technical failure or human error in the disaster. "The only explanation is some kind of external action," senior Kogalymavia executive Alexander Smirnov told a news conference in Moscow, without elaborating. However, Alexander Neradko, head of Russia's aviation authority, criticised the airline's comments, saying they were "premature and not based on any real facts".
Analysis of the plane's "black boxes", which could solve the mystery of what happened to the doomed jet, is expected to begin on Tuesday, according to Egyptian officials. Analysts have dismissed claims the jet could have been shot down by IS-affiliated groups in the region if it was flying at its cruising height of 30,000 feet (9,000 metres), but did not rule out that a bomb may have been planted on board.

Snapchat more enjoyable than Facebook - Study
US: Snapchat interactions are associated with more enjoyment and positive emotions than Facebook and other social media, according to a new study.
Snapchat is a mobile application known as a form of "ephemeral social media," which are platforms displaying shared content for a limited period of time (eg, 10 seconds).
"On the surface, many people view Snapchat as the 'sexting app,'" said Joseph Bayer, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan and the study's lead author.
"But instead, we found that Snapchat is typically being used to communicate spontaneously with close friends in a new and often more enjoyable way," he said.
"At the same time, Snapchat interactions were perceived as having less social support than other social media. These findings open up important questions about the benefits and costs of different social media," he said.
Mr Bayer and colleagues recruited 154 college students who used smartphones. The study used "experience sampling" - which measures how people think, feel and behave moment-to-moment in their daily lives - to assess the participants' well-being by texting them at random times six times a day for two weeks.
Researchers found that Snapchat interactions are associated with more positive emotions than Facebook and other social technologies.Simultaneously, Snapchat interactions are viewed as less "supportive" than other types of interaction, including Twitter, texting, email, calling and face-to-face.

Tense situation in Parliament
A tense situation erupted in Parliament yesterday as opposition MPs protested inside the Chamber with placards against the Police attack on HNDA students who were protesting near the UGC last Thursday.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a Point of Order demanded to know why the Parliament road had been blocked by the deployment of Police and Army personnel without allowing the protesting students to come to Parliament to present their grievances.
"Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa did away with all barricades for people to visit Parliament because it is the right of the general public to come here. On the contrary, about 500 Police and military personnel have been deployed near Parliament today. We want to know why the Speaker has called to deploy the Army to prevent these student leaders from coming to Parliament to meet us and present their grievances. This is totally undemocratic," MP Gunawardena said. At this point, about 25 Opposition MPs rose from their seats in protest displaying placards which read "Let's condemn Yahapalana police's attack on students," and "Ranil's Police state is sucking the blood of students". The placards carried the line "Joint Opposition" at the bottom.
The MPs who protested holding placards included Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Kumara Welgama, Dullas Alahapperuma, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Niroshan Premaratne, Udaya Gammanpila, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Gamini Lokuge, Jayantha Samaraweera, Rohitha Abegunawardena, Lohan Ratwatte, Roshan Ranasinghe, Namal Rajapaksa, Prasanna Ranaweera, Prasanna Ranatunga, SM Chandrasena, Sisira jayakody, Keheliya Rambukwella and CB Ratnayake.

Voting rights urged for migrant workers
Members of the Ethera Api Organisation of the JVP urged the government to set up a mechanism to protect the rights of foreign employees including the voting right at elections. They handed over a set of proposals to the Speaker in relation to foreign employment, JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti said.
He was addressing media at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday.
Handunnetti added that there should be a mechanism for Sri Lankan expatriates including migrant workers to vote at national elections.
"Even though foreign employees bring the highest amount of foreign exchange to the country they are unable to vote at elections. Apart from giving voting right, the foreign employees should be given other benefits too," he said.
The JVP forwarded suggestions to the Speaker. The Speaker will appoint a select committee in this regard to look in to the issues and suggestions forwarded by the JVP, Handunnetti said.
He said around four million Sri Lankans are employed in foreign countries while another significant number of people leave the country for foreign employment annually.
"Therefore, the government should formulate a mechanism similar to postal voting to grant voting right to foreign employees."
He added that the Ethera Api Organisation requests the government to offer duty free vehicle permits to migrant workers or let them bring the vehicles used by them in those countries.
Handunnethi pointed out that foreign employees face difficulties when admitting their children to National and privileged schools since the parents are required to have their names in the voters register and to certify the place of residence.
"Since they are away from the country they do not have a chance to vote and fail to get their children qualify for admission to Grade One ," he said.
Handunnethi added that it is better to have a pension scheme for foreign employees, who have been serving long periods.
It has been reported that there are certain persons who have been working abroad for two to three decades, he said.
The MP said that certain countries maintain Social Benefit Funds similar to the Employees' Trust Fund here. However, these migrant workers are unable to get the benefit of the Social Benefit Fund since the government has not entered into an agreement with those countries, which maintains the Social Benefit Fund.
"For instance Cyprus is maintaining a Social Benefit Fund but Sri Lankan employees are unable to get the benefit of it since the government has not entered into an agreement.
Therefore, it is an urgent need to enter into this agreement with such countries jointly by the Foreign Employment Ministry and Foreign Affairs Ministry" he said. He added that the Sri Lankan government should introduce a minimum salary for each sector of foreign employment.
This will answer the problem of labour exploitation.

Was Shakespeare's skull stolen
UK: Legend has it, it could be the skull of William Shakespeare - robbed from the playwright's grave to win a 300 bet.
But clergymen attempting to solve a centuries-old mystery over the identity of a lone skull found in a Worcestershire church vault have been thwarted by a senior church lawyer - who has barred them from carrying out DNA testing.
According to local folklore, the skull, in a vault beneath Sheldon chapel at St Leonard's Church in Beoley, Redditch, was stolen from the playwright's tomb in Stratford as part of a wager set by the art historian Horace Walpole in the 1700s.
Rev Paul Irving, vicar at St Leonard's, applied to the Church of England's Consistory Court for permission to temporarily remove the skull for DNA testing, as part of a new documentary investigation into the claims. But the application, which was supported by other local clergymen, has been thrown out by Charles Mynors, Chancellor of the Diocese of Worcester, who ruled there was nothing to link the skull to Shakespeare.
The legend is based on two magazine articles, dated 1879 and 1884. The first claimed that in 1769 Walpole offered 300 to anyone who could obtain the skull of Shakespeare, who was buried at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford and whose grave bears an epitaph cursing anyone who should attempt to move his bones.
It claimed that a Dr Frank Chambers broke into Shakespeare's tomb and stole the skull but then failed to persuade Walpole or any-one else to hand over money for it, so arranged for it to be returned to the tomb.
However, the second article claimed that this was never done and that ultimately the skull was traced to the church at Beoley, about 15 miles from Stratford.
