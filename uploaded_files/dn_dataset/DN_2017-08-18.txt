With the increase of per capita income in the country the market share of Life Insurance should increase, however that has not happened now, said Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) Chairperson Indarni Sugathadasa.
Collective effort thus has to be taken by all insurance companies to take stocks to ascertain positive solutions to reach 87 percent of people in the country who are not insured at present, she said.
Sugathadasa said that means of communication has reached great heights in the world thus the insurance fraternity should make use of it to educate potential customers.
Life insurance sales personnel must open new vistas in the ocean of Life Insurance.
You must develop sales skills and life skills.
The segment of ageing population is increasing in the country and so is the rate of natural disasters. You can convince offspring of these elderly people to buy Life Insurances for their parents, she said.
Your approach should be Demand Driven and not Supply Driven.
Subsequent to selling the policies, products you must maintain a cordial relationship with your customers. Hence you must virtually become a family member of your customer by selling a Life insurance product without vanishing into thin air, IBSL Chairperson she said.
Keynote speaker PIM Director Prof Ajantha Dharmasiri said, We learn from the womb to the tomb and insurance agents must learn to comprehend their customers expectations. Only permanent thing in the whole world is, change thus be flexible and stick to basics to understand your customers whims and fancies, he said.

Apura drought: Water scarce despite showers
Although there were signs of a significant rainfall in the Anuradhapura district, no major rainfall was experienced except for a few showers in certain areas.
Anuradhapura Irrigation Chief Engineer Jayantha de Silva said there was no positive change in the water levels of 13 major tanks as a result of the showers.
Anuradhapura Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Development Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that there was no water collected in the 3,000 minor irrigation tanks with the recent rainfall. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka said despite minor showers, the number of DS divisions suffering from the shortage of drinking water is on the rise.
By August 14, two more DS divisions were added to the list of divisions where drinking water is distributed through bowsers. At present, drinking water is distributed to Nochchiyagama, Mahawilachchiya, Thalawa, Thambuttegama, Padaviya, Galenbidunuwewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Rambawe, Ippalogama, Galnawa, Horupothana, Kabithigollawa, Thirappane, Madawachchiya, Palugaswewa and Nuwaragam Palatha (Central) DS divisions covering 120 Grama Niladhari divisions.
The population being provided with drinking water is 76,000 of 22,800 families. Wanninayaka said 1,000 water tanks of 1,000 litres are placed in remote villages for storing drinking water.
We have hired a fleet of tractor and lorry bowsers in addition to government vehicles to transport and distribute water. The President has directed to provide the utmost priority to make potable water available to the suffering masses at any cost. In distributing drinking water to distant remote villages, we are facing the problem of finding suitable water bases or sources nearby, Wanninayaka said.
He said he requested the Mahaweli Authority and the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to provide Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa tank, the main water source in Anuradhapura supplying drinking water to a population of nearly 300,000. He pointed out that the other two tanks in the system, Thuruwila and Thissawewa, have an adequate water capacity to continue water distribution for another one month. According to him, these tanks purify around 40,000 cubic metres of water daily for distribution in Anuradhapura, Nachchaduwa, Mihinthalaya, Saliyapura, Wijepura and the sacred city area.

Presidents Counsel Rumesh de Silva with counsel Harith de Mel and S.V. Niles instructed by D. Vidanapathirana appearing for the 30th respondent raised a preliminary objection that the application cannot be maintained on the basis that the prayers to the petition are not maintainable.
However, counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe appearing for the petitioner submitted that he is not proceeding with the prayers (h), (i) and G) where the petitioner was seeking for injunctions and enjoining order, but he will be proceeding with the other prayers.
The petitioner stated that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has invited interested local and foreign companies to submit proposals for the project.

Best Life lessons!
The Thespians of St. Benedicts have received the greatest virtue of drama  fearless freedom of thought. Dramatic Moves features the Thespians of St. Benedicts College who along with that freedom are lion hearted.
Teacher in Charge of Drama, Titus Withanage pointed out that in order to understand the true value of literature experience is important. Drama provides you with that experience. At practices and on stage you are transported back in time like a time machine. On stage you are literally in Shakespeares era living the bards dreams and the bards vision.
I am an English language teacher as well, so I feel the things we teach in the classroom is not enough. There should be places for children to practice what they have learnt. That is what I expect from the Drama Club. Introducing Shakespeare or works of literature is not enough. There is no better place than the drama club for the children to comprehend real literature, said Withanage.
To sir with love is the reward Withanage receives from his students. When he meets his former students and finds that they are successful with their own families and careers that is his greatest reward. The time they spent at practices, the lessons imparted has resulted in his students becoming pillars of society.
Within a short time the College understood that Drama was worth spending money and they provided the boys with one of the best stage directors in the country, Mr. Jerome De Silva.
So it is an honor for us to have him here at St. Benedicts. Currently in the island he is one of the best stage directors. We are privileged to have him here as our trainer. Here in our drama club each and every one supports the other, stated Withanage
An undying LOVE
President Joshua Joseph said that Courage is the quality he has developed because of drama. There are many forms of courage and to face school life needs courage. At such a young age society demands that from you. You need to be prepared to face the realities out there. Doing Drama is practical. You are faced with real life situations on stage when enacting a role.
Take Macbeth for example, you learn about how greed for power can destroy a man. How greed for power can turn a leader admired by many into a despot hated by many. All these are real examples that we see today in our society. How about Romeo and Juliet The power of love and its potent effect on a young person. We see this a lot in society. So one needs to get in touch with his or her character intimately. This involves understanding a characters motives and qualities. This is where the best lessons are learnt.
I started Drama when I was in Grade 6, and it was because of Drama that I have come out in school a lot. I do some compering, I am a prefect at school and debating as well. All of this is because of Drama. When I first entered drama we were casting for inter-house and Jerome gave met the script which was Merchant of Venice. I was a bit scared at that time, but later when I got used to it, it has enabled me to go anywhere and speak before a crowd, said Joseph.
United they learn lessons from Drama. The seniors still keep in touch with them. All in all it is an undying love. Josephs attitude is that he treats every drama like the last.
Forgetting ones lines is a problem any ones can face. Composure here is what is needed and is what is absolutely vital. When you face the problem of forgetting your lines, you should not think on that. You should let it go because missing that small line is not going to make a big difference. If I get worried about that small thing then my entire performance would go down. It is building it from that moment onwards. Your lines should be coming out naturally. I must think what more can I do to add to that character said Joseph.
Blood, sweat and tears
Vice President Nethan Alexander said that when he takes in a breath, the breath he exhales is that of his character. This is typical of these boys of St. Benedicts who are committed 100 percent. Alexander went on to say that it is all about blood, sweat and tears.
Every time it starts with meditation. A quiet time to think about what is going on, and when I come on to the stage, I forget everything that is going on in my personal life and live in that moment. Basically how we get through is mostly improvisation and this also relates to forgetting ones lines. When we act on stage we live as another person. Before I did drama I was a shy character. This is where I truly belong, my drama club, said Alexander.
He points out that to play a female role you need to be very good in acting. To portray something that you are not, when it comes to gender it is hard -the way you walk and your speech patterns and you posture. Adapting to any role is possible but it depends on the commitment you have to that role.
characterization
Secretary Shimal Benedict reiterated some of what Joseph said when he spoke about learning from characters.
When we do dramas we get into different characters, from that itself it shows us the problems that character faced during that period of time. Then we understand what the character would do to solve these problems. If I am facing a problem, what I would do is, when I come to Drama practices, I put all that away and get into the character I am playing and be the character through characterization, said Benedict.
When doing a Shakespearean play one definitely comes across all kinds of problems and the solutions to these problems are fascinating to conjecture. In Romeo and Juliet we are confronted with the deaths of the two young star crossed loves and in Merchant of Venice we read of Shylocks pound of flesh.
Drama helps you develop your self-esteem. It develops your mastery of English. It develops your personality so you can speak in front of a crowd. That is the problem a lot of people have, this stage fear. They cannot even imagine themselves speaking in front of a crowd. But the Drama Club develops your character, so you can speak in front of a crowd without any fear, said Benedict.
At St. Benedicts, drama is a club that one never leaves. The love for the club remains even after the boys have passed out of school. This is because of the overwhelming gratitude that one has towards this club. Drama is something that is practical. Benedict recounts a Car Wash project he took part in. The boys had to speak to CEOs and General Managers.
You feel very comfortable talking to them and discussing matters. Drama has given us so many values and principles, pointed out Benedict.
unforgettable
Former President Jerome Morrit feels that Drama has helped him discover himself. Through drama he has received the skills that has enabled him to boldly venture out into society. Morrits attitude leaves no room for doubt. This is a young man who knows himself and what he is capable of and knows his talents.
As a person I meet a lot of people. And when I tell them I am interested in doing drama and I have done drama for a long period of time, their reply to me is That is good and it will take you far. I begin to realize and understand why drama has become so important and why my life has been a big part of it. What I have learnt through drama at rehearsals and practices and what I feel will be of great importance is the courage to never give up. Through drama and through acting on stage and seeing people in the audience, bringing out the character has helped me in numerous ways, said Morrit
Morrit points out that if you take Drama as a whole, doing Shakespeare Drama itself, you learn more about English, Literacy and a lot about history. Through this you can teach others.
When it comes to unforgettable dramas I have lost count of that! There have been so many unforgettable dramas we have performed. I think one production that really puts a smile on my face, each time I think of drama, is when our cast performed Richard III. That moment performing on stage I really felt something. I was happy being there on stage and sharing that stage with my fellow actors and doing what I love to do out of everything else I can do. It is one production that I really enjoyed, stated Morrit.
These boys are ambitious and they seek to bring glory to St. Benedicts College. The boys became champions at Drama Comp. last year and they had loads of fun.

Cambodia gets loan for  Sihanoukville Port expansion
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has signed a loan agreement to provide up to CNY 23.5 billion (USD 3.5 billion) for the development of Sihanoukville Port New Container Terminal in Cambodia.
Under the agreement signed on August 7, the Japanese ODA loan would be used to for the project to develop a new container terminal and improve the cargo handling capacity at the port with the objectives of improving the logistics environment in Cambodia and promoting trade.
The loan funds will be allocated to container terminal and access road development, public works relating to marine routes and mooring basin dredging, the procurement of cargo-handling equipment, and consulting services.
With the project, Sihanoukville Ports container cargo handling capacity would be increased by 450,000 TEUs to more than one and a half times the current capacity. The project will enable the only deep-sea port in Cambodia to accommodate larger sized vessels.
Due to its strategic location on the Southern Economic Corridor, which has been a focus of support from Japan, Sihanoukville Port is expected to become a logistics transfer hub for ASEAN overall, according to JICA.

AGM of Ceylon Shipping Corporation, Yamuna WettasinghePicture by Saliya Rupasinghe
There is another business opportunity created by the Budget 2017 and that is operating of a warehouse for handling of LCL cargoes and Multi Country Consolidation. CSC has already invited Expression of Interests (EOI) from local and foreign investors to join hand with CSC to operate this lucrative business, she said.
CSC presently owns and operates two Ultramax dry bulk vessels with a dead-weight capacity of 63,000 MT. which are employed to transport coal to Puttalam thermal power plant. During the monsoon period the vessels have been successfully deployed in the open charter market with more than 95% utilization of the vessels after delivery from Shipyard last year, having continued operational profits from all voyages, she said.
In diversification of business activities, CSC has lined up with a number of projects to develop under public private partnerships. The bunker prices are much higher in the port of Colombo than other regional ports such as Singapore due to the fact that the common onshore storage capacity is limited. If we could enhance the volume we may able to offer cheaper prices in Colombo as in Singapore thereby attracting more ships for bunkering in Colombo. In order to increase the capacity we have proposed to the Government to operate a floating bunker storage vessel outside the port limits and to offer the buyers or vessels competitive rates, she said.
Ceylon Shipping Corporations core business is to build, purchase, charter and hire vessels to fulfill the national requirement, she explained.
We hope to enter in to container feeder market also at the appropriate time, she added.

Fibre failure
Apropos Ravi Perera's guest column on August 15, I heartily endorse the comments therein, having gone through a similar experience with SLT.
One evening a person whom I later gathered was from ExpoLanka Mktg persuaded me to go for a new Fibre Optic Cable and for which I had to pay Rs.799 immediately for which no receipt was issued- only a brochure.
Thereafter, I paid Rs.6,000 to the SLT Havelock Town office on July 24 and for almost a month no one turned up to install it.
Finally, on July 21, two persons turned up and what followed thereafter was a comedy of errors- culminating in my telephone/internet being disconnected for almost a week! Different persons came at unannounced times and were totally unprofessional in carrying out their task. Although, I was promised a new landline telephone instrument and a cordless phone as well (as per the brochure) they came without it and finally it was only on my insistence they brought the same.
The landline phone was found to be defective from the very first day! Throughout this time, I had to keep phoning various numbers but no one answered the phone in what were normal office hours!

COMBank's Raindrops project  to combat CKDu enters Phase 2
Commercial Bank of Ceylon has commenced the second phase of its Raindrops project to combat Chronic Kidney Disease of an unknown origin (CKDu) following the resounding success of the first phase in whichthe Bank in 2016 donated 5,000 litre storage tanks for rainwater harvesting to 25 families in Ginnoruwa in the Girandurukotte area.
The Raindrops project was initiated in collaboration with the late Ranjith Mulleriyawa, the renowned Agronomist who supervised the first phase of this community programme. The management of the entire project is handled by ETC Lanka, a member of the Not-for-Profit organisation ETC International Group based in Leusden, Netherlands.
During the first phase of the project the families that received storage tanks consumed harvested rainwater for more than one year, after which they were tested for CKDu and the results compared with those of 25 families that consumed well water during that period.
Under the second phase of the project, Commercial Bank has commissioned a scientific analysis of the suitability of rainwater for drinking, following indications from the first phase that rainwater is better than groundwater in areas prone to CKDu.
The Bank has entrusted the Wayamba University with conducting in-depth research into the water quality, pH value, electrical conductivity and other properties of harvested rainwater to determine the viability of promoting this source of water on a mass scale in areas reporting a high incidence of the dreaded disease. The initial findings of the study have shown that while several persons from the group that consumed well water have been diagnosed with Stage 1 CKDu, none of those that consumed rainwater have shown signs of the disease thus far.
It may be premature to draw scientific conclusions at this stage, but the preliminary findings are certainly encouraging and worth pursuing, Commercial Bank's Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said.
Commercial Bank also has commissioned an anthropological study to assess and analyse the changing perceptions of villagers on the consumption of harvested rainwater as an alternative to water from wells.
The study by anthropologist W.A. Upul Kumara Wickramasinghe indicates that persons who consumed rainwater reported the absence of unpleasant tastes, odours, oily film and sediment in the rainwater consumed; an improvement in the taste of food and tea prepared with rainwater and an increase of their individual consumption of water since they made the change to rainwater.
The results of the research to be conducted by the Wayamba University in Phase 2 of the Raindrops project could lead to more rainwater storage facilities being set up in CKDu-affected areas, the Bank said. Already, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board has come forward to donate 30 more water tanks to families in the Ginnoruwa village.

CSR Sri Lanka conducts   workshop for Just In Time Group
A team of members from CSR Sri Lanka conducted a workshop for the Just In Time Group (JIT) recently, to assess their current operations against systematic sustainability benchmarks.
Just In time Group (JIT) was the first corporate in Sri Lanka to use the internationally recognized diagnostic tool CSR 2.0; demonstrating their investment towards transformative CSR and to enter into the age of responsibility.
The aim of this assessment was to evaluate JITs current awareness to align business strategies towards achieving a long term value creation through systematic sustainability.JITs assessment covered a cross sectional team representing; PR and Communications, Legal, HR, Engineering, Secretarial, Marketing and Managerial  which led to a shared transparent view of the organization and therefore an effective assessment of the CSR stage that JIT required to strategize to enhance their way forward.
The assessing team comprisedof CSR SL, Chairman - Chandula Abeywickrema, Director  Mahesh Wijewardena and Aitken Spence PLCs Asst. General Manager, Sustainability - YasangiRanden, who are professionals in their respective fields who are passionate
Many companies globally tend to practice one of four types of CSR, depending on their level of maturity; namely - defensive CSR (compliance-driven, risk-based), charitable CSR (altruism-driven, philanthropy-based), promotional CSR (image-driven, PR-based), and strategic CSR (product driven, code-based). This theory identifies five principles of CSR 2.0 - creativity, scalability, responsiveness, glocality, circularity and four DNA elements of CSR 2.0 - value creation, good governance, societal contribution and environmental integrity.
JIT hopes to work towards their own goals to assist CSR SLs objectiveto shape the fabric of sustainable development initiatives of the private sector by increasing awareness of the potential to create long term value through systematic CSR or transformative CSR.
Transformative CSR is pivotal to making change happen at all levels be it societal, national, organizational and individual level. To keep with the pulse of our stakeholders, we at JIT are moving forward to embrace and transform with greater sustainability and accountability.
We are excited to be a part of CSR 2.0 and also as the first company in Sri Lanka to consult on this, said JIT HR, Legal and Admin Head Sherene Goonetilleke.
CSR 2.0 is a strategic engagement that drives corporates towards greater sustainability by identifying key stakeholders namely, shareholders, employees, customers and the environment and ensuring all of their transformation in the process of doing normal business of the company as a business strategy, said CSR Sri Lanka Chairman Chandula Abeywickrema.
CSR Sri Lanka is being supported by the United States Agency for International Development and private sector companies to improve the quality of CSR programmes to achieve business sustainability and to ensure companies responsibility towards their stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, employees, society and the environment to bridge the gap between ad hoc CSR projects and creating sustainable value.

Deadly Barcelona attack is worst in a day of violence in Spain

Spain saw one of its most violent days in recent memory as a spate of incidents throughout the country appeared to be connected to a terror attack Thursday in Barcelona that left 13 people dead and more than 100 injured.
Authorities said they are working under the assumption that two other deadly events, a terrorist incident in the seaside city of Cambrils and a house explosion farther down the coast in Alcanar, were linked to the van attack in Barcelona that had ISIS taking credit.



Also Thursday, two police officers in Barcelona were hurt when they were hit by a car, but police were unsure whether that was related to the other incidents.
The deadly events began in the early evening with a van plowing through crowds on the renowned Las Ramblas avenue, a popular tourist section of Barcelona. Authorities said of the 80 people taken to hospitals, 15 were seriously hurt.
As police searched for the van driver, Spain's Prime Minister called it an act of "jihadi terrorism."
Here are the latest developments in a tragic day:
 Two suspects -- one from Morocco, one from the Spanish enclave of Melilla -- were arrested in connection with the Barcelona attack, Catalan Police Chief Josep Lluis Trapero said.
 One suspect in the Barcelona attack is on the run. "The driver abandoned the van and escaped from the area," Trapero said.
 About 115 kilometers to the southwest, there was a second attack early Friday. Catalan police tweeted that five suspected terrorists were killed in Cambrils. Emergency officials said six civilians and a police officer were injured.
 One person was killed in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, around 200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Barcelona.
 Catalan police said early Friday they are "working under the hypothesis that the terrorists taken down in Cambrils were related to the events that took place in Barcelona and Alcanar."
 A driver ran over two police officers at a security checkpoint in Barcelona, police said, and the driver was found near the city. The two officers suffered minor injuries and did not need hospital treatment, police said. It was unclear whether that incident was related to the terror attack.
 ISIS' media wing, Amaq, said the perpetrators of the Barcelona attack were "soldiers of the Islamic State." However, ISIS has not explicitly claimed responsibility.
The Barcelona attack was one of the most deadly in Spain since more than 190 people were killed in aMarch 2004 attack against commuter trains.
Terror in the streets of another European city
It was the latest ina series of attacks in Europe in which vehicles have been usedto mow down pedestrians in public spaces. More than 100 people have died in similar attacks in Berlin, London and Nice.
Reports of the incident emerged on social media about 5 p.m. (11 a.m. ET). Photographs and videos showed people fleeing the area. About two hours later, police confirmed a terror attack.
As the incident unfolded, police told everyone in the vicinity of Plaa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas to remain indoors until told it was safe to go outside. Footage posted to social media by witnesses showed chaotic scenes with people lying in the street, apparently dead or injured.
Information about most of the victims has not been released, but one Belgian was killed in the attack, Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jose de Pierpont said.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy spoke of his grief and offered condolences to the families of the victims.
"I want to also express my solidarity with all of Spain to the city of Barcelona, today hit by jihadi terrorism, like other cities have been in the world," Rajoy said.
Witness reports gunshots
One witness told local media the situation was "very tense" and that all surrounding shops were evacuated. The witness said at least eight ambulances were at the scene. Emergency services said the area had been cordoned off and all public transportation stopped.
Another witness who was hiding in a shop nearby heard gunshots, according to state-run broadcaster TVE24. A third said he saw a van driving "around 80" kph, or 50 mph. He said "there is no doubt it was intentional," according to TVE24.
Ali Shirazinia, who was cycling alongside Las Ramblas at the time, told CNN he heard "a lot of screams" and saw the crowds split along the busy promenade.
Then he heard what sounded like the driver flooring the accelerator and saw a white van with blue markings come hurtling down the street. "It literally came right down the Ramblas and ran into people on every side," he said.
"The Ramblas is full of pedestrians, street merchants, street performers, and I saw people flying into the air and everyone was running into the shops on either side of the Ramblas, a lot of people were shocked."
Tourist Susan McClean told CNN she saw a "tidal wave" of people running away from Las Ramblas after the incident.
She ducked into a nearby shop and the shutters were pulled down while police sped toward the scene.
"There was clearly a lot of distress," she said.
McClean said she returned to her hotel one street away after leaving the shop.
Two arrests, one deadly explosion
Two suspects who were arrested were taken into custody hundreds of kilometers apart.
One suspect was arrested in Alcanar, around 200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Barcelona.
Also in Alcanar, one person was killed in an explosion at a house, Trapero said, adding that incident was connected to the Barcelona attack. But Trapero didn't say whether the arrest and explosion were tied to each other.
He did say the victim is Spanish and was not on police radar.
The other Barcelona suspect was arrested in Ripoll, about 110 kilometers (68 miles) north of Barcelona and 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Alcanar.
Government officials respond
The Catalan regional government said it was holding an emergency meeting to discuss the incident.
To facilitate police operations, the Catalan emergency services urged people via Twitter to avoid going out or undertaking any other type of movement that was not "strictly necessary."
The Spanish royal family tweeted: "They are assassins, simply criminals who are not going to terrorize us. All of Spain is Barcelona. Las Ramblas will return to be everyone's."
The Union of Islamic Communities of Catalonia expressed "condemnation and repulse" for the Barcelona attack.
"Faced with this criminal fact, the union of Islamic communities in Catalonia reiterates its full commitment to the fight against any type of terrorism, and it is expected that those responsible for these attacks may be detained and brought before the courts as early as possible," its statement said.
Barcelona officials ordered all public events to be canceled, and metro and train stations in the area were closed.
NATO chief: We stand united
World leaders were quick to voice their condemnation of the attack and offer support to Barcelona via Twitter.
"My thoughts are with all those affected. We stand united in the fight against terrorism," said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
US President Donald Trump said: "The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!"
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the attack in Barcelona "revolting," her spokesman tweeted. "We are mourning the victims of this disgusting attack in Barcelona -- in solidarity and friendship side by side with the Spanish."
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker branded the Barcelona attack "cowardly," adding: "We will never be cowed by such barbarism."
Las Ramblas is a predominantly pedestrianized street popular among tourists in Barcelona. Extending for about three-quarters of a mile through the center of the city, the tree-lined street is especially crowded in the summer, the height of tourist season.
The promenade passes by kiosks, flower sellers, pavement cafes and bars. It includes a number of the city's most popular sites.

Developing connections  through culture  and heritage
Sri Lanka Tourism, in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Vietnam, arranged a familiarisation tour for a TV crew of Nhan Dan (National TV) from August 4-10, to create awareness and promote Sri Lanka as a popular destination among the Vietnamese travelers.
Since both countries have their equal share of religious and cultural heritage, this created an opportunity for the Vietnamese media crew to get an informative and an interesting experience to share with their audience back home. The crew consisted of 3 members, Nguyen Hong Quan, Cameraman, Nguyen Thi Thun Hang, Reporter, and Nguyen Mai, Editor.
Nhan Dan TV is a TV is the main national TV in Vietnam which is linked with the Nhan Dan newspaper, which has the highest readership in the country.
One of the main purposes of the press trip was to cover the Kandy Esala Perahera , which is a world famous cultural pageant sacred to all Buddhists around the world , and highlights Sri Lankas importance as a Theravada Buddhist country.
The media crew visited historic sites of Anuradhapura, Sigiriya , Dambulla, Kandy and Nuwaraeliya. In visiting these cities, they had the privilege of covering Ruwanwelisaya, Dambulla Cave temple, Rock Fortress of Sigiriya, the temple of the sacred tooth relic, a tea factory and a plantation, not missing a cup of pure Ceylon Tea and afterwards visiting the Haggala Botanical Garden.
The TV crew also had an opportunity to interview President Maithripala Sirisena. TheMedia crew which was sponsored by Sri Lanka Tourism, managed to capture the attention of a large Sri Lankan audience through their interview.
Tourist arrivals from Vietnam has seen a 17% increase year on year, though the arrival number is not significantly high. Arranging Media trips of this nature will increase the arrivals in future, specifically in countries which share similar cultural and historical values as Sri Lanka.

Elephants affected by haphazard garbage dumping
While environmentalists are engaged in strenuous efforts to save the dwindling wild elephant population in the country, the haphazard dumping of garbage has in more ways than one, added to the diminishing population.
Also this has contributed to the escalation of the human  elephant conflict with both sides suffering increasing casualties in recent times.
The haphazard dumping of garbage by the Kantala Pradeshiya Sabha near the 9th mile post in the Kantale  Serunuwara road is a prime example for the above. The huge garbage mountain which is in close proximity to the road is attracting elephants in their numbers these days, as food has run out in the jungles due to the prolonged drought.
The people in the area complain that the garbage mountain which was a health hazard, has now become a danger to their lives in another form, wild elephant attacks.
People in the area urge the Pradeshiya Sabha to stop dumping garbage in the area and find a suitable location elsewhere, considering the adverse impact it has posed to their lives.

Engage, not sell: Embracing the Millennial Consumer
Millennials, the generation born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s, are driving a major paradigm shift in the business-consumer relationship.
Currently numbering 2.4 billion people according to the Deloitte Millennial survey, Millennials will make up 75% of the global population by 2025.
Hence, their attention and considerable spending power are greatly sought after by marketers. However, the tried and tested traditional methods of attracting consumers do not work on this fiercely competed for segment. Marketers will need to rethink their approach and align their views with those of Millennials if they wish to connect with them.
Not only are Millennials not swayed by advertising but also their preference for material objects differs from that of their predecessors. 78% of Millennials prefer to spend their money on an experience rather than on the accumulation of things. And when they do spend money on products, it is for access without the burden of ownership.
This phenomenon is driving the current rise in the sharing economy (the model adopted by Airbnb, Uber), which by 2030 will be worth $335 billion. 57% of Millennials say access is the new ownership, and 68% of Millennials say that they were willing to rent or share personal items.
So, if traditional methods do not work, how do we reach this rapidly growing segment of the population
Authenticity is the key to engaging Millennials. According to an Elite Daily study in 2015,43% of Millennials consider authenticity more important than content when consuming news. This is the same reason why 33% rely mostly on blogs before they make a purchase compared to less than 3% for TV news, magazines and books.
They need to trust the company or brand before they are willing to listen to what they have to say. Brands can no longer shout their messages at customers and assume their message is having the desired effect or even getting through.
However, before they can be authentic, brands need to occupy spaces that Millennials frequent and be present in the channels that they use in order to engage them. This means that brands need to be active on social media where 63% stay updated on brands. They also need to be accessible through apps on smartphones as 87% of Millennials are within reach of their smartphones at all times and are 62% more likely to be influenced by an app than traditional methods.
Once brands have established a presence on social platforms, they will need to encourage in conversations, listen and act on their customers suggestions and be transparent in their actions if they want to build trust and engagement.
For this purpose, brands should not always be selling their products but rather interacting in subject areas which are still true to their brand story and also of interest to Millennials.
And while this strategy may help convert a casual fan into a consumer, it also needs to translate into good product references because 51% of Millennials rely on a recommendation from a stranger before making a purchase and 49% rely on a recommendation from friends and family.
It is no longer about making a sale but forging long lasting relationships to convert your consumers to real brand ambassadors.
It is clearly evident that Millennials are transforming the retail landscape and the marketing strategies of yesteryear will no longer work.
While in the past brands had decades to adapt to new technology, that period is shrinking rapidly with the rate of new technological advancement. If a brand does not want to be left behind, they will clearly need to adapt quickly to a new way of engaging Millennial consumers.

Fight for your Right
The control of information is something the elite always does, the American novelist Tom Clancy once told a reporter. If you can control information, you can control people.
I suspect that these words, said over two decades ago in my home country, would resonate with many here in Sri Lanka. For years, the government has thrived as a basically closed system. An advisor to the United National Party told me recently that since the islands independence from the British in 1948, no matter what government is in power, the same dozen-or-so families run it.
This is known, he told me. It doesnt mean anything changes.
When information only flows through a privileged few, its hard for those outside to disrupt the status quo.
But last year, something changed: parliament passed an expansive right-to-information law, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. The act gives Sri Lankan citizens the legal right to access information at all levels of government, with few exceptions.
Whether that right is being observed by government agencies is a different question, though, and one worth interrogating.
This column, going forward, will keep readers updated on the data, records, and documents we are trying to wrangle out of various government bodies, and how we are being met in our effort.
It will also share the stories of private citizens filing their own RTI requests, who are often met with suspicion and resistance. Many are actively fighting for their right to information, with the help of legal aid organizations, Transparency International Sri Lanka, and their experiences need to be reported.
For this first instalment, though, here are a few stories that we are following at the Daily News:
Enforced disappearances
When parliament first passed the RTI Act, many human rights advocates hoped it could be used as a new way for family members of people who were forcibly disappeared during the civil war to unearth new information about their loved ones.
For years, these families have been rebuffed by various commissions created to investigate the disappeared. Amnesty International estimates that since the 1980s, between 60,000 and 100,000 people were kidnapped by police, military, and paramilitary forces. But, information on their fate is scarce, and promises from the highest levels to release lists of people who surrendered to the army in the final months of the civil war, remain unfulfilled.
RTIs ability as a tool for these families to pressure the government and its security apparatus has not been fully tested. In theory, government agencies could deny these requests, citing a threat to national security, though they would have to explain how such a disclosure would actually pose a threat.
Last month, the Daily News submitted a request under the Right to Information Act to the countrys Human Rights Commission to see how many people are using the new law as an avenue for information.
The commission was well-prepared for our request, and followed the RTI Act to the letter. I initially sent our request, by email, to the commissions media spokesman, Commissioner Saliya Pieris. He responded the same day, telling me he was not the designated information officer, but that hed sent our papers request to the right person.
Under the law, every government agency must appoint an information officer, or multiple information officers, to process the publics requests. The information officer the Human Rights Commission is W.A.U.S. Wijesooriya.
We got our request back within the 14-day time window, and it was illuminating: of all the requests the Human Rights Commission had received since the law went into effect, over 40 percent of them sought information about disappeared persons. The commission had not denied a single request.
We have since filed RTI requests with the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Prisons, and the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation. We havent received confirmation that our requests were received, but the agencies still have time to do so.
Unlike the Human Rights Commission, our experience with the Ministry of Defence was problematic. I initially tried to figure out who the ministrys information officer was over the phone, but after speaking with multiple people, it was soon clear no one had any idea what I was talking about.
So I delivered the request by hand. I was first sent away from the Ministrys Headquarters off Galle Road, and sent 3 kilometres south to their press office. There, security guards told me to go back to the main headquarters.

Finally, a press officer took my request and promised to get it to the right person. He called me the next morning to tell me he would deliver it by hand back to the main headquarters.
Im hopeful well get a response from them soon.
Supreme court delays
Court reporters say the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has a huge backlog of cases, which is fuelled by the frequent absence of judges. Even high-profile cases are not immune; the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Naomi Coleman, the British woman who was arrested for having a tattoo of the Buddha, has been postponed close to a dozen times since June 2015, after the judge presiding over that case retired without delivering judgement.
We initially filed an RTI request with the Ministry of Justices information officer, Additional Secretary A. Mansoor, to see how many other cases have been delayed because judges were absent from the bench. Mansoor responded eight days later, telling us that his ministry did not have the information, and that a request should be filed with the Registrar of the Supreme Court.
Thats where our luck ran out. The next week, I called the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court on an almost daily basis, asking for the name and contact details of their information officer. But, the secretary repeatedly hung up on me. I sent the RTI request to an email address I found on the Bar Association of Sri Lankas website, but received no answer.
Finally, I delivered the request by hand to the Supreme Courts mail room last week. Under the terms of the law, they now have 14 days to mail us a receipt of our request, and tell us if they will be able to fulfil it or not.
Going forward
The RTI Act, as it is written, has the potential to transform the way Sri Lankans interact with their government. But, in our short experience using the law, bureaucracy and ignorance are often barriers to information.
We will keep publishing the names of information officers here, and detailing the filing process, as a roadmap for anyone looking to file their own requests under the Right to Information Act.
But, even more important, moving forward, will be to tell the stories of private citizens exercising their right to information. Out on the ground, some civil society groups and information activists have reported that people are being met with intimidation and police questioning after filing RTI requests with local authorities.
My hope is this column can start bringing some of these stories to light. Stay with us.

Former President Chandrika salutes Premier Ranil
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga saluted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for his 40 years of public service in front of a crowded audience at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall yesterday.
Speaking at the inauguration of Encounter Ranil, a photographic exhibition celebrating 40 years of public service by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Bandaranaike Kumaratunga noted that she and Wickremesinghe had a history of working together, even as members of opposing parties who often disagreed.
Destiny threw us together twice in my political life to work together. Once was when the UNP defeated my party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, while I was President and then Ranil became the Prime Minister in 2001, and I was President. It was the first and only time until now that the two parties, or any two parties, were called upon to work together - the President from one party and the Prime Minister from the other.
The second time, she said, was when destiny brought us together again for the great movement of January 2015, upon the election of the Yahapalana government.
Speaking of her relationship to the Prime Minister at that instant, Chandrika Bandaranaike said, I still cannot understand or comprehend how two people, two leaders, who were so much in opposition against each other, aggressively opposing each other, two parties that were so much in opposition against each other, killing each other, bloodshed, and all these kinds of things, could suddenly in a very short period of time come together and decide to put an entire history of what happened for decades behind us, and decide to work together. I must salute Wickremesinghe for the extreme sacrifice he made during that exercise, for that exercise, for the success of that operation.
She expressed admiration for the way he conducted and carried himself throughout.
One thing I had noticed about the Prime Minister is that he was at all times, even at the most difficult times, when we were opposing each other - our two parties, not personally  he was most courteous, calm, and never lost his cool.
She also commended the way he dealt in the face of hardship.
He took all the setbacks and allegations thrown at him, even from within his own party, with great cool and calm...I have seen him from the sidelines, we have all watched him meet many challenges from within his own party, challenges to his leadership, challenges which were very serious at some times, with a lot of cool and understanding.
She ended on a strong note, stressing that her respect for the Prime Minister is beyond the personal and the partisan and connected to her larger vision for Sri Lankas future.
I have been accused by some members of my party of being a supporter of Ranil. I am not a supporter of any individual politician, Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
I am a supporter of what I believe is right. I am a supporter of the vision that brought together President Maithripala Sirisena, who made huge sacrifices on his part to make January 8 possible. I am a supporter of the vision initiated for us by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
I am a supporter of this Government. I am a supporter of good governance, of human freedoms, of democracy and democratic institutions, of truth, of reconciliation, of building a society which will have lasting peace, which will reject hatred against others, she said.

## Title: Future Commercial Real Estate Trends

Future Commercial Real Estate Trends
The first half of 2017 has already held some surprises that will impact commercial real estate. Lamudithe global real estate platformpicks out five trends that will shape commercial real estate in the future.
1. Airports will be hassle-free
The airport of the future will allow free and easy movement of passengers. As technology progresses, airport security will know everything about you, and this will eradicate the need to scan people constantly, and the toll-booth delay will disappear. In the not too distant future, all passengers will be identified with fingerprints, iris, or face scans and this will reduce the time it takes to move through security. Airports will try to boost their income by offering better amenities such as shopping malls and entertainment. New business models are likely to include commercial office space. Multinational companies may even decide to open a global hub right inside an airport given how easy it would be to fly executives in and out for global meetings.
2. Technology will do 90% of the work
A report titled The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Surveying Profession predicts that brokers and appraisers will have a lot less work to do in the future. Surveyingthe term used for leasing and investment brokers, property managers and valuersis ripe for automation. Tasks such as rent collection, the examination of financial information, property valuation, and monitoring market conditions are predicted to be completed with the help of artificial intelligence and deep learning.
3. More investment in the emerging markets
The emerging markets are fast becoming the motor for global growth. Presently, the emerging markets are outperforming developed economies with unrivalled growth charts that have resulted in impressive job market expansion and a lowering of unemployment rates. This employment growth has fueled a rise in demand for office and commercial space. In the Philippines, in Q1, six office developments were completed adding 113,000 sqm of office space in the capital Metro Manila. Impressively, the average vacancy rate is as low as 4%. Expect commercial real estate investors to turn to the emerging markets to pick up the slack from developed markets.
4. Unbanked lending will develop further
Alternatives to bank loans will continue to gather momentum. In countries like Mexico, peer-to-peer lending targeted at the underserved/unbanked population will prosper and bring more home buyers into the market. Customers searching for lower interest rates will also be tempted by the more favorable rates on offer by non-traditional lenders.
5. Agility will shape the market
According to a recent report by JLL, 20 million people are using third places for part of their working week. The Starbucks effect means that by 2030 30% of corporate portfolios will comprise flexible workspace by 2030. Real estate is fixed and immovable, and the perception is that it is slow to accept change; then there is technology which is the opposite. Speaking about investors, corporate tenants or developers it is technology and people at the core of everything. Thus, it is high time for the modern workplace to meet the flexible needs of the 21st century.

## Title: GLYPHOSATE SAFETY A SCAM
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, August 18, 2017 - 01:00
GLYPHOSATE SAFETY A SCAM
Glyphsate is a good non-selective plant killer, but then, so are many other herbicides. All of them kill both the crops and the weeds. The specialty of glyphosate and its very extensive use is only in relation to its use on genetically modified Roundup Ready crops that are so engineered not to die of glyphosate sprayed indiscriminately over farmland by airplane, helicopter and massive crop sprayers. Another dangerous use of more recent origin is to use glyphosate as a desiccant even on non-GMO seed, and cereal crops, cotton and sugarcane  purely for convenience of harvesting.
Tea is not a Roundup Ready Crop. Therefore, glyphosate is not a crucial requirement for the tea plantations. In fact, glyphosate formulations are not at all necessary for weed control in tea plantations. Any other accepted weed killer will be more than sufficient. If not the administrators of the Regional Plantation Companies, at least the administrators of the Plantation Ministry should have realized this long ago.
If glyphosate is banned for other food crops because of health hazards, then it must be banned for tea too. As a global consumer drink, tea is second only to the vital thirst quencher, water. Over two billion people drink tea from a global production of three billion tons. We cannot afford to lose our tea trade, which will inevitably happen with continued use of glyphosate. We will lose over two million livelihoods too. What is crucial Trade and livelihoods or convenience of glyphosate
Anti-glyphosate consumer groups are very strong. In the USA the Organic Consumers Association with over two million women is just one of several. Another, Moms Across America, which is as strong, wants a full stop on the practice of spraying glyphosate on GE foods and as a drying agent on food crops, increasing the consumption of glyphosate in our food, including but not limited to, wheat, corn, soy, sugar, rice, dry peas and beans and tea. Note the last word  TEA!!!
These two womens consumer group will influence their families, thereby increasing the number of campaigners to about 16 million. There are several such groups.
A survey of consumers in the European Union extrapolated to the total population shows that over 65% are against the use of glyphosate. Prohibition of glyphosate was backed by 75% of Italians, 70% of Germans, 60% of French and 56% of Britons, in a survey of more than 7,000 people across the EUs five biggest states.
This opposition cannot be ignored. The present state of glyphosate is precarious too. It will be banned soon, the world over. There need be no doubt about that. Recently unearthed evidence against it is damning.
It is a very poor reflection on all administrators in the tea industry, both political and industrial, that they are clamouring to use glyphosate when consumers all over the world  said to be in the millions in the West and two-thirds of the population in the European Union, have successfully proved that glyphosate is a scam from mid-2015.
Consider the following;
1. Papers released by a court in the USA.
Unsealed court documents released early this year reveal startling details of falsehoods, cover-ups skullduggery from Monsanto, the introducers of RoundUp, the glyphosate containing herbicide.
They also show collusion between Monsanto and USEPA [US Environmental Protection Agency] in regard to covering up the hazards of glyphosate. There are also revelations of Monsantos pre-planned attempts to peremptorily sabotage and ridicule the conclusions of the World Health Organizations IARS on the probable carcinogenicity of glyphosate.
These papers include depositions, emails of Monsanto officers and statements made to court by officers of the EPA and Monsanto.
The judges observation on testimony by EPA
Simply put, the EPA does not require, and thus not consider, chronic effects data resulting from continuous exposure to Roundup  the root of all Plaintiffs allegations in this case. For this fact alone, the EPAs conclusions related to glyphosate should be excluded as irrelevant:
So much for Monsantos claims of acceptance of the safety of glyphosate by regulatory authorities all over the world!!! As exposed under item 2 below, research papers submitted by Monsanto were sealed and locked in a safe at the EPA, never studied.
Though both parties have claimed to have conducted extensive prior testing to prove the safety of Roundup, the EPA did not conduct a single test on its formulation but accepted and relied on the applicant Monsantos word on the safety of glyphosate  which is just one of the formulations active ingredients. Other equally or more dangerous additives were not even divulged.
Admission in court by Dr. Donna Farmer, Monsantos Lead Toxicologist.
In the 35 years that Roundup has been on the market, Monsanto has conducted no chronic carcinogenicity studies on the formulated Roundup product because such a study was not required by the EPA for the registration of glyphosate.
In her deposition she has admitted that she cannot say that Roundup does not cause cancer because we [Monsanto] have not done the carcinogenicity studies with Roundup.
On the contrary, Monsanto has been claiming continuous conduction of research on the safety of glyphosate and declaring its safety as proved by this research.
Underhand tactics by Monsanto
Monsanto has an army of paid people nicknamed trolls who are required to viciously attack scientists who report findings against Roundup and commentators that criticize Monsantos products and methods. Monsanto has also several times authored their own ghost-written scientific papers full of fiction and denouncing genuine research papers. They have got them signed by scientists in their pay and even published in scientific journals through known contacts by-passing accepted conventions.
The leaked papers describe such an activity to attack the conclusion of the IARS on the probable carcinogenicity of glyphosate well before that conclusion was determined and published.
Collaboration between EPA and Monsanto
The released papers show Monsanto relying on a senior officer of the EPA to get information on the progress of the deliberations at the IARS, and also rely on him to block a move for research at the EPA.
It is reported that Jess Rowland, the EPA's Deputy Division Director for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and chair of the Agency's Cancer Assessment Review Committee, assured Monsanto that he's fully exploiting his role as the chair of the CARC to kill any potentially damaging research...and has commented that if I can kill this I should get a medal.
Well, he may have a job reserved for him at Monsanto upon retirement from the EPA!
For more details please go to http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-14/court-docs-prove-monsanto-collu...
2. Papers released from the EPA through the intervention of a U.S. Senators office in 2015.
Information from these is coming out like a carpet bombing operation on Monsanto with their own explosives. This information is destroying all the foundations on which the safety of Roundup was claimed by Monsanto, regulators and their interested parties including users.
Dr. Anthony Samsel, a scientific researcher, unsuccessfully tried repeatedly through the Freedom of Information Act to get at the research papers lodged with the EPA by Monsanto. He then got them through his Senator Jeanne Shaheen [New Hampshire]. He got a hoard of over 15,000 papers covering Monsantos complete glyphosate research over 40 years.
Among the many cancers and diseases Monsantos own research found associated with glyphosate are:
* Adenoma cancer in the pituitary gland* Glioma tumors in the brain* Reticular cell sarcomas in the heart* Malignant tumors in the lungs* Salivary mandibular reticular cell carcinoma* Metastatic sarcomas of the lymph gland* Prostate carcinoma* Cancer of the bladder* Thyroid carcinoma* Adrenal reticulum cell sarcomas* Cortical adenomas* Basal cell squamous skin tumors
Monsanto found that extremely low concentrations far lower than those recommended for use on crops, were far more dangerous than much higher concentrations. Their reaction was to stop those researches, cover up the results and concentrate only on the effects of higher concentrations since it is the general tendency to assume them to be more dangerous.
They also manoeuvred studies to allow room to tone down or deny adverse effects found in research. Above all, they hid or covered up adverse results and built up a concerted marketing campaign falsely claiming total safety.
The lurid details in these papers are too much to be included here. Interested readers could look up https://content.sierraclub.org/grassrootsnetwork/team-news/2015/09/monsa...

GMOA to invoke RTI on Health Ministry Secretary
Says SAITM cannot award medical degrees:
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said it will reveal to the country about the inability of SAITM to award MBBS degrees, GMOA Deputy Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters yesterday he said the truth about SAITM's degree awarding status will be revealed to the country shortly through the Higher Education Ministry Secretary under the Right to Information Act of 2016.
Legal action will be taken against him if he does not provide information requested by the GMOA on illegal and contradictory gazettes issued, he said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, SAITM does not have legal authority to award MBBS degrees and it will be legally proved shortly. A committee has been appointed to solve the SAITM issue with the participation of SAITM students, their parents and all the other relevant parties. Once the problem solved, only the Health Minister will stand by the SAITM demanding its existence.
If the Government pressurises the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register SAITM students as doctors, all the doctors will withdraw their registration from the SLMC making the SLMC an invalid, useless and 'dead' body. The GMOA urged the President and Prime Minister to intervene and solve the SAITM issue without giving in to pressure put on them by Health Minister.

GMOA questions delay on gazette notification
The Health Minister has broken his own promise by not issuing the gazette notification on minimum standards of medical education within a period of two weeks which ended last Monday (14th), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Acting Media Spokesman Dr. Prasad Kolambage said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Health Minister promised to issue the gazette notification on minimum standards of medical education on or before August 14th (last Monday) but failed to do so. Now he should reveal to the country all about this gazette notification and its current situation.
According to Dr, Kolambage, the Health Minister is speechless when the media questions him about the gazette notification and the so called `agreement signed with Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital in connection with its `taking over. He ran away whenever the media questioned him about those issues. But, earlier he always had answers to anything.
The GMOA has already made a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption in connection with the alleged financial fraud and misuse of public property that had taken place in connection with the taking over of Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital. The GMOA is hopeful that the commission will conduct an investigation on the issue. The GMOA will not hesitate to take stern action if the Government fails to address the SAITM issue and other connected issues, he added.

The Kuliyapitiya Base Hospital which is under the Wayamba (North Western) Provincial Council, would be taken over by the Government in order to establish a new Medical Faculty in it, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
He had stated so at a special discussion held at the Health Ministry recently, on establishing the Medical Faculty of the Wayamba University. Minister Senaratne had stated that the government had taken a policy decision to establish a medical faculty at the Wayamba University.
The Minister had stated that in addition to the Medial Faculty, another two medical faculties would be established at the Sabaragamuwa University and the Moratuwa University. Once the Kuliyapitiya Base Hospital is taken over by the Government, it would be developed as a Teaching Hospital, he had stated.
Minister Senaratne had also given instructions to the relevant officials to prepare the Cabinet Paper in this regard. A committee headed by the University Grants Commission Chairman has been appointed to accelerate the procedure.

Govt on witch-hunt against Rajapaksa's - JO
Joint Opposition member Prof. G.L Peiris said yesterday that the government is unsuccessful in all fronts and it is now trying to hunt down Rajapaksas.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said its failure in all aspects are clearly visible, at a time when it completed two years in office.
Certain government ministers have said that special court should be set up to investigate corruption that occurred during the precious regime. He alleged that the government is exacting the political revenge by using the law. Even, Hitler did not have special courts to try members of one family. Everyone is equal before the law and the law can to target specific individuals according to the wishes of the ruling party. If there is enough evidences, the suspects can be
indicted. But we are totally against the political revenge. There is a proposal of having a Trial-at-bar to try the Rajapaksas. But so far Trails-at-Bar have been used only for murder cases. So this is exactly the governments attempt to initiate political revenge.
Only the Chief Justice can take a such a decision on the request of the Attorney General and we do not think he will make a such a request,he added. Several government Ministers have been charged with massive corruption and fraud. So what is the action taken against them by the government
Commenting on the governments attempt to bring a no confidence motion against Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, he said that Minister Rajapaksa has not committed any crime or corruption or breached any laws in relation to fraud. The reason for bringing the no confidence motion against him is his statement on the Hambantota port and a heated argument he had with visiting UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter Terrorism recently.Therefore, we will take our decision considering all facts an aspects once the motion presented to Parliament.
Joint Opposition member MP Dinesh Gunawardene said the government has failed to fulfill his pledges even after a lapse of two year. Yet, the government has failed to announce at least a possible date for the holding of the local government election.The economy is about to collapse while the people are deprived of basic needs and not even provided any reliefs to uplift their livelihoods. Therefore, the Joint Opposition will hold the peaceful demonstration against the
government today in Town Hall at 2pm.

The Great Kings Master Plan
Juliet Coombe discovers how exciting and innovative the second Kingdom Polonnaruwa was eight hundred years ago, when The Great King Parakramabahu rode his elephant through the jungle inspiring thousands of men to clear it to create the most sophisticated interconnecting tank system in the world.
The Great King Parakramabahu understanding the importance of trade joined originally existing water tanks built in the Anuradhapura period to small canals he dug out, which in turn linked to the sub arteries of the Mahaweli River. The Queens and ministers would have followed behind the Great King in sedan chairs known as Dolawa, which required four men to carry them while the thousands of workers that built the tanks went on foot or by bullock cart. How the King fed this number of people in desert like conditions is just one of the many questions I have for my encyclopaedic national guide Priyantha Dambadeniya, whose exclusive engineering and historical lake experience can be booked through EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa or you can email him in advance of your tour on [emailprotected] to talk to him about this and many other amazing tours he does.
I learn many things as I have a go at walking across Gomathi Ela canal using a handmade bridge of logs strapped together one after the other with only coir rope keeping them attached, I realise total balance is required or I will end up face down in the water. I am watched over by water loving trees and a cheeky Malabar Pied Hornbill, just waiting for me to noise dive into the canal that is linked to the five tanks that are part of a fascinating new engineering and architectural tour.
Spiritual healers
The raw experience of balancing on tree trunks, gives me a better understanding of just how clever this civilisation was in harnessing every aspect of nature in creative and new ways that are still used today by the highly inventive people of the area. Guide Dambadeniya who walks across it like a trapeze artist on a high rope starts his half-day tour in front of what many believe is the only statue of The Great King Parakramabahu in the library quarters of the ancient city. I learn many things about Sri Lankas ancient Kings, who converted the people from paganism into Buddhism building huge stupors to do it in the shape of rocks, as up until the third century BC the people of this mystical island only worshipped rock, big trees, the sun and the moon. This way carving Buddhas out of rock like the one you can see at Gal Vihara made it easy for the people to transfer their belief system from paganism into worshipping the precepts of the Buddha.
Dambadeniya my guide, also known as The Master due his decades of studies in history and wildlife explains the Buddhist monks were responsible for teaching Great King Parakramabahu, whose technological ideas sprung from years of learned teachings in the temple. He also loved studying first hand the jungle plants for their healing powers with native doctors.
The King learnt the importance of healing mantras which are supernatural powers that allow one to fix ill health and the monks also showed him gurukam a healing of the mind, which today the west call psychotherapy. To do this you need to be deeply religious and this explains my spiritual guides power to show the depth of this remarkable civilisation that brought the place to life. He explained sitting on a rock that spiritual healers hundreds of years ago could read your life story from your face or palm of your hands and within minutes of doing so tell you your future, even your health issues if no preventive care was taken.
The King himself a deeply spiritual man who used the legacy of the first kingdom Anuradhapura who built the first tank in the area to build on this by building four huge more tanks and canals to interconnect to the river starting from Nuwara Eliya, through Kandy and into sub arteries, joining them into hand cut canals that worked like a cascade system, which finally interconnected together with the tanks to form an incredible inland ocean known today as Parakrama Samudra. This was achieved by clearing over 2,500 hectares of land (6,000 acres) to achieve the vast tank system for trade. He was the first man to understand the importance of water management and is said to have declared to his people Not a single drop of the water sent into the sea must be wasted and one can see from his power shower to pool and then irrigation of the gardens to the fields how the same water was used many times. This philosophy is still applied today as the Parakrama Samudra tanks which are used for everything from drinking water, to washing, irrigation of the paddy fields, growing more than eight hundred species of plants, including important medicinal leaves like Katu Pita, which cleans the blood and cures cancer.
These manmade water tanks created by thousands of people over 18 years are still used for transportation of goods, people, lake fishing for food and now tourism to explain village life. The water ways even provides natural mining for semi precious gems like rose garnets, which can be picked out of the Ambo Ganga river with your own hands as part of the half day tour.
An ancient citadel
This exciting archaeological look at the historic engineering system of the Great King takes you past four of the five tanks, and along the way I learn about medicinal plants, and how even the Kings soap for washing were made from leaves and thus none toxic to the environment. While learning about how to use medicinal plants, I am also told fascinating stories about suicide plants.
People have no idea how for example the Peru Ornamental plant arrived in the dry zone and one can only assume it was from the big trading ships that came from India, China, Persia or Arabia. The seeds of this beautiful flower are as deadly hard as a nut and to break it open you need a rock. These deadly seeds inside are used as suicide capsules when mixed with sugar they become like jelly so easier to eat and are still to this day used by upset village lovers to kill themselves. The English know this poisonous shrub as Yellow Oleander and the people give the flowers as offerings to the Buddha.
I learn sitting on the river bank how Chinese trading ships brought gold, silver, fabulous fabrics to the area to trade them in return for spices and gem stones. Indian traders came for the elephant ivory something the area was rich in during those times. Even the great explorer Marco Polo came to the isle of plenty to buy stones to make jewellery fitting for the elite. The EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa hotel is perfectly situated just above one of the jetties where the small merchant boats landed to trade, and this stunning spot can be fully explored after high tea, which is served, on the rocks to flute music from a boat, on the bund, where the columns were once made for the summer palaces on the lake.
This fabulous boutique hotel in Polonnaruwa EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa is now with the incredible re-furbishment not only the areas best location to stay for four or five days with its world class restaurant menu and delightful staff, but also a chance to finally learn more about the areas history.
So where better to be than nestled among the ruins of an ancient citadel in the dry zone conceived by the Great King, and later developed by the British Empire so the world could come and admire his brilliant work So whether it is early morning or late afternoon this fascinating tour with Dambadeniya will help you understand the incredible engineering achievements and have the benefits of being pampered afterwards by a uniquely trained butler team, who pride themselves on making every stay in the ancient citadel of Polonnaruwa an indulgent one.

Hats off for Diana, Hats off for Diana, the diplomat
The designers who kept all her secrets and how she used her headgear for diplomacy: The hats that made Diana feel like a Princess
There was no other girl in the world who wore as many hats as Princess Diana did during the Eighties.
On the day she signed up to The Firm in St Pauls Cathedral in 1981, millinery-wearing was in the job description.
She knew it was part of being royal, says milliner Stephen Jones, best known in the early Eighties for his rock star hats, but a firm favourite of the Princess in the latter part of the decade.
She understood from the Queen and the Queen Mother that it was part of the responsibility  to be identifiable. It was a symbol of royalty, to set you apart.
The Queens rules for millinery were laid down long before Diana arrived, and still exist. Hats must never disappoint by having brims which obscure the face from onlookers  that would be rude  and can never fly off. Diana took the convention to heart, at least at first. And it worked. Hats give me confidence, Diana once remarked, early in her career as Princess of Wales.
The designers who kept all her secrets
A few months before the big wedding, 19-year-old Diana was taken by her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, to the West London showroom of Scottish-born milliner John Boyd.
A veteran of the Chelsea design establishment, Boyd had been making hats for Princess Anne since she was 17, and Margaret Thatcher since she became Prime Minister in 1979. I knew Dianas grandmother, he tells me now, aged 91. And I met her mother every day on the 173 bus.
That day, Diana came in wearing knickerbockers, looking like a principal boy on the stage. She was quite shy, but it quickly became clear she wasnt interested in plush showrooms; she wanted to see the workroom upstairs and meet the girls there.
They got chatting and she told them shed come because there was a marriage in view, though she didnt say it was hers.
Then she spotted a tricorne hat  a new shape for us  which was going to be in the latest collection, and she said: Oh, I do like that, I think I want that for my going away hat. And that was when we realised it was her wedding she was talking about.
The hat was plucked from the collection, and the shape reserved for Diana. Boyd made another in the same peach-coloured silk as the Bellville Sassoon going away outfit, and topped it with ostrich feathers  a reference to the Prince of Wales three-feathered insignia  which were dyed to match the fabric.
Even for Boyd, it was a career-defining commission and the hat was a big public hit. Suddenly ostrich feathers were all the rage. Indeed, Boyds South African supplier, whose business hitherto was built on providing huge feathers for dancing girls in Hollywood, was flabbergasted by the boom in demand.
In those early years the Princess was almost never seen without a hat, and Boyd became one of her most trusted designers. He understood the enormity of the task she was faced with, and developed a kindly, teasing relationship with her.
She was very tall, and I had to avoid making her look any taller, he says. She liked hats that fitted quite close to her head, and she liked little nets and veils too, which also became very popular.
In fact Boyds pretty Diana designs  tricornes, mini-bowlers, close-fitting cocktail hats with netting and feathers  triggered a trend for small-brimmed hats. From 1981 to 1983, the style was copied at every possible price level, wrote critic Colin McDowell. At seven and a half, her hat size was a little bigger than average, and her hair was quite springy, so Boyd bought special wire combs from Thailand to keep the hats on her head.
She had a great sense of humour, he says. I used to tease her, and say: Youve got a big head  lets hope theres a lot inside it because youve got a big job.
I remember once, early on, we went to the wee cafe across the road from the showroom and a woman there said to her: You look just like that new Princess. And she replied: Thats funny, everybody says that . 
Its a telling anecdote from a time, hard to imagine now, when Dianas face was still relatively unknown  glimpsed under a heavy veil on her wedding day, but by no means iconic yet. She did have a wonderful fashion sense, says Boyd. She knew just how to wear hats and look chic. And the more people got to know her, the better an ambassador she was for British fashion.
In the end, she was just the best weve ever had. Wherever you went in the world, as soon as they heard you speak English, people would ask you all about Lady Di. They couldnt get enough of her.
As she grew into her Royal role, milliners Philip Somerville, Frederick Fox, and Graham Smith of Kangol, were drafted in, too.
The Australian hat-maker Fox was particularly influential in the mid-Eighties, when Diana began to experiment with wider brims and was seen wearing his flying saucer-shaped hats at Ascot.
Somerville, meanwhile, often made hats to co-ordinate with outfits by Catherine Walker, and encouraged Diana to go for bold colours, often with distinct hat bands  fuchsia and pillar box red; crimson and black.
This was in marked contrast to John Boyds more discreet affairs. He was also behind Dianas move into Jackie Kennedy-style pillboxes, which she wore perched on the back of her head.
Diplomacy
Diplomacy via headgear was royal protocol. Coded compliments to foreign hosts and witty references for special appearances were part of the Queens tradition, and Diana ran with it.
For a visit to Japan in May 1986, for example, she accessorised a now-famous red-spotted dress with a wide-brimmed scarlet hat, replicating the Japanese Rising Sun flag almost too obviously  though her hosts fell in love with it, and the outfit made headlines around the world the next day.
Meanwhile, a Philip Somerville blue-and-white turban hat was commissioned for a trip to Dubai in 1989; a stylish means of keeping her hair from view, in line with the countrys more conservative attitude to female dress.
Somerville also made her a sleek pagoda-shaped hat in purple silk  with a wide brim and a pointed crown  to match a Catherine Walker outfit worn on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989.
Milliner Graham Smith provided the suitably military-style white hat for Walkers outfit for Diana when she attended a passing out parade at Sandhurst in 1987.
But most daring, and either horribly mistaken or gloriously witty, depending on your taste, was the hat she wore to Ascot in 1986. Its black silk brim and crown of green and black polka dots matched her spotty dress. With an outfit so clearly referencing lurid jockey silks, onlookers might have been forgiven for expecting Diana to saddle up for the races herself. She loved dressing up, because in a way, the clothes and hats could speak for her when she couldnt, says Stephen Jones. -Daily Mail

Heed their call
For the first time in the country's political history the movements, groups and organisations which strove to install a government in power has come out in the open to criticise it for not honouring its election pledges. There have been criticisms leveled from within. There have also been government members who have sat as Independents, over dissent. But never has agitation taken such a form from the outside by groups who lent their shoulder to the wheel to establish a government. Certainly not the Pancha Maha Balavegaya which brought SWRD to power. No segment of the PMB raised their voice against misgovernance or failure to keep to the pledges of the MEP government.
Such a scenario, of course, would have been unthinkable under the Rajapaksa government. Dissent was not encouraged under Rajapaksa, even among Cabinet ministers, in contrast to now under Yahapalanaya. One need not have strained one's imagination to conclude what would have been the fate of the outsiders who dared tried to put the regime on the right track.
In that sense, the protest held at the Viharamahadevi Park by the pro-Yahapalanaya civil society organisations, to pressure the government to implement its election pledges, is unique. It is doubly significant, in that, among the protesters were government ministers who were seeing doing a Mea Culpa for the tardiness of the government in bringing to book those involved in mega corruption under the Rajapaksa government- a main pledge under Yahapalanaya.
Speaker after speaker virtually tore into the government for its lackadaisical attitude towards prosecuting the rogues under Rajapaksa. Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne called for trials to be conducted against high ranking officials of the former regime, on a day-to-day basis, before a High Court. He said, the matter had been discussed at the Cabinet and this was likely to be implemented shortly. The minister said, with the new initiative, he hoped all those charged with crime and malpractices will be brought to justice before the next May Day. Other speakers also wanted the investigations expedited.
True, their grievances are justified. Members of these civil society groups, professionals, artistes etc. virtually put their lives on the line in banding themselves together to see the ouster of the Rajapaksas. The Common Candidate, himself, was virtually in hiding on election night and famously said that he would have been six feet underground if the results had gone the other way. There is no knowing what would have become of their fate had the results on January 8 been different.
Besides, individuals of these organisations have being singled out by the JO and Rajapaksa friendly media for special mention, for their crusader role in seeing back of the Rajapaksa regime. Not only them, members of their families too would have felt the full brunt of the retaliation had things gone wrong. Hence their agitation.
Of course, the daring showed by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha, under severe odds, to rally these groups and organisations to take the fight to the enemy camp, no doubt, would live in the memory, forever, among those who took up the gauntlet. In that context, the catalytic role of the Ven. Sobitha could be termed as a ground breaking feat in the post independence history of Sri Lanka, which, no doubt, will be appreciated by all those who value freedom and justice. If not for him, there would not have been the same enthusiasm, that the public witnessed, among these organisations to take the fight to the Rajapaksa camp. Hence, it was fitting that the event at the Viharamahadevi Park was dedicated to the Ven. Thera.
But, even the Ven. Maduluwawe, had he been alive, no doubt, would have been a disillusioned and disappointed individual at the way the government had been dilly dallying in bringing the corrupt to book and its other lapses. He would virtually have thrown up his arms in consternation at the manner in which the large scale swindlers of the last government have made bold to point the accusing finger at the functionaries of the Yahapalanaya government, when in fact, the guns should be trained in the opposite direction.
Be that as it may, both, President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe should pay heed to the call of this most vital element of the campaign for good governance and get the machinery in motion to realise the most important pledge of their election campaign. This would not only silence their critics but also expose those now posing as paragons of virtue.
The government should, even at this late stage, take stock of the situation and get cracking, if not for anything else, but to spare these civil society groups and organisations from being pilloried by Opposition politicians for their role in installing the Yahapalanaya government. It is these members who are still holding the fort on behalf of the government, coming over TV talk shows to defend the regime at every turn. They should not be made to feel that they are being taken for granted.

H'tota Port lease will create huge opportunities for locals - Welikala
The leasing of Hambantota Port to a Chinese company will create huge business opportunities for the local shipping and logistics sector, said Serendib logistics President, Niluka Welikala.
Speaking to Daily News Business, she said that she is expressing her views and an entrepreneur and not from a political angle. She said if not for the Chinese firm coming in, the Hambantota Port development project would have remained stagnant.
Niluka Welikala
Building a port in Hambantota was a step taken in the right direction as it was strategically located in the heart of international shipping routes. We saw the potential in the Hambantota Port and opened our warehousing complex in a BOI land site in Mirijawala, Hambantota, on long-term lease basis a few years ago. Since then, we see a steady growth in our operations, she said.
She said that after opening the Port the much needed infrastructure and logistics were not being installed at a pace that was needed. Due to this, the true potential of the harbour could not be exploited and hence the harbour did not take off as planned.
Welikala said that a massive investment was needed to put advanced infrastructure such as gantry cranes and additional cargo unloading facilities. For this investment running in to several millions of rupees, a Chinese company has come forward to install them, taking away a huge burden from the government.
"From the point of view of a local entrepreneur, first we will have a lot of opportunities in the infrastructure development sector and second, in the services sector. Chinese investors will obviously need the local player to partner them in logistics and local companies can benefit."
In addition, there would also be several openings for transport and other services such as supply of essential services to cargo ships that will call at Hambantota Port, she said.
"Several international industries too would be set up in the investment zone and here again local companies support would be sought by foreign companies, opening up business vistas for Lankans that were never on the horizon. In addition, youth also would get high earning employment opportunities."
She said that there would be several foreign workers and this would also give openings for the locals to look after their logistics.
Welikala, who has a wide experience in the field of logistics, freight forwarding and warehousing for over two decades, she said they offer total solutions in warehousing and hub operations for both international and local clients in Sri Lanka. She said that there would soon be a Personal Cargo segment too introduced at the Hambantota Port allowing people in the South as well as the East to collect their cargo without travelling to Colombo. We will look at this business.
We are also looking at the tourism and cruise shipping sector and will invest in building a three star hotel in Hambantota.

ICT sector welcomes FMS move to abolish 10 per cent telecommunication levy
ICT sector welcomed the move by the Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to remove the 10 per cent telecommunication levy imposed on internet services from September 01.
Minister of Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando earlier said that he made a representation at the last budget to get this concession but it was not a reality. Now we welcome this move and it will defiantly hold to increase internet penetration in Sri Lanka and also increase use of android devices.
With a phenomenal growth of mobile broadband connections and rapidly increasing fixed internet connections, Sri Lanka is fast establishing itself as a potential regional ICT hub.
India De Soyza Consultant Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) said that this will be a major boost for the ICE sector in Sri Lanka. Firstly it would greatly help our efforts to promote the internet penetration in Sri Lanka which is around 30%.
In addition this will also lead to increase usage of mobile ticketing by the public. We will also see a sharp increase of the additional adaptation of mobile booking in areas of Doctor channeling and other mobile based bookings.
Further rapid Digitalization development this would be a key benefit to consumers and citizen where they will be enabled to use mobile data willingly to browse internet, said, Managing Director, cum CEO, eCybersec Pvt Ltd Sanjee Balasuriya
 During 2016, Sri Lankans went on to subscribe to 1.5 million cellular mobile connections and over 300,000 broadband and dial-up internet connections, increasing Sri Lankas internet penetration to a 30% and to our total internet users to a 6.1 million. Therefore this tax imposed was crucial for consumers and citizens of this country. With this change Sri Lankas increased internet connectivity also have given a boost to the Sri Lankans presence in the social media, especially on the Facebook, the favorite local online hangout. With greater access to information comes the ability to make informed decisions when making purchases.
According to the latest market trends, more and more Sri Lankan consumers research their products online prior to making purchases while millennial remain the main consumers of online e-commerce sites. Young people of the country will have an enabler to use mobile data once the tax component brings down.
Overall this would be a good and positive movement from Sri Lankan government, he said.

Its time for another freedom struggle: A Midnights Child looks back on Indias 70-year journey
The clear stream of reason has lost its way, says a journalist born in 1947.We must take the pledge of dedication to the service of India afresh.
I am almost Midnights Child. I arrived some weeks before the magic hour. On August 15, 1947, they celebrated by taking a ride in a Victoria horse carriage on Bombays Marine Drive with me, all of three months old.
As August 15, 2017, Indias 70th Independence Day approaches, I wonder whether this is the India my parents dreamed of. Neither is around to answer that question. But I am certain that their idea of India is very different from the new India that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to help build by 2022.
Today, apart from Independence, the painful memories of the Partition are also being invoked. Yet far away from the borders that wrenched one country into two, leading to mass migration on a scale not seen anywhere in the world and an unprecedented scale of communal killings, I grew up with little awareness of this cataclysmic event. So did many others like me, I imagine.
No one from my family went to Pakistan, or came to India from Pakistan. The only migration in the family was when my parents  from Mangalore and Mysore  moved to Bombay and then, after their marriage, to North India.
We grew up in a place that was once called Begumabad, a village near Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. It was renamed Modinagar after Seth Gujarmal Modi, an industrialist who set up a textile mill, a sugar factory, a rubber factory as well as a school, a college and housing colonies for his employees. Today, most of the factories have disappeared and Modinagar has been transformed into an educational hub.
Cranking it up
In the 1950s and 1960s, I grew up as a middle-class kid in this company town, where the houses were identical. Television had not yet arrived in India but everyone had radios (not transistors though). No one I knew had a refrigerator but iceboxes did the job. A lucky few had a wind-up gramophone.
Also, no one had electric hot water geysers. Nor had I ever seen a shower. Copper samovars did the job of providing hot water; a steel bucket and a brass lota did the rest.
I cannot remember my parents buying readymade clothes. The tailor stitched our clothes, usually a size larger so they would last longer. And woolen sweaters were always hand knitted.
In these days of short attention spans, it seems unreal that one could spend long summer holidays without ever complaining of being bored. We entertained ourselves either playing chor-police in the colony garden, a hot favourite where the youngest was assigned the task of being the jailor; cricket and badminton, the latter without a net and the former with a rubber ball; or board games like Ludo and Chinese Checkers. Monopoly and Scrabble came much later.
Temptation to buy anything was strictly limited to the amount of money you had. If you were middle class, living in a single income family, there was practically no surplus. You bought only what you needed. This was not some high moral principle. It was necessity.
Did it make us miserable, hungry for more, feeling we were missing out on something I think not. The differences between living in a small North Indian town like Modinagar and Bombay, which we would visit in the holidays, did not seem so stark as to make us restless.
Was this because Indias restricted economy flattened everyone to the same level Or was our lack of restlessness about material things a hangover of the Independence struggle that still lingered even two decades later Perhaps a little of both.
For the countrys good
I can remember constantly being lectured in school about how privileged we were to get a good education and that we must think of what we can do for the country, how we can use our lives to serve people less advantaged than us. This was not the nationalism of today; it was perhaps playing on guilt but also appealing to our conscience.
That message found a resonance in many of us. Despite our parents saving up to give us the best education possible and hoping we would become doctors, engineers or join the civil services, at least some Midnights Children let their parents down.
Our coming of age coincided with a time of questioning around the world. What contribution could you make to the country if the structures of oppression had remained in tact despite the end of colonialism Was getting degrees and professional qualifications enough to make you understand what was going on in a country where the majority was abjectly poor Could those of us who lived in cities ever understand the reality of rural India unless we went and lived there Should our engineers be building bridges and dams or going out to see how technology could change the lives of people in rural India These and hundreds of other questions infected our minds, refusing to allow us to slip into complaisance.
Caught in this churn of questions, many of us made choices that hurt and distressed our families. But at that time, it seemed the only thing one could do if you believed that coming from your class and your education, you had to do something to make a difference.
The point of this narration is to depict, briefly, the India in which people like me grew up. There was very little cynicism and a lot of idealism.
The dark period
So when and how did this tryst with idealism get dented
Before I, and India could hit 30, the idea of a free and democratic India had already been shattered when Indira Gandhi declared a state of Emergency on June 26, 1975. She imposed press censorship, imprisoned the opposition and suspended fundamental rights. At the stroke of midnight, free India was un-free. Would it ever come out of this dark period Certainly in the days after the declaration of Emergency, and the months that followed, there seemed no end in sight.
Yet, it did end, spectacularly and unexpectedly in 1977 when Indira Gandhi called an election and was defeated. We were a free country again. Or were we For many of us, the principal lesson from the Emergency was how easy it is to erode democratic values and why the very concept of freedom has to be re-examined within the context of the gross inequalities in our society.
As India completes 70, that reality has not changed. If anything, it has become starker. What is also evident today is that the Partition of 1947 is now a reality at so many other levels in India, in the deepening divisions between class, caste and creed.
Yet Modi speaks of his new India being free of communalism. How extraordinary that a man who heads a party that has built its political fortunes on communal poison can proclaim this without a moment of embarrassment.
The old India in which I grew up also had communal schisms, between Hindus and Muslims, between upper and lower castes. But even though difference was acknowledged, it was not emphasised or demonised. Many of us grew up not knowing where we belonged  South India, North India, just India I had coined the term emotionally integrated Indian to describe myself. Today, on the other hand, you are branded with your identity, in terms of region, religion and caste.
There is little in this new India that we are being promised that can keep alive the flame of idealism. Yet, I believe we can refuse to despair even though at times it appears that the unrelenting push towards changing the core of India is unstoppable; that the forces of the Hindutva will succeed in turning this country into a Hindu Rashtra where anyone who does not subscribe to their ideology will be rendered a second-class citizen if not a non-citizen.
What is more worrying is that this is happening so insidiously and at so many levels that it seems to have dulled our sense of outrage. Or perhaps there is too much to be outraged about. So one watches with despair and hopes that miraculously things will change.
If there is anything we can learn from these past 70 years it is that change only comes when people decide that they will not sit back and tolerate the intolerable. The sad reality is that even the Emergency would have continued if Indira Gandhi had not called an election. The silent majority were angry but were scattered and intimidated while the minority, who endorsed her actions, ruled with confidence.
Another midnight hour
Today, we cannot say for sure that the majority is angry. Many people are upset and disillusioned. But will they find a way to express this, or have they accepted that nothing can be done to change the direction in which this country is being taken
We are approaching a midnight hour of another kind, not one that will lead this country into freedom, but where the clear stream of reason has lost its way as Rabindranath Tagore wrote. An hour when partitions at every level are becoming the norm and where based on this divided and hate-filled nation, the votaries of a Hindu Rashtra could succeed in raising their bhagwa jhanda.
There is not much point in harking back to the old India that has disappeared. But there is every reason to oppose the vision of a new India that is being thrust down our throats, that has nothing new about it as it goes about keeping alive outdated and old divisions and hatreds. Nothing new and lasting can be built on such poisonous foundations. Midnights Children and their progeny will have to get ready for another freedom struggle.

Jellyfish glass tables
If you think glasswork involves nothing more than everyday household wares, think again. Italian artisan Daniela Forti uses a unique process to create stunningly surreal and unique works of translucent art, and they might remind you of a familiar sea creature.
Though Forti hails from Rome, she claims fame from her mastery of long-refined Tuscan tradition. The 57-year-old has been living and working among the rolling hills of Chainti since 1982, and shes upholding her hard-earned reputation as a master of vetreria with her latest collection, appropriately dubbed Meduse  the Italian name for jellyfish.
She produces these breathtaking table-like sculptures through glass fusion  a technique which involves strategically melting down already-solid pieces of glass until they meld and weave together, forming new and beautiful shapes. In the case of Meduse, gravity is the instrument that helps Forti fashion the realistic tentacles they possess.

President Maithripala Sirisena named the Karadiyana waste management project as the Mihisaru Viyamana Resource Management Centre and laid the foundation stone for the Karadiyana electricity generating project and landfill named the Batahira Kasala Viduliyata project yesterday morning.
The project is implemented by the Fairway West Management (Private) Ltd with the assistance of the Ministries of Megapolis and Western Development and Provincial Councils and Local Government bringing the vision of establishing large scale common waste management projects introduced by the Western Province Waste Management Authority under the Punarudaya environment conservation national programme into fruition.
A large quantity of waste would be collected daily at the Karadiyana Waste Management Yard, out of which 500 metric tons could be transformed into energy.
Electricity generated by the project would be sufficient to feed 37,500 houses. It would also produce carbonic fertilizer in addition to electricity.
The process would help reduce the amount of waste released to the environment by almost 90 percent and provide a sustainable solution to the environmental and social problems caused due to the dumping of waste.
Ministers Patali Champika Ranawake and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya also participated.

Larger ships to be Port of Oaklands new normal
The trend of larger ships calling at the Port of Oakland recorded during the first half of 2017 is expected to become the new normal at the port, especially in the light of the latest infrastructural investments allowing for the handling of bigger ships.
Ship size is increasing in Oakland. Average size vessel here was 8,000 TEU. Moving now toward 14,000 TEU. In a few years, itll be 18,000 TEU. Oakland is handling larger ships without difficulty. Carriers dont hesitate to call with bigger ships. After the obvious infrastructure requirements: 50-foot depth, heightened ship-to-shore cranes; the key is cargo-handling performance. Transformation in our marine terminals allows Oakland to work big ships efficiently and deliver cargo promptly, Michael Zampa, Port of Oaklands Communications Director, said while speaking to World Maritime News.
Just two years ago, the port was battling congestion issues arising from waterfront contract talks between the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU).
Today, Port of Oaklands Maritime Director John Driscoll boasts of top port productivity among West Coast rivals with 35-to-40 container moves per hour during vessel operations, and ships spending 24 hours, or less, at berth. World Maritime News

License, Aint No Problem Sir..!
A survey done recently showed that in India, corruption is so rampant that a huge percentage of drivers get a license without ever doing a driving test. Heres my imaginary experience with a driving school:
The instructor at the driving school looked up from the road map he was trying to read. Dont worry sir, he said giving me a toothy grin, we will get you a driving license within a week.
Within a week, I exclaimed, I hardly knows the inside of a car right now.
It doesnt matter what you know or dont know, said the instructor patiently, you will have the necessary certificate within seven days.
What are the timings for my driving classes every day I asked.
We are not very particular, said the instructor, we know how much people are pressed for time, we are very understanding. If you can come for the classes well and good, if not, it doesnt matter.
But how can I get a license if I dont attend your driving classes I asked quite confused.
Ah, said the instructor with a smile. Our boss is very well connected, his second wifes brothers best friend works in the licensing office and for a small fee the work is done.
I see, I said without really seeing anything.
But if you have the time, said the instructor moving a little closer towards me, it would be good if you could attend our theory class.
Good! I exclaimed, Im glad I will learn some aspects of driving at least.
We will have an ex-traffic police inspector to lecture you all, said the instructor quickly.
An ex-traffic police inspector, I said, Sounds very impressive.
His lectures are always jam packed, said the instructor happily. Last week he spoke on how to drive past a red light without being caught and the week before he spoke on the exact amount to pay a cop if ever caught, you see people have the tendency of either paying too much or too little.
I see, I whispered uneasily.
You will benefit immensely from our driving school, said the instructor unfolding a bundle and showing a form in front of me.
Thank you, I said shoving the form back to him and trying to move away.
Where are you going, shouted the instructor running after me. Dont you want a license for yourself
Yes I do, I said, but I want to learn driving.
Learn driving asked the man in a whisper, hurriedly looking around in every direction and then quickly pushing me out. Sir, please dont scare the other students away, I think you have come to the wrong place..!

Living in no-nonsense times
In the opening days of this month, August 2017, about the only person in all of India to be publicly targeted for alleged black money was the afore-mentioned Minister, DK Shivakumar.
The timing too may have been well-considered. Since Ahmed Patel, Gujarat's Congress leader, had shown the temerity to stand up to Amit Shah, the BJP president, shouldn't Patel be prevented from re-entering the Rajya Sabha Why not immobilise Shivakumar and liberate Gujarat's MLAs for the market economy
We live in no-nonsense times. A day or two before the raids on Shivakumar, this is what Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju told Parliament, during a debate on lynchings:
When India's name is shining in the eye of the globe, when people the world over respect our Prime Minister, at this moment to ruin the image of our Prime Minister, our government is as bad as ruining the image of our country I am ending my comments with a warning... As many times as you raise issues like this, those many times we will expose you. Wishes are not facts. India's name does not necessarily glow in the world today. Yes, India's global footprint has steadily expanded over the last 25 years.
International coverage
Persons of Indian origin play more visible roles on several continents. But farmers suicides, violence against women, and lynching of humans in the name of the cow invite critical international coverage on TV, in print and on social media.
The world also rightly wonders about the media's independence in India. Our always-visible Prime Minister is also, unfortunately, wholly inaccessible. He is possibly the first Indian Prime Minister who does not hold press conferences or give interviews to probing journalists. When was the last time anyone read a candid interview with Mr Modi Or watched such an interview on television
Our Prime Minister tweets, launches projects, meets world figures, addresses election rallies, gives a monthly radio talk. He reaches us. Sometimes he makes constructive points. But we cannot reach him or ask him questions. A one-way torrent of words, even of eloquent words, is not democracy.
Mr Rijiju was right to refer to world opinion. We do not know whether the lynchings would have secured a debate in Parliament but for the international dismay aroused. Leaving out exceptions like North Korea's rulers, few regimes can wholly disregard international opinion. During our 1975-77 Emergency, Indira Gandhi kept, in a drawer near her South Block desk, a few small journals that had criticised her. If a foreign caller asked her about the freedom of the press in India, she would show the articles.
The journals preserved in Mrs Gandhi's drawer did not represent the state of India's conformist Press in 1975-77. Likewise, newspapers questioning the central government today do not speak for India's big media. Possessing a much wider reach, our TV channels seem unwilling to hold Modi and his team to account. When Opposition parties become weak and primary media is fearful, only Caesar may save us from Caesar and his supporters. However, Mr Modi, who has the platform and megaphone to reach millions, who expounds a great deal on chosen goals, refuses to address the nation on life-and-death matters.
A brief statement that the Prime Minister condemns lynching was not half enough. From a TV screen, Mr Modi must directly condemn culprits and their supporters. He must tell India's policemen, with the whole nation watching, that they must protect every person on India's soil.
He must assure India's women, Dalits and Muslims, specifying them, that their safety is his commitment. Publicly and privately, he must insist that state governments bring the guilty to justice. His record, unfortunately, does not suggest that Mr Modi will do any of this.
Following Independence, a far-from-perfect yet precious house of democracy was created in our land. Behind it lay the sacrifice of countless people, including the forebears of many who may read this.
Hindus and Muslims
In this piece, I cite only from two or three of them, but what a team of heroes we had. I marvel at all of them, thank God for all of them, and do not compare them with one another. At that mid-August midnight 70 years ago, this is what Jawaharlal Nehru said: We shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out, however high the wind or stormy the tempest... All of us, to whatever religion we may belong, are equally the children of India with equal rights, privileges and obligations.
And here are BR Ambedkar's challenging words: Political tyranny is nothing compared to social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies government.
Narendra Modi himself often speaks of Babasaheb Ambedkar. He also often speaks of Mahatma Gandhi. The Swachh Bharat campaign has Gandhi, or at least Gandhi's spectacles, as its icon.

LR joins project to build worlds biggest sailing cargo ship
UK-based maritime classification society Lloyds Register (LR) has joined the Quadriga sustainable shipping project, an initiative from Hamburg-based Sailing Cargo, which aims to build the worlds biggest sailing cargo ship.
The project outlines a plan to build a 170-meter car carrier, capable of carrying between 1,700 and 2,000 cars, which will be equipped with four DynaRig masts and will operate on hybrid propulsion with sails and diesel-electric engines, and an optional battery system for peak loads. The vessel will be capable of sailing at 10-12 knots with the aim of reaching 14-16 knots in the next few years through combined expertise.
Wind-assisted propulsion offers one of the few realistic options for introducing renewable power into shipping, LR said.
The IMO target for CO2 emissions requires a 50% reduction in global ship-sourced CO2 emissions by 2020, this means significant changes in the industry are required.
The big question is whether the technology will be available on the scale needed to achieve the level of reduction required. The consensus is that engineering advances alone and the associated efficiency gains will simply not be enough to meet the IMO target. Fuels will have to change and the Quadriga project provides one of the potential viable alternative solutions.
Through consultancy during the design and specification stage followed by onsite new construction supervision, LR will help to ensure compliance with technical, safety and environmental standards upon realisation of the project. LR will also verify whether the predicted performance parameters have been achieved.

Naval personnel attached to the Northern Naval Command with the assistance of the Coastguard took into custody nine persons along with four Fibre Glass Dinghies (FGDs) for causing destruction to fish breeding grounds and illegal fishing in the seas North-East of Point Pedro recently.
The Navy and the Coastguard upon observation that the suspects, under the guise of traditional fishing, were trapping cuttlefish into illegally made enclosures, encircling a wide sea area using fishing nets, sand bags and twigs. The unscrupulous method has caused enormous destruction to fish breeding grounds and led to the depletion of fish stocks substantially. If allowed to continue, the wanton destruction made with the sole intention of making a fast buck, with scant regard for repercussions, would adversely affect the livelihoods of law-abiding fishermen and deal a deadly blow to the fishing industry in the area, which is fast improving as a result of the constant vigilance maintained by the Navy in collaboration with the Coastguard.
The arrested persons along with the FGDs were handed over to the Assistant Fisheries Director of Jaffna for legal action, as their illegal mode of fishing was in clear contravention of the fishing methods approved under the Fisheries Act.

No need to wait until the expiration of Uva Provincial Councils term in 2019 to hold Provincial Council Elections, State Minister of Enterprise Development Lakshaman Yapa Abeywardane said.
He made this observation by refuting all allegations levelled against the government claiming that the Provincial Council elections can only be held in 2019 after the expiration of the term of the Uva Provincial Council.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, the State Minister said that the 20th Amendment to the Constitution has been gazetted to hold all Provincial Council (PC) Elections on the same day. But, it doesnt mean that we have to wait till the expiration of the term of the last constitute Provincial Council in 2019.
He further said that if the Chief Minister presents facts to the governor and requests the Provincial Council to be dissolved, the governor can take steps under the constitution to dissolve the Provincial Council.
It is our duty to fulfil what people expected form the government of good governance. People who voted for us wanted to reduce the wastage of public money. The Chairman of the Elections Council announced that the holding of election on different days is a wastage of public money. So we decided to hold elections on the same day, He added.

The Ministry of Education of the NWP - PC has issued a circular banning the conducting of tuition classes on Sundays in and around the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP. Kumari Weerasekara, Secretary to the Provincial Ministry of Education  NWP, had signed and issued the circular instructing all school heads and Pirivena heads, school teachers and parents in the NWP not to permit school children to attend private classes on Sundays from 6.00 a.m to 1.30 p.m each day, as students have to study Dhamma at Sunday Dhamma schools. The students who study from Grade one to eleven ( up to G.C.E.(O.L) are thus prohibited from attending private tuition classes on Sundays.
NWP-PC Chief Minister and Education Minister of NWP Sandya Kumara Rajapakse had instructed the Secretary to the Provincial Education Ministry to issue this circular to induce students and parents to attend Dhamma schools on Sundays as religious education seems to have been neglected by the students over the undue competition among them towards public examinations, said Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary W.

Pakistans Akmal in trouble over Arthur outburst
LAHORE, Thursday - Umar Akmal faces sanction from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) following the out-of-favour batsman's public outburst against head coach Mickey Arthur.
Akmal addressed a news conference on Wednesday in which he lashed out at Arthur, accusing the South African of insulting him and refusing him access to the coaching facilities at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).
"I accept my fitness isn't up to the mark, and I am trying to work on it, and I asked to be allowed a trainer to help me," Akmal said.
"But Mickey said I shouldn't even have come to the NCA and should be playing club cricket instead," he said, claiming Arthur's language as "demeaning and insulting".
The PCB said a 'show-cause' notice has been issued to Akmal following the outburst.
"The middle-order batsman has seven days to file a reply," the board said on its Twitter feed.
Arthur, who had sent Akmal back from the Champions Trophy squad in England for failing fitness tests, confirmed an exchange of words with the 27-year-old.
"I did tell him a few home truths and said he was always looking for excuses instead of looking at himself," the former South Africa and Australia coach told ESPNcricinfo.
"I also told him that he had to earn the right to use our support staff because he is not a contracted cricketer. He can't just walk in here and demand what he wants."

## Title: PPP, higher education and the State
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

PPP, higher education and the State
PPP or public  private partnership is a remedy recommended for many ills of the system of tertiary education. It is introduced as a new concept in lieu of privatization. For example, the Government vows that it will not privatize state owned enterprises but would establish public-private partnerships instead.
First of all are PPPs that strange Dont we already have PPPs The answer to the first question is negative while the second question has a positive answer. There are many institutions and enterprise that are in fact PPPs. For example take LECO  the Lanka Electric Company. It was born as a result of a partial privatization of the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Or take the entire private hospital system. They are termed private but are actually public private partnerships. The private sector provides physical capital for it and that also with considerable financial and other privileges offered by the Government while the State provides almost 95 percent more of the human capital. Supposing health service personnel in the State sector stops working in the private health service sector it would collapse like a bunch of paper huts. The action of the State in this respect is similar to a businessman funding a rival competitor in the same industry and extolling his success over his own performance.
PPP is proposed as a solution even to the crisis about the controversial SAITM Medical Faculty. In the case of Hambantota port development, PPP is already a reality. PPP is only a different name for privatization just as the open economy was once known as Dharma Rajya and Human Phase of Capitalism later.
Equitable opportunities for education
The problems facing higher education are much graver. The Government must accept its responsibility to educate all its citizens, to provide them equitable opportunities for education. It is also accountable for its actions. Education should be considered a human right. The Government is therefore obliged to provide special financial and other benefits to the disadvantaged and marginalized sections of the population.
Sri Lankas premier standing among nations with commendable literacy and education levels is a result of the free education system initiated in 1945 and subsequent expansion of Swabhasha education. Of late, however, Sri Lankan education system has deteriorated due to lack of finances and political will among others.
If University education is considered, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) Report states:  State University system has been unable to keep pace with developments in the labour market. It is confronted with challenges including limited accessibility, low quality and weak relevance poor governance and managerial capacity and inadequate resources. This conclusion of the ADB sums up the ills succinctly.
The National Education Commission has among a series of recommendations has proposed the following: promoting equitable access, development of quality and assurance of undergraduate programmes, strengthening of graduate programmes and external degree programmes, promoting better governance, building management capacities and diversification of sources of financing.
The Commission also considered the University system as the hub of basic and applied research. It also called for industry  University cooperation in research. It must be mentioned here that the Sri Lankan private sector conducts only 5 percent of research while the State sector provides the balance 95 percent. The private sector lacks entrepreneurship and has shown great hesitation in taking risks. They had a challenge when the GSP+ facility was withdrawn. But instead of engaging in developing productivity through R & D it was begging the Government for assistance and the latter also had no programme than going after the EU.
Lack of qualified academics
Overall Sri Lanka spends only 0.14 percent of the GDP on R & D, perhaps the lowest percentage even in South Asia. Inadequate has limited the number of academics engaged in research and development. Only 5  20 percent of them are engaged in research and that also mainly in social sciences.
It seems that the Government has forgotten its responsibility to the State University system which patronized mainly by the less affluent strata of society. There is much to be done to develop it. Teaching as well as administrative staff vacancies have not been filled. There is a lack of qualified academics. To make matters worse, instead of rectifying the shortcomings the Minister of Higher Education and few other ministers are openly ridiculing State Universities comparing it with SAITM, whose qualifications are still debatable.
Besides Government politicians seem to hold outdated conceptions about University education. They consider University students to be school children who should be armed by using force or disciplinary measures. Even the failure of the so-called Act on preventing ragging has not opened their eyes. University students are youth in their prime and hence naturally revolting against injustice and discrimination. The violent protests could and should be solved through debate and discussion and above all creating a democratic environment for freedom of expression and association could thrive.
The Government blames the Universities for producing unwanted graduates, especially in humanities. On the other hand it never accepts the responsibility for the same. The principal reason for students in humanities being the majority is that the number of schools that could send students in physical and biological sciences being a minority, less than 1,000 or so. Beside the UGC being a bureaucratic denies sufficient autonomy for the Universities to decide upon their courses of studies. The under-development of the economy and the Government's mix up of priorities. We find, for example, agriculture graduates serving in the services industry with no connection to agriculture and science. Lack of planning in post-graduate education has also denied the country of qualified academics and researchers.
Another principal shortcoming is the lack of transparency in government activities. Most of its legislation is thrust upon the people suddenly without providing an opportunity for public discussion. Democracy to be meaningful must be participatory.

Pre-budget bonanza for small enterprises
Broadband internet tax-free:
Light trucks, motorcycles reduced:
The government yesterday unveiled a raft of new measures to boost small and medium enterprises and offered subsidised loans of up to 750 million rupees for agricultural and export-oriented industries.
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweeera said tax cuts on small commercial vehicles and motorcycles coupled with targeted loan subsidies should create another 50,000 jobs this year.
While tax reductions on light trucks and motorcycles came into effect from Friday, the abolishing of the 10 percent levy on broadband will kick in from September.
The minister said telecom operators had agreed to match the governments gesture by loading a volume of 10 percent more data to their existing tariff packages and making internet access even more affordable.
We want to make this an entrepreneurs paradise. Sri Lanka has a history of being a trading nation of very efficient, dynamic entrepreneurs for the last 2,000 years. We are taking steps to harness the entrepreneurial skills of our people, the minister said.
They used to say, when (Neil Armstrong) went to the moon he found a Matara bath kade (eatery) already in operation there!
He said the tax cuts and subsidies were aimed at empowering small businesses to build a strong economy and ensure that people were not dependent on handouts.
With immediate effect, the government is slashing the taxes on light trucks and single cabs by 300,000 rupees and is abolishing a 90 percent excise duty on motorcycles with an engine capacity of 150 cubic centimetres or less.
He said the move was aimed at improving transportation particularly in the rural sector and lift the small-scale enterprises across the country.
This is the first time such a targeted package of measures is being unveiled, the minister said
The minister said he expected economic growth to be between 4.5 to 5.0 percent this year despite the twin effects of the floods in May and the ongoing drought in several parts of the island. Sri Lankas economic growth last year was 4.4 percent.
Subsidised loans were being offered under eight categories with the aim of boosting small scale enterprises as well as export-oriented medium scale industries.
We want the country to be a paradise not only for foreign investors, but for our entrepreneurs too, he said. The new measures also include subsidised loans for one million homes to set up solar panels on their roofs and generate their own electricity. Each home will be offered Rs 350,000 repayable over five years with an interest rate of 6.0 percent.
The government is setting aside Rs 1,500 million to subsidise solar panels under the clean energy drive across the country.
The government is setting aside a total of 4,475 million rupees to subsidies loans under the new scheme unveiled by the minister Thursday.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said the package was presented ahead of next years budget, and he hoped the government could announce more concessions when the 2018 budget is unveiled in November.

He added that the government expects to implement a new programme in the agricultural sector to strengthen the economy of the farmers as well as the national economy, through increasing the foreign market for local vegetables and fruit.
He said the government has planned a programme to attract the young generation to agriculture through modernizing the agricultural sector.
Commenting on ensuring peoples right to own land, the President said the government officers have a responsibility to work without any delay, irrespective of politics or political parties. He recalled that mega conflicts in history were based on the right to lands. He said the government is performing to fulfil its responsibility to give all Sri Lankans a right to own land.
Addressing the gathering after symbolically handing over 5,000 deeds to residents of Mahaweli colonies under the national programme to hand over 100,000 land deeds to the landless, the President stated that he would inspect the development work of Mahaweli farm lands separately. He said he would make observation visits to those areas from January next year.
Identifying the land issues pertaining to the areas belonging to the Mahaweli Authority as well as handing over land deeds to landless families were discussed in detail at a meeting at the Mahaweli Ministry chaired by President Sirisena. Attention was also drawn to expedite the development work of the Weli Oya area of Mahaweli Zone B and to begin the resettlement process of the farming community in the Mahaweli Zone D at the Bisopura new development zone in Medirigiriya.
The President pointed out that the officials should be more committed to achieve their targets while executing their duties efficiently and skilfully in the fields of Mahaweli, environment and forest conservation.
The Agriculture Development Ministry with the collaboration of several other ministries has arranged to donate over one hundred thousand plots of lands to the landless people living in the Mahaweli zones.
Plantation Industry Ministry, Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Ministry and Agriculture Irrigation, Mahaweli and Rajarata Development Ministry are the other Ministries to work with the Agriculture Development Ministry and lands have been arranged for residence and plantation purposes.

The President advised relevant officials to provide speedy solutions to the matters relating to the schools in the area. He inquired about the progress of the programmes implemented to develop the facilities in the area.
This is the first time such a large number of title deeds are to be awarded, providing a lasting solution to a prolonged issue faced by Mahaweli settlers. earlier, 5,000 title deeds were presented to settlers in the Walawe zone at the Embilipitiya Gam Udawa Grounds, and another batch of 5,000 title deeds were presented to the farming community in the Mahaweli H zone today at the Talawa Pradeshiya Sabha Grounds.

Previous govts skipped funding for waste management: Minister Ranawaka
The garbage problem which reached a bursting point because past governments which gave priority to building expressways and reservoirs, failed to provide funds for waste management, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was speaking at a ceremony held at the Karadiyana waste yard to mark the launching of construction work on the third phase in a series of projects to generate electricity from waste yesterday. President Maithripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest.
The project to producing 10 megawatts of electricity daily from 500 metric tons of waste, would be supervised by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
Ranawaka said he fist received complaints about the dumping of waste at the Karadiyana environment system in 2007 when he was the Environment Minister. Environmental organisations said damage was being done to the environment due to the dumping of waste. When he visited the spot on an inspection tour, he realised that this happened due to the lack of a proper site for the dumping of waste. But instead of taking legal action, they decided to formulate a systematic programme for waste management. The result was the Pilisaru project. Sine government funds were not available for the project, he suggested that money should be found by imposing a tax on plastics.
Nearly 70 out of 338 Local Councils launched the Pilisaru project in their areas of authority within two years. About 130 Councils are implementing the project, the minister said.
The Karadiyana project was awarded to Fairway Private Ltd. after calling for tenders through competitive bidding.
Minister Ranawaka said the Meetotamulla garbage mountain would be developed as an urban park within the next three years.
He said the area covered by the Bloemendhal waste dump would be developed in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Customs Department. A waste park was being developed in Kerawalapitiya by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said he had also been empowered to build the Port City project, which is the largest private sector investment project. Although environmentalists, the fishing community and social activists had cried to halt the project, it had been undertaken as an accelerated project by incorporating their views, ideas and suggestions after discussions, he said. They will sell the Carbonic fertiliser produced from waste by the end of this month, he said.
A special App had been created by the ministry through Dialog. Anyone can take pictures of unattended garbage heaps and send them to the ministry through the App, so that they could be referred to officials for action, the minister said.

School talent steals limelight at 2017 Chess Nationals:
School talent stole the limelight in the Sri Lanka National Chess Championships concluded at the Royal College Skills Centre, Colombo yesterday with 17-year Royalist, FIDE Master (FM) Minul Sanjula Doluweera and grade-10 student from Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda, Women's Candidate Master (WCM) Sayuni Gihansa Jayaweera being crowned mens and women's national chess champions respectively.
The apex national chess tournament was conducted by the Chess Federation of Sri Lanka where the best 14 male and female contestants battled it out for supremacy in 13 rounds at the finals from August 10 to 17.
Minul gained 9.5 pts to claim the top spot in national rankings while Candidate Master (CM) Udith Jayasundera of Colombo University was placed second with 8.0 pts.
In fact Minul secured the title before the last round even began after he drew with A.A.C.B. Amarasinghe in the penultimate round, thereby securing an unassailable lead over Jayasundera.
Sasith Nipun Piyumantha (FM) of Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda secured third slot with 7.5 pts.
Four players ended on 7.5 points: Sasith Nipun (Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda), Prasanna Kurukulasuriya, G.M.H. Thilakaratne and Isuru Alahakoon. Sasith Nipun was declared second runner up on the tie-break.
In the women's championship, top ranked 15-year-old Sayuni collected 10.0 pts to win her first national title. Former national champion Dasuni Hansika Mendis (WCM) of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo also finished with 10.0 pts but Sayuni was declared the winner since she had defeated Mendis in their individual encounter in the seventh round.
Mendis, who won the title in 2014 and 2015, and ended runner up last year, was half a point ahead of Sayuni at the end of the penultimate round, but was held to a draw by another former national champ Sachini Ranasinghe in the final round. Sayuni who had to win her last game did so, against Chamindra de Silva. Another Visakhian, Pasindi Yathra Wijesuriya obtaining 9.0 pts secured third place.
A significant change look place at this year's chess nationals as school chess players performed exceptionally well overcoming their elderly and much experienced counterparts at the final stage. School dominance was more prominent at the women's championship as seven school players were included in the top 10 rankings, including first, second, third and fourth places. Four schoolboys were placed among the top ten of the Open Nationals, including first and third places. This is a good omen for Sri Lankan chess as youngsters are taking up the sport seriously at national level.

SME optimistic over tax cut on small trucks
The SME sector and the mini truck dealers welcomed the move by the government to slash the Ad-valorem excise duty valuation method on motorcycles, mini trucks and single cabs.
The duty on mini trucks and single cabs is expected to reducedby Rs 300,000 with effect from midnight yesterday.
Nimal Welgama Chairman Ideal Motors said that this was a very welcome move and would be a major boost to the SME sector that spends a lot of money for point to point transport to third parties. The SME sector was struggling due to high transport cost and now they can think of owning a vehicle of their own, he said.
As an importer we are now able to pass on this benefit to the customers and we are happy that the new Finance Minister did such a commendable move. This is a very humanitarian deed and most is commendable.
Motor Industry welcomes the reduction of duty on small vehicles, however import levies of Rs 700,000 per vehicle is still very high. As these small vehicles are mainly purchased by self employed individuals having very limited income and they cannot afford the higher initial payment and monthly installment payments, said CEO, Lanka Ashok Layland, Umesh Gautham.
Similarly few months back the sudden decision of the Ministry of Finance to impose 50% excise duty on the import of chassis without cabin and body for building cabin and bodies locally has killed the entire local industry. Similarly, the excise duty on fully built trucks were reduced to 40%. This decision has made hundreds of local body builders and assemblers jobless. To provide continued employment of local youth we strongly feel that duty on fully built truck should be higher than the truck chassis imported for local assembly and local cabin and body building, he said.
Meanwhile Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the 90% tax which is imposed based on the value of motorcycles will be removed. However sources from the automobile industry when contacted over the tax reduction on motorbikes said that they could not fathom the fact that the government will reduced the duty by 90 % when the motor cycle market was in its peak.
He said the entire motorcycle market were 30,000 and questioned as to what was the reason for reducing the duty and that there was a possibility that the duty reduction story could be a misinterpretation by the media.
The source said that currently the duty on motor bikes less than 150cc was 90% or unit rate on cc value which ever was higher.
Some people assume that the government has done away with the 90% method and the entire tax will be calculated based on the unit rate method.
He however said that they felt that there was a distortion of information and added that there were different schools of thought as to how this was going to be calculated but no one was quite aware of the actual scenario at this point of time.

Sri Lanka transition grinds to halt at India roadblock
Two years have passed since Sri Lanka bid farewell to the last of their batting greats yet the South Asian side appears no nearer to ending what has been a difficult period of transition.
When the brilliant Kumar Sangakkara followed the equally prolific Mahela Jayawardene into retirement in 2015, even the most optimistic Sri Lankan fans acknowledged the void they left was simply too big to be filled overnight.
What they probably did not anticipate was that two years down the line, the team would still be hopelessly in the throes of a seemingly interminable era of regeneration.
Once admired, even envied, for their steady supply of freak bowlers with bizarre actions and a near-invincible record at home, Sri Lanka's recent humiliating 3-0 whitewash at the hands of India made for a particularly painful watch.
Only Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne offered fleeting glimpses of batting prowess but Sri Lanka were otherwise completely outclassed by the tourists in one of the most lop-sided series of recent times.
"Since I've been in this team, this is the worst series loss I've experienced," test skipper Dinesh Chandimal said after his team lost three matches in 11 days against their neighbours.
The debacle followed their first ever one-day series loss to Zimbabwe in July, which prompted a frustrated Angelo Mathews to relinquish the captaincy of both the test and one-day sides.
Mathews appeared to have sparked a revival last year when they whitewashed Australia but the 3-0 home win proved little more than a false dawn.
Sri Lanka were subsequently thrashed in both tests and one-dayers in South Africa, lost a home test against Bangladesh and then failed to progress beyond the group stage at this year's Champions Trophy.
The India whitewash has led the country's sports ministry to call for a report from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to explain why the side performed so poorly, while former captain Aravinda de Silva believes the board lacks vision.
"We are going through a rebuilding process but you can't be saying that forever," de Silva, hero of Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup triumph, told the Hindu newspaper last week.
"Short-term process is good for a few months, one or two series, but not for the future.
"So we need to seriously look at the team in the long-term and not keep chopping and changing," said de Silva, who quit as head of the board's cricket committee in May.
His former team mate and chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya pointed to a string of injuries as one reason for the side's struggles and dismissed allegations of leading a trigger-happy panel.
"Why should we change a squad of players if they are performing well and are injury free" he told reporters. "Do you know how many players have been injured in the last 14 months"
Asela Gunaratne missed a majority of the series after fracturing his hand on the first day of the opening test and paceman Nuwan Pradeep was sidelined after picking up a hamstring injury in the second test.
Rangana Herath, who has helped Sri Lanka overcome the loss of retired spin great Muttiah Muralitharan, missed the final test with a stiff back.
Sri Lanka were twice subjected to being made to follow-on and a lack of balance was evident as they failed to stretch any of the three tests to a full five days.
Jayasuriya sought to explain the lack of competitiveness.
"For instance, Mathews is not bowling after his hamstring injury," the former captain said of the all-rounder.
"He used to bowl at least 15 overs in a test innings earlier but now plays purely as a batsman. So it's very difficult to get the right balance when your key all-rounder is not bowling."- Agencies

Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that the survey was conducted on the responsiveness of health services of countries in the world. Soon the Sri Lankan health service will be transmitted to an interactive one, especially for the benefit of adolescents.
About 40 percent of the worlds selfie deaths take place in India. The number of selfie deaths had increased in Sri Lanka too. The issues, incidents etc have not changed in the world for many decades. What has changed is the angle we look at them.
Family Health Bureau Director Dr. Priyani Senadheera said 16 percent of the total population of Sri Lanka is in the adolescence stage (15 to 24) and this age group is neither children nor adults. therefore, they behave differently during this transit period.

STAX reveals interesting insights about future of SL family-owned businesses
STAX, Sri Lankas leading strategy consulting firm organised a panel discussion titled Taking over the Mantle, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID).
This pioneering event was held to highlight the hurdles that family businesses face around continuity and persevering to the next generation.
The panel comprised three renowned business magnates encompassing three generations; Laugfs Holdings Chairman W.K.H. Wegapitiya, Jetwing Travels (Pvt.) Ltd Managing Director Shiromal Cooray and SAIG & Orion Director and CEO Jeevan Gnanam. During the panel, the tycoons shared their perspectives and experiences in taking on the challenge of continuity. Prior to the discussion STAX carried out an extensive survey to determine the current state of affairs at Sri Lankan family businesses. STAXs focus is on serving companies as a strategic partner for growththe spotlight on family businesses in particular is motivated by the unique potential of these firms.
As I see it, Sri Lankan family firms stand on the cusp of a phenomenal opportunity as the region expands. Most of these firms are now managed by 2nd and 3rd generation family members who have an unprecedented advantage in terms of global education and exposure. However, there is a short window to capitalize on the opportunities that dot the horizon; from overseas expansion to product diversification, commented Ruwindhu Peiris Manager, Director of STAX.
STAX surveyed a select group of 31 family business leaders70% of those firms have been in existence for over 30 years. The survey was structured to explore 4 key themesStrategic Thinking, Succession Planning, Professionalization, and Innovationthat leaders need to consider for the longevity for their businesses.
Armed with these interesting insights, the discussion was underway with Cooray stating that having a clear vision played a key role in the continuity of their business along with retaining family unity. Positively, the survey revealed that a combined 77% of family businesses either have a well-defined vision or are on the process of developing one. On the flipside, only 58% of companies have their vision in writing  the rest rely upon a verbal agreement.
A failure to articulate the vision of the business in writing can be especially problematic as a company transitions from the 1st Generation to the 2nd because the underlying goals are no longer as clear as they once were.
A failure to embark on timely succession planning is one of the main reasons cited for family business discontinuity. The first generation businessman, Wegapitiya, shared statistical evidence emerging from a Harvard Business professional who had theorized that businesses boom and burst in a predictable wave period of standard length.
Therefore, understanding this wave and initiating succession planning at the right time is imperative. According to the survey, the majority (68%) of the family businesses in Sri Lanka reported that they had a succession plan that satisfied their aspirations.
However, some leaders are yet to develop a sense of clarity and comfort regarding the extent to which the next-generation will contribute towards the business. During the panel, a key discussion point was the hesitance of next generation family members to pick up the baton.
The survey also corroborated this point65% of incumbent leaders surveyed reported being unsure if the next generation would join the business. Commenting on this insight, Shiromal Cooray informed that there was never any compulsion to join their company, despite a general drive and urge. Similarly, our children are not forced but there is a tendency that they will join as they are educated in the respective fields. The act of professionalizing involves achieving a separation between family ownership and business management. While family businesses can be slow to embark on this process, the majority of the firms (94%) surveyed are willing to bring in external expertise; with the key reason being a perceived need for greater diversity and maturity among leadership teams.
Gnanam, who is part of the third generation, added that it is important to harness each persons unique skills towards the benefit and growth of the companyfamily or notas it can be an advantage.
Another significant aspect of continuing a family-owned business is innovation and diversification into hitherto unexplored realms of business in order to ensure long term sustainability. According to the survey, 87% of Sri Lankas family businesses have considered diversification. In general, the panelists agreed with the idea of diversification in order to avoid conflict but noted that most preferably it should be done in alignment with the core competencies of the main business.
Ultimately, the thrust of STAXs message at Taking over the Mantle was clearfamily businesses are strong contributors to the Sri Lankan economy and enjoy a wealth of growth prospects. However, in order to truly capitalize on these avenues before the window of opportunity closes, firms need to pay heed to key areas like strategic thinking, succession planning, professionalization and innovation.

A Strange, Sweet, Odyssey
Remembering some of the most cherished moments of world history when wedding bells tolled and two people united in love in magical surroundings
As the sun dipped low over the hills on the picturesque island of Spetes, a Prince of Greece, promised to love and honour a shy Venezuelan girl who was working as an events planner in London, in a wedding ceremony described as Mamma Mia, with aristocrats (the bride having asked an assortment of English nobles and Scandinavian princes to trade their formal finery for caftans and sandals).
A cheer went up from the crowd when Prince Nikolaos, 40, the third of King Constantine and Queen Anne-Maries five children, for years one of Europes most eligible bachelors, arrived at the whitewashed monastery of Ayios accompanied by his mother, on the day he was to wed Tatiana Blatnik.
Among the dazzling array of distinguished guests who watched the arrival of the groom were Princess Mary representing the Danish royal family, along with her mother-in-law, Queen Margrethe, who is Anne-Maries sister  making her the grooms aunt - Queen Sofia of Spain, Swedens Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Princes Daniel.
The bride, however, was the one everyone wanted to see. Possessing all the charms of the prototypical princess: flaxen hair, perfect teeth, arresting green eyes, enviable posture she proved an expert in wearing a tiara and sash.
Born in Caracas to parents of Slovenian and German origin, Tatiana went to boarding school in Switzerland and studied sociology at Georgetown. Before being swept up into the Greek royal family she worked for Diane von Furstenberg and lived a posh yet discreet life in Londons Chelsea neighborhood.
Prince Nikolaos, who had worked in television and banking but now spends his days as a landscape photographer, first came to Greece at age 11, when the government permitted the royal family to return for just eight hours to bury Nikolaoss grandmother Queen Frederika, who had died in Spain after complications from surgery. Nikolaos brought Tatiana to Greece for the first time in 2004, around the Olympics, and she recalls the deep impact the journey had on both of them.
Coming here was really emotional, overwhelmingly so, because Nikolaos was so attached to the idea of Greece and couldnt get enough of it, she says. One night, I was exhausted and wanted to go to bed but he pleaded with me, No, please, I must watch every sunset and every sunrise. Ive been longing for this my whole life. 
On her wedding day, sweeping up to the monastery in the horse-drawn carriage that is customary on the island, Tatiana looked breathtaking in an ivory Angel Sanchez gown with a chantilly lace overlay, teamed with a matching bolero and full-length veil. Completing the regal yet feminine look was a pair of diamond drop earrings and the antique corsage tiara, lent by her new mother-in-law. Since her own father sadly passed away when she was small, the 29-year-old was escorted up the aisle by her stepfather Attilio Brillembourg.
Once inside the monastery the elegant blond received a wedding band to complement a stunning engagement ring, topped with a sapphire that was given to Nikolaos by his mother, who received it from her own parents, King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark. Having arrived Ms Tatiana Blatnik, she left HRH Princess Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark.
Described as Blatniks Jet Set courtship by one magazine, Tatiana had met her future husband, who was a friend of her brothers, in a nightclub in Switzerland. It was like something out of a movie, she said later. He pursued me for over a year.
But, no doubt she was in love with him too. The applause that rang out from the crowd when she received a passionate kiss from her groom on her wedding day, was obviously prompted by the sight of a couple deeply in love.

Tamil Nadu pushes for ferry service with Sri Lanka
CHENNAI: Six years after the ferry service between Tuticorin and Colombo was suspended, Tamil Nadu is making fresh efforts to re-establish sea links with Sri Lanka. The State Government recently wrote to the Ministry of External affairs (MEA) to facilitate voluntary repatriation of Sri Lankan refugees and to take steps to resume the ferry service between both countries, say sources. A meeting was initially scheduled to be held between officials in the MEA, Directorate General of Shipping and bureaucrats from Tamil Nadu in February. "But this was cancelled because of the political turmoil. Now a letter and a report have been submitted to the Centre to Aid Structured Resettlement of Refugees who want to return," said a senior official. He, however, said the State would have to discuss with the Centre before plotting the route - the circuitous commercial course connecting Tuticorin to Colombo or the shorter line linking Rameswaram to Talaimannar in Sri Lanka's North, where most refugees hail from.
Officials say although the number of refugees who returned to Sri Lanka had doubled in 2016, many remained in camps here, reluctant to leave behind belongings. "A large number want to take the ferry along with their belongings as they are unsure what awaits them back home," said P Umanath, Commissioner of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non Resident Tamils.
Nearly three decades of unrest forced more than two lakhs ethnic Tamils to flee across the Palk Strait into Tamil Nadu. Eight years after the war ended and a new government in 2015 broke the culture of surveillance and censorship, refugees here are keen to get back. As of June, 62,629 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees were in 107 camps in 24 districts and 36,794 Sri Lankan Tamils stayed outside.
The British began the first ferry service between Dhanushkodi, the Southeastern tip of Pamban island and Talaimannar in 1914. Suresh Amirapu, whose father Amirapu Ramarao was Marine Superintendent there in the 1950s, said the route was patronised by both Indian and Lankan traders and tourists. "A train called 'Boat Mail' used to bring passengers to Dhanushkodi from where they were ferried to Talaimannar four times a week," said Suresh, who now runs a shipping company in Mumbai. After a cyclone wrecked the Dhanushkodi Port in 1964, the service shifted to Rameswaram.
The ferry service between Rameswaram and Talaimannar continued till 1983, after which it was suspended in the wake of the war between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government. However, illegal ferries continued to operate for refugees fleeing the war. LTTE cadres also used the ferries to smuggle essential commodities from Tamil Nadu.
In 2011, India allowed a private luxury vessel, with a capacity to carry 1,044 passengers and 300 tonnes of cargo, to operate between Tuticorin and Colombo - a journey of 10 to 12 hours. However, it was stopped as it could not attract passengers despite the fare being at least Rs 4,000 cheaper than air fare. "Around 12,000 people were ferried in five months, but it wasn't economically viable.

UNP says No Confidence in Wijeyadasa
The Working Committee of the United National Party and its Parliamentary Group yesterday unanimously adopted a resolution stating that they do not have confidence in the conduct of Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
The resolution submitted by Parliamentarian Ashu Marasinghe and seconded by Parliamentarian Sydney Jayarathne comprised 5 points.
During deliberations which lasted for close to two hours at Sirikotha yesterday, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is reported to have said that he did not make the statement to the effect that  I will not look back without taking control of the Hambanthota port.
Following the presenting of the resolution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had asked those present if any member present opposed it. No member had opposed the resolution. The resolution containing five points said that, Minister Rajapakshe had failed in his duties as the Justice Minister, the Minister had failed to bring in new laws to tackle bribery and corruption as promised by the United National Fronts manifesto, that the Minister had failed to bring in laws which provide for criminally earned moneys to be given back to the agencies, that the Minister is being blamed for the prolonged delay in the hearing of criminal cases, and that the Minister conduct had brought the government and the United National Party into disrepute.
Minister Rajapakshe who was present during the deliberations had said that he had not made the purported statement to the newspaper. He was given time until August 21st to clarify his statement. Rajapaksa was asked to obtain the advice of Ministers Malik Samarawickrema, Mangala Samaraweera and Ravindra Samaraweera in this regard.

US prepares for Black Moon

US: A so-called Black Moon will plunge the United States into darkness on Monday, August 21, when a total solar eclipse completely blocks out the light from the sun.
The eclipse will be visible from coast-to-coast in the US - the first of its kind in 99 years.
The breathtaking event will last two minutes and 40 seconds for those watching from the path of totality, getting gradually shorter the further away from the centre you stand. It brings people to tears, Rick Fienberg, of the American Astronomical Society, told Space.com. It makes people's jaw drop.
There is no accepted definition of a Black Moon, but the term has come to describe a number of astronomical phenomenons associated with the New Moon.
This is the part of the lunar cycle where none of the Moons surface is visible from Earth. Black Moon is not a term used by the astronomical community, but it has become popular on social media and is used regularly by astrologists and followers of the some Pagan religions.
Next weeks total eclipse in the US falls into this category of Black Moon.
It occurs when there are four New Moons in a season, rather than the usual three. These moons rise once every 33 months.
The last one rose on February 18, 2015 and the next will be on May 22, 2020.
The most common use of the term is when there are two New Moons in a single calendar month.
Occurring once every 29 months or so, this type of Black Moon is the exact opposite of a Blue Moon, which is where there are two Full Moons in a month.
The next one will rise on August 30, 2019.

Worlds shortest body builder
Vince Brasco, from Geensburg Pennsylvania, at 25, has become an Instagram sensation as one of the shortest body builders in the world, standing at just 41.
His Instagram handle has more than 35,000 followers and he goes by the name of Mini Hulk. Vince suffers from a condition called acondroplasia, where the arms and legs are shorter than the average person but the torso is the same size. It is the most common form of dwarfism.
Speaking to Strength Addicts the Instagram sensation said that he started competing with dwarfism because he had seen a lot of people having health problems and he did not want to be like that.
According to Brasco, he wanted to be a role model for others with dwarfism, and wanted to show them that there are no limitations in the pursuit of dreams. Brasco was able to lose a significant amount of body fat after weeks of professional coaching, going on to build his strength gradually.
His role models are body builders Phil Heath, Jay Cutler and Kai Greene. Brasco can bench press more than three times his own weight.
However, while Brasco has successfully competed in a string of bodybuilding competitions, he confesses that he still encounters prejudice due to his size. Brasco  who has had 15 major surgeries to combat health problems associated with his dwarfism  now trains almost every day with a private coach.
In addition to being a bodybuilder, he is also the words shortest fire fighter and volunteers at his local fire station for the last four years. ANI

WRITE to your hearts content
The Daily News recently attended the book launch of WRITE a magazine dedicated as a platform for published and budding writers aged 16 years and above to publish their work. It also intends on making an impact on the literary scene in Sri Lanka.
WRITE is a brand new initiative which is the brainchild of Chairperson of WRITE magazine Shehara Willie. The objective is to promote a magazine which will further enrich the field of creative writing in Sri Lanka. It all started in October last year right after a workshop of creative writing Willie attended. Subsequently she came up with this grand idea called WRITE Magazine.
Willie and her friends did a lot of brainstorming. They first listed down why they wanted to begin this venture.
One was to appreciate Literature as a path for expression, empathy and enlightenment. The other reason was to inculcate a love for writing and the performing arts. And as an island wide publication, to create a network of diverse individuals, collecting a variety of their experiences.
We want to make it a bridge between differences and a path of diversity and reconciliation. Our primary concern is to Express, Empathize and Enlighten through our stories, said Willie.
These young people were delighted to mention that there have been submissions from Johannesburg and Chennai. They hope these will be a sign of the magazine serving as a global network. They have now set up their Facebook page and the email to contact the general public requesting for articles. The idea is also to reach out to schools, Universities and Bookshops in all corners of the country to call out for writers.
The categories of creative writing are poetry, short stories, monologues and One Act plays.
Key Note Speaker Dr. Vivimarie Vanderpoorten, published award winning poet and senior lecturer at the Open University Sri Lanka emphasized on the power or reading.
She showed her pleasure at the launch of WRITE and believes it will inspire young people to read and write. She pointed out the American Essayist Arthur Krystal spoke of a new definition of literature. He quotes from A New Literary History of America, where the author points out that literary means not only what is written but what is voiced, expressed and invented in whatever form. This covers sermons, cartoons, features, photographs, movies and war memorials.
So if you accept this definition of literature, then books of course will matter to us. But perhaps not in the way they did matter earlier. Do we agree with this definition of the New Literary History of America, questioned Vanderpoorten.
Bob Dylan in 2016 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He describes himself as a song and dance man. He was nominated for the prize every year since 1996. In Literature, say Vanderpoorten we cannot avoid the use of the word Canon. One definition of this word is that it is an authoritative list as of the works of an author and basis for judgment, standard and criteria.
Cannon is also defined as the books of the bible officially recognized by the church. So the idea of a literary canon also implies some sort of official status. To enter the cannon is to gain certain privileges.
The Gate keepers of the fortress of high culture include influential critics, scholars and teachers. Anthologies such as poetry, Anthologies compiled by already famous writers also function as sort of Canon. So as Arthur Krystal goes on to say, there is a notion today that Great books arise because of great writers who are driven to write exactly what they want to write. Now Canon formation as Vanderpoorten points out is a result of the middle classes desire to see its own values reflected in art. So as she points out, Canon is tied to the advance of literacy, surging book trade, spread of coffee shops and clubs, rise of reviews and magazines and the creation of private circulating libraries.
Going back to my initial point of diversification of literature, we can see that the internet provides a huge platform for people to showcase their work. This way budding writers can make a name for themselves without the intervention of the economics of the book trade. However to be published in print is seen as prestigious, stated Vanderpoorten.
Of course the ability to share work online and in cyber space is one major cause of the popularization of poetry. Poetry is considered a high art form and almost sacred. Poetry is certainly making a comeback, however at University we see that students get very nervous when you say poetry! Poetry online and in cyber space is one major cause of the popularization of poetry. These students however sometimes think that there is some element of abstract unattainable meaning in poetry.
But I notice so many young people are writing poetry now, actually the world over. Recent trends around the world have succeeded in bringing poetry back to the masses and popularizing it as a genre. Spoken work poetry and performance poetry are immensely popular in social media. Now writing literature is getting popular amongst young people which is a great thing, pointed out Vanderpoorten.
I had the opportunity of getting my hands on this WRITE magazine and I am impressed with its beauty. It is edited by Vinusha Paulraj and Oshanthaka Cabraal. Being a Harry Potter fan myself I saw a beautifully written article on Harry Potter! There was also an article on the Taming of the Shrew which also caught my attention. Poetry has been given its due place with a tribute to Anne Ranasinghe.
There was also an article on an interview with Professor Rajiva Wijesinha which promises to be very fascinating. All over the magazine are poems and prose. In other words it has lived up to its reputation. All the hype is justified.
