Sri Lankas Maharoof hopes for perfect game
Cardiff, Friday: Sri Lanka all-rounder Farveez Maharoof says the tourists need to play the perfect game if they are to defeat England in the fifth and final one-day international in Cardiff on Saturday.
Maharoofs team have yet to win a match in England this tour, with two drawn warm-up games preceding a 2-0 loss in a three-Test series that ended in a rain-affected draw at Lords.
Sri Lanka did win their two one-dayers in Ireland but they now find themselves 2-0 down with one to play in a five-match ODI campaign against England.
Although they cannot win the series, victory in Cardiff would see Sri Lanka improve International Cricket Council ODI rankings and give them a morale boost ahead of Tuesdays lone Twenty20 in Southampton -- their final match of this tour.
And a one-day win in the Welsh capital would be timely given Sri Lanka will return to Cardiff during next years Champions Trophy -- a tournament for the worlds top eight ODI teams.
Its been a tough tour, losing the Test series as well as the one-dayers, but we just have to go again, said Maharoof in Cardiff on Friday. Its one more game and up to us to showcase our talent and willingness to win. The boys are up for it, and we hope we can give it a good show.
He added: We just have to play a perfect game and get back the momentum which has been lacking.
There are a lot of fans behind us and we have to win for them.
England chased down a revised Duckworth/Lewis target of 308 in 42 overs with 11 balls to spare to win Wednesdays fourth ODI at The Oval after opener Jason Roy made 162 on his Surrey home ground.
Maharoof said that while England had batted well, Sri Lankas attack should have been able to defend a total of 305 for five. The batsmen have done a decent job up to now, Maharoof said. It was a good score in the last game -- its just as a bowling unit we couldnt hit our straps.
Take nothing away from the England line-up, they have been batting middle order.
Roys hundred was his second of the series after his 112 not out, together with fellow opener Alex Haless 133 not out, saw England to a 10-wicket win in the second ODI at Edgbaston last week after the pair shared a national record partnership stand of 256.
Sri Lanka chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya -- admittedly before injuries deprived the tourists of Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera, ahead of fellow paceman Shaminda Erangas suspension for an illegal action -- had said the islanders were the top best bowling side in the world.
However, Sri Lanka have looked some way short of that standard against England and Maharoof said: Its been tough work.
The guys are putting in a lot of hard work, and Im sure it will pay off one day.AFP

Alive again Del Potro lights up gloomy Wimbledon
London,Friday: Juan Martin del Potro admitted he felt alive again after the injury-plagued former US Open champion sent Swiss fourth seed Stan Wawrinka crashing out of Wimbledon on Friday.
On a day when rain caused a four-hour delay on the outside courts, forcing organisers to consider playing on the middle Sunday for the first time since 2004, the giant Del Potro shone beneath the Centre Court roof.
His 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 second round victory over Wawrinka brought back memories of his stunning US Open win in 2009 before a series of wrist injuries pushed him to the brink of retirement.
The world number 165 from Argentina, who was a semi-finalist in 2013 in what was his last appearance at Wimbledon, next faces either French 32nd seed Lucas Pouille or Donald Young of the United States.
Del Potro is playing in his first major since the Australian Open in 2014 after undergoing three wrist surgeries.
It feels amazing, it's a great sensation, said the 27-year-old.
I enjoyed the crowd. It's an incredible feeling, that's why my hands are still shaking.
I feel alive again. After sitting at home for two years, this feels like asecond or third career, added the former world number four.
Wawrinka, a quarter-finalist in 2014 and 2015, fired 47 winners past Del Potro but was undone by 48 unforced errors.
Meanwhile, Wimbledon suffered a third day of rain delays.
Only one minute of action was possible on the outside courts in the first four hours while most players didn't get beyond warming up.
The tournament already had a backlog of 16 second round ties and with more rain expected Saturday, organisers admitted that play may take place on Sunday for the first time since 2004 and only the third time overall.
Sunday play is being considered but a decision won't be made until tomorrow, a spokesman told AFP.
All men's second round doubles matches were reduced to best of three sets rather than five.
Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer can take a step closer to a Wimbledon semi-final duel when they battle for places in the last-16 later Friday. AFP

TNA welcomes oral update of UN High Commissioner
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), welcomes the oral update of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Human Rights Council at its 32nd Session on the implementation of resolution 30/1. The oral update in our view, captures accurately the opportunities and challenges for reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. We are grateful to the High Commissioner and his Office for their continued engagement in this matter.
We are however concerned about the very slow pace of implementation with respect to a number of human rights issues in Sri Lanka. In particular, delays in releasing private land illegally occupied by the Military; the continued use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the governments failure to repeal it, the breach of undertakings to release those held under the PTA and the continuing surveillance and harassment of civilians in the North and East. Delay in the resettlement of displaced people in both the North and East and in the restoration of normal life by providing then with housing, livelihood opportunities and other facilities, continues to be a matter of concern and is a great impediment to the process of reconciliation and the return to normalcy.
With respect to the reconciliation mechanisms proposed by the government, we welcome the tabling of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Bill in Parliament. The government consulted us on the Bill and we are pleased that several of the extensive revisions we urged, have been included in the Gazetted. We commend the government for its constructive engagement on the Bill. We look forward to further amendments being moved at the committee stage and to the early passage of the law through Parliament. A law on the lines contemplated by the Bill, if implemented sincerely, could bring relief to families of the forcibly disappeared who are in desperate need of answers. The OMP must represent a dramatic break from the experience of failed Commissions, including the current Paranagama Commission, which lacked credibility. We reiterate that justice for crimes committed in the past by both sides, is a necessary precondition to meaningful reconciliation. In this regard, we reiterate the importance of the full implementation of operative Paragraphs 6 and 7 to ensure trust and credibility.

No proper administration today - MR
People have now realized the true form of the so-called Good Governance Government they elected with open arms. The issue regarding the appointment of the Central Bank Governor itself has created a grave crisis within the government, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Bentota on July 01.
He said more crises have erupted in the government due to lack of unity and mutual understanding among members of the government who are acting according to their own whims and fancies.
Rajapaksa expressed these sentiments when confronted by the media, while he was engaged in his morning constitutional along the Bentota beach yesterday.
Asked for his comments on Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperumas statement expressing a desire to join him (Rajapaksa) if attempts to admit a group of children to a school in Matugama failed, Rajapaksa replied, Thats why I said this is the true form of Good Governance Government.
Rajapaksa said there is no proper administration in the country today.
No one knew who was governing the country. All local councils have been dissolved and education was in shambles. This was a strange system of governance people had never experienced.

Sri Lanka wins toss, elects to field in final ODI with England

Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bowl on a Cardiff pitch expected to assist seam bowlers.
England Captain Eoin Morgan said he would have opted to bowl first as well.
It is the first time in the series England will be asked to set a total.
Alex Hales has been omitted from England's XI with a "minor niggle" - he was forced to leave the field at The Oval with a back injury - and James Vince steps into the top order for the hosts.
Spin-bowling allrounder Moeen Ali is also displaced by a seam bowler in Chris Jordan, on account of the grassy surface which is likely to aid the quicks.
England already have the series sewn up 2-0.
Left arm seam bowler Chaminda Bandara will debut in place of all-rounder Farveez Maharoof for Sri Lanka.
That decision is likely to have been spurred by a desire to beef up the attack, after the England batsmen ran down 308 with 11 balls to spare on Wednesday.
Rain is expected to interrupt play, and had in fact begun to come down as the toss formalities were being completed.
The start of play was delayed by ten minutes but the weather is forecast to improve as the afternoon progresses.

England: 1 James Vince, 2 Jason Roy, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (Capt), 5 Jonny Bairstow, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Chris Jordan, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 David Willey, 10 Liam Plunkett, 11 Adil Rashid.

Yasindu Kavishani
displays her medals
Despite coming from a rural background Kavishani had the rare opportunity to pursue her talent as a swimmer by training at the FoG Bryan Adams Swimming Pool Complex which offers free of charge access and training to all children and youth catering to 50 villages in the Seenigama region.
The pool complex is named after the legendary Canadian singer who sponsored its construction during Foundation of Goodness re-development efforts following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami to rebuild the village of Seenigama after destruction, to be even better than before.
Kavishani who is attached to the Foundation of Goodness and all her fellow swimmers receive extensive training at the Sports academy both in and out of the pool including gym sessions, fitness training, nutritional advice and seminars on mental toughness.
In addition, the young swimmers also have the incredible advantage of receiving advice and direction from a number of outstanding sporting personalities who visit the Foundation of Goodness, most recently including American swimming sensation Missy Franklin who is a five-time gold medalist at the London Olympics and will be taking part once more in Rio in the coming months.
Missy Franklin visited the Foundation of Goodness as an ambassador for the Laureus Sports for Good Foundation (UK) who sponsor the FoG Sports Academy and spent time meeting our swimmers and training them herself.
The swimmers also had the opportunity to see the great Olympian go through her own training regimen at the pool which was an absolutely inspirational experience.
Village youth in the region are also most fortunate to be blessed with overseas volunteers training them as well frequently.
Janaka Lal the coach and former long distance swimmer from Ambalangoda has to be commended highly for being the driving force behind her success and training.
The Foundation of Goodness is delighted by Kavishanis success which showcases the brilliant talent hidden in rural Sri Lanka that only needs access to opportunities and resources in order to excel.
Established in 1999 as a charitable NGO the Foundation of Goodness has worked extensively following the 2004 tsunami that devastated the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans to develop a one of a kind holistic rural community development model which today delivers a wide range of programmes to over 30,000 beneficiaries from 100+ villagers in the South, North and East of Sri Lanka annually, free of charge.
The Foundation operates principally out of the MCC Center of Excellence, Seenigama in the South of Sri Lanka and has also worked extensively with villages in the post-war North and East of Sri Lanka since January 2011, reaching over 27,000 beneficiaries todate, with uninterrupted monthly visits.

Woods also said that up to ten persons will be allowed to own a share in each horse.
All horses auctioned will be screened before the sale to ensure they are in a sound state for racing by Dr Hasneyn Mirza. Prior to purchase he will inspect them again on the day of the sale along with the RTC resident veterinarian Dr Thangaraj.
The RTC Veterinary Hospital which is being built under the expert guidance of Dr Mirza will have complex machinery such as portable equine XRays and ultrasound scanning facilities, the likes of which are new to Sri Lanka.
The horse population of the race course and the pony population of Nuwara Eliya are expected to be registered at the RTC Veterinary hospital in the near future to ensure that they get into a routine health screening program to ensure the equine population in the area are in the best of health.
Starting at about Rs 1.5 million to Rs 2.0 million, excellent horses such as 4-year-old, Captain Haddock, trained by Trainer Manvendra Singh, and 4-year-old Stormont, trained by the champion trainer Suleiman Attollahi, are also expected to grace the ramp in Nuwara Eliya. Both bred at the Kuningal stud farm out of Admiral of the fleet, have won a stake in each and every race they have ever run in India. These two amazing horses are expected to perform extremely well in Sri Lanka as well.

Volvo Ocean Race reveals longest route
PARIS, WEDNESDAY: The next edition of the Volvo Ocean Race, the world's premier round-the-world sailing event, will start in Alicante, Spain late next year and be the longest distance in race history, organisers said on Wednesday.
The 13th ocean race, which will take eight months to complete instead of the previous nine, is reckoned to be the toughest professional challenge in yachting and this time will cover a daunting 45,000 nautical miles and visit 11 cities, said chief executive Mark Turner. The first leg will be from Alicante to Lisbon in October-November 2017, and then on to Cape Town, Guangzhou via Hong Kong, Auckland, Itajai in Brazil, Newport in the United States, Cardiff in Wales, Gothenburg, arriving finally in the Hague in June 2018.
We believe this route is one of the best ever... we are taking the sailors to some of the most remote corners of the planet, said Turner.
Above all, we are taking the fleet deep into the Southern Ocean: the Roaring 40s, Furious 50s and maybe Screaming 60s, he added, referring to latitude bands.
Crews need to survive on a diet of freeze-dried food and a maximum of four hours sleep a day.
Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing, skippered by Briton Ian Walker, won the 12th edition of the event in June 2015 after covering 38,739 nautical miles in just under nine months. AFP

Maria Sharapova isnt missed at Wimbledon
There is no pop-up sweet shop in Wimbledon Village bearing her name, no banner in the local department store and even talk of the All England Club revoking her lifetime membership.
The tennis goes on in SW19 but Maria Sharapovas absence as a result of her two-year doping ban hasnt exactly been keenly felt by her fellow pros.
Despite winning just six Grand Slam titles compared with Serena Williams 22, her celebrity and earning power on the womens tour was unrivalled and she regularly outstripped the American on the list of sports highest paid athletes.
But the poster girl of womens tennis was far from popular among her peers  and not, it seems, due to her immense earning power.
Shes a totally unlikeable person, was Slovakian Dominika Cibulkovas blunt assessment. I dont miss her on the tour. Arrogant, conceited and cold. When I sit beside her in the locker room, she wont even say hello, the 2014 Australian finalist added.
The unimpressed face pulled by the third seed here, Polands Agnieszka Radwanska, when asked if Sharapova was irreplacable was equally telling.
You should ask fans or the tournament [organisers] or someone, she replied after winning her first round match against Ukraines Kateryna Kozlova in straight sets, I think we have so many other good players, so many other women playing great tennis, so many other good matches, I think the womens is still going to be a great event.
Former coach Nick Bollettieri, however, insists Wimbledon is poorer without the presence of the statuesque former champion in the draw. Bollettieri, who first encountered Sharapova when she arrived at his Florida tennis academy from Siberia aged nine, thinks her star power will be missed.
Maria brought elegance and beauty, Bollettieri told Sportsmail. She dressed beautifully, she performed beautifully, she won this tournament at a very young age. But I think most of all she stood in with the tradition of elegance and respecting Wimbledon and all its given to the world. You know that when Maria played she would fight and no matter what the score was shed give it all.
The Russian was banned from tennis for two years last month after testing positive for meldonium. Unless she wins an appeal there is no possibility she will be allowed back to play at Wimbledon until 2018 and even then she may be left relying on wildcards.

## Title: Isipathana St. Peters should be a thriller

Isipathana St. Peters should be a thriller
The confrontation between Isipathana College and St. Peters College in their inter-school Milo Presidents Trophy knockout semi-final at the Royal Sports Complex at 4.30 pm today should turn out to be a closely fought out affair.
With both teams boasting of powerful packs and speedy sets of three quarters a terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected. Isipatana is enjoying a wonderful season having emerged as the unbeaten league champions in the Singer A Division inter-schools league winning all their matches. The Peterites came up with some superb performances in the latter part of the league tournament to finish in fifth position despite losing four matches.
Isipatana entered the semi-final with a walkover from D.S. Senanayake College in the quarterfinals due to them pulling out of the tournament in the very last minute. The Peterites stormed into the semi-finals with a smashing 37-31 win over St. Anthonys College Kandy in their quarterfinals.
Isipathana skipper Kushan Indunil has led the side admirably and has been a source of inspiration to his teammates with his fiery loose play and has been ably supported by that cracking flanker Devin Gunaratne, Sharuk Manabarana, Ekanayake, hooker Hasitha Mapitigama, Lahiru Wishvajith, Kaveesha Madushan, Adeesha Weeratunge, Sashmitha Fernando and the omnipresent number eight Wageesha Weerasinghe. Today they will be confronted by equally good forwards in Rahal Delpachithra, Ravin Yapa, Harin Biyanwila, Senura Premawardene, Narendra Perera, Angelo Mendis, Sajith Seram and the indefatigable open side flanker Shane Gurusinghe.
In Harith Bandara and Randy Silva the Pathanians have a superb halves combination with Bandaras daring breaks having the opponents defence in disarray. In Indunil and vice-captain Sumudhu Rankothge Isipathana have two hard running centres who are capable of tearing apart the Peters defence.
The biggest threat to the Peterites could be posed by those powerful runners on the wing in Chamod Fernando and Ranindu Padmasanka while full back Gayan Wickramaratne has the knack of joining the line to form the overlap.
St. Peters three quarters too have played a key role in their success this season.
The halves combination of vice-captain Avishka Heenpalle and Steven Sivaraj have hit it off smoothly.
Sivaraj has the ability to pick the tiniest of gaps while his long kicks to touch have given them territorial advantage. In captain Sandesh Jayawickrama as the inside centre and the two speedy wingers Ramesh Fernando and Luke Lakshan have time and again pierced the opponents defence with their deceptive runs while outside centre Theekshana Dasanayake is likely to test the Pathana defence to the hilt with his daring runs down the flank in addition to their attacking full back Diyath Fernando.
Isipatana will strive to break the one-year jinx having last won the Presidents Trophy in 2014 under Shenal Deelaka de Silva while the Peterites will aim to lay their hands on the trophy for the sixth time since the inception of the tourney in 1995 when they were the first winners.
They last won this trophy in 2010 under the leadership of Keith Gurusinghe who is incidentally the elder brother of present Peterite dashing flanker Shane Gurusinghe.
The teams:
Isipathana College (Probable XV):
Kaveesha Madushan, Hasitha Mapitigama, Sharook Manabarana, Lahiru Wishwajith, Adeesha Weeratunge, Sashmitha Fernando, Devin Gunaratne, Wageesha Weerasinghe, Harith Bandara and Randy Silva, Chamod Fernando, Kushan Indunil (captain), Sumudhu Rankothge, Ranindu Padmasanka, Gayan Wickramaratne Head Coach: Nilfer Ibrahim, Asst. Coach (Forwards): Terence Henry

Royal S. Thomasexpect a cliff-hanger
The Royal-Thomian semi-final clash in the Milo inter-school Division 1 Presidents trophy knockout rugby tournament is expected to be a cliff-hanger at the CR & FC grounds, Longden Place today at 4.30 pm.
S. Thomas has brought in young Hans Walpola to play in the pivotal position of fly half at the expense of Bumindra Dissanayaka who is expected to be on the bench and will most probably play in the second half if needed.
In the pack, seasoned campaigner Dhanuja Wijeratne will play as number eight alongside their cracking flankers Shaniv Ahangama and Cristian Dilleal in the third row. Tehan Perera and vice captain Malinda Deshapriya has been moved up to the front row to bind down with hooker and captain Pandula de Silva.
The forte of both teams has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal eight especially Ayesh Maduranga, Hamza Hassan, Azmir Fajudeen, Harith Lokugamage, Hisham Barrie, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Ashen Fernando, Maleesha Madumewan and captain Nikhila Gunadheera are expected to give a terrific display in the loose and secure ball position.
If they deliver and get their act together to proceed with the famous rolling maul then the Royalist will have a chance of pulling off this game.
However they face a huge challenge from the Thomian forwards spearheaded by their cracking number eight Wijeratne who will be ably supported by Tehan Perera, Pandula de Silva, vice-captain Deshapriya, Senanayake, Mack, Ahangama and Dilleal.
In the set scrums experienced Royal hooker Fajudeen should get the better of his vis-a-vis de Silva, while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Lokugamage together with Madumewan and Thomian line out jumpers Senanayake and Mack.
Royals new halves combination comprising Wijekumar and Calyanaratne are playing really well in the latter stages even though they are playing together for the first time this season. Everything will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Meantime the S. Thomas will hope that their highly talented scrum half cum play maker Shenal de Silva will pair off well with his new fly half Hans Walpola.
In all probability, Shenal de Silva should try to set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given opportunity, as they have two hard running wing three quarters in Praveen Ferdinando and Naveen Heenakankanamge who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank together with their experienced centres Ashwantha Herath and Sarith Nanayakkara. This is in addition to their speedy full back Gayan Wickramaratne who is there to join the line and form the overlap.
The teams:
Royal College (Probable XV):
Ayesh Maduranga, Azmir Fajudeen or Hisham Barrie, Mohamad Nabeel, Ashen Fernando, Harith Lokugamge, Maleesha Madumewan, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Nikila Gunadheera (captain), Ashok Wijekumar and Lennox Calyaneratne, , Nikil George, Thuleb Hassen, Janidu Dilshan, Shabith Feroz or Shaqir Nawfer , Ovin Askey, Head Coach: Sanath Martis, Asst. Coach: Dushanth Lewke
S. Thomas College (Probable XV):
Tehan Perera, Pandula de Silva (captain), Malinda Deshapriya, Hasith Senanayaka, Wayne Mack, Cristian Dilleal, Shaniv Ahangama, Dhanuja Wijeyratne, Shenal de Silva and Hans Walpola, Praveen Fernando, Ashwantha Herath, Sarith Nanayakkara, H.K.Naveen, Mayon Jayawardena

THE COACHES SAY
Nilfer Ibrahim (Isipathana College)
Since both teams are equally good its going to be a cracker of a match. This Peters side is a balanced one unlike in the past. We have lost to them in the 7s final year before and this has made us more determined. We have changed our game plan and patterns of play for this match. I dont underestimate them because they are a good side. We will go out there with confidence and win the semi-final.
Colin Denish(St Peters College)
Isipathana are the league champions and we are going into this match as the underdogs. We need to capitalize and grab all the opportunities that come our way if we are to win this semi-final. We have got our pattern of play and the momentum right in our last three games where we ended up victorious. We are going into this game with the same confidence and will do everything possible to pull off a win.
Sanath Martis (Royal College)
We have done our home work well by rectifying our previous short comings. Its going to be a cliff hanger, but we are trying our best to win and getting to the finals.
Tevita Tulagaese (S. Thomas College)
This match with Royal College should be a good one and the boys will go out there and play well while enjoying the game at the same time. We have a very good opportunity to win and lets see what will be the outcome.

What is Zika virus and what dangers does it pose
With the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro now just a matter of weeks away, athletes from all over the world are making their final preparations for the trip to Brazil.
But with the Zika virus casting a cloud hanging over the Games, several athletes have opted out with many more raising concerns and taking precautions.
So, just what is the Zika virus and what dangers does it pose
Sportsmail answers the key questions...
What is it Zika is a virus that has spread predominantly through Latin America and the Caribbean.
How is it spread
It is predominantly spread by mosquitoes but can also be sexually transmitted. Investigation is ongoing to determine if it could be spread by blood transfusion.
Does it cause you to be unwell
Those who have suffered Zika have said it caused severe flu-like symptoms and vomiting for between two and seven days.
What are the long-term dangers of catching Zika
The main danger is to pregnant women or women who intend to be pregnant in the months, or even years. It has been shown to cause microcephaly, an abnormal smallness of the head, in unborn children and also eye defects, hearing loss, and impaired growth.
Does it affect adults, too
In adults, there is evidence to suggest it can cause Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder that causes temporary paralysis and can result in permanent nerve damage and even death.
Have any athletes caught Zika in Rio so far
There have been 17,000 international athletes, volunteers and staff involved in test events in the Brazillian capital and so far none has contracted Zika. The Jamaican sprinter Kemar Bailey-Cole caught the Zika virus, but its thought he contracted it at home.
What are the International Olympic Committee doing to protect athletes
Mosquito nets will be provided over the beds in the athletes village and all the venues will be made as mosquito-proof as possible. They are also advising frequent use of mosquito repellent.
