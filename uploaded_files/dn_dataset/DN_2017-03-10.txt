No room for North, East merger:
Steering Committee on Constitutional reform process

The Steering Committee on the Constitutional reform process has come to a common consensus that a new Constitution will leave no room for a merger between the Northern and Eastern Provinces, said National Coexistence, Dialogue and National Languages Minister Mano Ganesan.
He said they expect to have a draft of the new Constitution ready by the middle of this year.
The Minister addressing a meeting of the Congress of Religions - a body constituting key religious leaders of all communities  said the TNA too had agreed to this stance despite holding an opposing view for many years.
At the meeting of the Steering Committee this week, we only agreed two things for a new Constitution: one is that there will be no merger and the other is that Buddhism will continue to hold the foremost place in the Constitution while giving all other religions their due place, said Ganesan speaking at the Mahabodhi Temple Trusts office in Maradana yesterday.
The Steering Committee had also received reports from the Chief Ministers of all Provincial Councils. According to the Minister, they had indicated that they were unanimously opposed to a new Constitution which would take away some of the current powers of the Councils.
Some religious leaders meanwhile, criticized the Minister for not having a proper mechanism to implement the reconciliation process. They pointed out that the Constitution reform process was taking too long. They also requested religious leaders not be sidelined but taken into the fold when designing a mechanism for reconciliation.
Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith meanwhile questioned the Minister as to why the government could not simply
fully implement the existing 13th Amendment under a proper regulatory framework as an immediate step rather than waiting for a new Constitution. Why not devolve powers which are already there he said.

The Minister explained that no government in power has successfully managed to implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and that it was better to not have new problems at a time when they were doing their utmost to prepare a new Constitution.

JO members joined LTTE to protest against me in Australia: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said in parliament that a group of Joint Opposition members joined hands with LTTE cadres to stage a protest against him while he was in Australia when the Deakin University conferred him with a honorary degree. The Premier said the JO activists and LTTE extremists protested against him and they were together shouting at him using public addressing systems.
The Premier made these observations yesterday while responding to a question raised by joint opposition MP Padma Uadayashantha Gunasekera, who demanded to know as to what measures the government will take against those who spread racism through the internet.
The Premier also said that it was suspicious if these efforts to promote racism were done by those who staged the protest.
Together, against him in Australia.
Procedure fraudulent, incorrect: JVP Leader
The procedure taken to grant degree awarding status to SAITM was fraudulent and wrong, said Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Moving an adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday on issues pertaining to SAITM, the MP said the University Grants Commission (UGC) granted the degree awarding status to the SAITM on August 31, 2011 on certain conditions to be met .
He pointed out a post review on these conditions was due after February 28, 2012, but eight days prior to that, the power of granting degree awarding status was taken over by the Ministry Secretary from the UGC.
Observing that Dr Sunil Jayantha Navaratne was the Ministry Secretary who was holding office at that time, MP Dissanayake alleged that this move was a fraudulent act carried out with the connivance of the then Higher Education Minister S B Dissanayake.
MP Dissanayake further pointed out an expert committee comprised of 10 persons appointed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), unanimously decided that the SAITM could not be recognized and the report was handed over to Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne on September 4, 2015.
The MP also claimed that Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne deliberately delayed publishing this report in a Gazette allowing the matter to be taken up in court.
The MP further said SAITM had obtained BOI approval in 2008 by producing fake documents. He urged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to articulate their positions on SAITM issue and take steps to resolve it without allowing it to be further complicated. The MP further pointed out that the UGC had been unable to properly fill the student vacancies at State Universities, depriving university entrance to many students. In 2013/2014 intake, there had been 1,794 vacancies, in 2014/2015 intake there had been 1,455 vacancies and in 2015/2016 the intake had been 2,226 vacancies. The students are languishing at home for 19 long months after the A-L exam. In Colombo, Ruhuna and Sri Jayewardenapura Universities alone, there is a shortage of 310 staff lecturers. These must be addressed as soon as possible he said.
Security personnel of former President:
Matter should be referred to relevant committee, report to Parliament
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, stated that the matter concerning the security personnel of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa not provided with the relevant aptitude training should be referred to the relevant committee and a report should be summoned before Parliament.
He said that it could be found out whether they had not been directed to the training or had the security personnel had not participated in training.
The Premier made these observations yesterday, when joint opposition member Wimalaweera Dissanayake questioned as to why the monthly travelling allowance and special allowance of one third of the basic salary was not paid to the police officers who were deployed to provide security to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake said that the said allowance were initiated to be given to the police officers who were deployed to provide security to the President, Prime Minister, Ministers and former Presidents in 2002 by the UNP government. He added that the previous government confined the allowance only to the Presidents security. Again this, the government changed enabling security officers of the Prime Minister, Ministers and former Presidents to get the allowance. However, the security officers had to take aptitude training before they were entitled for the allowance. Since 2005, the security division of former President Chandrika Kumarathunga was decided by a Cabinet. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas security division is operated separately. I have instructed that they be attached to the Ministerial Security Division. However, during the previous regime, the allowances had been given even without aptitude training, Minister Rathnayake said.
When MP Dissanayake questioned as to why such a long period had been taken to provide the training, the Premier said the training was provided by the Police. The security division had to direct the officers for training. So we can direct this matter before a relevant committee and get the report within a week, the Premier said. Then only could we find out what has taken place.
Govt. will find out if any groups
or personnel are attempting to promote separatism, LTTE
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka assured Parliament that the government would find out if some groups or personnel attempt to promote separatism and LTTE.
The Minister made this observation yesterday when joint Opposition Parliamentarian Padma Udayashantha Gunasekara questioned the governments stance on posts shared in the internet and social media these days that promotes separatism and LTTE. He added that in one of them a woman in LTTE attire made statements too. He made this query during the round of questions for oral answers.
At this stage, Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said that if there were such incidents, they be reported before the Court and action would be taken accordingly.
Leader of the House, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella questioned as to whether those websites operated locally or internationally and MP Gunasekara said that he was not aware of it. Minister Kiriella said that opposition members make baseless statements. They attempt to give undue publicity to the LTTE at a time when it had been eliminated.
At this statement Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the opposition members were unaware as to where those websites were being operated. Then how could we know if they operated them with those inimical forces the Premier questioned. Some of the Opposition members with several LTTEers altogether around 20, staged a protest in Australia when I went there.
At this stage MP Gunasekara said that he would find as to where the websites were being operated in and what those websites were.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said some of the websites of Namal Rajapakasa and Mahinda Rajapaksa operated overseas, sling mud at the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet and himself. He requested that those websites be looked into.
A this stage UNP MP SM Marikkar said that it was not a website but a profile called MR Esata Penena Minisa to which the Premier said that we could direct that MR Esata Penena Minisa. be found out.
CAA seals matchstick factory
CHAMIKARA WEERASINGHE
The Consumer Affairs Authority sealed an illegal matchstick manufacturing factory in Panawa, Nittambuwa yesterday evening.
According to CAA officials, the authority raided the factory following a complaint by a citizen that it was manufacturing and distributing matches to consumers without the Sri Lanka Standard Institute (SLSI) certificate.
The CAA sleuths seized matchstick boxes worth Rs. 120,480 from the factory.
Matchstick manufacturing deals with hazardous material and obtaining SLSI certificate is a must for the product, said CAA Chairman Hasitha Thilakaratna.
He said Industries and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen urged to conduct the raid as the product in question was of importance in terms of public safety.
We are taking steps to bring this case before the Attanagalla Magistrates Courts on March 17, he said.
Those who misled students in 1971 and 1989 have no moral right to speak of students: Kiriella

Sandasen Marasinghe
The political parties that misled the students in 1971 and 1989, has no moral right to speak of the countrys students any more, said Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
He also said that it was the UNP that initiated the free education system. We have provided the students with text books, uniforms, bursary and the Mahapola and we will solve the university students hostel issue by 2018.
The Minister made these observations joining the Adjournment Motion on SAITM moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Minister Kiriella also said that some groups have created a political issue concerning the SAITM. Now we have to act according to a Court order. The legal background, the standard of the SAITM was challenged before Court in the same manner that they do here, Minister Kiriella said. The Court has considered all aspects and gave its decision. We have to abide by it.
The Minister said the Kotelawala Defence University also commenced a medical faculty during the previous regime, adding that the Medical Council granted its approval to it even at a time there was no hospital to it since the Medical Council feared the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
I appreciate the previous government as it initiated this private medical college although it was a leftist government, Minister Kiriella said. It also granted a loan of Rs 600 million to the SAITM. The then President Mahinda Rajapaksa also granted 10 students scholarships in SAITM.
He requested that all support to act in line with the Court order. He also asked for assistance to operate SAITM until the appeal against the Court order on SAITM is heard.

Possible SriLankan, TPG deal may take over six months: Eran
SriLankan Airlines restructuring plan with the shortlisted private equity fund TPG may take over six months to arrive at a possible agreement, Deputy Public Enterprise Development Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Wickramaratne said discussions with regard to the subject of airlines is a complex matter to be dealt with.There were eight bidders initially then it reduced to three and now shortlisted to only one party, Wickramaratne said.
Its the private equity fund called TPG who is now doing the due-diligence. We have only selected them as a partner of SriLankan Airlines. Discussions with them will continue at least for six more months.
Texas Pacific Group (TPG) which was launched in 1992 with the buying of Continental Airline in 1993 has invested in many airlines including American Airlines, Ryan Air and Mid-West Airlines and owns direct and indirect stakes in several leading airlines.
It was among the shortlisted bidders for SriLankan in 1997 but we went for the Emirates partnership, Wickramaratne said.
We may have to bring in more than one company to revamp the current Airline and with TPG we can do so by bringing in another into SriLankan Airlines.Sri Lanka is planning to sell up to 49 percent of SriLankan Airlines along with management control. (ZI)

Practices for nurturing happiness
We all want to be happy and there are many books and teachers in the world that try to help people be happier. Yet we all continue to suffer.
Therefore, we may think that were doing it wrong. Somehow we are failing at happiness. That isnt true. Being able to enjoy happiness doesnt require that we have zero suffering. In fact, the art of happiness is also the art of suffering well. When we learn to acknowledge, embrace, and understand our suffering, we suffer much less. Not only that, but were also able to go further and transform our suffering into understanding, compassion, and joy for ourselves and for others.
One of the most difficult things for us to accept is that there is no realm where theres only happiness and theres no suffering. This doesnt mean that we should despair. Suffering can be transformed. As soon as we open our mouth to say suffering, we know that the opposite of suffering is already there as well. Where there is suffering, there is happiness.
According to the creation story in the biblical book of Genesis, God said, Let there be light. I like to imagine that light replied, saying, God, I have to wait for my twin brother, darkness, to be with me. I cant be there without the darkness. God asked, Why do you need to wait Darkness is there. Light answered, In that case, then I am also already there. Healing medicine
The main affliction of our modern civilization is that we dont know how to handle the suffering inside us and we try to cover it up with all kinds of consumption. Retailers peddle a plethora of devices to help us cover up the suffering inside. But unless and until were able to face our suffering, we cant be present and available to life, and happiness will continue to elude us.
There are many people who have enormous suffering, and dont know how to handle it. For many people, it starts at a very young age. So why dont schools teach our young people the way to manage suffering If a student is very unhappy, he cant concentrate and he cant learn. The suffering of each of us affects others. The more we learn about the art of suffering well, the less suffering there will be in the world.
Mindfulness is the best way to be with our suffering without being overwhelmed by it. Mindfulness is the capacity to dwell in the present moment, to know whats happening in the here and now. For example, when were lifting our two arms, were conscious of the fact that were lifting our arms. Our mind is with our lifting of our arms, and we dont think about the past or the future, because lifting our arms is whats happening in the present moment. To be mindful means to be aware. Its the energy that knows what is happening in the present moment. Lifting our arms and knowing that were lifting our armsthats mindfulness, mindfulness of our action. When we breathe in and we know were breathing in, thats mindfulness. When we make a step and we know that the steps are taking place, we are mindful of the steps. Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. Its the energy that helps us be aware of what is happening right now and right herein our body, in our feelings, in our perceptions, and around us.
Letting Go
The first method of creating joy and happiness is to cast off, to leave behind. There is a kind of joy that comes from letting go. Many of us are bound to so many things. We believe these things are necessary for our survival, our security, and our happiness. But many of these thingsor more precisely, our beliefs about their utter necessityare really obstacles for our joy and happiness.
Sometimes you think that having a certain career, diploma, salary, house, or partner is crucial for your happiness. You think you cant go on without it. Even when you have achieved that situation, or are with that person, you continue to suffer. At the same time, youre still afraid that if you let go of that prize youve attained, it will be even worse; you will be even more miserable without the object you are clinging to. You cant live with it, and you cant live without it.
If you come to look deeply into your fearful attachment, you will realize that it is in fact the very obstacle to your joy and happiness. You have the capacity to let it go. Letting go takes a lot of courage sometimes. But once you let go, happiness comes very quickly. You wont have to go around searching for it.
Imagine youre a city dweller taking a weekend trip out to the countryside. If you live in a big metropolis, theres a lot of noise, dust, pollution, and odors, but also a lot of opportunities and excitement. One day, a friend coaxes you into getting away for a couple of days. At first you may say, I cant. I have too much work. I might miss an important call.
But finally he convinces you to leave, and an hour or two later, you find yourself in the countryside. You see open space. You see the sky, and you feel the breeze on your cheeks. Happiness is born from the fact that you could leave the city behind. If you hadnt left, how could you experience that kind of joy You needed to let go.
Inviting Positive Seeds
We each have many kinds of seeds lying deep in our consciousness. Those we water are the ones that sprout, come up into our awareness, and manifest outwardly.
So in our own consciousness there is hell, and there is also paradise. We are capable of being compassionate, understanding, and joyful. If we pay attention only to the negative things in us, especially the suffering of past hurts, we are wallowing in our sorrows and not getting any positive nourishment. We can practice appropriate attention, watering the wholesome qualities in us by touching the positive things that are always available inside and around us. That is good food for our mind.
One way of taking care of our suffering is to invite a seed of the opposite nature to come up. As nothing exists without its opposite, if you have a seed of arrogance, you have also a seed of compassion. Every one of us has a seed of compassion. If you practice mindfulness of compassion every day, the seed of compassion in you will become strong. You need only concentrate on it and it will come up as a powerful zone of energy.
Naturally, when compassion comes up, arrogance goes down. You dont have to fight it or push it down. We can selectively water the good seeds and refrain from watering the negative seeds. This doesnt mean we ignore our suffering; it just means that we allow the positive seeds that are naturally there to get attention and nourishment.
Mindfulness-Based Joy
Mindfulness helps us not only to get in touch with suffering, so that we can embrace and transform it, but also to touch the wonders of life, including our own body. Then breathing in becomes a delight, and breathing out can also be a delight. You truly come to enjoy your breathing.
A few years ago, I had a virus in my lungs that made them bleed. I was spitting up blood. With lungs like that, it was difficult to breathe, and it was difficult to be happy while breathing. After treatment, my lungs healed and my breathing became much better. Now when I breathe, all I need to do is to remember the time when my lungs were infected with this virus. Then every breath I take becomes really delicious, really good.
When we practice mindful breathing or mindful walking, we bring our mind home to our body and we are established in the here and the now. We feel so lucky; we have so many conditions of happiness that are already available. Joy and happiness come right away. So mindfulness is a source of joy. Mindfulness is a source of happiness.
Mindfulness is an energy you can generate all day long through your practice. You can wash your dishes in mindfulness. You can cook your dinner in mindfulness. You can mop the floor in mindfulness. And with mindfulness you can touch the many conditions of happiness and joy that are already available. You are a real artist. You know how to create joy and happiness any time you want. This is the joy and the happiness born from mindfulness.
Concentration
Concentration is born from mindfulness. Concentration has the power to break through, to burn away the afflictions that make you suffer and to allow joy and happiness to come in.
To stay in the present moment takes concentration. Worries and anxiety about the future are always there, ready to take us away. We can see them, acknowledge them, and use our concentration to return to the present moment.
When we have concentration, we have a lot of energy. We dont get carried away by visions of past suffering or fears about the future. We dwell stably in the present moment so we can get in touch with the wonders of life, and generate joy and happiness.
Concentration is always concentration on something. If you focus on your breathing in a relaxed way, you are already cultivating an inner strength. When you come back to feel your breath, concentrate on your breathing with all your heart and mind. Concentration is not hard labor. You dont have to strain yourself or make a huge effort. Happiness arises lightly and easily.

Presidential Commission of Inquiry  to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud:Probe into 49 complaints Completed: PM
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud has completed probing 49 complaints, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday. He said the findings of the investigations have been referred to relevant authorities to take necessary legal actions. The Premier made these observations yesterday responding to a question raised by JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2). MP Dissanayake demanded to know the current situation in relation to the functions of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud.
The Premier said the Commission has received 15,599 complaints. He said these complaints had been studied and categorised for the purpose of investigations.
The commission has dismissed 1,180 complaints as allegations which have no basis for further investigation, Premier said. The commission has referred 400 complaints to investigating officials to commence probes. So far, the commission has completed investigating 49 complaints while investigations into 158 complaints are in progress.
The Premier said the findings of some complaints have been referred to various authorities to initiate action against the accused. He said the commission has no legal powers to determine punishment for those found guilty of fraud. He said the commissions mandate is to report the results of their investigations. The powers to take punitive action or instituting legal action on the basis of the findings are vested with the Attorney General or the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Premier Wickremesinghe said. The Commission, therefore, has referred the outcomes of their findings to those authorities. Considering the number of complaints received by the Commission and the workload, the mandate given to the Commission has been extended to September 03, 2017, he said.

## Title: Saboteurs behind SAITM

Saboteurs behind SAITM
In terms of article (2) (h) of Chapter VI under the title Directive principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, State is pledged to establish in Sri Lanka a Democratic Socialist Society the objective of which includes the complete eradication of literacy and the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels. Education policy of Yahapalanaya is based on above principle.
It may be noted that State is capable to provide this service free of charge only for limited number of students who complete A/Level successfully, due to restrictions of resources and facilities available for this purpose. State is compelled to set a cutoff point on marks to be secured at A/Level for admission to medical faculties of State run universities in order to suit the capacity available at State run universities.
Access to education
As a result thousands of students who have successfully completed A/Level have been deprived of entering State run universities. In that context active participation of private sector education institutes and universities to cater for the needs of students who are so deprived of education free of charge is absolutely necessary. SAITM is one of the pioneering institute came forward to share the responsibility and the burden of the State on implementation of State Policy on education and to cater for needs of students who are deprived of higher education which includes medicine as well at State run universities due to no-fault on their part.
SAITM has been established under section 17 of BOI Law No. 04 of 1978. It is a fully pledged BOI project. It has obtained UGC approval to award MBBS Degree. It has affiliated to Russian Universities abroad where medical degrees have been recognized by SLMC subject to the condition that they should satisfy the standard imposed by SLMC for practicing medical profession in this country. In addition Minister of Health in terms of power vested with him/her in Medical Ordinance has gazette, granting approval for SAITM to conduct MBBS Degree course subject to standard set for same by SLMC.
SAITM has complied with standard set by SLMC amidst of gamut of allegations leveled against SAITM. In that process SAITM has set up its own hospital which provides facilities needed for MBBS course practical, in addition to two state run hospitals allocated on charging of fee of Rs.50,000 per student.
Contrary to all these compliances followed by SAITM, SLMC turned down application submitted by MBBS Degree holders of SAITM for registration at SLMC to enable them to practice their profession. This act of SLMC was challenged at Court of Appeal as it appears it is tantamount to gross violation of right to access to education. Judgement given by Court of Appeal ordering SLMC to get them registered has cleared the negative picture created by GMOA against SAITM.
On a random survey carried out by writer on his own it has been observed that allegations leveled against SAITM are either biased, prejudiced or false fabrication promulgated by GMOA. All of them have focused on current standard adopted by SAITM over MBBS course. If it is inadequate it is a matter for the government to intervene and regularize the standard.
If clinical practices are inadequate or insufficient, it is a matter for the Government in consultation with SLMC to provide opportunity for same at State run hospitals free of charge. GMOA has no right to stop it.
Entry qualifications required for MBBS course of SAITM on par with average entry qualifications required for the same in most of the recognized universities all over the world. Marks needed to secure at A/Level Bio-stream by students from remote areas who entered medical faculties of State run Universities under District quota system seemed below the level of marks of students entered from developed areas to follow MBBS course at SITEM. Allegation which says that students who followed A/L Commerce are also could enroll for MBBS course at SAITEM is a diabolic lie fabricated by GMOA. On our survey I found there is no iota of truth on above allegation.
Teaching staff attached to medical faculty of SAITM consists of well qualified and well experienced lecturers, Senior Lecturers, Professors who were or who are attached to medical faculties of State run Universities. In that context how can GMOA say that teaching staff attached to medical faculty of SAITM is poor in quality when compared to the teaching staff attached to medical facilities of state run Universities
State run Universities
It has been observed that overall standard maintained in medical faculty of SAITM is far better than that of the standard maintained in some medical faculties of State run Universities. Behavioural pattern of the students attached to medical faculty of SAITM is also considered far better than that of the behaviour of students attached to medical faculties of State run Universities.
Freedom of education and free of charge education are considered two different concepts. Free of charge education is limited due to restrictions imposed by State run Universities on admission to their medical facilities. SAITM has come forward to cater for students who had become victims of restrictions so imposed by State run Universities. SAITM has cited alternative mechanism to free of charge education in which cost to be borne by parents of the students concerned. Unlike free of charge education this mechanism is not a burden to the general public.
The allegation caused by GMO that standard of medical profession would be jeopardized drastically if SITEM, MBBS Degree holders are allowed to register at SLMC seems malicious and false presumption due the fact that medical profession has already been jeopardized in the hand of GOMA. Whilst criticizing SAITM MBBS Degree course in that manner GMOA is silent over increase of malpractices and medical negligence caused by some of the members of GMOA at State run hospitals.
Those who studied at the cost of public funds and found their employments in Public Sector hospitals are reciprocally duty bound to serve general public on priority basis. Contrary to the above GMOA has driven its membership to go on a series of intermittent strikes in public hospitals over SAITM issue causing immense hardship to indigent patients who cannot afford to go to private hospitals where most of GMOA members are thriving on consultation business.
It is suggested that State can introduced new mechanism for standardizing and accreditation of MBBS courses conducted by both State run Universities as well as SAITM. This mechanism should be assigned to an independent and apex body consisting of representation from all stakeholders of health sector. Remember in this process SLMC is already prejudiced over SAITM issue.
Higher education and health
Allegations caused by GMOA against SAITM cannot be substantiated at all in view of factual position of those allegations as clarified above. Campaign launched by GMOA, has been leveled not only against SAITM, but also against Government and its policy on higher education and health. Non-compliance of Judgement given by Court of Appeal on SAITM issue unless it is challenged at Supreme Court by aggrieved party could be considered contempt of Court. If Supreme Court upheld judgement given by Court of Appeal, there will be further chaos over SAITM issue for which GMOA should hold responsibility.
GMOA has dragged student population against government over SAITM issue. It has launched further campaign to drag masses of this country as well against government over this issue which could ultimately cripple the Government. GMOA has infringed right of SAITM students to have free access to education. Its Trade Union action has caused a threat to Government which represents masses and also jeopardized education of university students.
Forgetting its boundaries and limits, GMOA has also challenged certain economic development plans and policies of the Government such as proposed Free Trade Agreements, ETCA, Taxation policies etc. which are considered out of ambit of GMOA being a trade union.
In the meantime it has also been observed that some elements who had extended their support for SAITM during past regime have been now shifted their support against SAITM, in connivance with GMOA.
In the above context it is clear that GMOA has lunched unwarranted and unjustifiable campaign against Government behind SAITM issue on the pretext of safeguarding medical profession which in reality jeopardized medical profession as well.

Samaposha comes alive with real farming families
The story of Samaposha, the favourite breakfast cereal that starts the day for Sri Lankas children, is woven around the life of farmers who grow the nutritious grain that goes into producing the product.
Plenty Foods, the subsidiary of Ceylon Biscuits Ltd, launched the outgrower system two decades ago to ensure that the grain used to produce Samaposha is fresh and is of very high quality, especially because it is consumed by the nations children as a hurried breakfast.
There is no artificial additives at all in Samaposha which is made of 100% natural and 100% local ingredients.
The backward integration endeavour has proved to be so successful that the areas where the cultivation takes place in far-flung hamlets are visibly thriving. For the farmers who grow the grains, it is much more than a livelihood.
It is a heartfelt commitment and dedication that is reflected in their contented faces. The philosophy of the Samaposha backward integration system is simple. Cultivate and produce quality grain  corn, soya, rice, green gram  and in return Plenty Foods will give back quality of life to the farming families.
Samaposha outgrowers also enjoy benefits such as knowledge sharing that develops their management and cultivation skills, ability to obtain a hassle-free bank loan, emergency assistance in case of an acute need such as damage to the crop from a natural disaster, advisory services and technical assistance at every stage from the initial preparation of the soil to planting the seed right up to the final produce reaching the factory in Pallekelle, Kandy. These are a few of the advantages that keep the farmers contented and smiling.
Govi Pawula or Farmer Club is the five-pronged initiatives powered by Plenty Foods to further uplift the social-economic conditions of these farmers: Govi Denuma, enhancing agricultural knowhow; Govi Sarana, providing assistance in the hour of need; Govi Sathuta, providing social bonding and integration to the farmer community; Govi Suvaya that helps them to maintain good health and Govi Arana, that meets their religious and spiritual needs.
For the Samaposha farming families, visits from the Companys field officers and staff are warmly welcomed as though a much loved relative is visiting. A regular visitor is the Plenty Foods Director and Chief Executive Officer Shammi Karunaratne who said We have been able to establish a strong bond with the farmers because this unique win-win system benefits not only our Samaposha farmers but the entire nation, ensuring high quality nutrition for all, especially children.

Samurdhi beneficiaries demand for rights
A protest was staged by Samurdhi beneficiaries and development officers of the Matale district at the Dambulla clock tower junction demanding for their rights.
They claim that around 28,000 Samurdhi development officers have not been absorbed into the Divineguma Department so far. However, around 1,000 have been absorbed.
Those absorbed are enjoying all benefits including allowances and other benefits while the majority of Samurdhi officers are deprived of their rights.
"We are facing great injustice and the government should solve this problem," they said.
They allege that the government will reduce the number of Samurdhi beneficiaries by 10 percent yearly and has taken steps to recover Rs.2,500 from each Samurdhi beneficiary which was given by the previous regime to develop their houses.
This amount is due to be deducted from their monthly Samurdhi allowance, they allege. This should stop with immediate effect, said the protestors.

Simon Griffiths,  Aedas architect visits  mixed development by ABANS
Simon Griffiths, Executive Principal of Aedas Singapore, a global architecture and design practice considered to be within the Top 10 in the world, recently visited Colombo City Centre and met with the promoters of the development.
He also attended the 34th National Conference on Architecture at BMICH Colombo to share his views on the concept of mixed-use developments and why these cities in the sky are becoming more prevalent throughout the Asian region.
Simon Griffiths is the visionary behind the structural design of Colombo City Centre, a progressive mixed-use venture by the ABANS Group in collaboration with Silver Needle Hospitality, which will not only redefine the city skyline and urban landscape of Colombo, but also, will be the first ultra modern mixed-use development in Sri Lanka.
Hosting broad design expertise throughout the Asian region, Simon Griffiths has worked on a vast variety of projects including large scale mixed-use ventures, office, hotel, and educational sectors as well as infrastructure projects, particularly, major rail and airport projects in Asia and the Middle East.
His innovative design for the Colombo City Centre project reflects the rich, dynamic culture, history, and colonial heritage of Colombo, placing a contemporary twist on several architectural constructs and forms from the Portuguese, Dutch, and British eras. The building features elegant colonnades with deep eaves along the western face opposite the Beira Lake, which offer respite from Sri Lanka's tropical weather. Large full height windows and doors open to the city, breaking down the barrier between the outdoors and the residential space. This creates a harmonious ground floor transition as well as provides residents an uplifting visual experience of the Beira Lake, Indian Ocean, and brilliant city skyline.
To maintain the lavish natural setting of Colombo City Centre, a series of trees has been retained along Muttiah Road, while alush landscape has been integrated into the structure itself.
Further, the development pays reference to specific aspects of Sri Lankan culture. For instance, the car park screen embodies several influences such as the vibrant colours and weaving of the Sri Lankan textile industry as well as the palm frond walls of traditional dwellings. Colombo City Centre will offer residents the opportunity to partake in a truly enriching high-end lifestyle with its inclusion of an opulent residential complex that will reinvent luxury living in Sri Lanka; a 05-floor retail lifestyle mall that will offer a premium shopping experience, fine dining, a gourmet supermarket, children's play area and more; and Next Hotel, the flagship brand of Silver Needle Hospitality that will utilize a smart approach towards accommodating the needs of professional business travelers.
Simon Griffiths expressed his viewpoint on the location and unique nature of the Colombo City Centre development, remarking that: Beira Lake is a focus point within Colombo, enriched with cultural events, temples, and history. The development has been designed in such a way as to engage with the future pedestrianized lake side, and allow tourists and locals alike to relax, interact, and admire the amazing sunset views over the lake. The form of the building offers shelter from the elements and the permeable street frontage with al fresco F&B offerings invite and draw people to wander through the multi-levels of retail spaces.
He further added: With the introduction of the CCC Mall, it will be one of, if not the largest, international lifestyle mall in Colombo, catering both the tourist and local markets, bringing new brands and entertainment to the city. This will also benefit the residents of the development, as they will have a vibrant hub of dining, 6-screen cinema complex, and marketplace, without having to leave the CCC development.

I switched from Law to Marketing because it is a process that enables us to make people happy by fulfilling their needs and wants. The top 30 brands have evolved lately in the corporate sector due to the philosophical nature of marketing and not because of finance. Every successful marketer should be fully equipped with the four aspects; passion, customer centric, differentiation and experience gathering, said Mudadeniya.
The 24 month part-time programme consists of four levels andgears students with marketing competencies from operational to management level.
SLIM Vice President Pradeep Edward who is the Director and CEO of GAP Holding stressed the importance of gearing oneself with the knowledge in marketing to excel in the existing vibrant business environment.

Credible and value adding courses and training programmes and affordable prices of SLIM have made the marketing fraternity and the corporate sector in Sri Lanka to perceive SLIM as an invaluable mentoring entity for over four decades.

'SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards 2017 today
The eagerly awaited SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards will be held for the eleventh consecutive year today at Waters Edge Battaramulla, to recognize the brands and personalities that have left a lasting impression on the people of Sri Lanka.
This unique event is organized by Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) - the national body for marketing which also organizes premier annual events such as SLIM Brand Excellence, Effie Awards and NASCO, in association with Nielsen Sri Lanka, the local arm of the largest information and research company in the world.
The SLIM - Nielsen People's Awards is unique as it puts the general public in the driver's seat, allowing everyday people to name their favourite brands, personalities, advertisements, films, teledramas etc. No individual or company can apply for recognition themselves, and therefore must be nominated by consumers, which provides a true reflection of the views of people based on what is close to their hearts and minds.
The survey spanned a period of one year with randomly selected males and females between the ages of 18 to 50 years being interviewed in all 25 districts. The data was captured through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire by Nielsen field research officers, who were specially trained to conduct interviews of this nature.
Commenting ahead of the awards show, SLIM Nielsen People's Awards 2017 Project Chairman, Ranga Perera described the awards night as an excellent opportunity for marketers in Sri Lanka to understand consumers.
The research findings based on the national sample is a reflection of which brands are strongly positioned in consumers minds. Shifts in preferences when comparing results from previous years would also indicate changing consumer trends which are important for marketers in decision making.
He added that further insights can be obtained through the purchase of research findings at a disaggregated level (by age, gender, region), where specific demographic segment preferences can also be looked at.
A brainchild of SLIM, the SLIM - Nielsen Peoples Awards saw its inception in 2006 and has been held annually ever since. With Sri Lanka's economy showing strong growth and consumer spending habits evolving, it would be of interest to see if traditional brands and personalities have retained their inherent strengths or whether new brands and personalities are emerging as people's favourites, setting the stage for marketers to re-evaluate their marketing and branding strategies.
As the national body for marketing SLIM offers the most sought after proprietary postgraduate and diploma programmes in the fields of marketing and sales. Nielsen Holdings PLC is a global performance management company which has operations in over 100 countries, covering more than 90% of the world's population.

SLMC rift  yet to heal
The storm within the Sri Lankan Muslim Congress (SLMC) had not completely settled observed its former Secretary General Hassan Ali. He said that while there would not be a split within the SLMC, the people were not necessarily happy with its current leadership. Trouble has been brewing within the SLMC since 2015 when SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem introduced the new position of Secretary to the Command to the party Constitution apart from the existing post of General Secretary which Ali held. It was seen as a move to sideline the vociferous Ali who was gaining popularity within the party.
Ali at the time, objected to the sudden change in the Constitution and complained to the Elections Commissioner about it. The latter informed Hakeem that they would not be allowed to contest elections unless they resolved their internal issues. Hakeem thereafter promised Ali an MP seat in return for him withdrawing his complaint and that he would also restore his position as General Secretary at the 2016 delegates conference. None of the promises materialized and at the recent party convention, the post of General Secretary was completely axed, leaving Ali no position at all in the party.
They have abolished the position. They offered me another but I declined it, I dont want any position, said Ali speaking to Daily News. He added that he would remain with the party and had no plans of taking over the leadership or leading a movement against the leader in the future.
In reply to him not receiving the MP seat, Ali said,
I was not going after the MP seat, it was Hakeem who offered the MP seat . He didnt allow me to contest elections and promised to put me on the National List. He put my name first in the SLMC list and sixth in the UNP but later appointed his brother and a friend of his and added, Perhaps he was planning to push me out of Parliament.

SLPA earns Rs. 44 billion revenue in 2016
Net profit Rs. 11 billion
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has earned a revenue of Rs. 44 billion and of it a net profit of Rs. 11 billion during the last financial year (2016), Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
However, of the Rs. 44 billion revenue, the expenditure was Rs. 20.2 billion during the period.
The Minister was addressing the media yesterday at the Port Ministry.
Moreover, the SLPA has paid an amount of Rs. 7.1 billion (Rs. 7,100 million) as installments and the interest for the loan obtained for Hambantota Mahinda Rajapaksa Port during the last financial year.
Minister Ranatunga said Rs. 17,000 million had been paid by the SLFP during the last financial year for loans obtained and for other liabilities. He added that there is a gradual increase in the net profit and the total revenue when compared to previous years.
The SLPA increased the revenue as a result of a collective measure to increase the productivity and measures taken to minimize fraud and monetary misconducts, he said.
When the Minister was asked about plans for the Hambantota Port, he said the SLPA is looking forward to carry through with the best option. Accordingly, the SLFP will compromise for the best option.
We have achieved a fruitful outcome by now in connection with the Hambantota Port. We are still engaged with it to get the best plan running. We have done well so far, he said.
However, within the next 10 days, the SLPA will finalize the project, he added.
The Minister noted that the Galle and Trincomalee Ports are making a profit now after a lapse of several years as a result of mitigating fraud and financial misconduct.
Speaking on the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port, the Minister said the SLPA is looking forward for an investor aiming to develop it further. He said machinery will be ordered for the Eastern Terminal. The Eastern Terminal can be extended to 1,200 metres with the assistance of the private sector investors. It is hoped to run the terminal as a public-private entity.
Speaking on the present situation of the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), Minister Ranatunga said that the depth of the jetty is not sufficient for most modern large vessels. The cranes of the JCT are not modern.

We have to install modern machinery especially modern cranes in place of old cranes. The SLPA will place an order for new cranes this year and the SLPA will receive the new cranes by next year, he said.

Unruly behaviour has Parliament adjourned till March 21

A tense situation prevailed in Parliament today (10) between the members of the government and Joint Opposition (JO), compelling the Speaker to adjourn Parliament till March 21.
The tense situation came about when Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya giving the JO the opportunity to talk in Parliament over making NFF an independent party in the House as well as assigning a member of the JO to represent views of it in place of JO leader Dinesh Gunawardena who was suspended from attending the sittings for a week.
When JO member Keheliya Rambukwella was speaking following JO members Chamal Rajapaksa, Wimal Weerawansa and Dullas Alahapperuma, Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected on allowing them to speak in Parliament stating that the Speaker had already stated a ruling.
He added that it was not fair to waste the time of the House as there are many matters that the government has to take up.
"This is a matter that the Speaker has already given a ruling on," Minister Kiriella said.
"If around two hours is allowed to be wasted every day for these members how can the government work" At this occasion the JO members rose to their feet and began to shout and object against Minister Kiriella.
Several government members too join the brawl, fanning the tense situation.
The Speaker said that the JO members were not given opportunity to speak on this matter for the past three days.
"I promised them to give time during this week. Let them speak," the Speaker said.
"But the decision is made already. We have to attend to public business," Minister Kiriella said.
"I promised them to give time to express their grievances," the Speaker said.
"Lets give them five minutes. MP Rambukwella may continue his speech".
Thereafter MP Rambukwella continued amidst chaos as members of both the side were shouting.
However when MP Rambukwella wound up his speech, the Speaker announced that the Public Business is commenced.
Amidst the chaos situation someone was heard requesting to suspend the sittings for 10 minutes.
Following this suggestion the Speaker announced the adjournment at till March 21.
The government members left the House while the Joint Opposition members shouting slogans hailing the Speaker.
However according to the order paper the sittings were scheduled from 10.30 am to 1 pm and from 1.30 pm to 7.30 pm.

Visiting New Zealand farmer shares expertise with local dairying women
As Sri Lankans continue to enjoy the goodness of milk, demand for dairy is growing by 13 per cent per year. However, currently the local industry can only meet 30 per cent of this demand.
In addition, the fact that the agricultural sector employs 30 per cent of the Sri Lankan workforce, but contributes just nine per cent of the national GDP, tells us that the productivity of this sector has an immense potential to grow.
In time for International Womens Day, Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka held a womens networking session to empower local dairy women and recognise the contribution they are making to the industry, as well as the unique potential they hold to uplift the industry even more.
Marloes Levelink, a Fonterra shareholder who has been in New Zealand dairy for 15 years, shared her insights and expertise with tenSri Lankan women from dairy farming families who supply Fonterra with fresh milk.
This was part of her three-week visit, which is one element of the Co-operatives dairy development programme that aims to help uplift the local Sri Lankan industry.
Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka Head of Extension, Training and Partnerships Mik Harford said like their counterparts in New Zealand, local women in dairy are vital in running their families farming businesses.
Women often play substantial roles in the dairy farm, while also balancing multiple commitments and businesses.
At the session, local dairy women highlighted key challenges they face in their day to day farming activities including the irregular supply of quality feed and water, the need for veterinary services and the need for better time management when considering household and farming commitments.
In discussing these road blocks, Levelink shared simple solutions and ways of working that help her and her fellow New Zealand farmers to increase their farms production and quality. She covered areas such as effective approaches to managing livestock and improving cattle health, farm productivity, and additional income opportunities from the existing herd.
From my visits to farms around Sri Lanka, it is evident that women play a crucial role in local dairy farming, and there is great potential for them to further enhance the industry. As a woman in dairy myself, I understand some of the common challenges we all face, such as unpredictability of the weather, as well as combing the farm business and the household activities.
Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka and the Indian Subcontinent Sunil Sethi said the session was all about women empowering women  sharing theirknowledge and insights to uplift the dairy industry.

## Title: WATERWAY  TO GO

WATERWAY  TO GO
The boom in the spice trade was a direct result of Sri Lanka being colonised by the Portuguese and then the Dutch. The Dutch organized mass cultivation of cinnamon plants, with many plantations blossoming along the west coast of the country. At a time when horsepower came in the form of actual horses and roads didnt have smooth asphalt, and moving goods was a challenge large canals were created in key places to transport goods. The cinnamon once prized as highly as gold had to be taken from the plantations to the Colombo or Negombo ports to be traded and sold, and the demand for it exceeded the rate at which it could be transported by land.
To solve this problem, the Dutch built a canal system spanning over 100 km, which provided fast and efficient transport to this sought-after spice. Pictures will show you that, during their heyday, these canals resembled those of Venice, with boats gliding across the water like oversized Gondolas. The cinnamon trade in Sri Lanka declined after the British took over the colonial reigns and tea was given more prominence. This, combined with the development of the countrys road infrastructure and the introduction of railways, was the final nail in the canals coffin. The canals were gradually abandoned and eventually overrun by nature, and finally only monitor lizards glided across the waters.
Large-scale cleanups
However, the canals are now making a comeback. Large-scale cleanups are restoring them to their former glory and now they are fully accessible all the way to Colombo, just like they were 200 years ago. A canal boat trip can easily be arranged by speaking to the hotels travel desk.
If the weather is good and the sea is calm, you can take off from right in front of the hotel in a motor- boat, guided by a fisherman from the area who knows the canals like the back of his hand. If you stay at a Jetwing property and book a tour with the naturalist from the hotel you will learn about the historical story of these canals, as you float along, enjoying the scenery and diverse ecosystems that surround you. Just a short skim across the wavy waters and you come upon the estuary where the canal opens up into the sea. If the sea is rough, the tour begins with a short van ride to the estuary where the boat is waiting. The best time to do this is before 8.30 am when the sun is not at its hottest and the animals are just coming out of their lairs.
The canals have a depth of a little over 2metre and are generally about 50m in width. As you proceed inland, heading east, the bow of the boat cuts through the placid waters, which reflect the blue skies above. Trees line the sides from start to finish, some indigenous to the area like the palm tree, which survives half submerged. I imagine it was waterways like this that inspired Stephen King while writing the final chapters of Birds of Prey, where German warships wade through unknown tributaries in search of cover. Occasionally, you will see a dark shape passing underneath the surface and the tail of a monitor lizard emerges with grey, weathered scales. They look almost primeval, making you feel like you are on the set of Jurassic Park, but they are harmless, often scampering away into a burrow under the roots of a mangrove tree, which dip into the water and provide great perching spots for blue Kingfishers waiting eagerly to pounce on the first fish that emerges to kiss the surface.
Canal trip
My favourite bird is known as the flying dog and if you are very lucky you might even hear it sing just like one. Just make sure you take a good pair of binoculars or you will miss the smaller attractions and a good zoom lens if you want to capture the colorful butterflies that flit across the boat in more rural parts of the canal.
There are several islands around the canal system that are being built into beach resorts which can only be reached by a barge from the mainland - a rather exciting way of grabbing a snack if you fancy one. Along the way you can also stop at the Canal Caf for a quick bite to eat or a drink and gaze on the serenity of the canal and groups of parrots that fly across from time to time. If youre bored of just sitting in a caf, you can stop by the waters edge, next to the coconut trees and watch as the local coconut climbers clamber up and drop coconuts onto the banks.
Even 13 years on one can still see areas that were affected by the tsunami in 2004, abandoned houses and land now turned into pig farms. The canal trip goes all the way up to the dam at Kozhikode, and after that the boat turns around and heads back to the hotel, where fresh juice and refreshing towels await you at the end of a picturesque adventure. In all, the canal trip that can be organized through Jetwing Beach or Jetwing Blue lasts one hour and thirty minutes. It is almost like a journey back through time to the colonial era when these arteries were filled with boats transporting goods to and fro. A stylish way to explore these natural havens along the old trade routes from Colombo to Negombo without even getting stuck in a traffic jam! Perhaps one day they will be used again and for more than just transporting curious tourists around.

Womens rights: Sri Lanka still to go a long way
Sri Lanka is not in a good situation with regard to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) despite having ratified the international standards, Sri Lanka Human Rights Chairman Deepika Udagama said.
Even though we have a Constitution that ensures equality and non-discrimination, CEDAW urged Sri Lanka to take on conflict-related violence against women, she said.
She was addressing the Lecture, Question and Answer (LQA) session organised by the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) on Wednesday to mark International Womens Day.
Udagama said it is high time that we say women are also human beings just like saying prisoners are also human beings.
This is why we have human rights. When you listen to the programmes on International Womens Day, it is all about extolling the virtues of motherhood. It is not about any particular status of ones life whether you are a daughter, wife or a mother. That is irrelevant. The point is we are all human beings and women deserve equal respect, she said.
Speaking of the problems faced by Muslim women in Sri Lanka under the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Act (MMDA), Udagama said the Constitution in a democratic country should be the supreme law. Nothing should be above it, she said.
The Constitution is the supreme law, but there are exceptions. The article 16 of the Constitution says any written or unwritten laws at the adoption of the Constitution will continue to operate notwithstanding inconsistency with the Constitution. There is a contradiction where the Constitution is the supreme law, but there are exceptions,she said.
Udagama said the human rights commissions position is that we must have a principally recognised Constitution. All other laws should abide by that, Udagama said.
Even though Udagama sees the problems faced by Muslim women as human rights issue, she said it would be strategic for the community to deal with the issues pertaining to the Muslim Personal law.

Year 2016, a success story in drug enforcement
The year 2016 has been a success story for drug enforcement in Sri Lanka but the job is not complete as drug traffickers had not stopped, said United Nations Office on Drug and Crime Programme Coordinator Shanaka Jayasekara.
He was addressing the launch of the International Narcotic Control board (INCB) Annual Report 2016 at the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) yesterday.
Drug traffickers need to know that the drug enforcement agencies are out-performing their colleagues in the region and Sri Lanka is no longer a soft transit location. However, this also becomes a challenge as we strive to improve on the records of 2016. We need to have higher seizures in 2017, he said.
Jayasekara said the law enforcement agencies in Sri Lanka, be it the Police Narcotics Bureau, Sri Lanka Customs and Excise Department, have taken the fight against drug traffickers with its own resources and initiatives. The report stated that the amount of heroin trafficked into Sri Lanka continued to increase in 2016. Seizure data for the first half of 2016 indicated a sharp increase over the same period of the previous year.
The report stated that in 2016, the Police Narcotics Bureau with the support of other law enforcement agencies in Sri Lanka seized over 1,550 kg of cocaine. This included the seizure of 928 kg of cocaine on MV Fabiola when it arrived at the Colombo Port on December 9, 2016 from Ecuador. This was the largest seizure of cocaine in South Asia, a great achievement for Sri Lanka. In addition, consignments of 210 kg of cocaine seized on November 24, 301 kg on July 21 and 80 kg on June 15 account for the record seizure of cocaine in Sri Lanka.
It further stated that in 2015, South Asia continued to be particularly vulnerable to trafficking in opiates and heroin. Trafficking in cannabis, synthetic drugs, and new psychoactive substances also persisted in the region. Trafficking of heroin from South-West Asia to India and then to Sri Lanka, Maldives and countries in Western Europe was identified by the Narcotics Control Bureau of India as a major trafficking trend.
The theme of the INCB Annual Report 2016 is the impact of narcotic drugs on women.
The report identifies the disproportionate increase in drug overdoses among women and calls on member States to do more to take women into account in their drug policies and programmes.
The report calls on governments to give priority to providing healthcare access for drug-dependent women and calls for more funding and coordination to prevent and treat drug abuse among women.

He also said even though Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka told Parliament that the Government was looking for two suspects in connection with the shooting incident of SAITM CEO Dr Sameera Senaratne, the two suspects had not been arrested when they surrendered to court.
Meanwhile, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara rising to a Point of Order questioned how Parliament Police were allowed into the main Chamber on Wednesday through the lobby of Opposition side, adding that it was a breach of Parliamentary privileges.

Bandula  utters  falsehood
PresidentialCommission on Treasurybond issue
Severely reprimanded by Commission
MP Bandula Gunawardane was severely reprimanded yesterday by the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds, for misleading the public by providing false information on its ongoing proceedings.
The Commission summoned MP Gunawardane yesterday to the Commission for disseminating wrong information via the media.
Asked if he did or did not give incorrect information regarding a request letter sent by the Joint Opposition to the Commission, Gunawardane admitted that in fact he did.
The Commission chided Gunawardena not to devalue the exhaustive examinations done by the Commission on the CBSL Treasury Bond issue.
The matter which drew the attention of the Commission is on a statement made by MP Gunawardana to the electronic media on March 7, 2015 highlighting that the JO has sent a requesting letter to the Commission to testify and provide certain documents which were not in possession with the Commission ,regarding the CBSL Treasury bond issue.
Gunawardane told the media that the letter of request was sent to the Presidential Commission whereas it was not.
In an attempt to evade the rigorous questioning directed by Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, MP Gunawardana initially mentioned that he only told the media that JO is going to send the said letter.
As the Commission then quoted Gunawardanes statement for the purpose of his recollection, the MP had no choice but to admit that he indeed incorrectly stated that the JO had already sent the letter.
However, in an attempt to dodge the embarrassment, Gunawardane went on to explain that perhaps he said so by mistake.
It was observed that, perhaps, MP Gunawardane got his past tense and future tense befuddled when he was making the questioned statement.
Asked as to why he or the JO did not respond to the public notice issued by the Commission to grant opportunity to testify before the Commission, Gunawardane said they were not able to meet the time restrictions to send in the application form. Gunawardane then was granted the opportunity to testify before the Commission.
He was kindly requested by the Commission to condense his statement to facts and information and not political statements or any other prejudices.
Gunawardane failed to provide the Commission with documents he was referring to, as he testified, since none of them were authentic and had authors.
Gunawardane limited his statement to four main points, including a request to the Commission to inspect the role played by the Bank of Ceylon, to which the Commission replied ; We have already undertaken that task.
Gunawardane was allowed to show him bundles of evidences that the Commission has collected and is analyzing at the moment.
The MP made a request from the Commission to allow JO members MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage and MP Nandalal Dissanayake who were members of the COPE committee to testify before the Commission.It was pointed out that COPE Chairman MP Sunil Handunnetti and former Chairman D.E.W.Gunasekara are both to be summoned before the Commission.
We have almost by-hearted the two COPE reports regarding this matter. So, there is no need to repeat the same in front of us. However, we will try to accomodate at least one of your members, the Commission said.
Gunawardane also produced an anonymous document to the Commission, including data regarding the treasury bond issuances, which the Commission pointed out to the MP, is already in their possession under the signature of one Wasantha Samarasekara, the President of the Inter Companies Workers Association.
MP Namal Rajapaksa was also present at the Commission as the legal representative of MP Bandula Gunawardane.

Be waxed!
The March 8 represents a special day for women all around the world. International Womens Day revolves around celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women from all over the globe. The day however should be celebrated by all women regardless of their achievements as all women deserve to be celebrated for the roles they play in life.
So whether youre a stay at home mom, a career woman or an activist who fights for equal rights for women, you deserve to be celebrated for your feats. And what better way to be celebrated that to take a little time off for yourself for some well-deserved pampering.
No one knows and understands pampering better than the folks at BeWaxed, Sri Lankas pioneering waxing salon. The waxing salon which was the brainchild of Durga Kenny is itself a testament to the ambition and hard work of a woman. Durga has worked tirelessly to mold her small business into a sought after brand today.
Services offered at BeWaxed differ from that of a mainstream waxing salon as the techniques and ingredients used are unique. Besides their differences in the waxing process BeWaxed also boasts well trained staff.
The girls were recently taken to Thailand to receive their training at the Wax Academy. We are hoping to go there again and for our staff to receive more training Durga said as she discussed the growth of the brand.
I never imagined we would grow this much and never thought that Colombo will come to appreciate us so much. As we celebrate four years it is also so important for me to remember my staff. Some of the girls have faithfully been with me right from the start and it is their hard work as much as mine that we are here today, she added.
As it celebrated its 4th anniversary, BeWaxed is also expanding its horizons with their mini branches where customers are able to pop in for a quick waxing. These express branches were designed to create a sense of convenience for the customers as the services offered are limited to the basic sugar waxing. The first express branch is now in operation at 175A, Vauxhal Street, Colombo 2.

Blaze kills 22 girls in Guatemala childrens shelter
GUATEMALA: Guatemala declared three days of mourning after a blaze Wednesday in a government-run childrens shelter killed at least 22 teenage girls and focused attention on allegations of sexual and other abuse in the facility.
All those killed were aged between 14 and 17.
Most died of burns in the fire in the Virgin of the Assumption Safe Home in San Jose Pinula, 10 kilometers (six miles) east of Guatemala City, officials said.
A total of 38 other people were injured, 16 of them in critical condition, hospital officials said.
President Jimmy Morales said on national television that he had ordered the dismissal of the shelters director.
The blaze was believed to have started during an overnight rebellion in the center, which holds nearly double the 400 people it was designed to house. Some youths tried to escape, news reports said.
Morales said that before the fire, orders had been given to transfer some of the youths to other facilities because of the overcrowding.
They were serving food to the teenagers when some of them started a fire in a mattress and thats how the fire was set, said Abner Paredes, a prosecutor defending childrens rights.
Human rights activists held a vigil Wednesday night, lighting candles and placing flowers outside the shelter and in the main square in Guatemala City.
It was a ticking time bomb. This was to be expected, one of the centers former employees, Angel Cardenas, said outside.
He said he had lodged several warnings about conditions inside.
At the entrance of the shelter -- whose imposing, barbed wire-topped concrete wall showed no sign of the drama inside -- crying relatives crowded the entrance. They were searching for news of the children kept there. Police blocked access to them and to journalists.
A few survivors were seen hugging kin on the pine tree-lined road. But many other family members were left unattended.
They dont want to give any information at all, said Rosa Aguirre, a 22-year-old street vendor who had rushed from the capital to see if her two sisters, aged 13 and 15, and her 17-year-old brother were among the casualties.
She said many frustrated people had gone to hospitals to see if their relatives were there.
Aguirre said she, too, had lodged complaints about how the centers residents were treated, but received no attention.
She said brawls broke out inside often, and her brother was sometimes put in a dark isolation cell nicknamed the chicken coop.
She said she had tried in vain to gain custody of her siblings after their mothers death four months ago.
Guatemalan media said the shelters occupants had revolted overnight and into Wednesday against alleged sexual abuse by staff, and over poor food and conditions.
The center, supervised by state authorities, hosts minors under age 18 who are victims of domestic violence or found living on the street.
They are sent there by court order and are under the responsibility of the social welfare ministry.
The shelter has been the target of multiple complaints alleging abuse. Dozens of children have run away in the past year, reportedly to escape ill treatment.
The government decreed three days of mourning. - AFP

Bountiful harvests with organic paddy husk fertilizer
Paddy husks not being put to good use in the past, has now proven to be a good source of alternate fertilizer for crop cultivation of both vegetables and fruits. It has also been found to be ideally suited for growing coconut trees as well.
A recent media visit to the model vegetable farm at Kalladi, Madurankuliya proved beyond doubt that if people are keen to grow even on a small scale to meet their daily vegetable needs, they could do so with the space available to them is with the able guidance provided by the Department of Agriculture.
The plot of land turned out to be a model vegetable farm run by Chanduni Agro Plantation (Private) Ltd headed by Chandana Hapuarachchi. Hapuarachchi ventured in to manufacturing paddy husk - compost fertilizer with the aid of the Centre for Excellence for Organic Agriculture, run by the Department of Agriculture, at Maakandura.
Obtaining proper advice on fertilizer
D.M. Priyanga, the Soil Scientist and Head of the Research Division at the Centre for Excellence for Organic Agriculture, Department of Agriculture, Maakandura, was on a field visit in Kattuwa, Kochchikade on February 15 when she met the Daily News and spoke on the work being undertaken by them. She said that if people are keen to grow vegetables and fruits in their respective land, what they needed was proper advice and guidance on using fertilizer. We recommend that they come in search of our advice to use site specific fertilizer. We also advice them that they also need to get the soil tested before applying fertilizer, she added.
Having inspected the site where vegetables were grown, she said she was really taken up by how successfully those involved had cultivated vegetables such as cabbage and beetroot using the newly manufactured compost fertilizer.
Priyanga a former Lecturer at Hardy Institute, Ampara in the field of Agriculture, Animal husbandry, Food and Nutrition had served at the Wayamba Open University for many years as a visiting lecturer (external) and worked at the Batalagoda Paddy Research Institute. Subsequently, she had joined the institute at Makandura, as a soil scientist in 2006 and was involved in research and soil testing. We have carried out over 20,000 sample tests from 2009 and designed compost to go with our recommendations.
She went on to say that the Institute where she headed the Research Division was declared open by President Maithripala Sirisena in June last year and since then the Centre has been helping a large number of farmers by carrying out laboratory tests on soil and use of paddy husk compost. Our Institute comes under the purview of the Agriculture Department and is the only institute to promote large scale compost production, quality assessment and organic farming in Sri Lanka. We have given technical guidance to a large number of farmers and producers under the Project of Compost Production and Promotion of Utilization, since 2009 under the Agriculture Ministry. Our Institute is well equipped to carry out tests and our charges are very affordable. We test the soil prior to recommending the fertilizer to use. We have certified compost fertilizer manufactured using coconut husk and it conforms to WHO accepted standards fertilizer for application, she added.
Successful results
She also had a word of appreciation for those involved in the plot of land which came under her scrutiny as she said, the outcome of their effort is well manifested in the richness of their crops, grown using the new fertilizer. She did not mince words when she said our people are a bit lazy to use organic material because they have to bring in a large quantity into the field and they have to put in some hard work at the start. For them it is easy to go with the chemical fertilizer than doing the hard work. But now with the training they have received on the use of organic fertilizer, the trend has changed. We advise people to go for a soil test before they use either organic or chemical fertilizers on their fields. If they follow that method, the results would be tremendous and we would have a plate of rice with healthy vegetables for our children and the future of this country.
Priyanga also stressed the importance of ensuring the proper growth of a plant. The plant needs 16 ingredients in specific proportions. There might be different proportions of nutrients within the ingredients in the soil chosen for cultivation and the best solution would be to get the soil tested prior to using fertilizer while that test would help adjust the composition of those nutrients to suit the soil of the plot designed for cultivation.
Learning to make the best use of fertilizer
She also pointed out the availability of facilities at the Centre to provide training to farmers which would enhance their knowledge in making the best use of fertilizer. We have registered thousands of farmers for training. They lack awareness of the dangers of excessive use of fertilizer. Many of them are ignorant and unaware of the polluted nature of the soil in the land they intend to use. The soil gets contaminated due to their own excessive use of fertilizer and the soil simply keeps absorbing the chemicals. The plant eventually rejects all these excesses and does not do well and in the end their labour is all in vain. To avoid such a situation, she insisted on the importance of making the farmers aware and be warned beforehand.
Chandana Hapuarachchi, Chairman, Chanduni Agro Plantation (Pvt) Ltd in the meantime informed the media that his plan was to turn 75,000 kgs of paddy husk into fertilizer and introduce it to crop cultivators; to encourage them to use compost fertilizer as his company does, to grow vegetables and fruits.
We hope to move onto other crops with the passage of time, he added and with the support of Herman Fernando, Director Operation of his Company assigned to see to the manufacturing of paddy husk compost, he expected paddy husk compost to be in great demand in the future.

Can we teach standard Sri Lankan English
Languages are for communication particularly for interaction between and among individuals. Hence the most important feature of a language should be its intelligibility to one's interlocutor.
The discordance in pronunciation, of the village name Uunawachuna by foreigners for Unawatuna has been a standing joke among us Southerners while travelling there by bus. One white man who had tried to learn a bit of Sinhala one day asked a bus driver Uunawachunata yanawada with the final syllable of the second word pronounced as the voiced counterpart of consonant t as in dog (alveolar plosive rather than th as in this). The message however hit home as the drivers of buses plying thereabouts happened to be accustomed to such jabberings.
Second language speakers
Having been born to a family of all mono-linguals of Sinhala with both parents not knowing a word of English and having studied right upto the A/levels in Sinhala medium, I took a lot of pains to master English on my own and at last was able to win laurels for my endeavour when I was on my visit to England for my post-graduate studies.
The courier who took me from the King's Cross railway station to the British Council in London commented: You speak English beautifully. How did you manage to learn it Among nearly 45 adult students in my group my best friend was David Kerr, an Irish young man who used to pay tribute to my English as others including mostly Africans and even Orientals like Indians, Pakistanis and Malaysians spoke an English almost unintelligible being adulterated with French and oriental accents. David even came to my room in the halls with a carton of orange juice to get certain points in linguistics clarified by me It is also a truth that Sri Lankans speak English with an accent more close to the British model than most other second language speakers.
I don't believe that this portrait of myself amounts to what is termed by Professor Manique Gunasekara as linguistic servitude'. The concept servitude incorporates a much wider range of other aspects than being merely linguistic in terms of a whole system of values including one's ways of behaviour, dress, wishes and aspirations as well as beliefs that often characterise a class quintessentially well-known and whom MG in her book calls English speaking elite'.
I don't belong to this elite and more than that, in spite of learning English, I have all my lifetime since I became a discerning young man been very critical of certain English values (or any other system of values for that matter) when they happened to offend ours. I still keep enlightening my fellow citizens about the absurdity of sporting a necktie while seating profusely in the sweltering heat or handling spoons with right hand at luncheons imitating the English who eat with forks and spoons. Our copycats switch to the left hand to get second helpings'!
The Postcoonial Identity of Sri Lankan English by Professor Manique Gunasekara is a landmark work produced with obvious hardwork of research, which very clearly portrays how far the standard English has been affected by local languages. Our senior at Kelaniya during 1980s while reading English, her genial ways with an infectious smile always on her face were typical of her not being arrogantly emphatic in her views as evident in her interview recorded by Sajitha Prematunga on Daily News.
My objective in this article is to set out what I sincerely felt going through the book, particularly the loan words absorbed into this so-called Sri Lankan Standard English'. Apart from the quite natural phonological syntactic and morphological variations manifest in the common man's Sri Lankan English, she has painstakingly catalogues a vast number of these loans from local languages like Sinhala and Tamil.
The elite who use these words in interaction among themselves do not apparently exhibit them so freely with those outside their clique. The young undergrads (almost totally female) who were reading English at university having gained entrance by passing A levels (while we a batch of teachers entered by passing GAQ with English as a subject externally) may have been using this dialect as it were, yet never uttered a single word of that nature in the little opportunity we had to consort with them.
English speaking people
As a matter of fact we have never even heard that kind of Jargon in this cosmopolitan stratum of the society. Neither our lecturers like Ranjith Gunawardana, Gamini Haththotuwagama, Luxmi Silva nor even the professor D C R A Gunathilaka ever used such words in their speech. Thus it is amply clear that those bizarre terms are only bandied about in a closed circle the class that use English as their first language or the mother tongue. The only such word we heard them speak is Gunda which is how they called our lecturer Mr. Gunawardana.
Having worked with a large number of English speaking people as a teacher of English, a teacher educator in an English College of Education and also an administrator in the Western Province visiting hundreds of schools, I have never come across a single teacher who used the vocabulary catalogued in Manique's book. Hence treating it as Standard Sri Lankan English is a highly controversial proposition.
That what the ordinary English speaking people use in our everyday life should be our standard English is my thesis. This by no means reflects any form of linguistic servitude as it does not slavishly stick to the British model in all respects of language. Mostly being affected by our local phonological standards we pronounce most English words according to how we deem them correct. Obvious examples are clientele whose first syllable is pronounced as in client while the accepted form is the long -- vowel e as in clean'; In restaurant the middle part tau is pronounced by Lankans as tu whereas the standard is restrong, the first syllable of vehicle and vehement is pronounced as vehi  whereas the standard is we'; words beginning with e-es we pronounce as es while the accepted sound is is eg. Establish, escape etc. The u of university, unit etc are pronounced with a short vowel while the standard is a long vowel as in you'; in mobile the initial vowel is pronounced as a short one as in mob while the standard is a long vowel as in morning'. Examples galore if you go into this common man's English. It is obviously lack of mastery, yet even teachers of English teach this localized model unhindered.
It is by no means servitude to try to approximate to the most prevalent model of a language as language is for universal communication and thus the closer to a worldwide standard the easier will be the deciphering of messages. A more acute form of servitude is writing our names with foreign spelling eg. Malik as Malique ignorant of the phonological rule that words ending in -que tend to lengthen the preceding vowel making this name Maleek examples are unique, boutique, mystrique, oblique, critique and clique all pronounced with a long vowel in the middle. Another point that minimizes the validity of Sri Lankan standard English is the fact that the type of vocabulary highlighted will obviously operate as noise in communication. If teachers and course planners adopt these in their class texts the students will find their interlocutors, particularly those from overseas in this fast shrinking global village nonplussed and hard put to it to understand them. For example how would those in the periphery comprehend if one of our students said: The Hutamart does not respond to the meeya instead of: The computer does not respond to the mouse, hutamart being the rustic term for any modern contraption!

CBs former female superintendent  displayed integrity on  bond issue: President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said the evidence given by a former female superintendent of the Central Bank before the Presidential Commission on the bond issue showed how she tried to impart her duties honestly and with integrity.
The President said among the evidence recorded so far by the Commission, the former female superintendents statement stood out as an example of a woman trying to fulfill her duties with honesty and steadfastness.
The President was speaking at a ceremony organized by the SLFP Womens Front to mark the International Womens Day at the SLFP Headquarters.
Speaking further on the evidence given by her, the President said not only she had spoken truthfully and honestly, but had also admitted that she was under pressure when taking some actions and that there was nothing that could be done in her capacity to change them.
President Sirisena said this can be looked at as an example of how women react with honesty and with sincerity when vested with high responsibilities,
He added that female representation in politics would be legalised and increased in the upcoming polls. He said Government policies would be formulated to give priority to women and female representation would be further enhanced to establish a nation free from corruption.

Chinas forex reserves rise above $3 trillion
Chinas foreign exchange reserves rose above the $3 trillion mark in February again, the first rise in eight months.
Analysts said the trend of yuan depreciation may be reversed this year if Chinas economic fundamentals continue to improve.
The countrys foreign exchange reserves rose by $6.92 billion in February to $3.005 trillion, the first increase since June 2016, data from the Peoples Bank of China, the central bank, showed on Tuesday.
In January, the reserves fell to $2.998 trillion, sparking heated discussions as to whether they would continue to fall and become inadequate for guarding the countrys financial stability. The February rebound may ease such concerns, analysts said.
The rise in the reserves was partly due to the domestic economic recovery and higher exports in February, said Ren Zeping, chief economist at Founder Securities Co.

CIMA unveils corporate partner programme
CIMA unveiled its Corporate Partners, celebrating a decade of partnerships which play an important role in ensuring the accounting profession continues to evolve with contemporary business needs.
This year's partnership holds special significance, in addition to acknowledging the 10 year milestone. In January 2017, the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (the Association) was formed combining the strengths of CIMA and the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).
Representing 650,000 students and members globally, in public and management accounting, the Association strives to power opportunity, trust and prosperity for people, businesses and economies worldwide. To further elaborate on the Association and its relevance for Sri Lankan corporates, Lawson Carmichael (Executive Vice President - People, Strategy and Innovation) and Venkkat Ramanan (Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific) were in attendance to address CIMA's corporate partners. Citing geo-political, technological, regulatory and workforce issues which are causing rapid changes to businesses and their operating environments globally, Lawson advocated building stronger corporate partnerships. He said: "Strategic partnerships are differentiating companies of the future. The Association uniquely differentiates us, delivering value, delivering better business and protecting the public interest."
Supporting these statements, Venkkat explained, "The main objective of the Corporate Partner Programme is to form a closer linkage between the Association and the corporates. While the Programme also provides an essential link for employers seeking professional talent to meet their business needs, the Association is committed to support Sri Lanka's economy by developing the competencies of not only school leavers but the accounting profession at large." Venkkat also emphasised on the need for corporates to gain a better understanding of the local implications of global changes. He added: "

Combating kidney disease: New water filter to save annual health cost
A new water filter manufactured by Life Saver was introduced at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
Water samples collected from Beira Lake was purified within a few minutes with this British-made filter costing only 50 cents to purify water for four persons. It will help reduce the dumping of thousands of empty water bottles to the environment, the Finance Ministry said in a release. The annual budget generally allocates Rs. 124 billion for health expenditure and funds could be reduced by providing drinking water for the people, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the event to introduce the filter. The Minister said introducing a proper mechanism to supply pure drinking water would solve several health problems including kidney disease among people.
We planned this programme targeting residents of the Colombo North area as they have been facing a severe drinking water problem. When we searched for a prospective stakeholder, we came across this company. A programme has been initiated under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to eradicate kidney disease, he said.
One advantage is that the cost to provide drinking water for the people will reduce and the other is that the cost for annual health will decline as diseases will decline. The government can reduce its annual cost on health - Rs.124 billion - to a considerable extent, the minister said. The filter is currently used in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Lebanon and Colombia. Life Saving Regional Manager Stuart Elson and local agent Dareen Weerasinghe were present.

Using NFC(Near Field Communications) technology, first introduced to Sri Lanka by Dialog, Commercial Bank customers visiting Dialog outlets can simply tap their Visa or MasterCard credit cards on the machines to carry out payments, and cardholders no longer need to hand over their cards to outlet staff.
The units are already in operation at 17 Dialog outlets island wide, and the Tap n Go feature enhances security while transactions below Rs 5,000 do not require a signature - expediting checkout. Commercial Bank has been a leader in the adoption of NFC technology in Sri Lanka's banking sector.Dialog first introduced NFC touch technology to Sri Lanka in 2012 with the Touch Fuel Card. In 2013, Dialog introduced the NFC powered Touch Travel Pass and the Smart Sticker, enabling customers to conduct transactions with a simple touch.

COPE should inquire Templeton fund transactions: Harsha
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) should investigate the transactions carried out between the US-based Franklin Templeton Fund and the Central Bank in the past, Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva said.
De Silva confirmed that close to US$500 million have been taken out from Sri Lanka during the past two months.
Templeton Fund has taken out funds close to US$900 million in the latter part of last year. Almost US$ 500 million have been taken out within the last two months, de Silva said.
Its true that about 1,400 million dollars that were there from a long time have taken out from Sri Lanka. But its not an isolated incident there is a background to that.
De Silva accused the last regime over not holding any inquiry into charges made by them about the Templeton Fund and Central Bank. Analysts say over 10 Templeton funds owned more than 80 percent of bonds available to foreign investors at one point.
Last regime didnt inquire on these issues. At one instance, the Monetary Board decided to keep interest rates stable, then took money from Templeton. After few days the interest rates reduced, he said.
For Templetons money, last regime even kept the rupee artificially over valued and let people suffered. This economy was steered according to the needs of Templeton Fund and those controlled the Central Bank at that time.
We even remember how rupee was depreciated in 2012 Valentines Day. So we need to go back and the COPE should find out how these transactions happened. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake recently confirming that the Templeton Fund had taken out 1,475 million US dollars out of Sri Lanka within a period of 14 months said it is because the US Dollar has been devalued by 0.25 percent.

The Consumer Affairs Authority CAA claimed legal victory over one of the largest cosmetic contraband stocks ever to be nailed in the country.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen has commended CAA officials over phone for the legal victory and also on two other raids by CAA (on match boxes and steel rods). Good work by CAA and the alert officers for this achievement and also on quickly raiding sub-standard match box makers and steel rod makers, the Minister said.

CAA officials also said that they are planning to destroy the stock next week in the presence of a courts official.
On a tip-off, on March 9 CAA also raided a manufacturer of match boxes who produced 28,080 match boxes valued more than Rs 100,000, thus netting Sri Lankas largest ever sub-standard match box haul in recent times from Nittambuwa. CAA found that they were made without completing the mandatory Sri Lanka Standards (SLS) requirements. The suspects are to be produced at Attanagalle Courts on March 17.
The CAA also raided a steel and iron rod maker in Hekitta, Wattala claimed to have manufactured 40 tonnes of iron rods (QST bars) in three sizes (10mm, 12 mm, and 16 mm) but identified by CAA as producing only 12 mm rods despite claiming three sizes, while also allegedly in lower standards than mandatory SLS requirements.

Diabetes affects seven to ten percent of pregnancies
Sri Lanka has excellent health indicators, but diabetes has affected seven to ten percent of pregnancies. Around 70 percent of them are gestational diabetes, Health Services acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said the marriageable age of Sri Lankan women has come down to 23, but women who expect to become pregnant should get themselves screened for diabetes and other Non Communicable Diseases.
According to Dr. Bandara, the maternal death rate in Sri Lanka has come down to 33 deaths per every 100,000, but infants with congenital defects can be born to mothers with uncontrolled diabetes.
Meanwhile, Health Education Bureau sources said the prevalence of diabetes in Sri lanka is around 10.3 percent. When a pregnant mother gets diabetes, the chance of developing the disease in her in next five to 10 years is 50 percent, the sources said.

Dinesh got it coming
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, perhaps, would have been the custodian of parliament in recent memory who has had to endure the worst kind of brickbats, nay invective, from a section of his charges representing the Opposition. Since he assumed the mantle of Speaker of Parliament, in August 2015, to say that Jayasuriya has been wearing a crown of thorns, would indeed be an understatement. Since that day, he has been at the receiving end of scorn, and sometimes vilification, of the worst kind, from the members of the Joint Opposition, for refusing to dance to their tune.
Many have been the instances where his podium had been invaded by the JO hordes, virtually baying for his blood, for not giving rulings in their favour. Wednesday was no different, when the worst kind of rowdysm was witnessed among members of the JO, who, not only defied the ruling of the Chair but resorted to name calling of the Speaker which was unprecedented to say the least. Their grouse; one of their stalwarts, namely Wimal Weerawansa, being overruled in his demand to be recognized as the leader of a political party that has severed its ties with the UPFA, under which banner, the party contested the last General Election. The Speaker's decision, which was arrived at in terms of the rule book, was not to the liking of the Joint Opposition, and WW in particular, who went berserk using unparliamentary, nay, unprintable language, in the August Assembly. The now familiar stampede to the Speaker's podium, to grab the Mace, predictably followed, forcing a multiple suspension of sittings and eventually the Police been summoned to evict a JO member, nay, its parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena who was making a spectacle of himself in the House, coming to the rescue of his beleaguered colleague, eventually earning for himself one week's suspension from sittings.
It was unbecoming for a politician of the calibre of Dinesh Gunawardena, who boasts of a rich political pedigree, to have conducted himself the way he did in the chambers of parliament. One would have thought that, years of being a parliamentarian, and a leader of a political party (MEP), he would have acted with more maturity and set an example to his junior colleagues. But on Wednesday Gunawardena disported himself as just another garden politician, keen to play to the gallery, for cheap political gain. This was hardly the Gunawardena stock, which the public, particularly the old timers, have come to know although father Phillip himself was a robust and rumbustious politician lionized by his constituents of the Hewagam Korale.
Blood curdling screams, the gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair, to express a point of view, is not going to elevate Dinesh Gunawardena to the ranks of his more illustrious forebears, particularly as the leader of the MEP. No. He will only be reducing himself to the level of politicians of the calibre of Wimal Weerawansa and Mahindananda Aluthgamage. True, there have been numerous instances when boisterous MPs were evicted from parliament in the past. But these disruptions were not deliberate intentions to disrupt parliament and there was no vicious taunts hurled at the Speaker. But what the public have been witnessing during the last two years is a systematic attempt to throw parliament proceedings into disarray, by deliberate attempts at disruption. The demand made by Wimal Weerawansa fits into this pattern. By virtue of being political party leader he will have the privilege of making Special Statements in parliament willy nilly, in addition to raising objections and protests at party leaders meetings. Not just WW, Vasudeva, Udaya Gammanpila and Chandrasiri Gajadeera, who are leaders of the NSSP, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and the Communist Party, respectively would want to be recognized similarly and make special statements on a daily basis, and kick up rows in the process, not permitting a smooth running of parliament.
Be that as it may, the Speaker should resolve to deal firmly with members, who willfully disrupt parliament businesses, in the future. As has been pointed out, Rs. 4.6 million is spent by the public for each day's sittings of parliament and they naturally, expect value for money. MPs storming the Speakers podium and running away with the Mace and trading insults across the floor is not what they expect their money to be used for. True, parliament should be a place for robust debate and the parry and thrust, that was a hallmark of parliaments of old, when men and women of quality and standing graced the August Assembly. But, many would agree that what we are witnessing today is an abomination, where parliament is akin to an arena of the gladiators.
It was from the likes of Dinesh Gunawardena that much would have been expected to turn things around and help restore the dignity of this premier people's forum. Sadly though, the scion of Boralugoda had apparently chosen to throw in his lot with the riffraff, that has not only marred the illustrious name he bears but also called into question the political views he espouses.

'Game of Thrones' Season 7 premiere date unveiled after reveal stunt hits snag

HBO has finally announced the premiere date for "Game of Thrones" Season 7, much to the relief of the show's followers who lit Twitter on fire after tuning into a glitch-filled Facebook Live.
The new season will premiere July 16.
The announcement came after a bumpy attempt to make the premiere date reveal a bit of an event.
HBO had arranged to break the news during a Facebook Live on Thursday afternoon.
Eager fans who tuned in were greeted by a block of ice and instructed to leave comments -- specifically the word "fire" -- in order to melt the ice and reveal the premiere date.
At one point the stream had over 100,000 viewers. Nearly 15 minutes into the stunt, the live stream cut to black without revealing when the series would return.
The date was eventually unveiled in a third attempt at a live stream, which drew more than 160,000 viewers at its peak.
HBO also released a new teaser.
As previously reported, "Game of Thrones" producers had topush backproduction on the new season so they could film in a wintery setting, resulting in a later than usual start date.
"Game of Thrones" typically debuts in April, with the exception of Season 3, which dropped in late March.
Season 7 will consist of only seven episodesdown from its typical ten.

He also said that the airline is not paying for the slot they occupied in these three destinations. But as and when the performance increases we will be able to get slots back at these three destinations.
He also said that what the airline now has to do was to concentrate heavily on London which is the only connections to Europe, the national carrier has.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka Tourisms Additional Marketing Director Dushan Wickramasuriya said they hope to attract over 120 top travel journalists to Sri Lanka this year.We met them at the recently concluded IMM Journalists event on Tuesday in Berlin and invited them to visit Sri Lanka and do news items and documentaries on Sri Lanka,he said.

Hela Clothing partners with Microsoft to revitalise apparel industry
Hela Clothing, a leading apparel manufacturer, partnering with Microsoft recently, to revitalise the apparel industry.
As the shift to a more digitally enhanced manufacturing eraaccelerates, the opportunity to deliver long-term digital solutions and insights has accelerated Hela Clothings ambition for modern, secure and efficient solutions such as Microsofts Office 365 and Hyper-V platforms.
Businesses that embrace digital transformation generate materially more operating income each year than those who do not, said Brian Kealey, Managing Director for Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives.
And with Sri Lankan companies faced with evolving customer and employee expectations, its increasingly challenging to be productive without a comprehensive, board level digital transformation plan.
The partnership with Microsoft has allowed Hela Clothing to choose Office 365 over a number of others including other cloud competitors as its preferred means of collaborating and communicating in the workforce.
Furthermore, Hela Clothing opted to replace Red Hat Virtualization with Microsoft Hyper V. A platform aimed at consolidating Hela Clothings digital infrastructure to remote desktop and application virtualization systems. As a consequence, Hyper-V has increased Hela Clothings hardware utilization by consolidating servers and workloads onto fewer and more powerful physical computers.
Focusing on digital transformation with Microsofts secure and comprehensive cloud enabled platforms has played a crucial role to our success, said Thilina Samarasinghe, Group Head of IT of Hela Clothing. Now that Microsoft has reduced our capex on server hardware and increased real-time communication, productivity at Hela Clothing is at an all-time high. With Microsoft, we will remain committed to innovating and accelerating insightful intelligence across the apparel sector.
Further to the current deployment, Microsoft will continue to work with Hela Clothing to help them envision and implement more integrated platforms like Skype for Business through Microsoft Most Valuable Professional Partner, Infront Consulting Group. Country Manager for Infront Consulting, Susantha Silva added, In this context, Hela Clothing has fully leveraged the opportunities of present digital technologies to become a forerunner in the apparel industry.

Sri Lanka Police recently discovered that they may have within their ranks an officer who probably has the worlds longest name -- 14 in all -- and certainly a colleague who takes longer to fill forms.
Superintendent Hakmana Dissanayaka Wasala Bandara Amunugama Wijeratne Gunathillaka Rajanayaka Bandaralage Hakmana Walawwe Anuruddha Bandara Hakmana figured in a police statement announcing routine transfers.
Hakmana was sent to Embilipitiya Police Division from Gampola, according to Police Headquarters.
A senior officer said Hakmana with 13 initials and surname was certainly the man with the longest name in the department and could not remember any other wordy name in the 150-year history of the department.
Hakmanas 14 names would be better than the 28 of an Edinburgh man who has 28 because most of those names had been added by the man over several years unlike the Sri Lankan policeman who has a birth certificate to prove his 14 names.
It is not clear if SP Hakmana attaches a separate sheet with his full name when filling out official forms.

It is delighting to note that these celebrations in Melbourne are known to be the largest, well organised and presented National Day event staged anywhere outside Sri Lanka.
Well over seven hundred guests, largely from expatriate Sri Lankan communities in Melbourne gathered in their numbers to celebrate the event, graced by the presence of members of the clergy, parliamentarians of the Victorian Government, local government representatives, members of consular corps and community leaders.
Proceedings commenced with the National Anthem of Sri Lanka, followed by observance of two minute silence in memory of those who sacrificed their lives for the Glory of our Nation, introductory welcomes and lighting of the traditional oil lamp accompanied by chanting of Jaya Mangala Gatha.
Elegantly dressed in Lama-Sari, young Siyoda Jayawardena walked in, smiled and took control of the lectern as the compere. Welcoming the guests, she recalled the evolution of our Independence from 1948 as a self-governing Dominion, to a fully independent sovereign Nation in 1972, with the passage of new constitution which created the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka with our own Head of State. This, she stressed, was the spirit of Independence in which we gathered that evening to join the National Day celebrations of our Mathru Bhumi - Janma Bhumi Lanka. A stunning history lesson! Guests were ecstatic!
Multi-faith blessings were led by Venerable Na-Otunne Vijitha Sangha Naayaka Thera-Paada by reciting Seth-Pirith. Rev. Premakantha Kurakkal administered Hindu blessings. Rev. Dr. Ruwan Palapathwala conducted Christian prayers and Mr. Omar Haniffa, Islamic prayers.

The cultural presentation was ushered in by Sri Lankan Cultural Ensemble of Australia and Janali Dance Academy through their presentation of  Asaddrusha Vannama, a dance routine drawn from the Kandyan tradition extolling the virtues of the Buddha. This was followed by Natarajah Anjali, a cosmic dance in praise of Lord Shiva drawn from Bharatha Natyam repertoire, and presented by Nrithakshethra School of Classical Dance . Dig Gei was presented by Rangana Udumbara Dance Troupe. Sabaragamuwa tradition. It was about young maidens invoking the blessings of God Saman, the guardian deity of the sacred precincts of Sri Pada.

More US states challenge Trump travel ban

Three US states have joined Hawaii in a legal challenge against President Donald Trump's revised travel ban.
Trump signed an executive order placing a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim countries on Monday.
New York maintains the new directive is a ban on Muslims while Washington says it is harmful to the state. Oregon and Massachusetts later also joined.
The ban begins on March 16, with the White House saying it is "very confident" of winning in court.
Trump's original order was more expansive but it was defeated after a legal challenge initially mounted by Washington and Minnesota.
What states this time and why
Oregon- said the order hurts residents, employers, universities health care system and economy
Washington- it has "same illegal motivations as the original" and harms residents, although fewer than the first ban
New York- "a Muslim ban by another name", said the attorney general
Massachusetts- new ban "remains a discriminatory and unconstitutional attempt to make good on his campaign promise to implement a Muslim ban"
Hawaii- argued it would harm its Muslim population, tourism and foreign students
The revised ban bars new visas for people from: Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen. It also temporarily blocks all refugees.
The previous order, which Trump signed in January, was blocked in federal courts and sparked mass protests as well as confusion at airports.
But critics maintain the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims.
"President Trump's latest executive order is a Muslim ban by another name, imposing policies and protocols that once again violate the Equal Protection Clause and Establishment Clause of the United State Constitution," said New York Attorney General Eric T Schneiderman after announcing his legal challenge.
Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who was the first to sue over the original ban, said he would ask a federal judge to rule that the temporary restraining order halting the first travel ban "remains in effect".
"We're asserting that the president cannot unilaterally declare himself free of the court's restraining order and injunction," he said.
Though the White House has faced mounting criticism over its immigration orders, Trump supporters say the president is fulfilling his campaign promises to protect Americans.
What is different about the new order
Citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the other six countries on the original 27 January order, will once more be subject to a 90-day travel ban.
Iraq has been taken off the banned list because its government has boosted visa screening and data sharing, White House officials said.
The new directive says refugees already approved by the State Department can enter the US. It also lifts an indefinite ban on all Syrian refugees.
Green Card holders (legal permanent residents of the US) from the named countries will not be affected.
The new order does not give priority to religious minorities, unlike the previous directive.
Critics of the Trump administration had argued that this was an unlawful policy showing preference to Christian refugees.

Co-chairmen former MP Muththu Sivalingam and Kotmale UNP Chief Organiser Asoka Herath presided.
Senanayake said cultivation of land above the 5,000 feet level had caused a shortage of water for cultivations below.
Additional Forest Range Officer Bandara Galagoda said his department will take legal action against those responsible for cultivations on land above the 5,000 ft level since such cultivations destroy the forest cover.
He said the Land Reform Commission (LRC) acquired some land belonging to the Forest Department. This was denied by the LRC representative who said that only the land demarcated belonged to his department. Asoka Herath said the LRC owned a limited amount of land in Kotmale. Allocation of large slices of land ranging from eight to 10 acres to a single person was unfair as other needy persons would be denied of land.
A proposal by Asoka Herath to build 50 trade stalls in a section of Kotmale new town lying idle and hand them over to 50 unemployed youths to start a business of their own and to build a reception hall with a seating capacity of 500 was also approved by the committee.

National Development Bank is now nearing completion of the Banks new strategic plan, devised by brainstorming inputs from all the divisions of the Bank and its group companies.
We are excited about the future that lies ahead where we are determined to strive and reach our full potential. In reaching these goals, raising additional capital to meet the Basel III requirements and to support the growing franchise would be a key strategic priority, National Development
Bank Chief Executive Officer Dimantha Seneviratne told shareholders in banks annual report 2016.
Given the backdrop of rising interest rates and uncertainties in the leasing industry, retail banking witnessed a subdued portfolio growth the year under review. On the other hand, mortgage backed housing loans were boosted by a growth in real estate development, an area focused on actively. A creative niche has been the tri-partite arrangements, where project financing for upper middle class real estate projects are coupled with loans to buyers of apartments.
Though credit cards saw a less than expected growth, the bank is fully aware of the importance of a strong credit card offering in the retail banking space, and the bank has been constantly improving its presence in this sector.
This will be one of our focal points in the coming year.Despite the challenging environment, we continued to maintain a healthy asset book and a strong credit quality. Our credit underwriting standards remained robust as reflected by our non performing loan ratio which continued to be below the industry average, he said adding that the bank believes that there is tremendous entrepreneurial potential at the provincial and grass root levels.
Through the Banks SME and micro-finance programmes, it continues to leverage this potential and offer our competencies in order to empower the small scale entrepreneurs.
We believe that technological advancement in our offerings is a mandatory constituent for our future success. Moving in to digital channels will gain priority in our new strategy that is being drafted.
Considering our existing balance between fund and fee based income, we have some distance to go. Our future focus will be on products and services which give more value to the customer and where we can enhance our revenues by way of fee income.
He further added that the banks ratio of deposits in current and savings accounts (CASA deposits) to total deposits, which is an indicator of the cost of funds, is relatively lower compared to the industry average. (IH)
