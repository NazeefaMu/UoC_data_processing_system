Great day: Hamilton cruises to French GP win, reclaims championship lead
Le Castellet, Sunday: A masterful Lewis Hamilton powered back to the top of the world championship Sunday when he roared to a polished lights-to-flag win for Mercedes at the French Grand Prix.
The four-time world champion, making the most of his upgraded Mercedes engine, led from start to finish, bar one lap following a pit stop, as he claimed his first win in France, his third this year and the 65th of his career.
This is a great day, said reigning champion Hamilton. I enjoyed the race, for me the best French Grand Prix I have ever had. The weather was great, too, and the fans were really enthusiastic.
I am so grateful to my guys for a solid weekend. My guys continuously push the boundaries and they never give up.
Hamilton came home seven seconds clear of Max Verstappen with Kimi Raikkonen taking third for Ferrari after passing his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo with five laps remaining.
Hamiltons consummate performance came after fellow four-time champion and pre-race leader Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari crashed into his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas on the opening lap.
Both suffered damage and, under an early Safety Car, limped to the pits for repairs.
They rejoined from the back of the field to finish fifth and seventh respectively, either side of Kevin Magnussen of Haas, who was sixth.
Vettel had to serve a five seconds penalty, which he took at his second pit stop.
It was my mistake, conceded Vettel. My start was too good and I ended up with nowhere to go. I tried to brake early and had no room.
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said: It was a misjudgement from Sebastian because it ruined his race as well. The floor of Valtteris car was destroyed.
Hamilton now leads Vettel, who had a wayward race, by 14 points in the championship after the first French event for a decade and the first at Le Castellet since 1990.
I hadnt thought about that, but that is where I want to be, he said afterwards, when he was later critical of Vettel for his crash with Bottas.
On seeing a video recording of the incident, he said: He took him right out - ah, man, thats crazy.
He added that a five seconds penalty was too lenient, an opinion shared by many including Mercedes non-executive director Niki Lauda.
Why Vettel gets only five seconds for this enormous mistake I dont understand, said the three-time world champion. Its too little. Five seconds is nothing. He destroyed the whole race for himself and for Bottas.AFP

Import tax on fruits will be increased from July
The government had formulated a lasting programme to subject the entire country to a rapid development mechanism and to bring development dividends to everyone, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made these remarks while addressing supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in Polonnaruwa, yesterday.
The development mechanism would identify the pulse rate of the entire nation and it was not a mere show-off simply to make certain people happy. The special development programme would pave the way for Sri Lankans to stand on their feet with prestige, the President said.
President Sirisena noted that the governments policy was to give top-priority to local produce and to provide a helping hand to entrepreneurs to achieve success.
As a remedy to protect the local fruit producer, action had to be taken to increase import tax on fruits. It would be implemented from July, the President said.
Taking another step under the move to give more value to local fruits and their producers, a ban on cutting down certain types of fruit trees, named by Agriculture Department officers and experts in the sector, would also be imposed.
President Sirisena said the Grama Shakthi programme, introduced to do away with poverty of people, is at present, in full-swing throughout the country. In addition to the Grama Shakthi programme, another programme under the name Gamperaliya would also be implemented countrywide in due course, aiming to address poverty.
The government had taken measures to introduce a new soft loan scheme for entrepreneurial development.
The loan scheme would be an ideal solution to curtail the unemployment rate as well as to increase local production.

Cochlear Implant Switch launched at Kandy General Hospital
Medical tourism growing in Sri Lanka
The launched of the first Cochlear Implant Switch at the Kandy General Hospital took place last week making Sri Lanka to become the future hub in the field of Audiology to gain foreign exchange to Sri Lanka.
The globe medical tourism market is growing and Sri Lanka is now in a position to offer this facility to the region. We can now attract foreigners not only from the SAARC but other countries to come and use this facility enabling the country to get additional foreign exchange, he said.
Prior to the switch the first ever Cochlear Implant Surgeries at the Kandy general/ teaching hospital was successfully done on May 2018 by ENT surgeons Dr. W. M. C. Narampanawe and Dr. A. D. K. S. N. Yasawardene.
The recipients of the Implants are 15 year old H.G Amali Lakshika Wickramarathne and 30 year old M.W.G.R. Thakshila.
Wickramarachchi Institute of Speech and Hearing (WISH) headed by J. M. Wickramaarachchi who is the pioneer in the field of Audiology for the past 40 years said that the government together with his institute has been funding Cochlear Implants for free since 2012.
We also sponsored ENT specialist to Australia for training and today Sri Lanka is able to offer this technology to the region to open us a new health market to Sri Lanka.
Colombo and Sirimavo Bandaranaike Specialized Children Hospital in Peradeniya have been providing Cochlear Implants and performing the surgeries for over half a decade with the support of J. M. Wickramaarachchi.
However, in these past two years many other government and semi government hospitals are also conducting CI surgeries. These include the National hospital Colombo, Batticaloa teaching hospital, Anuradhapura teaching hospital, Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital and now the Kandy teaching hospital.
With their clear commitment to technological innovation and providing the best service and facilities to the people of Sri Lanka, they have managed to successfully complete over 600+ Cochlear Implants in both private and government sector.
This achievement has been possible due to the hard work and dedication of mainly the ENT surgeons, who have given new hope and beginnings to the deaf community of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is now rated as one of the best Cochlear Implant programs in Asia. However, the main credit has to be given to the ministry of health and the team of government officials who have worked towards making Hearing a reality by free access to Cochlear implants to those hearing impaired individuals who once used to think that this procedure was out of reach for them.
Dr. Yasawardene is one of the world class ENT surgeons who is highly experienced in Cochlear Implants and is now selected to be one of the master trainers globally. He now train other ENT surgeons around the island.
The Cochlear pvt Ltd in association with Macquarie University, Sydney Australia and J. M Wickramarachchi, Sri Lanka provides yearly training programs in Sydney to local ENT surgeons to master their surgical skills specializing in Cochlear Implants.

My words were wrongly taken
The Most Ven Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Champter said it was regrettable to see that the words Hitler and Military he used in a dhammadesana during a dana pinkama to mark Gotabhaya Rajapaksas birthday being taken out of context by certain main political leaders in the country to say that he had made a statement unbecoming of a Bhikkhu.
The Anunyake Thera in a statement issued on June 23 said the dhammadesana delivered by him in the presence of leading Nayaka Theras in Colombo, Mahinda Rajapaksa and several government and opposition political leaders, lasted about 30 minutes. Taking one word of it in isolation to interpret its overall meaning is like a blind man feeling the elephants tail and comparing the elephant to a broomstick, the Anunuayake Thera said.
The essence of my discourse was,t I would call upon you to develop the country even by being a Hitler.
What I meant was that there should be strict policies in administering a country and I never meant that there should be a cruel administration that kills people like Hitler did. the Thera said.

Pawternity leave
A Norwegian pet supply company is giving employees paid time off to bond with their new pets.
Musti Group, described as the largest pet supply company in the Nordic countries w ith more than 1,500 employees, began offering pawternity leave to employees, which consists of three paid days off when they acquire a new puppy or kitten.
Musti Group CEO David Rnnberg says the first few days a puppy is in a new home are vital to getting used to its new owner and environment
Depending on the needs of each pet, the first days spent together can be rather intense, and sleepless nights are more than familiar to recent pet parents, Rnnberg said in a statement.
A baby animal requires constant attention and unconditional love. Paying attention to a pets needs and spending time with them supports their learning, builds trust and helps prevent behavioral disorders in the future.
Henri Mkinen, the marketing director of Musti Group, said other companies should offer their employees pawternity leave because its good for the pets well-being.
Puppy socialization and training cant happen during evenings or weekends alone.
A puppy might feel both insecure and lost in their new home, without the presence of their mother and siblings, Mkinen said. If a pet is left alone for too long, they will find all sorts of things to do -- not all of them necessarily pleasant to the owner. UPI

Some groups waiting to restart corrupt practices
Some groups are waiting for an opportunity to recommence their long-practised corruption being unable to stand the sustainable corruption-free development process initiated by the yahapalana government, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He said that the development programme initiated by the government is not done forcibly, but with the approval of the people. Some people cannot tolerate this type of development, Minister Ranawaka said. The behaviour of government servants is one of the main hindrances of the countrys development programme.
Minister Ranawaka further said that yahapalana was established by the government for public servants to render their services efficiently. Public servants should not slow down development programmes. When land for a development programme is needed, it takes unwarranted time to complete the procedures at the divisional secretariats.
The Minister made these observations during the opening ceremony of Kelimandala, the first-ever park for differently-abled children set up at Boralesgamuwa. The park, constructed within the Boralesgamuwa Development Zone under the Weras Ganga Storm Water Drainage and Environment Improvement Project implemented by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, was opened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Minister Ranawaka further said that nearly one percent of children are differently-abled and they should be provided with special areas in the urban areas. He added adults can accompany differently-abled children to the Kelimandala park.
He also said that a similar park would be set up in the Kottawa area in the near future.
A mono rail line would also be introduced to Piliyandala from Colombo to minimise traffic congestion. However, these projects cannot be implemented immediately, Minister Ranawaka said. The expressways were designed in 1968, though they were constructed during the previous regime. But some attempt to take the credit for these constructions. I challenge those people to show a single public institution that they developed. They bankrupted all the institutions they took over.
Minister Ranawaka said that now these public institutions have begun to earn profits, while rendering a commendable service to the people. He pointed out during the previous regime, lands in Colombo had been given to foreign institutions free of charge, which this government does not do. He asserted that this government has not granted a single plot of land to foreign institutions free of charge.

UNOPS to help Sri Lanka reach excellence in health procurement
The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) collaborated with the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry to assist the Ministry to achieve excellence in health procurement.
As a first step to achieve this goal, UNOPS facilitated a two-day training on health procurement, focusing on strengthening the technical capacity of key health procurement policy and decision-makers of the Ministry, primarily responsible for procurement of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.
This workshop was held from June 18  19 at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo. The training was facilitated by a team of four UNOPS expert trainers and was attended by 40 government officials. A unique aspect of the workshop was that enabled participants to integrate these learnings to their day-to-day challenges of health procurement with discussions on real case studies useful to their work.
Presenting his opening remarks, UNOPS Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Sudhir Muralidharan highlighted the importance of efficiency in public procurement and UNOPS capacity to enhance the procurement services in the Health Ministry and the Sri Lankan Government.
UNOPS is thrilled to join hands with the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry, to work towards excellence in health procurement in Sri Lanka. We are readily available to share our expertise and good practice to enhance the quality and efficiency of Sri Lankas public procurement processes, Muralidharan said.
UNOPS Asia Region Senior Advisor and Deputy to the Regional Director Simonetta Siligato was also present at the workshops inauguration.
In Sri Lanka, public procurement represents around 15 percent of the total GDP, while around three percent of the total GDP is allocated to the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry for provision of quality healthcare facilities. The ministry spends approximately 30 percent of its allocation as capital expenditure through procurement. Therefore, it is essential for the ministry to ensure that their procurement processes are made efficient.
Speaking at the training, Health Ministry Additional Development Secretary S. Janaka Sri Chandraguptha highlighted: we in Sri Lanka provide the best healthcare free-of-charge for the betterment of our people and achieved several records in the world arena To complete all health procurements in time, all the officers should be well-versed with procurement rules and regulations and engage in the activities enthusiastically. I believe that this training can enhance their capacity to overcome the challenges of health procurement successfully.
The training was carried out in three areas, which included pre-purchasing, purchasing and post-purchasing. Within the two days, they examined case studies, discussed issues in government procurement processes and shared lessons learnt from UNOPS procurement processes. The training also included sharing knowledge and good practice used of the UNOPS e-sourcing system, UN Global Market and WeBuyPlus.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa distributed certificates of completion to the participants and noted that the ministry would explore possibility of engaging further with UNOPS.
Ministry officials further requested UNOPS to conduct more training programmes at provincial and regional levels, to strengthen procurement processes at all levels in order to better enhance the quality of healthcare services in the country.

The Minister said non-communicable diseases are responsible for 70 percent of deaths in the world and Sri Lanka too has the same percentage. "We have to reduce the numbers of people with non-communicable diseases," Minister Senaratne said.
"This requires physical exercise.
There is no point of loosing only body weight. One has to drop the tummy fat too," he said.
The Minister said the Health Ministry has already established 1,500 Suwadivi Centres, and Suwanari Centres at government hospitals to diagnose noncommunicable diseases.
He said the concept, "family doctor" will be established in the country. "One doctor would be appointed to 5,000 people and their health condition would be recorded.
The programme would commence in August. USD 200 million was granted by the World Bank in this regard.
The Minister appreciated the SLMA's endeavour to reduce obesity among people.
The winners of the walk were granted gifts. Over 2,000 people participated in the walk.
National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie, Parliamentarians Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Thusitha Wijemanna, office bearers and SLMA members participated.

Although Ven.

The Thera said the statement made by the Anunuayake Thera was most unbecoming and never expected from even a novice samanera.
Even samaneras were expected to make statements subject to their tutors without causing disrepute to the Sasana, the Thera said.
A majority of people would condemn the alleged statement made by a leading prelate such as Ven. Upali Thera, Ven. Sumedha Nayaka Thera said.
People were fully aware of cruelties and oppression inflicted by Hitler during his iron rule. Bhikkhus ought to deliver anusasanas to laymen in a more disciplined manner upholding religious and national values, the Anunayake said.

[APPRECIATIONS - (25-06-2018)]
Prof. Laksiri Jayasuriya
Ardent egalitarian
Emeritus Professor Laksiri Jayasuriya, who was professor of Social Work and Social Policy at the University of Western Australia, passed away on April 20, 2018, in Perth. He was the founder of the Sociology Department at the University of Colombo and led an eminent career in the Australian academia, while contributing to government policy-making processes in areas such as multiculturalism, ethnic affairs, immigration and citizenship.
He nurtured cohorts of students under his care during his long career in Australia and continued to engage in scholarly activities and publishing after retirement. Professor Jayasuriya leaves behind beloved wife Rohini and two loving sons Kanishka and Pradeep, both professionals; one in the academic and the other in the medical field. His death was a great loss to his colleagues, relatives, friends and former students in Australia and Sri Lanka.
Laksiri was born on October 27, 1931, in Ceylon, during the British colonial period. He was the eldest in a family of three. His father was a prison medical doctor and mother was from a wealthy family. He received his primary and secondary school education at the Royal College, Colombo, from 1945 to 1951. It was then an institution that trained civil servants for the colonial government of Ceylon. He participated in the debating team at Royal College, which included figures such as Felix Dias Bandaranaike (later, Finance and Public Administration Minister) and Mervin de Silva (later, reputed journalist).
Following the trend at the time of the English-educated elites who sent their children for higher studies in Cambridge or Oxford, Laksiri also wanted to follow the same path. However, through an encounter with Professor A. P. Elkin (father of Peter Elkin, an English professor at the University of New England, Australia) during a visit to Colombo, the opportunity arose for Laksiri to go to Australia for tertiary studies. He proceeded to Sydney in 1951, to begin his Bachelors degree as a private student by a ship called
Himalaya and became a resident of the Wesley College.
In Sydney, he was with a cohort of students who occupied influential positions in Australia and overseas in later years (David Walker interview 2012). He studied for a Bachelors degree between 1951 and 1954 at the University of Sydney and later received a degree in Psychology (Hons.) in 1954, with first-class and the University Medal. Laksiri studied History, Psychology and Anthropology. After completing the degree in 1954, he was offered a teaching fellowship at the Department of Psychology during the same year, by the Sydney University. He was one of the first academically-trained psychologists in Sri Lanka. Laksiri was 23 years old at the time.
He had a left orientation and political consciousness despite his elite education from the Royal College days. Sri Lanka had a strong Trotskyite group at the time and he was influenced by their social ideology and political activities. In Sydney, he had a close relationship with David Ross, a senior student at Wesley and the son of a communist party trade unionist. Laksiris contemporaries included Hedley Bull who later became a professor of International Relations and Jim Wolfensohn who became the President of the World Bank.
His teacher Prof. W. M. ONeil had a great influence on him in terms of scholarship and academia than anyone else (David Walker interview 2012).Laksiri accepted a full-time, permanent academic appointment at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, in 1956. Having trained as a social psychologist, he joined the Sociology Department where at that time, included Ralph Pieris, Stanley Thambiah and Gannanth Obeyesekera, all of whom contributed and taught subjects such as sociology and anthropology overseas. At the time, the department was arguably the best within the Faculty of Arts; an institution that was well regarded in Asia. He influenced a generation of students at the University, some of whom went to make substantial contributions in the academic and political spheres.
The campus was a site of creative intellectual endeavour as well as of robust debate over academic and political issues. Laksiri built strong friendships with people such as K. N. Jayatilleke, Professor of Philosophy and J. E. Jayasuriya, Professor of Education. He was an active participant in the academic debates and was remembered fondly for his contributions by his colleagues and students.
Laksiri returned to the University of New South Wales, Sydney, in 1969, on a Leverhulme Fellowship and delivered lectures in the departments of Psychology and Social Work. This was after he spent time at Berkley University on a Fulbright Scholarship.
Laksiri was asked to give the prestigious guest of honour address on the sweeping victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in 1970. This led to a productive series of publications on Sri Lankan elections until 2010 that covered broader social contexts. He published a book on the Changing Face of Sri Lankas Electoral Politics in 2012, nine years after his retirement.
Laksiri pursued a postgraduate study at the London School of Economics and Political Science between 1957 and 1960, securing a PhD in Social Psychology. In 1969, he became the foundation professor in the Sociology and Social Welfare Department at the University of Colombo and developed the academic programme particularly with a concern to analyse the emerging contemporary social challenges as well as policies. He later became Dean of the Faculty of Arts. He was particularly proud of contributing to establishing the workers' education programme at the Colombo University.
In 1974, Laksiri was appointed foundation professor of Social Work and Social Administration (later Social Work and Social Policy) at the University of Western Australia (UWA), Perth. He was the first Asian professor there and one of the first Asians to be appointed to a professorial position at an Australian University. During his academic career at UWA, he was the head of department (1971 to 1990) and the Centre of Asian Studies Director (1989 1992). Between 1970 and 1971, he was the Social Sciences Faculty's Dean.
He was a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and the Australian Academy of Social Sciences and was also an honorary member of the Australian Association of Social Workers. He became an Emeritus professor and a senior honorary research fellow at the same university in 1993, marking the end of his full-time teaching and research career. Between 1993 and 1994, he served in the capacity of a Senior Fellow of Development Studies at Edith Cowan University, Perth. Laksiri was never one to slow down. He continued his academic work after retirement in close-association with the University of Western Australia in an honorary capacity, until his health began to deteriorate. The energy and enthusiasm he showed for the subjects that he examined, was extraordinary. He was truly blessed with high intellect and a vast reservoir of knowledge covering both Eastern and Western social traditions and philosophies.
In the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's, Laksiri played an active role in various state and federal government advisory bodies and reviews in Australia, dealing with areas such as multicultural education, language services and ethnic affairs.
He was appointed to the Immigration Advisory Council by the Whitlam Labour government (1972 to 1975). During 1973 to 1975, he was on the Federal Government Committee on Community Relations as well as the Migrant Task Force of the West Australian Government. He was the chair of the National Advisory and Coordinating Committee on Multicultural Education (NACCME) (1984 to 1987) and the National Multicultural Advisory Council (NMAC) (1996 to 1997). Laksiri served on the Anti-Racism Reference Group of the West Australian Government from 2001 to 2007.
Those roles highlight some of the key points of his significant contributions to policy-making, review and advisory services. Through those roles, he elevated himself to be a spokesperson for the immigrant and ethnic communities whose needs and interests had to be looked after by way of effective government policies and programmes. He was one of the key architects of the multicultural policy in Australia. His policy and academic contributions emphasised the importance of a political concept called pluralistic citizenship involving political rights as opposed to the narrow and tokenistic concept of cultural diversity associated with cultural, linguistic or ethnic identity.
Laksiris Academic career at the University of Western Australia was highly productive in terms of teaching, supervision of postgraduate students, research and publications from 1971 to 1993. He was elected Fellow of the Australian Social Science Academy and later became a Fellow in the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and The British Psychological Society. In recognition of his services, he received the Member of the Order of Australia Award from the Federal Government of Australia in 1984. In the 1980's and 1990's, Laksiri published papers and books on contemporary policy issues.
He co-edited a book on Legacies of White Australia focusing on race, culture and nation (2005) and another book titled Transforming a White Australia: Issues of Racism and Immigration (2012). There are a significant number of book chapters, monographs, journal articles and occasional papers to his credit. During his long and productive career, Laksiri also published books, monographs and articles focusing on Sri Lankas social development, as well as Welfarism and Politics (2000). The latter is a book used by postgraduate students researching on the way Sri Lanka turned away from a welfare state to a warfare state and the emergence of hybrid regimes that contained both democratic and authoritarian elements.
A significant part of his academic work examined issues of social policy and electoral politics in Sri Lanka. He was particularly interested in the way social policies helped to shape new patterns of class formation and conflict in Sri Lanka. His book Taking Social Development Seriously (2010) was a synopsis of many of his key ideas on those issues. He was interested and disappointed in the way neo-liberal policies over the last decades dismantled or impoverished some of those programmes. He had a keen interest in the electoral politics of Sri Lanka and analysed election results after national elections and published papers in 2001 and 2002.
In the latter stage of his life, Laksiri focused on Buddhist Philosophy, which his father also had shown a keen interest in. He published an article on Buddhist Humanism for the Asian Century in the International Journal of Buddhist Thought and Culture (2011) and a book titled Reflections on Buddhist Social Philosophy (2014). He was the founding President of the West Australian Buddhist Society.
Professor Jayasuriyas published work is available online and his personal papers are now available through the National Library of Australia for those interested in the focus and depth of his academic work.
It is a fitting tribute to a tireless academic, an advocate of immigrant and ethnic rights, a policy advisor, humanist and influential figure in the Australian policy context. Condolence messages received from the WA Government as well as former and current ministers of Multicultural and Immigration Affairs reflect his standing in the Australian community.
He was a giver as one of his friends has remarked in the Guest Book maintained by the West Australian newspaper. He had a vision or concept of inclusive multicultural citizenship within a just and egalitarian society in both Australian and Sri Lanka. He was disappointed by recent shifts in politics in both countries, but he never lost hope in the struggle for a just, democratic and pluralistic society.
Laksiri's relatives, colleagues, friends and former students fondly remember him as an intellectual with roots in Sri Lanka as well as a humanist who carried strong academic credentials and high ethical standards.
May he rest in peace!

Kumarini Wickramasuriya
A steadfast soul
So many words of appreciation have been written about the incomparable and multi-faceted Kumi Wickramasuriya who touched the lives of many. She is an inspiration to people on so many different fronts. I count myself as one of the fortunate people who came to be part of her life. She was the closest friend of my mother-in-law, Neiliya Perera and besides his parents, the person who has known my husband, Milinda, the longest. She was there for his mothers confinement, to help her out with her firstborn. The rare and special friendship of my mother-in-law and Kumi radiated its love and influence to all around them and made us all the stronger for it. I have long-cherished and admired Kumi, who has meant so much to all of us in our family.
It is hard to remember Kumi without thinking of her husband, Sena Wickramasuriya; renaissance man, doctor and deep-sea diver, who chose to live in Tangalle rather than Colombo. Sena was equally at ease with fisherfolk as with his peers and was a much-revered figure in Tangalle. He helped build the Tangalle fisheries harbour to the extent of carrying rocks and diving to inspect the site when he served as the Harbours Corporation Chairman in the early 1970's. Although Kumi carried many deep traditions and ties to her de Mel and Moratuwa heritage, after her marriage, Tangalle gradually became the new core of her life and purpose.
Milinda and I spent part of our honeymoon in Tangalle with Kumi and Sena. I still remember how Kumi had prepared an oil lamp for us and how charmed I was with their oasis in Tangalle replete with exotic fish aquariums everywhere, diving equipment, warm company, scintillating conversations, gourmet food and classical music, surrounded by Kumis exquisite garden and the aromas from her famous kitchen floating in the air. She also created a special cake for us on our first wedding anniversary which she donned the Mimosa. At that time, Kumi was commuting between Tangalle and Colombo as a consultant to the Maliban top shelf bakery, putting her culinary skills to good use. Kumi was talented in all she touched and brought so much beauty and genuine joy to life in everything she did.
After Senas untimely death, Kumis world fell apart. Alone, a woman in a remote village far away from her closest family and friends in Colombo, she took the brave decision to remain in Tangalle. In Senas memory she embarked upon a venture that they had often spoken of starting. The organisation which she founded, aptly named Navajeevana, created new life not only for those it served, but also for Kumi. I still recall the difficult early days of Navajeevana as Kumi struggled to cope with the loss of her life partner, with her teenage son Arun to support through school and university and to adjust to her new status as a widow, founding a new enterprise with uncertain funding and little experience. I recall and witnessed how she built up Navajeevana piece by piece. Like her many friends, family members and others she had inspired, we all supported her in various ways during that long road.
Disability at that time was a taboo subject in the village, even though Hambantota was the worst afflicted area due to high levels of malnutrition and the lack of resources and facilities. Kumis hands-on approach helped to gradually erase the stigma and bring disability out into the open.
In the early days of Navajeevana, Kumi herself made field trips to remote areas of Tangalle to visit the homes of the disabled. Some of those homes lay beyond paved roads and bus routes so that part of the distance could only be reached by foot. She hired and trained college graduates from the area, providing them with hard-to-find jobs and a purpose. Kumi, in her double-cab, was a common sight in remote areas of the Hambantota district and created quite a stir. She continued her work at the height of the troubles in the late 1980's, at a time when many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) fled Tangalle. Hers was the only one permitted to operate undisturbed.
Kumi always had a strong sense of service to others, an unwavering faith in God that sustained her throughout her life and a generous spirit. Even in the most difficult of times, her faith prevailed. She often serenely remarked in wonder that someone above was looking after her. Strangely enough, small miracles seemed to occur from nowhere when she needed them the most.
It is entirely due to Kumi that Navajeevana became an indispensable community focal point and resource centre as well as a source of pride for the community. When the 2004 Tsunami struck, Navajeevana was the obvious choice as the logistical base of operations for much of the aid work in Tangalle, as the organisation had strong ties with surrounding communities and the necessary logistical competence and experience. Many better-funded and well-paying international NGOs marvelled at what she was able to achieve on a shoe-string budget with her highly motivated and trained team.
Ironically, Navajeevana had been struggling to obtain enough funds to finance its ongoing programmes such as her preschools, weekly clinics, eye camps, training of volunteers, prosthetics workshop and widening her network of clients as foreign donors began to make drastic cuts on programme funding. However, after the Tsunami, with the increasing awareness and appreciation of its activities, everyone wanted to be a part of the inspiring story of Navajeevana and there was an influx of funds that helped tide over the organisation for some time and provided Kumi with the ability to implement programmes she had envisioned. She never sat back, but kept on devising new ways to expand Navajeevanas reach.
It gave much joy to Kumi when Navajeevana was asked to design and build a disability-friendly housing scheme for fisherfolk whose houses had been destroyed in the Tsunami. Her talented architect niece, Amila de Mel, assisted Kumi in this venture. The housing scheme was held up as a model project by many local and international agencies. Always keen to encourage and empower the disabled and to find ways to bring about more public integration and awareness of disability issues, Kumi was thrilled when the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) approved of a project to set up a gift shop with local products made by the disabled as well as a tourist cafe fully manned by disabled persons at the Navajeevana headquarters.
After the end of the war, Navajeevana was drawn upon by the government to help train social workers from the North and the East.
It brought her great happiness and pride to see the hard-built knowledge and experience of Navajeevana reach beyond regional borders and the people she had trained over the years develop in competence to this high level. For many founders, it is hard to divorce yourself from your creation. However, Kumi was always balanced and responsible, knowing when to lead from the front and when to do so from behind. She let others take the credit.
Kumi was always full of new ideas and plans and had a big heart. Though it saddens me that she is no longer with us, I can only smile when I think of her, for she lived a full, meaningful and contented life, and was widely loved. One of Kumis greatest joys was to be able to take her granddaughter Ananya to spend time in Tangalle, last Christmas. Kumis legacy lives on in all her loved ones, her son Arun, his wife Kishani, her granddaughter Ananya, family members Ranjini, Amila, Hiran, Suresh and Aro, as well as her other family, friends and many others whose lives she had touched.

Mahinda Bandusena
Distinguished public servant
Mahinda Bandusena, a senior and distinguished public servant, passed away recently after a prolonged period of ill-health. What is noteworthy about the formative period of his career covering school and university, is the total reliance on the free education system and the enabling environment that it ushered.
A quintessentially village lad with practically no social props, he availed himself of the opportunities the free education system offered. He applied himself with extraordinary determination, short-circuiting the school calendar through double-promotions and commenced his university career at Peradeniya at a very young age. It is a tribute alike to his determination and innate abilities that he secured a place through a highly-competitive examination in the coveted Administrative Service.
Thereafter, he slowly but steadily advanced towards the summit of his service, serving as an Additional Defence Secretary, Industries Secretary and a Public Administration Secretary. He performed with such acceptance in this position that Minister Rathnasiri Wickremanayake, upon becoming Prime Minister, sought his services as the Prime Minister's Secretary. His career in the public service was crowned with the position of Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Israel. In every one of these positions, he gave of his best. The somewhat conducive political and administrative atmosphere that prevailed during this time, enabled him to do what is expected of an administrator, keeping political and other vultures at bay.
Although thoroughly immersed in the public service at such heights, he remained essentially a family man, ensuring that his two daughters and son ended up as medical and engineering professionals. He was singularly fortunate in the two sons-in-law and the daughter-in-law that joined his family. His wife Lalitha, his children and grandchildren sustained him especially during his unfortunate illness. The loving care with which his wife nursed him, administering a myriad of medications meticulously on time and ensuring hospital services of the highest level at frequent intervals, would stand out as a shining example of indefatigable wifely devotion and love.
It is to be hoped that his life as an administrator and family man would be an inspiration to others. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.

Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from further economic and political developments.
1Q18 GDP growth falls to 3.2% Y-o-Y
GDP growth in the 1st quarter of 2018 fell to 3.2% Y-o-Y (cf. 3.8% Y-o-Y in Q117 and 3.5% in 4Q18) due to a slowdown in the growth of the Industrial Sector despite recovery of the Agricultural sector and marginal improvement of Service Sector during the period.

Agricultural sector recorded the highest growth among all sectors (4.8% Y-o-Y) as Growing of Rice recovered with a notable 56.6% Y-o-Y growth over the period (cf. 49.6% decline last year due to adverse weather conditions).
Meanwhile Growing of Cereals, Growing of Vegetables, Growing of Tea recorded 40.2%, 22.3%, and 10.6% respectively.
Service sector activities which account for ~57% of overall GDP meanwhile improved marginally from 4.3% Y-o-Y in 1Q17 to 4.4% Y-o-Y in Q118.
Growth in the sector was driven by the Financial service activities, Wholesale and retail trade, Telecommunication, Other personal service activities, and Real estate activities, including Ownership of dwelling.
The second largest contributor, the Industrial sector, slowed down in 1Q18 (0.9% Y-o-Y growth cf. 3.7% in 1Q17) as Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products contracted 38.8% Y-o-Y whilst the Construction sector (7.4% of GDP) declined 4.9% Y-o-Y.
The CBSL projects GDP growth to recover in 2018 to 5.0% on the back of modest recovery in Agriculture sector and continued positive momentum in Services and Industrial sectors.
Earlier in April18, CBSL also eased policy rates by 25bps and held it unchanged in its 3rd Monetary Policy Review in May18.

The world is too loud
On being a writer with misophonia
A: Whats the apple doing on the sink
B: I was going to eat it earlier but then I thought it would be too noisy.
A nods, appreciatively. Returns to laptop. Inserts earplugs. Puts on headphones. Googles rainy jazz.
It was all over the news a few years back: people who get extremely distressed by specific repetitive noisesnotably mastication, respiration, keyboards clicking, cutlery scrapingmay suffer from a newly discovered condition called misophonia, or decreased sound tolerance. Something to do with salience networks in the brain going into overdrive, producing strong emotional responses that differ distinctly to the mere annoyance non-sufferers experience at the same noises; prompting a fight of flight response (aka: hyperarousal) in sufferers.
That is to say: my brain processes your pen clicking as a threat to my survival. The overwhelming urge to punch someone in the mouth and/or to flee is typical.
Undiagnosable conditions
Misophonia sounded to me like one of the many undiagnosable conditions plaguing the species, such as picky nose syndrome or bigotty mouth disease. Only a few small studies had been carried out, but the media did its amplification trick turning my family WhatsApp into an echo-chamber of suggestions that perhaps I wasnt just a tetchy feck and I had this thing all along!
But I was a tetchy feck, and a sceptic. If only two or three studies had shown correlations in the neurobiology of self-professed misophonia sufferers*, then dozens of studies with negative results would either have never made print or would have been published in low-tier journals that responsibly publish negative results and, for their service to science, go utterly ignored.
No, no. Keeping ear-plugs to hand as a diabetic keeps insulin is merely a writerly quirk. Escaping my house in a robe and slippers because of a ticking extractor fan shows my respect for Edgar Allen Poe. Getting off buses and trams and trains mid-journey and fleeing restaurants mid-meal is mad-hat creative spontaneity! Dreaming about being able to afford soundproofing only to wake up because my partners heart is beating uncivilly loudly is  passion
Forcing the orchestra to pause the rehearsal until my laughing fit is under control (a chronically flat pizzicato is all it takes to set me off, weeping) is because we sound either hysterical or intolerable! Besides, all genius-types are prone to such irascibilities. Marcel Proust lined the walls of his bedroom with cork to dampen the noise!  until he developed an allergy to cork. 
Responsive relationship
So how does having this hypochonhypersensitive ear effect my writing life What habits have I developed on account of or in response to this relationship with the aural
I Like the Sound of Orange, Which Rhymes with Nothing
Whenever I teach, I play background noise soundtracks during all reading and writing exercises. At first, students think this is weird and even rude and contrived, potentially fascist, and it is  in that its non-negotiable.
Theyll be less conscious of the silence before their pen finally hits the page, I promise. There is truth in that.
(Another truth is that writing begets pen-clicking and knees jiggling beneath desks, chaffing jeans). Carefully modulated ambient noise, I tell them, is scientifically proven to enhance concentration, cognition and creative processes.
I dont cite the one article I know, as its from the Journal of Consumer Research, and creativity can be consumed but it cannot be manufactured. I quote the abstract to sound authoritative:
Results from five experiments demonstrate that a moderate (70 dB) versus low (50dB) level of ambient noise enhances performance on creative tasks  Process measures reveal that a moderate rate (vs. low) level of noise increases processing difficulty, inducing a higher construal level and thus promoting abstract processing, which subsequently leads to higher creativity.

BOI hosts MALAYSIAN BUSINESS DELEGATION
A Malaysian business delegation consisting of five members headed by Dato Kulasegaram Sabaratnam, Chairman of the Malaysia Sri Lanka Business Chamber was hosted by the BOI and briefed on the possibilities of investing in the country.
This delegation has made several visits to Sri Lanka in the past and built strong ties with the country. The Malaysian team was in the Island to participate at the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2018.
Among the sectors of interest of the delegation was the possibility of manufacturing furniture in Sri Lanka as one of the companies British Seep Systems and Beds (BSSB) has vast experience in this sector and in fact currently exports to clients in the USA, Europe, the Middle East and also retails in the UK.
This company which employs 700 staff in Malaysia is exploring opportunities in Sri Lanka. Another Company which is part of the delegation was looking at the service sector such as business process outsourcing and legal process outsourcing. The Company is also interested in publishing, and more specifically books in the Tamil language.
One company represented was interested in the Unit Trust Industry and studying the opportunities available in Sri Lanka.
The leader of the delegation Dato Kulasegaram Sabaratnam also stated that his delegation were keen to examine the possibility of marketing Sri Lankan products in Malaysia and had scheduled meetings with important local stakeholders like EDB as well as individual entrepreneurs, with a view of entering into joint ventures.
The BOI was represented by Nilupul de Silva, Director, (Investment Promotion), Dilip S Samarasinghe, Director (Media and Publicity) and Manilal Ranasinghe, Deputy Director, (Investment Promotion).
Specific areas which the delegation did show interest was on the possibility of manufacturing solar panels in Sri Lanka, an area where the BOI has conducted extensive research in collaboration with Harvard Universitys Kennedy School.
Malaysia has been traditionally one of Sri Lankas most important sources of investment in the period from 2005  2016. In that period over $1.4 billion worth of FDI inflows originated from Malaysia. Currently Malaysian investments include projects in Hydro Power, KPO Services, Cellular Mobile Telephone networks, Hotels, Container Services, IT, the Browning Beer and education.
Currently there are an estimated 22 Malaysian enterprises in commercial operation in Sri Lanka under Section 16 of the BOI Law and another 13 under Section 17. One of the important areas which BOI promoted to the Malaysian delegation was Sri Lankas access to several key markets under international agreements including the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA, Pakistan  Sri Lanka FTA and GSP+ agreement with the European Union in addition to the FTA with Singapore. In the future an FTA would be signed with China.
As Malaysia has a booming economy and has emerged as an economic leader in the South East region, BOI is keen to attract Malaysian investments in a number of key industries such as information communication technology services, electronic and electronic items, Automobile components, Textile and Apparel, light Engineering, Rubber based products, Agro processing, Ceramic Industries, Tourism and research and development. The Malaysian delegation also stated that they are keen to partner in any future economic forum bringing together Sri Lankan economic interest overseas.

Bring widows out of the dark shadows of shame
International Widows Day was observed on Saturday June 23, this year. The United Nations ratified the day of action to address the poverty and injustice faced by millions of widows and their dependents in many countries.
For millions of women across the globe, becoming a widow marks the beginning of a life of unspeakable suffering and tragedy. For these women and their children, widowhood is not simply a change in marital status, but the end to economic, social, political, physical, and emotional security.
Absent in statistics, unnoticed by researchers, neglected by national and local authorities and mostly overlooked by civil society organisations  the situation of widows is, in effect, invisible. Yet abuse of widows and their children constitutes one of the most serious violations of human rights and obstacles to development today. Millions of the worlds widows endure extreme poverty, ostracism, violence, homelessness, ill health and discrimination in law and custom.
To give special recognition to the situation of widows of all ages and across regions and cultures, the UN General Assembly declared 23 June 2011 as the first-ever International Widows Day, to be celebrated annually. The theme for the 2017 observances was: Never Alone - a reassuring mark of solidarity for this hapless segment of society and to share the spirit of hope and healing with as many widows as possible. It is a comforting thought that there are hosts of dedicated persons ready to assist this overlooked portion of the population by providing support, education, healing, caring, sharing and strength.
Once widowed, women in many countries often confront a denial of inheritance and land rights, degrading and life-threatening mourning and burial rites and other forms of widow abuse. Widows are often evicted from their homes and physically abused  some even killed  even by members of their own family. In many countries, a womans social status is inextricably linked to her husbands, so that when her husband dies, a woman no longer has a place in society. To regain social status, widows are expected to marry one of their husbands male relatives, sometimes unwillingly. For many, the loss of a husband is only the first trauma in a long-term ordeal.
In many countries, widowhood is stigmatized and seen as a source of shame. Widows are thought to be cursed in some cultures and are even associated with witchcraft. Such misconceptions can lead to widows being ostracized, abused and worse. Research by HelpAge International, for instance, has found that in Tanzania hundreds of older women  mostly widows  have been killed because of accusations of being witches. The children of widows are often affected, both emotionally and economically. Widowed mothers, now supporting their families alone, are forced to withdraw children from school and to rely on their labour. Moreover, the daughters of widows may suffer multiple deprivations, increasing their vulnerability to abuse.
Such cruelties are often seen as justified in terms of cultural or religious practice. Impunity for abuses of the rights of widows is rife, with few perpetrators ever successfully brought to justice. Even in countries where legal protection is more inclusive, widows can suffer social marginalization.
Across a wide spectrum of countries, religions and ethnic groups, a woman is left destitute when her husband dies. Poverty is often made worse by little or no access to credit or other economic resources, and by illiteracy or lack of education. Without education and training, widows cannot support themselves or their families.
Poor nutrition, inadequate shelter and vulnerability to violence, combined with a lack of access to health care, can have a severe impact on the physical and mental well-being of widows. The sexual and reproductive health needs of widows may go unaddressed, including the fact that widows are often the victims of rape.
They are particularly vulnerable in the context of HIV and AIDS. Women may be kept unaware of the cause of their husbands AIDS-related death and made to undergo ritual cleansing through sex with male relatives regardless of HIV status. The economic insecurity stemming from widowhood also drives some women and girls to sex work.
They struggle to care for themselves and their children in their own countries, refugee camps or countries of asylum. In several post-conflict situations, high numbers of children depend on widowed mothers  often young women, sometimes children themselves  as their sole support. Widowed grandmothers are also left caring for orphaned and sick grandchildren. In countries coming out of conflict, such as Sri Lanka, they are vulnerable to ongoing exploitation and often experience further violence and discrimination in the post-conflict period. Mistreatment of widows can have a negative impact on investments in peace and security, feeding the cycle of poverty, breeding unrest and insecurity, and ultimately challenging democracy and sustainable security.
With reconciliation being high on its agenda, the Sri Lankan government launched an empowerment scheme for widows in the country and has extended the implementation of a self-employment programme to former members of militant groups.
Of roughly about 900,000 widows in Sri Lanka, approximately more than 600,000 belong to the age group of 40 years and above. Even though exact details are not immediately available with regard to those who became widows in the wake of the 26-year-long armed conflict (1983-2009), a considerable number of widows is said to be belonging to this category. The scheme now covers the widows in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullativu and Ampara, Trincomalee and Batticaloa , Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
According to the 2012 Census, women are heading 23 per cent of 5.2 million households in the country. Their share in the overall population of about 20 million is around 51 per cent. A senior official in the Ministry of Womens Affairs says that field officials of her department have identified the beneficiaries including those who are heading households. The scheme has been inaugurated simultaneously in all the districts. Economically weaker sections will be targeted under the scheme. The focus will be more on awareness generation, improvement of skills and provision of technical assistance. Another decision taken by the government is to extend the self-employment programme, which has been in vogue since 2012.
The programme also covers those who were once involved in terrorist activities and who subsequently underwent rehabilitation. Soft loans are being provided to beneficiaries so that they can lead their lives in a dignified manner. Approximately, 2,500 persons have benefitted. The number of applications received is around 7,000 says an official source.
Healthcare, decent work, full participation in decision-making and public life, and lives free of violence and abuse, would give them a chance to build a secure life after bereavement. Importantly, creating opportunities for widows can also help to protect their children and avoid the cycle of inter-generational poverty and deprivation. International Widows Day is an opportunity for action towards achieving full rights and recognition for widows  too long invisible, uncounted and ignored.

Buddha never preached dictatorial rule - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the Buddha had never preached a dictatorial rule such as Hitler, Polpot or Idi Amin, but preached to rule the country based on the Dasaraja Dharmaya.
The Prime Minister made these remarks at a ceremony organised at the Maha Manthinda Pirivena in Akuressa, Matara on Saturday.
The Prime Minister further said that Buddha had preached on how to rule the country through many Sutras. A king should follow the Dasaraja Dharmaya when ruling a country, he said.
Besides, the Buddha had preached on the Lichchavi precepts as well and as a democratic country, we should act accordingly and follow those people friendly ruling methods. The Buddha had never asked rulers to kill countrymen. Buddhism is against all forms of killings and torture, he added.
The Prime Minister pointed out that King Dharmashokas ruling can be considered as an example for the Buddhas teachings of just ruling.
The Buddha had preached to the Lichchavis to meet frequently, discuss cordially and depart peacefully. That is how the Buddha preached on ruling a nation.He never asked anyone to be a dictator, the Prime Minister said.
The PM said he would never hesitate to condemn a saying that a politician should be like Hitler, if such a statement was made in his presence.
He expressed his displeasure about the behaviour of the media in this regard. He added that if he made such a statement, the media would have attacked him continuously. He said certain electronic and print media kept silent on the theras anusasana.
He further said that as a civilised society and because the world respects the country for its Buddhist principles, democracy had flourished and helped the country move forward.

Cannabis to be allowed to grown, exported in Sri Lanka for medical purposes

Since United Kingdom and Canada has lifted the ban imposed for Cannabis, Sri Lanka will also be allowed to grow cannabis for medical purposes, export the production, paving the way to earn millions of dollars, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He added that growing Cannabis in cold countries is not effective.
Addressing a media during a press conference held in Colombo today he said that a cabinet paper had been presented to cultivate cannabis with the assistance of armed forces.
Initially, around 100 acres of cannabis will be cultivated, the Minister said.
According to Minister Senaratne, United Kingdom lifted the ban on Cannabis due to its use as a herb to treat neurological disorders. It was British colonial rulers who banned cannabis in Sri Lanka in order to promote tobacco.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that cannabis should be allowed to use in Sri Lanka legally as an Ayurvedic drug.
The stocks of cannabis taken into custody by the police time to time come out after a long procedure as dried, low quality substance that does not have much effect.

Cathay Pacific welcomes new member to its fleet
Cathay Pacific welcomed the newest member to its fleet as the first of its 20 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft prepares to fly from Toulouse, France to the airlines home of Hong Kong on a blend of biofuel.
Eight of these aircraft will be delivered this year with the remainder to arrive by 2021. After initial rounds of regional services, starting with its first commercial flight to Taipei in July 1, the A350-1000 will launch Cathay Pacifics new service to Washington DC on September 15, which at 8,153 miles makes it the longest on the airlines network.
This technologically-advanced aircraft will also serve Madrid, Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, Manchester and Zurich from the coming winter.
Cathay Pacific Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Paul Loo said, We already have one of the youngest long-haul fleets in the sky, and with the arrival of the A350-1000, our fleet is only going to get younger.

CBSL resolves CIFL depositors issue
The depositors of the Central investment Finance Ltd, (CIFL) is finally gets relief as the Central Bank (CBSL) has pledged to settle some of the depositors and pay a sizeable amount to other depositors before end of July 2018.
President of the CIFL Depositors Association, M. Wijegunawardane said that since the company folded up five years ago, several promises of re-payment plans were presented and even promises were made. However the depositors are yet to receive a penny as a return on hard earned deposits.
The CIFL depositors last month met several Parliamentarians and their matter subsequently taken up in Parliament last month. The depositors then met the Deputy Governor of Central Bank and other top officials and a repayment plan was proposed.
Under this scheme all depositors having less than Rs. 600,000 would be settled in full while the remaining depositors too would be paid an advance of Rs. 600,000. There are 4,200 depositors and total deposit base is Rs. 3.5 billion and under this scheme 61% of customers would be fully settled.
He said that this move is some consolation but its not the solution. The issue of interest for our deposits is not clear and also there is no proper time frame given as to when the balance would be settled.
He also said that they have also brought in a German investor who wants to bail out CIFL and launch solar power projects and financial services in Sri Lanka. This company is ready to invest US$ 32 million and has Rs. 5 billion business plans for Sri Lanka. However he is facing tremendous red tape. (SS)

I dont know, I cant remember, a national malady!
At a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, a senior politician was unable to satisfactorily explain how he and his family came to occupy a luxury apartment when his residence was being renovated. To many questions by the state attorney, his answers were I dont know or I cant remember.
A few parliamentarians stunned the nation admitting having taken millions of rupees from the master fraudster who has played out the country for billions. Their excuse, We received these cheques. We cant remember who gave the cheques. The money was used for the election campaign.
But when the campaign donations came the election had ended. Perhaps the CID will tell us, whether these donations have been banked, invested in business ventures or busted in hotels, casinos and massage clinics!
With all this ill-gotten filthy lucre they are bound to vie for post turtle positions once again. These rogues and their leaders can never change. The people have been fooled enough. Let them come. The people have no time to experiment with born-again politicians.
Unlike politicians who have deservedly earned the condemnation of the nation as abominable rotters, our cricketers have been a much-loved breed. Thankfully, many a time they have been able to lift the spirits of this perpetually despairing nation. Politicians and others in positions of power have a lot to learn indeed from the cricketing greats such as Sangakkara, Muralitharan, de Silva and Jayewardene. But going by the events that overtook the game of cricket itself at the St. Lucia Test Match in the West Indies one wonders whether our cricketers are beginning to go the way of our politicians. Did not our Captain Chandimal sound like an MP when at the ball tampering inquiry he famously admitted very much like a politician: I put something into my mouth, but I cannot remember what it was
Inasmuch as the MPs who received cheques from Perpetual Treasuries do not deserve seats in the August House as Honourable members, Chandimal has forfeited the honour of Captaining Sri Lanka.

Clashes in Nigeria between farmers and herders leave 86 dead

At least 86 people have died in central Nigeria after violent clashes broke out between farmers and cattle herders, police in Plateau state said.
Some reports say fighting began on Thursday when ethnic Berom farmers attacked Fulani herders, killing five of them.
A retaliatory attack on Saturday led to more deaths.
The area has a decades-long history of violence between ethnic groups competing for land.
A curfew has now been imposed in three parts of the state.
State police commissioner Undie Adie said a search of villages following the bloodshed revealed that 86 people had been killed, and six injured.
He said 50 houses had been burned, as well as 15 motorbikes and two vehicles.
Who are the Fulani herdsmen
They are believed to be the largest semi-nomadic group in the world and are found across West and Central Africa - from Senegal to the Central African Republic.
In Nigeria, some continue to live as semi-nomadic herders, while others have moved to cities.
The nomadic groups spend most of their lives in the bush.
They herd their animals across vast areas, frequently clashing with farming communities.

Cost of subsidies risen to Rs. 76 billion
Government spending on subsidies granted to the people in the form of Samurdhi, fertiliser, school textbooks, school uniforms and other items which cost Rs.354 billion in 2015 had today increased by Rs.76 billion to a total of Rs.430 billion a high Treasury official said.
This increase of Rs. 76 billion for granting subsides to the people is a significant feature on the part of the government, the official said.
The Yahapalana Government which assumed office on January 8, 2015 has taken measures to gradually increase spending on subsidies to the people including school textbooks, and uniforms, nutrition programmes, allowances to disabled War Heroes, fertiliser, Samurdhi, free medicine and persons.
Government total spending this year (2018) is estimated at Rs.2,903 billion of this Rs.820 billion had been allocated for debt repayment and servicing. Another Rs.630 billion is earmarked for salaries and wages. Rs.751 billion is earmarked for capital expenditure. Goods and services are estimated to cost Rs.195 billion.
The official said the increase in the Samurdhi allowance by 200 percent and increase of the fertiliser subsidy, and welfare measures in the education and health sectors had directly resulted in the increase on welfare spending.
During the previous Rajapaksa regime, the governments spending on subsides to the people was Rs.205 billion in 2012, Rs. 223 billion in 2013 and Rs.250 billion in 2014. This rapid increase in welfare spending should engage the special attention of the public, government, sources said.
Meanwhile, the government will stand to lose Rs. 1,200 million in income due to the vat exemption granted to the health sector, Deputy Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle said.
All private sector health services except room charges have been exempted from VAT with effect from July 1. This has accounted for the loss of a sizeable amount of government income.
Attygalle said the new Inland Revenue Act was implemented from April 1 this year and the government estimated an income of Rs.30 billion from it during the first two months of its implementation and the government had realised an increased income of Rs.5 billion.

Dont sweat out a hangover
Exercising on a hangover might seem like a foreign concept to many, whose ideal way to spend the morning after is to do nothing but watch Netflix from under the covers, but its not as rare as we might think.
Drinking and exercising is obviously an unlikely pairing, but one 2014 study found that on days when people exercise more - typically weekends - they also drink more alcohol, making a hung-over workout all the more likely for many of us.
However, while working out after a night of drinking might seem like the best way to make up for the previous nights sins, it might not actually be the best idea.
Unfortunately the old adage of sweating out a hangover physiologically doesnt seem to happen, explains Ian Streetz, personal trainer at boutique boxing gym Kobox in London.
A major problem with a hangover is of dehydration, and by attempting to sweat it out, further dehydration occurs.
This can make exercising feel far more physically draining, due to the inevitable fatigue, body aches and possible nausea that accompanies the laymans hangover.
Mila Lazaar, head of HIIT at London-based fitness studio Another Space, explains that our bodies are more prone to tiredness during exercise due to low blood sugar.
This can make out co-ordination worse, meaning were more likely to suffer an injury, she tells The Independent. Streetz adds that this could also be down to the way alcohol is digested in the body: The by-products of breaking down the alcohol in your body is excreted in sweat as a toxin, he tells The Independent. This is released in higher concentration if the body is dehydrated, which can lead to cramps, strains and injury.
Streetz adds that alcohol also lowers the rate of protein synthesis in the body, the biological process in which cells build new proteins, making it harder to build muscle and recover as effectively as you would normally.
Ultimately, this means that your post-party workout will be far less beneficial than usual and might actually be doing you more harm than good. Obviously, its important to note that hangovers manifest themselves on a scale, ranging from sore head to sore everything, and while exercising in the former might not be so terrible, going for a full on weights session post-drinking is seldom a wise idea, despite what your drunken happy-go-lucky brain is telling you. If youre experiencing some of the more severe hangover-induced ailments - dizziness, shakiness, headaches and vomiting - a gym session should really be the last thing on your mind.

Dowrich rescues West Indies
BRIDGETOWN June24, 2018: Shane Dowrich led yet another West Indies rearguard with an unbeaten half-century as the West Indies rallied from 53 for five to reach stumps at 132 without further loss on a rain-hit opening day of the third and final Test match.
Almost half of the scheduled overs were lost to intermittent showers as day/night Test cricket came to the Caribbean for the first time, three years after the first such fixture was played between Australia and neighbours New Zealand in Adelaide.
Having already played a vital role in the series with an unbeaten 125 that rescued the West Indies in the first innings of the series in Trinidad two weeks earlier, the wicketkeeper-batsman's rich vein of form continued on his home ground Saturday at the Kensington Oval.
His assured innings of 60 not out was well supported by Jason Holder, the West Indies captain contributing 33 not out in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 79 and going some way towards justifying his decision to bat first on a green pitch, notwithstanding the struggles faced by the home side's top order against a Sri Lankan attack spearheaded by stand-in skipper Suranga Lakmal.
Appointed to lead the tourists with regular captain Dinesh Chandimal suspended for the match after being found guilty of ball tampering during the second Test in St Lucia, Lakmal swiftly dispensed with openers Devon Smith and Kraigg Brathwaite on a grassy pitch.
Lahiru Kumara, Sri Lanka's top bowler of the series, then removed Kieran Powell cheaply as well to have the home side reeling at eight for three. A one-hour break for rain offered some respite to the home batsmen but when play resumed Kasun Rajitha followed up on an encouraging debut in the second Test by dismissing Roston Chase immediately upon coming into the attack.
When Rajitha accounted for Hope at the start of the second session, West Indian prospects of a decent first innings total looked grim, especially with the trend over the previous nine day/night Test matches in other parts of the world for bowlers to hold sway with the pink ball during the twilight period.
But Dowrich and Hope batted with relative ease and will be looking to extend what has already been a productive partnership deep into the second day.
Lakmal, the first seamer ever to lead Sri Lanka in a Test, wasted no time in making the most of the sporting track earlier in the afternoon when play got underway in bright sunshine.
Smith stabbed at the last delivery of the first over of the match and Dhananjaya de Silva showed a safe pair of hands to come up with the catch at third slip. Danushka Gunathilaka, brought in effectively as Chandimal's replacement in the middle-order, then showed good athleticism in sprinting in from cover-point and diving forward to take the catch millimetres from the turf as Brathwaite could not control a delivery from Lakmal which lifted sharply at the batsman.
Kumara was also grateful for the support from his fielders when Kusal Mendis held a good low catch at second slip when Powell pushed at a full-length delivery without covering the ball properly. Then after impressing with an expansive cover-driven boundary before the rain-break, Chase was bowled in Rajitha's first over, dragging a delivery onto his middle stump.
Off-spinning all-rounder Dilruwan Perea, who has replaced Akila Dananjaya in Sri Lanka's other change from the drawn second Test, bowled the final over of the session but, as expected that the visitors relied heavily on their three seamers in between the showers in seeking to lay the foundations for a series-levelling victory.
Those expectations would have been boosted when Hope fell to Rajitha via another sharp Mendis slip catch. However the Sri Lankans were left frustrated deep into the night both by the resistance of Dowrich and Holder and the frequent interruptions by inclement weather.
With Chandimal already ruled out, any thoughts of recalling Rangana Herath for this must-win final match of the tour ended on Friday when the experienced left-arm spinner split the webbing in his bowling hand during catching practice on the eve of the Test. AFP

Ecoeye Lanka Proprietor Nalin Herath endeavouring to win the world
There is an old saying, Behind Every Successful Man, There is a Woman. That is a proven truth in the Sri Lankan society. Nalin Herath, the proprietor of Ecoeye Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., is a man of courage.
Ecoeye Lanka Private Limited, Proprietor Nalin Herath, endeavouring to win the world earning in dollars and pounds through handloom textile related products.
Nalin Herath, who has obtained vocational education relevant to the garment field after finishing his higher education, selected it as his way forward in life. Employed as a Quality Controller and various administrative professions relevant to the field, he was an employee that made great endeavours to uplift the organizations he was employed in from their existing levels.
But, unfortunately, none of the organizations he uplifted through his courage were not concerned in uplifting Nalins economy.
All of them used my skills only for their organizational development. So, I thought of starting a business enterprise of my own.
Hidden expectations of reaching the apex of the business world through own strength was engendered in Nalins mind with the ending of his school education.
Nalin decided to leave his profession and follow a management course relevant to the garment industry utilizing his savings to support him in bringing his new hopes to fruition.
Other than his field experience and administration and management knowledge, Nalin had a talent for artistic creations from his childhood. His expectation was presenting a creative product to the market. He had realized that, if he is to start a business enterprise relevant to the aesthetic field, handloom textile related garment industry is a good sphere to start in.
Even though I had all the skills necessary to start a business enterprise, my only problem was lack of capital. At that point, my mother gave me Rs. 500/=. I bought two yards of cloth from that money, cut it in half and sewed two bags. That was how I started my business enterprise.
Even though he is producing multicolored handloom bags suiting modern fashions, his path was not a decorative one. Nalin who came to traverse the sea of business with a large bundle of hopes and expectations faced a large number of obstacles he never expected.
Though I took my bags, made painstakingly foregoing sleep and with borrowed money, the people in the shops did not buy my products. Traders were used to selling cheap products imported from countries such as India and China.
Even though his subconscious mind told him to stop his business enterprise in the face of obstacles thrown on his path by the society but his self-confidence, rising above all those obstacles, ordered him to go forward without stopping.
Every instance I broke down, my mother encouraged me. She bought two sewing machines for me spending some of her savings
Another basic necessity of Nalins business enterprise was thus fulfilled. He started to run his business with more strength. He started practically experimenting with all his inherent skills in the handloom textile industry.
Traders realized that there is some attractive difference in my products than other bags. They began to accept my products for selling, subject to the condition of paying for them after they were sold
Gradually, he went on seeking the Silk Road of development. But, even at that time, he was facing the problem of finding working capital.
The second woman we mentioned earlier in this article came to help him at that point of time.
My wife sold all her jewellery and gave me that money to invest in the business. I was able to fulfill orders and manufacture the necessary samples without a break using that money
Nalins mother was the spiritual strength behind the development of Ecoeye Lanka. Today, it is his wife who is administering the finances of his business enterprise and encouraging him. That is why we mentioned earlier that Nalin, who received the strength of two women to the maximum, in a man that is two times successful.
Even though Ecoeye Lanka, had some business purchase in the area by that time as a sole ownership, Nalin was entangled in another problem.
We were buying handloom textiles for our products from outside vendors. With the development of the organization, the amount of handloom textiles we purchased became insufficient. Even handloom textile suppliers were unable to cope with our demand
Nalin who has a good knowledge of the sources of the garment industry utilized the skills he obtained through his learning as a turning point for his Company.
I got the idea of producing the textiles we require ourselves. I bought yarn instead of textiles. After dyeing the yarn I purchased, I started utilizing my own personnel to weave handloom textiles
As rural women like to weave handloom textiles as a domestic industry, Nalin worked to obtain the handloom textiles required for his industry through supplying handloom machines to the residences of such women. Today, about 40 families have become stakeholders of this business enterprise through his sponsorship.
Ecoeye Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., that was limited only to Kurunegala, is today a company exporting handloom products to a number of countries such as Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada.
It was the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka that gave me overseas exposure for the first time. Special among those overseas experiences was the Serendib Exhibition held in the United Kingdom. Export trade is a very broad field. I was given all the required guidance on that by the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka
Today, Nalin, is a budding exporter, self-sufficient in his business. He has brought his company, Ecoeye Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., to the level of producing the yarn for the industry, dyeing them, producing handloom textiles, manufacturing value-added garment products using those handloom textiles and generating foreign exchange to the country through exporting them through his step-by-step experimentation in the industry. The products of Ecoeye Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., is very popular among not only Star Class Hotels but also renowned supermarket chains and memento sales networks.
Today, the hobby of Nalin who walked the roads till his feet ached under the hot sun carrying his load of handloom bags is making the most modern automobile introduced to the market. This hobby of Nalin is ample evidence for the development of Ecoeye Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
Nalin said that the labour force of todays society is going towards various tragic happenings.
According to him, one of the greatest tragedies is, young women of todays society earns something through any sort of employment, getting married and becoming dependent on their husbands by bidding adieu to their jobs after marriage.
He said that the handloom textile production and the garment industry of this country are both facing that unfortunate fate and entreats women, having the major share of this countrys labour force, to escape the mentality of depending upon their husbands and spend their strength on the development of the national economy.
Nalin gave us another Talk worth Dollars
When I was entering the entrepreneurship field, my objective was earning rupees. But, now my objective is not earning rupees but earning dollars and euros

England end barren run by beating Boks 25-10 at wet Newlands
CAPE TOWN, Saturday: Captain Owen Farrell kicked 20 points as England ended their five-match winless run with a deserved 25-10 victory over South Africa in the third and final test at a wet and windy Newlands on Saturday.
England played the better wet-weather rugby as they forced the Springboks, who ended up winning the series 2-1, into numerous errors with the platform for victory laid by a 14-6 penalty count in their favour.
Wing Jonny May also added a late try, superbly set up by a kick from flyhalf Danny Cipriani, who was making his first start for England in a decade but had little other influence on the game in the difficult conditions.
The only try for the Boks came from centre Jesse Kriel as the home side, who made five changes for the test, battled to breach a resolute England defence.
The conditions suited the visitors and they maximised that advantage with a more intelligent and accurate kicking game with ball in hand.
After Bok flyhalf Elton Jantjies, who had a poor game in the place of the rested Handre Pollard, had missed an early penalty, Farrell booted England ahead on 10 minutes.
It took until 37 minutes for the next score as South Africa were penalised for slowing down the play at the ruck after Jantjies had dropped the ball to put his side under pressure deep in their own half and Farrell landed the simple kick.
The Boks were on the board with the last play of the first half when Jantjies kicked a penalty after the hooter as England transgressed at the ruck and the visitors led 6-3 at the break.
England won a scrum penalty early in the second period, again after Jantjies had dropped the ball, that was converted by Farrell.
The first try of the game was scored by the Boks soon afterwards in a move started and finished by Kriel.
He found the slightest of gaps in the visitors defence out wide and tore into the England 22. Fullback Warrick Gelant then supplied a clever grubber kick and Kriel was able to gather over the line.
Jantjies slotted home a difficult conversion effort and the Boks had a lead of one, though it was short-lived.
Gelant immediately entered the ruck from the side and provided a penalty chance for Farrell, who slotted home to take England ahead again.
With the penalty count mounting against the Boks, Farrell extended the lead to five points and victory was sealed when Ciprianis excellent cross-field kick into the corner of the Bok goal-line was dotted down by May.
It was Englands first-ever test try against South Africa at Newlands in their third appearance in Cape Town and eased the pressure on coach Eddie Jones as the tourists came away with some consolation from a difficult tour. - Agencies

England sweep series 5-0
Manchester, Sunday: Jos Buttlers unbeaten century on his Lancashire home ground saw England to a thrilling one-wicket win over Australia in the fifth one-day international at Old Trafford on Sunday.
Victory gave England their first 5-0 series sweep of Australia, in more than 140 years of mens international cricket between the arch-rivals.
England, set a mere 206 to win, slumped to 50 for five and then 114 for eight.
They were still 11 runs shy of victory at 195 for nine when Adil Rashid (20) was out after sharing a stand of 81 with Buttler.
But Buttlers 110 not out saw them win with nine balls to spare while last man Jake Ball held firm at the other end.
Australia captain Tim Paine won the toss only to see his side dismissed for 205 in 34.4 overs.
Off-spinner Moeen Ali took an ODI best four for 46 -- including two for none in three balls
Travis Head (56) was the only batsman in the innings to pass fifty, with DArcy Short left stranded on 47 not out. AFP

England thrash Panama 6-1 to reach last 16
NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia, Sunday: England achieved their most emphatic World Cup result as Harry Kane's hat-trick helped them thrash a poor Panama side 6-1 and reach the last 16 on Sunday.
There were five first-half goals, with John Stones heading in the opener.
Kane made it 2-0 from the spot before Jesse Lingard, who was fouled in the box, made it 3-0 with a great strike.
Stones nodded in his second, Kane smashed in another penalty and then scored a lucky third, before Felipe Baloy fired in a consolation goal.
This was the first time England had scored four goals in a World Cup match since the 1966 final against Germany.
Meanwhile, skipper Kane, who now has five goals in the tournament, became the third England player to score three or more goals in a World Cup group stage, after Roger Hunt in 1966 and Gary Lineker in 1986.
England will now compete with Belgium - who secured their second win by beating Tunisia 5-2 on Saturday - for top spot when they play each other on Thursday.

Federer loses world No.1 spot
Halle Westfalen, Sunday: Croatian Borna Coric denied Roger Federer the 99th title of his career on Sunday with a 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 6-2 defeat in the final of the ATP Halle grass event.
Federer also lost the number one spot in ATP rankings to Rafael Nadal, and missed a chance to earn a record 10th title at the German venue.
Federer dropped the opening set in a tiebreak but levelled by winning the second. Coric held his nerve to take victory.
The Croatian outsider ranked 34th also ended Federer's 20-match win streak on clay for Federer which stretched to June, 2017.
The Swiss will drop to second in the world behind Rafael Nadal, who is playing no tune-up events prior to the start of Wimbledon a week from Monday.
The loss in just over two hours means came a week after Federer won his 98th title in Stuttgart.
Coric, who accounted for German second seed Alexander Zverev in the first round, held his nerve against the crowd favourite at this venue which styles itself after the All England club.
The 21-year-old had lost twice to Federer, but played him tough in their last meeting at Indian Wells last March.
He was the first Croatian to reach the final at Halle and now owns two titles after winning in Marrakech in 2017.
Federer dropped the opening set, won the second but was unable to fight back after going down 2-4 in the third.
Coric moved out to 5-2 and completed his upset on a second match point a game later as Federer's volley hit the top of the net.
The Swiss fired a dozen aces but lost serve twice.
Federer's excellent serving in the first set - four love games, three points lost on serve - could not prevent Coric taking the opener in 57 minutes.
The Croatian withstood a Federer assault in the 11th game, which lasted for nearly 10 minutes and featured five deuces. A game later, the Swiss seed took the set into a tiebreaker.
Federer reached a 5-3 margin and sent down his fifth ace to earn a pair of set points.
But Coric annulled the first with a service winner while a wild Federer backhand accounted for the other. Second later, the Croatian seized the set on his first opportunity from a Federer backhand long. AFP

Footnotes to Plato
Friedrich Nietzsche: The truth is terrible
The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (18441900) pursued two main themes in his work, one now familiar, even commonplace in modernity, the other still under-appreciated, often ignored. The familiar Nietzsche is the existentialist, who diagnoses the most profound cultural fact about modernity: the death of God, or more exactly, the collapse of the possibility of reasonable belief in God. Belief in God  in transcendent meaning or purpose, dictated by a supernatural being  is now incredible, usurped by naturalistic explanations of the evolution of species, the behaviour of matter in motion, the unconscious causes of human behaviours and attitudes, indeed, by explanations of how such a bizarre belief arose in the first place.
But without God or transcendent purpose, how can we withstand the terrible truths about our existence, namely, its inevitable suffering and disappointment, followed by death and the abyss of nothingness
Moral world
Nietzsche the existentialist exists in tandem with an illiberal Nietzsche, one who sees the collapse of theism and divine teleology as tied fundamentally to the untenability of the entire moral world view of post-Christian modernity. If there is no God who deems each human to be of equal worth or possessed with an immortal soul beloved by God, then why think we all deserve equal moral consideration
And what if, as Nietzsche argues, a morality of equality  and altruism and pity for suffering  were, in fact, an obstacle to human excellence What if being a moral person makes it impossible to be Beethoven Nietzsches conclusion is clear: if moral equality is an obstacle to human excellence, then so much the worse for moral equality. This is the less familiar and often shockingly anti-egalitarian Nietzsche.
Nietzsche grew up in the belly of God and Christian morality. His father, and his grandfathers on both sides of his family, were Lutheran pastors, and Nietzsche himself went to university planning to study Theology. Theological studies has perhaps never had such a spectacular dropout  one who later ridiculed Luther as a boor and declared himself to be the anti-Christian par excellence.
The young Nietzsche switched after one year at university to Classical Philology  the study of the texts and culture of the ancient Greek and Roman world  where he excelled, earning appointment to the University of Basel in 1869, even before completing his doctoral thesis. He soon met the composer Richard Wagner, and was briefly a disciple, imagining that Wagners music would redeem European culture from the ill effects of Christian morality. His enthusiasm for Wagner subsided after a few years, as Nietzsches mature philosophical views coalesced, and he grew disillusioned with Wagners rabid anti-Semitism.
Naturalistic world
Nietzsches classical training had educated him about ancient philosophy; the Presocratic philosophers (with their simple naturalistic world view) were his favourites, while his disagreements with Socrates and Plato persisted throughout his corpus. But it was only by accident that he discovered contemporary German philosophy in 1865 and 1866 through Arthur Schopenhauer and, a year later, the neo-Kantian Friedrich Lange.
Schopenhauers The World as Will and Representation (which was first published in 1818, but only came to prominence decades later, contributing to the eclipse of G. W. F. Hegel in German philosophy) set Nietzsches central existentialist issue: how can life, given that it involves continual, senseless suffering, possibly be justified Schopenhauer offered a nihilistic verdict: we would be better off dead. Nietzsche wanted to resist that conclusion, to affirm life, as he would often put it, to the point that we would happily will its eternal recurrence (in one of his famous formulations) including all its suffering.
Lange, by contrast, was both a neo-Kantian  part of the back to Kant revival in German philosophy after Hegels eclipse  and a friend of the materialist turn in German intellectual life, the other major reaction against Hegelian idealism after 1831. The latter, though familiar to philosophers today primarily by way of Ludwig Feuerbach and Karl Marx, actually received its major impetus from the dramatic developments in physiology that began in Germany in the 1830s.
Natural product
Materialism exploded on the German intellectual scene of the 1850s in such volumes as Ludwig Bchners Force and Matter, a publishing sensation which went through multiple editions and became a bestseller with its message that the researches and discoveries of modern times can no longer allow us to doubt that man, with all he has and possesses, be it mental or corporeal, is a natural product like all other organic beings. (Think of Bchner as the Richard Dawkins of the nineteenth century: a popularizer of some genuine discoveries, while also an unnuanced ideologue.) Nietzsche, who first learned of these German Materialists from Lange, wrote in a letter of 1866, Kant, Schopenhauer, this book by Lange  I dont need anything else.
Nietzsche soon soured on Kant, though Kant and Plato remain his most frequent philosophical opponents in his writings, even if philosophical may mislead as to Nietzsches critical method. For Nietzsches distinctive writing style is notably anomalous in the canon of great philosophers: he writes aphoristically, polemically, lyrically and always very personally; he can be funny, sarcastic, rude, scholarly, scathing, often in the same passage.
He eschews almost entirely the rationally discursive form of philosophical argumentation. In the course of examining philosophical subjects (morality, free will, knowledge), Nietzsche will invoke historical, psychological, philological and anthropological claims, and never appeal to an intuition or an a priori bit of knowledge, let alone set out a syllogism (Nothing is easier to erase than a dialectical effect, he quips in Twilight of the Idols).

Germany rescue World Cup hopes with dramatic Kroos winner
SOCHI, Russia, Sunday - Toni Kroos rescued Germanys World Cup hopes in dramatic fashion on Saturday, curling in a stunning free-kick deep into injury time to seal a 2-1 win against Sweden.
Germanys late, late show keeps Joachim Loews on course to be the first team to retain the title in 56 years but their fate is still not entirely in their own hands.
The defending champions were in desperate trouble when Ola Toivonen lifted the ball over Manuel Neuer to put the Swedes ahead in the first half in Sochi after Kroos gave the ball away.
Germany, looking far sharper than they did in their opening defeat against Mexico, piled forward and eventually earned their reward when Marco Reus reacted quickly to turn the ball in shortly after the interval.
Despite incessant pressure, Loews men could not find the goal they craved as time ticked away and Germanys task was made more difficult when key defender Jerome Boateng was sent off in the 82nd minute for a second yellow card.
But Kroos had other ideas, stepping up in the 95th minute to curl a free-kick from the left edge of the penalty area into the top corner, beating the despairing dive of Robin Olsen, who had been outstanding in the Swedish goal.
We never lost hope. I think there was a bit of luck there with the goal scored in stoppage time, but it was a result of our belief in ourselves, said Loew. Despite the adversity, the team kept their cool and turned it around.
Germany -- level with Sweden on three points, with Mexico on six points -- must now beat South Korea in Kazan on Wednesday and hope the other result in Group F goes their way.
MEXICO WIN
Mexico showed that their shock defeat of Germany last weekend was no fluke with a 2-1 defeat of South Korea in Rostov-on-Don.
West Ham striker Javier Hernandez grabbed his 50th international goal while Los Angeles FC forward Carlos Vela was also on target from the penalty spot.
South Korea scored a late consolation strike from Tottenhams Son Heung-min, but it was too little, too late for the Asian giants, who desperately needed a victory after losing to Sweden in their opening game.
Sometimes against teams that have less of a footballing tradition than the biggest nations, you can tend to rest on your laurels and lose concentration, said Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio.
But it was a deserved victory. We are very happy and we share that with the whole of the country.
LUKAKU, HAZARD STRIKE
In the first game of the day, Belgium produced an imperious display to overwhelm Tunisia, with Premier League stars Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard scoring two apiece in a 5-2 rout at Moscows Spartak Stadium.
The one-sided victory cemented Belgiums place at the top of Group G and all but guaranteed their place in the knockout rounds, with just one group game, against England, remaining.
Manchester United striker Lukaku took his goals tally to the tournament to four as the Red Devils carved open Tunisias defence with an impressive attacking display.
Dylan Bronn and captain Wahbi Khazri grabbed consolation goals for Tunisia, who now face almost certain elimination.
Belgium and England will qualify for the last 16 on Sunday if England defeat Panama in Nizhny Novgorod.  AFP

The ring, which in reality is three rings fused together, features a gold center band with a round diamond in the center.
The two outer bands have smaller diamonds, as well as a quartet of precious stones in the colors of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.
She explained that the blue and yellow are both sapphires, the red stone is a ruby, and the green is tsavorite.
Her husband designed it himself, and went to Shane Co. to have it made. Other Redditors loved it as much as her, and the post earned thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments.
Her fianc even chimed in too, explaining, I knew I needed to have an extraordinary ring for such an extraordinary girl. It turned out better than I ever could imagine. The ring is definitely enchanted. IANS

Hitler(II)
The main story of an English language weekly yesterday speculated that the Asgiriya Chapter Anunayakes call to former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to follow Hitler when he takes over the country may have damaged Gotas presidential prospects. The Ven.Vendaruwe Upali Thera created a huge political uproar when, delivering an anusasana on the occasion of Gotabhaya Rajapakass 69th birthday, at the latters residence, he alluded to the general perception among some that the former Defence Secretary was a Hitler and if that was the case so be it. In his anusasana the prelate said; Some people have described you as a Hitler. Be a Hitler. Go with the military and take the leadership of the country.
The remark drew scathing attacks from President Maithripala Sirisena and Minister Mangala Samaraweera, with social media having a field day coming out with some amusing, nay, imaginative sketches. President Sirisena, speaking at a function in Nikaweratiya vowed he will never allow for a return of the dictatorship which the people voted against on January 8. In January 2015, the people did not vote for food or jobs. They voted for freedom and democracy. I have restored both and will not allow the country to slip back to a dictatorship, he said.
The monks remark, it is reported, had drawn negative responses even among those close to the Rajapaksas, and, as speculated by the media report, may have cooked the goose for Gota. However, the Presidential Election is still a long way away, and, given the short memories of Sri Lankans, the issue may well have blown over by the time the poll draws near. But, one can safely bet that government politicians will keep the issue on the boil and the pro-government websites will go over the top with the topic.
Even without the media blitzkrieg the public mind is still fresh on how the former Defence Secretary bulldozed his way towards achieving his ends and the autocratic manner in which he ran roughshod over established practices and even the rulings of the court. The Meethotamulla catastrophe, for which the present government was blamed, would not have occurred had Gotabhaya not used the Army to breakup demonstrations by the people protesting against the indiscriminate dumping of garbage in their neighbourhood which eventually created the mountain that spelled death to dozens. Nor can one forget the manner in which the residents of Glennie Street in Slave Island were evicted from their homes using the military, nor, the fate of the Pettah pavement hawkers.
Some may agree with the methods used in the quest for beautifying the city and ridding the city landscape of slums. However, one also cannot lose sight of the fact that they were contrary to democratic norms and a complete infringement on the rights of the people, which is the hallmark of a dictatorship in the manner of a Hitler which the anunayake wants the former Defence Secretary to be.
In any democracy, the judiciary takes a preeminent place. It could be said that democracy rests on the free functioning of the courts of law and thus a great deal of regard is attached to the judiciary. However, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had no time for such niceties. The contempt in which he held the judiciary is well documented in the dialogue he had with Poddala Jayantha and Sanath Balasuriya whom he summoned to the Presidential Secretariat following a demonstration led by the duo against the abduction of journalists, opposite the Fort Railway station. The two media activists suggested that if the Defence Secretary had any grouse he was free to go to courts only for Gota to famously retort that mata oya bambu usaviwalata yanda wela ne - a clear insight to the dictatorial tendencies latent in the former Defence Secretary.
Perhaps, it was this tendency that was alluded to by JO firebrand Vasudeva Nanayakkara when he totally rejected Gota as a presidential prospect due, chiefly to the latters militarist way of doing things. And the MPs fears are not unfounded, given that all the movements created to promote Gotas candidature such as Eliya and Viy(p)ath Maga are virtually saturated with ex-military top brass one of whom, in a book written by him, graphically detailed the massacres carried out by the unit headed by him of Tamil civilians in the North while another wants all those who helped set up the Missing Persons Commission executed.
Without doubt, these will be the next Eichmanns, Himlers and Heydriches who led the bloody pogroms of the Fuhrer, under a Gota Presidency. Is it into such a scenario that the likes of the Ven. Vendaruwe Upali Thera want the country taken to
Of course we too are speculating. All this is contingent on the former Defence Secretary qualifying to contest for President. At the outset he has to renounce his American citizenship for eligibility. The outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap gave more than a hint with regard to the exact position. Besides, there is no way that the worlds number one superpower would be humbled by an inhabitant of a poor third world country cheapening its citizenship by wanting to withdraw it.

Honda hits late Japan leveller to blow World Cup group wide open
Yekaterinburg, Sunday: Substitute Keisuke Honda equalised with 12 minutes left as Japan twice pegged back Senegal in a thrilling 2-2 draw on Sunday that leaves World Cup Group H wide open.
All eyes will now be on the other group match later in the evening between Poland and Colombia following this stalemate at the Yekaterinburg Arena.
As it stands, Japan and Senegal have four points after two games, with Colombia and Poland on zero, though they have played a game less.
Midfielder Honda was the hero for Japan, scoring the deserved leveller after goalkeeper Khadim N'Diaye flapped at a cross.
Senegal, who reached the quarter-finals in the country's previous World Cup appearance in 2002, needed just over 10 minutes to go in front.
Japan failed to deal with a right-wing cross with Genki Haraguchi nodding the ball straight to Senegal defender Youssouf Sabaly in the box. He fired at Eiji Kawashima and the goalkeeper made a mess of it, punching the ball into the lurking Liverpool star Sadio Mane.
The ball bounced off the striker and into the net for his first goal at this tournament -- cue raucous Senegal celebrations with Khadim N'Diaye racing the length of the pitch to join in.
This match was billed as the pace and power of Senegal against the tactical and technical nous of Japan, who took a gamble and replaced Vahid Halilhodzic with Akira Nishino as coach just weeks before the World Cup.
It appeared to pay off when the unfancied Asians stunned 10-man Colombia 2-1 in their opener, and on 34 minutes they were level with Senegal when Takashi Inui bent the ball wonderfully into the bottom corner.
Backed by a vocal Japanese following who never stopped singing and with the locals also on their side, Japan were now the better side after a nervous start.
Mane found himself at left-back at one point as the Blue Samurai threatened to slice their way through, in what was growing to be an absorbing contest in the warm Yekaterinburg evening.
Aliou Cisse, Senegal's likeable coach and their skipper in that World Cup run in 2002, sent his substitutes to warm up five minutes into the second period as Japan began the half the better.
Working down the Africans' left side, the 26-year-old talisman Mane was only a sporadic danger.
Japan should have taken the lead on the hour but Yuya Osako, the match-winner against Colombia, somehow missed the ball when unmarked inside Senegal's six-yard box.
Inui then struck the bar from distance after the Senegal defence went AWOL.
On 71 minutes, Japan allowed a scuffed cross to go right across their goal and defender Moussa Wague arrived all alone at the far post to grab what looked like being an unlikely winner.
But Honda, the former AC Milan midfielder who had only been on the pitch six minutes, hit the late equaliser to leave Group H up for grabs. AFP

Include lentils in your diet
Swapping potatoes or rice with pulses can be beneficial for your health, a new research has claimed.
According to a University of Guelph-led study, swapping half a portion of starchy dishes for lentils can significantly improve your bodys response to carbohydrates.
The research was conducted by Alison Duncan and Dan Ramdath.
Replacing half a serving of rice with lentils caused blood glucose to drop by up to 20 per cent. Replacing potatoes with lentils led to a 35 percent drop, the research stated.
Pulses are extremely nutrient-dense food that has the potential to reduce chronic diseases associated with mismanaged glucose levels, said Duncan. Canada has a huge production of lentils, but we export most of it and only 13 per cent of Canadians eat them on any given day, said Duncan.
We are hoping this research will make people more aware of the health benefits of eating pulses.
The study involved 24 healthy adults fed four dishes - white rice only, half white rice and half large green lentils, half white rice and half small green lentils, and half white rice and half split red lentils. Researchers measured glucose levels in the participants blood before they ate and during two hours afterward.
They repeated the process for white potatoes alone and the same combinations of potatoes and lentils.
We mixed the lentils in with the potatoes and rice because people dont typically eat pulses on their own, but rather consumes them in combination with other starches as part of a larger meal, so we wanted the results to reflect that.
Blood glucose fell by similar amounts when half of the starch was replaced with each of the three types of lentils. Blood glucose comprises sugar found in the blood during digestion in the upper digestive tract and depends on the starch content of foods consumed.
Pulses, such as lentils, can slow digestion and the release of sugars found in starch into the bloodstream, ultimately reducing blood glucose levels, said Duncan.
This slower absorption means you dont experience a spike in glucose.
Having high levels over a period of time can lead to mismanagement of blood glucose, which is the hallmark of Type 2 diabetes. Essentially, eating lentils can lower that risk.
Pulses contain components that inhibit enzymes involved in absorption of glucose, and fibre contained in these foods can encourage the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can also help to reduce blood glucose levels, added Duncan.
We are hoping that building evidence for approval of a health claim for pulses will further encourage people to add pulses to their side dishes. The study appears in the Journal of Nutrition. The Scientist

Ireland beat Wallabies for first away series win in 39 years
SYDNEY, Saturday: Ireland earned a landmark 20-16 win over Australia on Saturday with Jonny Sextons boot helping them secure their first away series victory over the Wallabies in 39 years.
Both teams scored a try in a scrappy contest but the five penalties from the Irish fly-half Sexton earned the tourists their historic victory at the Sydney Football Stadium.
Ireland dominated possession and territory in the first half but failed to make their opportunities count, securing only a slender three-point lead at halftime, before CJ Stander scored what proved to be a decisive try three minutes after the break.
Australia responded strongly, with Marika Koroibete going over for a fine try but, despite sustained pressure from the home side, a late penalty from Sexton settled the game. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt praised his teams resilience as key to their milestone victory.
We dont do this very often, 39 years ago, Schmidt said.
They were coming in waves and we managed to keep them out.
Australias coach Michael Cheika was critical of some of the decisions from French referee Pascal Gauzere.
I really want to maintain a culture of no excuses. You guys have seen what happened out there. The only ones who can answer questions about the decisions are the officials, Cheika told reporters at a post match press conference.
Every time we got a bit of football going, we got penalised.
Australia were left feeling aggrieved after being forced to play ten minutes of the first half without star fullback Israel Folau, a period that saw Ireland take a lead that they never relinquished.
Folau was sin binned for making contact with Irish captain Peter OMahony in the air as both players challenged to win a Wallabies kick-off. OMahony fell heavily, and was taken off by stretcher, but contact was minimal.
Irish winger Jacob Stockdale was also sin binned in the first half, but his forearm contact into the throat of Australia scrum-half Nick Phipps drew fewer complaints.
While Ireland were the only team threatening in the first half, Australia dominated much of the second.
Ireland struck first after securing a line-out in Australias 22 which allowed Stander to drive over the line.
Australia, content to kick for territory in the first half, sought to keep the ball in hand after the break as they tested the Irish line with sustained phases of possession.
Australias dominance was eventually rewarded after fly-half Bernard Foley kicked behind the Irish defence with Koroibete swooping on the grubber kick and breaking a tackle by Sexton to score.
Just a point behind, Australia came close with their late pressure but a contentious penalty for Ireland near the Australian 22 offered the steely Sexton the chance to seal the win amid a chorus of jeers from a record home crowd.

Isco urges Spain to stay true to selves in Morocco decider
KALININGRAD, Russia, Sunday - Spain midfielder Isco believes his side must stay true to the philosophy that brought them World Cup glory in 2010 to achieve the result they need in Mondays Group B decider against Morocco.
After a breathless 3-3 draw with Portugal in their opening game, La Roja laboured to a 1-0 victory over Iran, and require at least a point in Kaliningrad against a Morocco side playing for pride to guarantee a last 16 berth.
We have to be faithful to the end to the style of play that defines us, the Real Madrid playmaker told reporters ahead of the game.
We have to play, pass a lot, keep the ball. If we play quickly across the pitch the chances will come.
Spain won a historic treble of European and world titles between 2008-2012 with a brand of possession-based football that came to be known as tiki taka.
Along with Real teammates Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio, Isco represents the cream of a new crop of Spanish talent looking to fill the void left in the national team after legend Xavis retirement.
This is my first time in a big competition with the national side, he said. I feel at ease but its easier with all the big players in the side.
Playing behind striker Diego Costa, Isco has delighted Spain fans this tournament with his deft touch and vision, but the team heads to Russias European enclave knowing the job is far from done.
While they could progress with a draw they would need to win and score more goals than Portugal in their match with Iran in order to guarantee top spot in Group B.
Coach Fernando Hierro, who only took the job two days before the tournament began after the shock dismissal of Julen Lopetegui, said his team wont underestimate a Morocco squad that are yet to pick up a point.
This is the World Cup, and not one single game is going to be easy, Hierro said. We can improve, and I hope we will keep winning while we do so, but nobody is giving anything away easily.
In certain groups teams have already qualified (for the last 16) but our group is very tough. We have no option but to secure all three points against Morocco.
The North Africans were the first team to be eliminated from the tournament but Herve Renards men have acquitted themselves well. AFP

It always seems impossible until it's done - Nelson Mandela
Leadership lessons from a legacy
There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires. Such are the words echoed by a man who gave so much for his people so that even his harshest critics agree he was irrefutably an extraordinary man.
Known as the first black President of South Africa, Mandela dismantled the institutional legacy of apartheid and racism which had been reining the country for decades. An anti-apartheid activist, he became the joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work. His life, more than any other, has symbolises the struggle for racial equality and self-determination of the diverse peoples of South Africa and the African continent.
He sought to unite the whites, blacks, and other minorities. His vision was for a rainbow nation which resulted in enriching South Africas economy, intellectuality and culture. He did not have favourites either. He served the poor and the rich, the academic and illiterate equally. Instead of favouring his own  the Xhosa tribe, Mandela chose to empower the beings of his country.
South Africa and Sri Lanka both have painful pasts. We were subjected to a lot of killings and disappearances. There were different sets of rules for the Blacks and the Whites. Blacks were regarded inferior then. We were not even allowed to be buried together! Mandela gave his life to struggle against apartheid, said South African High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Robina Marks at the launch of Nelson Mandela Centenary 2018 Programme.
She notes that his legacy should be reflected upon to inspire the current generation.
One of the things that struck me when I stepped into Sri Lanka two years ago was that anyone here can relate to his lessons. He was a symbol of someone who was able to turn his back on resentment for the past doings, she noted.
Mandela forgave his greatest adversary - the Apartheid government which not only caused tremendous suffering to himself and his family but also to his countrymen. By choosing this higher route Mandela left a legacy of forgiveness and reconciliation for the world.
Mandela was a gifted visionary. He used a full range of cognitive, emotional and behavioral abilities to bring about profound change in South Africa.
One of Mandels key principals was that he always put his people and honour before worldly gain. While many political leaders from yesteryear as well as during present times are making fortunes through corruptive activities, Mandela took a different route. His estate was roughly just US $2.9 million and he even left money for his staff as well as his family.
Leadership is not something which goes on forever. It is something you serve for your term at office. Then you leave that position vacant for another - which is exactly what he did. Our later presidents would hold onto power and refuse to let go of it. Leadership is about serving your term, make your country a better place and then retire, Marks stressed. She says that Mandela saw himself as a part of a collective rather than a leader.
No person leads on his or her own. We all stand on the shoulder of others who have gone before us, she opined.
Another striking aspect about this iconic leader was that he looked ahead and could see that South Africas system of apartheid would not survive into the future. He strategically assessed his moves and anticipated reactions from his prison cell. The prisoners and prison guards often describe him as a man of principle and dignity, willing to sacrifice his life for his beliefs.
Even during his years in prison Mandela sharpened his knowledge by reading smuggled books. Since political books were out of reach, he turned to books on gardening and horticulture. The result of this was that he was able to cultivate food not only for his fellow prisoners but also for the prison officials.
Apart from this Mandela was also keen to educate all those around him. His experience as a lawyer helped him to give legal advice to his fellow prisoners as well as the prison staff. His passion for learning and teaching was so great that Robben Island gained fame as Nelson Mandela University.
He spent 27 years behind bars on Robben Island, hammering on rocks in the scorching heat during the day, only to retire to a tiny eight-by-seven-foot concrete cell with only a straw mat to sleep on. This harsh prison life did not break him. Rather he took it as a means of challenging the system which denied him his liberty. When he was offered freedom in 1985, he refused by saying I cannot and will not give any undertaking, at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated!Such attributes made others dub him as a saint. However Mandela himself never denied his humanity. He wanted others to see himself as a human being with flaws.
Though he towered above others, due to being around six feet tall, he was also very humble. Once at a workshop we were conducting, he pulled one of us aside and requested to meet the people who had prepared the food at the event. We were stunned by his words and the kitchen staff whooped for joy. He came and shook their hands, Marks recalled one of her experiences with him.
Another anecdote she shared was that Mandelas special relationship with Queen Elizabeth.
Mandela was regarded as a terrorist in some countries including the US. It is natural that one persons freedom fighter becomes anothers terrorist. Many people are formal with the Queen and always address her as Queen Elizabeth. Mandela stuck to calling her My dear Elizabeth in public and in private he called her Lizzie. Her cheeks would grow pink with delight on hearing him address her in this manner because she saw someone who regarded himself her equal and recognised her humanity. She also recognised him as someone who is a leader, Marks mused adding that he was not afraid to voice on subjects that are taboo to the society.For example he was the first one to admit publicly that his son has contacted HIV, she explained.
After 24 years after the end of apartheid we can see how the life, the legacy and the lessons of Mandela have impacted the life of today. Even though we have democracy, freedom, justice and one of the most appropriate constitutions in the world, we still have challenges to face in Africa, Marks added.
Mandelas birthday, July 18, has been declared as United Nations Mandela Day. Had he lived today he would have scored a century this year. However the timeless lessons from his life story will endure for years to come. So make everyday a Mandela Day.

Solutions cannot be found to issues and problems unless there is flexibility on the part of both the government and the strikers, Malwatte Mahanayake Thera Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said.
The Mahanayake Thera expressed these sentiments during an Anusasana he delivered when a delegation from the striking joint front of Postal Unions led by Postal Trade Union Front Governor K.M. Chintaka Bandara called on him at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy yesterday morning.
Bandara also handed over a letter detailing the issues which had led to the postal strike to the Mahanayake Thera during the meeting.
The Mahanayake Thera who said that all strikes whether postal or otherwise finally inconvenienced the public added that a rigid stance by both parties to the dispute would never help to bring in a solution to problems. If both parties in a dispute abandoned their rigid stance and compromise, an amicable solution could be found to any problem. Bandara said the postal strike inconvenienced the ordinary public only because people in the higher social strata made use of courier services to attend to their postal and other delivery matters.
He said 27,000 postal workers had downed tools for the last 11 days without a solution in sight and their salaries too had been suspended this month. Bandara alleged that instead of finding solutions to problems of public servants, the government was pursuing a policy of oppression. He said the satyagraha campaign they had launched would be transformed into a fast unto death if the government failed to find a quick solution to their problems.

Making money matters fun for children
Zerodha, Indias leading technology-driven brokerage firm recently announced the launch of the Sinhala version of its successful book for children The Rupee Tales.
Zerodha last year took a momentous step to nurture young minds with the Rupee Tales: a set of five story books which attempts to familiarise children above seven years to basic financial concepts. Zerodha has used storytelling with vibrant illustrations as a medium to convey these concepts.
Founder and CEO, Zerodha, Nithin Kamath,said Zerodha is taking the forefront in improving financial literacy in India and we are taking this commitment further with the launch of the local version of our book the Rupee Tales. It is our earnest attempt to creatively inculcate basic financial awareness among children. The concepts covered in the Rupee Tales pertain to financial inclusion and a large part of the financial inclusion for all dream is dependent on how the younger generation adapts to it.
For the Sinhala version of the book, Zerodha has associated with Darshana publications who has the official translation and distribution rights of the book. Each book deals with a specific topic, peppered with lively characters, and vibrant illustrations. The concepts covered include; Savings,Banking and Inflation, Taxes, Insurance, and Stock Markets.
Author of The Rupee Tales Karthik Rangappasaid, The idea to write Rupee Tales came to me when my 7-year-old daughter kept asking me where I work and what I do. I realized it was not easy to explain what the stock market is, or, for that matter, basics of finance. During a casual chat at work, we realized there was no material available to familiarize kids with basic financial concepts in India or for that matter across SE Asia. Being Indias leading financial services firm, we felt it was our responsibility to change this, and thus, The Rupee Tales was born.
The books will be officially available for sale during Kandy Book Fair which is scheduled to take place from June 27 to July 1. It will also be available during the upcoming Colombo Book Fair to be held in September 2018.
Knowledge at a critical age to change perception and for the formation of habits are even more critical. These simple yet powerful books from Zerodha introduce some very important principles to young children. Saving should be a habit. A habit which has to be cultivated from a very young age. One book in this series tackles savings and the need for saving in a simple yet powerful manner. These deeply rooted habits will continue in the lives of these children even when they grow up to be adults. Likewise, all five books convey stories which are important to forming good habits in our lives, said Darshana Ralapanawe, Darshana publications.

Lal Pushpadeva, OMI. Touching on the life of Dr. Peries, Bishop Mendis said one could clearly see how God moulded him through his family, where his father, Dr. James Francis Peries and mother, Mrs. Winifred Jayasuriya, were devout Catholics (living at Sihagiri, Dehiwala), who showed great devotion to St. Mary.
Bishop Valence Mendis pointed out how Dr. Peries effectively portrayed the Sri Lakan countryside, villages, temples and the Buddhist influence on the lives of the people, as well as customs, languages and music through his films, adding that Dr. Peries was fortune to have received the wholehearted co-operation, assistance and encouragement of his wife, Sumithra, who was a pillar of strength to him during 53 years of wedded life. He said Dr.
Bishop Mendis added that Dr. Peries simple lifestyle, the unassuming ways and his humility in the wake of greatness, were worthy of emulation and that even though he did not create films to amass wealth, through his cinematic creations, he earned the greatest honour of being called the Father of Modern Sinhala Cinema.
After Holy Mass, eulogies were delivered by Nirasha Gomez, the granddaughter of Dr. Peries only sister Erica and Professor Carlo Fonseka.

Neranja pilots in mountain kingdom
Surrounded by the majestic Himalayas, the small country of Bhutan, enveloped by India on three sides of the world map and China on the other, is not easy to get to. It is gifted with a natural environment that is aloof with its rivers and valleys and is the only country in the world that has achieved carbon dioxideneutral status. The annual 1.5metric tons of carbon dioxide produced in Bhutan is absorbed completely by its vegetation that can absorb six metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.
Bhutan, which is fed by Mahayana Buddhism, plays an important role in religious matters. This country has five seasons, namely, Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring and Monsoon. The only ways to get to Bhutan are by air and by small narrow roads. There are no railway or shipping lines available. Bhutan, known as the island of Lightning Dragons in the ancient past, is still under royal rule. The present government is ruled by the dynasty of Wangchuck.
According to their constitution, the forests should have an area of 60 percent of the country and to date it has increased to 72 percent. The kingdom provides free electricity to the people and is currently researching to supply electricity for Winter, Solar and Hibernation. They develop the country from the concept of gross domestic happiness instead of gross domestic product because of the natural environment and the health of the country.
Their target has been to produce 100 percent chemical-free organic food by the year 2020, and by 2030, the release of greenhouse gases and the dumping of waste.
There are four airports in this kingdom and the most special airport is Paro Airport, which is the only international airport in Bhutan. In 1968, the Indian border authority built the airport for helicopter operations. The airport is located on the very deep basal Paro river with the highest mountain range at 18,000 feet above sea level.
The runway is about 1,402 to 1,964 metres. In 2010, an Airbus A319 aircraft and ATR 42 light aircraft landed in this airport, making it the countrys only international airport. But on March 4, 2018, a Malaysian carriers A320neo landed on a test flight, giving it a positive result.
A dangerous airport
Among the worlds challenging airports, Paro Airport is the most dangerous and challenging airport - only eight pilots in the world have qualified to fly in and out of this airport. We, as Sri Lankans, should be proud that there is a Sri Lankan pilot among them - Captain Neranja Paul Tiranagama. Captain Tiranagama is well experienced and lucky enough to see the beauty of Paro International Airport, the most beautiful and dangerous airport covered by the beautiful Himalayan glaciers and rivers every day, as he cruises to 39,000 feet. No man is an island and he does not climb that mountain alone. As Tiranagama said, he is thankful to all those who have helped him in his life to get here. More importantly, he has cultivated a habit of not giving up, and he never gave up his dream or anything he believed in.
There are ten dangerous airports in the world and five of them are categorised as the most dangerous. Tiranagama, who operates an Airbus A319 to and from Paro International Airport, says none of these airports are dangerous and its wrong to use the word, dangerous; he calls them very challenging.
The most dangerous airport in the world is Lukla Airport in Nepal, but only small turbo propeller aircraft take off and land here. At number 2 stands Courchevel International Airport in France and again it only operates small twin and single-engined turbo propeller aircraft. At number 3 is Toncontn International Airport in the Honduras, but when you look at the terrain with airport elevation, it is 1,005m (3,297ft) and the runway length is 2,163m (7,096 ft). It is not as dangerous as Paro International Airport in Bhutan.
At number 4, we have Princess Juliana International Airport in St. Maarten and yes, they operate big jets, but the reason for this airport to be dangerous is that the runway is too close to the beach and the elevation of this airport is 14 feet, which is relatively safe.
At number 5 we have Paro International Airport in Bhutan. When comparing Paro International Airport with all the above airports, one feels that it should be made number one as it operates all big Airbus jets, the terrain surrounding the airport is at 18,000 ft, and the airport has a shorter runway which is just 6,450 ft, with an elevation of 7,400 ft above sea level.
From SLAF to commercial piloting
Tiranagama started his career as a Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) pilot and later became a commercial jet pilot.
After his father, Karu Tiranagama who was a former Sri Lanka Army Officer influenced him into flying, he started his flying career at age 17 at Upali Aviation Services in Ratmalana under Captain Hirantha Perera. After obtaining his private pilot licence, he joined the Sri Lanka Air Force as a twin turbo prop pilot and from there was sent to USA and Canada for further training and upgrade.
He left the Air Force to become a commercial pilot and went to Turkey as an Airbus pilot. He obtained his A320 type rating in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and after three years of flying, due to his daughters illness, he took a break. His daughter had been sick, and after her successful recovery, he joined Bhutan Airlines as a first officer flying the Airbus A319.
Aviation itself is not dangerous but like the sea, it is unforgiving of those who are not capable, neglectful or careless- these were the first words from his instructor Captain Hirantha Perera, during his initial flight training as a student pilot at Upali Aviation Services, said Tiranagama, and he has never forgotten these words.
He later obtained advanced training and guidance under the greatest and legendary pilot in Sri Lankan aviation history - Captain Elmo Jayawardena and his friend Captain Deepal Pinto Hewagama. He was also trained by Captain Dulip de Alwis, Captain Jawed Aleem, Captain Mohan Pragasam and Air Canada pilot Captain Steve St. Pierre and Bhutan Airlines pilots Captain Sangay Wanchuk, Captain Chenga, and Captain Karma Dupchu.
Tiranagama said that what thrills him most in his job was the take-offs and landings, but mostly the take-off, because you used almost maximum power during the take-off and the agility and power the engines produce runs through your entire body, The feeling you get from that is beyond words and its unimaginable.
Having become one of the best pilots around, Tiranagama says he still has many dreams to accomplish. They are his responsibilities rather than dreams. He is determined to do something good before his time runs out. His dream after his retirement is to move to his hometown in Galle or someplace cold in Sri Lanka and build his own school for less-fortunate children and teach them everything he can with the help of the Canadian government and some close friends.
His life is simple, his story is clear.

Norwegian assistance to map countrys marine resources
Norwegian State Secretary for Development Cooperation, Jens Frolich Holte, concluded a three-day visit to Sri Lanka last Saturday (23).
Discussions focused on shared interests and common challenges of sustainable use of the oceans and management of marine litter, ongoing cooperation in the fisheries sector, marine spatial planning, progress in peace building and reconciliation, and economic development, including promotion of two-way tourism, between the two countries.
State Secretary Holte's visit to Sri Lanka took place in the context of following up on agreed areas of cooperation during bilateral discussions that took place between President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg in Colombo in August 2016.
The visit coincided with the arrival of the Norwegian Marine Research Vessel Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, one of the most advanced research vessels in the world (owned by NORAD and jointly operatedby the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR) and the University of Bergen (UIB)).
The vessel will undertake a 26 day research journey around Sri Lanka and help map marine resources. Assistance to survey Sri Lanka's fish resources and marine eco-system using the research vessel including technical assistance to develop a national fisheries policy framework are important elements of Sri Lanka - Norway cooperation in the fisheries sector.

Nottinghamshire wrap up emphatic win over Essex
LONDON, Saturday: Defending champions Essex suffered their second loss of 2018 as Nottinghamshire completed a 301-run win on the final morning at Chelmsford. After resuming on 88-4, the home side survived for just 23.5 overs before being bowled out for 139.
Ravi Bopara only added six to his overnight 33 not out before being caught behind off Matt Milnes (4-44).
Last-wicket pair Neil Wagner and Matt Quinn faced 50 dot balls before Wagner finally edged Samit Patel to slip.
The victory was Nottinghamshires fourth of the season and the 23 points earned lifted them to second in the Division One table, 13 points behind leaders Surrey. Having been set 441 to win, Essexs slim chances of victory disappeared on the third evening as they lost four wickets before the close, including Alastair Cook for a duck.
Worcestershire registered their first Championship win of the summer as they beat Lancashire by 202 runs on the final day at New Road.
Lancashires last four wickets went down after lunch for one run, three to Ed Barnard (4-95), as they were bowled out for 399.
Keaton Jennings was Lancashires main hope of batting out time for a draw, but he was bowled by Patrick Brown. England opener Jennings made 177 from 295 balls, including 27 fours. But he could do nothing about a delivery from Brown which seemed to keep a little low and hit his off stump.
His downfall left Lancashire 359-6 at lunch, having resumed day four on 269-4 after being set a target of 602, but their fourth defeat of the season was not long in coming after the restart.
Warwickshire made a gallant attempt to set a new Championship run-chase record before losing to Kent by 73 runs.
Chasing 519 to win at Tunbridge Wells, Ian Bell and Dom Sibley extended their second-wicket partnership to 260. Sibley was caught at slip before lunch for 104 and Ivan Thomas claimed the crucial scalp of Bell after the break, trapping him lbw for 172.
Adam Hose continued the chase with 65, but Joe Denly took three wickets in six balls as they were all out for 445.
Warwickshire remain top of Division Two despite losing their unbeaten record, while Kents fourth win lifted them back into second place, just eight points behind.
Middlesex held their nerve to beat Leicestershire by one wicket following a tense final-day run chase.
The visitors chances of reaching their target of 381 appeared in the balance when Stevie Eskinazi was run out on 97 as they went from 82-3 to 197-6. Hilton Cartwright kept their hopes alive but Ben Raine removed him lbw for 80, leaving Middlesex requiring another 38 runs with two wickets remaining. James Harris (58 not out) hit a four to deny the Foxes a third successive win.
Yorkshire batted through the final day at the Ageas Bowl without undue difficulty to secure a draw in their Championship game against Hampshire.
The home side had half a chance after dismissing Gary Ballance (21) and Cheteshwar Pujara (32) early. But teenager Harry Brook put on 108 with Jack Leaning before he was unluckily run out by a deflection into the stumps at the bowlers end for 68. Leaning made 54 not out before the game ended when Yorkshire declared on 263-6.
Derbyshire clung on for an unlikely draw with a score of147-8 as tail-ender Tony Palladino led the late resistance against Glamorgan at St Helens.
Palladino (30 not out) and Duanne Olivier blocked out the last 13 overs after Michael Hogan claimed 4-43. Earlier Usman Khawaja (126) and Kiran Carlson (152) allowed Glamorgan to declare at 403-7. Derbyshire were set 325 in 63 overs but they toiled apart from Wayne Madsens 55 before their late resistance.

## Title: OIL PALM TO REPLACE RUBBER
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, June 25, 2018 - 01:00
OIL PALM TO REPLACE RUBBER
During the past few weeks, there were reports in the local press that some of the rubber estates under the management of plantation companies are being converted to oil palm plantations. In my personal opinion as the longest served former Director of the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka, when scientific factors affecting the environment and the best performing rubber end products manufacturing industry in the country are considered, this is a dangerous decision taken by the authorities, without taking the environmental impact and the economic impact of this crop diversification.
In most of the rubber estates under private management, as I have highlighted in my earlier press reports, and at the CRT seminar organised by the Ministry of Plantation Industries, large extents of revenue areas of rubber estates have been ruined by over-tapping and stimulation, totally ignoring the recommendations of the RRI. There is no alternative for the planters in charge of those estates now to overcome this problem without replanting them at a very high cost.
Even the scientists of the RRI have reported that, in most of the plantations under private management, nearly 50% of the trees of ages between 10 to 15 years are already either tapping panel dried or totally tapped out. This is purely due to over-exploitation.
This is a disaster in the rubber plantations today and converting such clearings into oil palm in order to overcome this problem created by bad management is asking for more trouble. It would definitely put the rubber-based value-added product industry, which earns over the US $ 1.25 billion to Sri Lanka annually, in deep trouble. Of the agricultural products of Sri Lanka, rubber is the only commodity that is converted into reasonable value-added products. It provides employment to over 30,000 skilled workers of the country while earning a reputation for Sri Lanka as a producer of world-recognized end products such as solid tyres, examination and surgical gloves, rubber flooring, engine components and footwear.
At present Sri Lanka imports nearly 55,000 Mt of raw rubber and latex annually from Asian countries to cater to the rubber products industry, as our rubber annual production has fallen to about 69,000 Mt in 2016, compared to 130,000 Mt produced a few years before that. Can we continue to import raw rubber into Sri Lanka in the future competing with the giants in the rubber products industry in the world, namely China the largest consumer, India the third largest and Japan the fourth largest consumer, when there is a competition for raw materials in the Asian rubber market How many of you are aware that 75% of the total NR production in the world is consumed in Asia now That is why we have been requesting authorities to grow more rubber in the country including intermediate and dry zone as well.
It is true that palm oil is imported to meet the shortfall of edible oils in the country. Out of the 160,000 Mt of edible oil that Sri Lanka needs annually, coconut oil provides only about 55,000 Mt and the balance requirement is met by imported vegetable oils, mainly palm oil. Nobody knows the real quality of the vegetable oils imported into the country.
European and US consumers
There was a misconception in the mid nineteen eighties that coconut oil is harmful to human health. That was a problem associated with coconut oil extracted and purified by improper rash methods. Due to that, the formation of Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) during the drying of coconut kernels at high temperature in kilns or during bleaching of crude oil extracted from contaminated and discoloured copra at high temperature using chemicals is unavoidable. Fortunately, the scientists in Sri Lanka have been able to find a method to eliminate this toxic PAH formation by drying copra at low temperature using a drying chamber and also without using chemicals for bleaching, because coconut oil thus produced is white in colour and hence bleaching is not necessary. This health safe product is now available in the market as Physically Extracted coconut oil.
They have even been able to change SLS standards of edible coconut oils by introducing new parameters such as maximum PAH value and peroxide values to convince the European and US consumers that are physically extracted coconut oil is the safest edible oil in the market.
Earlier, heart patients were not allowed to consume coconut oil because of the presence of PAH, and due to its high LDL value. But, today Europe and the US have accepted properly extracted coconut oil as the healthiest edible oil in the market and as a result; all Kentucky food outlets in UK and US have reverted back to the use of coconut oil. Based on this development, in addition to its use for edible purposes, it finds use even in pharmaceutical industry. Even in the GPN spray recommended as the first aid for heart patients before reaching a hospital, cleanly extracted coconut oil is used as the solvent because medium chain triglycerides in coconut oil have the ability to supply oxygen to the brain fastest.
Palm oil is substituted in cooking oils, either to bring the price down, or as a cheap oil substitute, but not due to any health benefits of it. Also, the use of crude palm oil is restricted to mix with edible oils. However, I am not suggesting that palm oil imports should be restricted or the expansion of oil palm plantations in the country should be stopped; but, based on the above technical facts, none of the rubber estates in the South of Sri Lanka should be converted to oil palm or to any other crop because they are low yielding. If they are not meeting the expected productivity, it is either due to the inefficiency or the negligence of the management of those estates.
All such estates have been established over75 years ago, after careful examination of their soil conditions and the rainfall distribution patterns etc by the RRI. Hence, if they have been properly managed, they should give good rubber yields even today. This is very clear from the lower productivity reported by these estates, compared to the small farms of smallholders.
Agricultural crops
The presence of main plant nutrients, namely Nitrogen, Potassium Magnesium and Phosphorous in the rubber harvested is insignificant, compared to any other agricultural crop, particularly palm oil. Further, during the wintering period, rubber tree returns all nutrients back to the soil, and that is why rubber plantations are identified as the best replacement for rain forests. The situation with regard to oil palm is quite different. After two to three rounds of planting, the soil is depleted of all important nutrients, making the land unsuitable for any other crop.
Therefore, with better agricultural practices, such estates with low productivity could be converted to more productive and sustainable estates. If you take the example of Dartonfield estate where RRI is situated, which was one of the lowest yielding estates in the country in the mid nineteen nineties and hence was not wanted by any private company to manage. When it was advertised there were no bidders to take over. But when the management of the estate was given to the scientists by the ministry, within eighteen months they were able to convert it into a profitable venture by tremendously increasing its productivity and by minimizing the tapping cost.
Any land in Sri Lanka so far unutilized for planting a crop, particularly marshy lands in the very wet zone of the country, could be converted to oil palm to meet the edible oil shortfall and also to provide oil required for the soap industry etc.RRI will definitely provide their fullest corporation for that.
The only plus factor for oil palm over rubber as plantation crop is its lower labour utilization. But, when all other factors are considered, rubber is a wonder crop for Sri Lanka plantations. Rubber trees provide firewood requirement for tea drying and rubber drying, bakery industry brick lime and for tile industries. In such industries, particularly in the bakery industry, if other types of wood are used, various flavours imparted to the bread by the firewood used make the bread unsuitable for consumption. Tea industry alone utilizes over 60% of the total rubber wood available annually. Even tile and brick makers prefer to use rubberwood in their furnace, because of the ability to control heat in the furnace when rubberwood is used, compared to other types of wood. Boron treated rubberwood can be used to make furniture. In Malaysia, the income generated from rubberwood furniture and kitchen utensil export is higher than the income generated from rubber products export.
On the other hand, what can you do with the trunk of oil palm It can only be used to make the pestle (Molgas) for rice pounding. Rest of the trunk, when allowed to decay, breeds beetles destroy coconut plantations. Effluent released by palm oil factories, which amounts to nearly 75%ofthefruit weight, is one of the most difficult factory effluents to treat before discharging to lands. The effluent treatment is a problem in rubber industry too, but it is not as bad as in the case of oil palm. This palm oil effluent is virtually a poison for the dogs and birds.
The reason for not reaching expected yields in rubber estates is poor management practices, mainly not applying recommended fertilizer doses, and poor weed control.
Fertilizer requirement
Fertilizer applications are not done according to recommendations because of the high cost. Fortunately, from last month, the prices of urea and MOP, which are the two main components in a fertilizer mixture have been reduced by the government by over 40%. Therefore, now if the correct manuring is done, the productivity of estates can be improved to reach at least the level of small holdings.
Those who promote replacing of rubber with oil palm should be aware that the fertilizer requirement for oil palm is much higher than the requirement for rubber, according to the recommendations of the respective research institutes; they are not equal based on the number of plants planted in an acre of land. Oil palm, only 65 per acre, while 200 rubber plants are planted per acre. But, when it comes to tapping the c panel after 12 years of tapping, a number of trees needed to be manured drops down to about 140. Then can the little saving on labour and the slightly higher price of palm oil in the market offset the higher fertilizer cost For your information, I give below the amounts of nutrients recommended for the two crops by the respective research institutes.
From these figures, it is clear that the two major imported components Nitrogen (N) and Potassium (K) in the fertilizer recommended for oil palm are over two times and over five times more than the recommendation for rubber, respectively. That is assuming that all 200 trees will remain yielding throughout. But, RRI recommends only 140 trees need manuring while reaching the c panel after 12 years of tapping. The situation with regard to Phosphorous (P) and Magnesium (Mg) too are the same, but we need not bother too much about them as they are available locally. However, even Eppawala Rock Phosphate which is the local source of P is price wise very close to the price of N and K fertilizers. At the price of fertilizer in the local market today, the cost of fertilizer per acre of oil palm for a year is over four times the cost of fertilizer for an acre of rubber.
The main complaint of the villagers and the local government authorities in oil palm planted areas in Sri Lanka is that the traditional sources of water in those areas have gone dry after oil palm plantation. I am certain that there is some truth in this complaint because in Malaysia, due to the same reason, there is a restriction for planting oil palm in paddy cultivated areas of the country.
When internationally published water transpiration rates for the two crops are considered, during dry seasons the transpiration rate from oil palm trees rise up to 7.5 mm per day while the transpiration rate of rubber is reduced to a third of that, 2.5 mm per day.
According to hydrology experts who visited Sri Lanka in the past, when the forest reserves in the country have depleted to 16.5%, we get fair, but very uneven weather conditions in the country, thanks to 125000Ha of rubber planted all over. They felt that the two rivers flowing down from Sripada, Kelani Ganga and Kalu Ganga would have dried by now if not for the rubber plantations on either side of the two rivers, down from Sripada to at least Awissawella area.
Isnt it unfortunate that we are going to sacrifice the rubber cultivations that provide a huge foreign exchange income to the country while providing employment to over 250,000 estate workers and about another 30,000 skilled people of the country, purely to fill the shortfall of oil for all purposes, ignoring the ecological impact of this foolish crop diversification If that happens are we going to import drinking water too from South East Asia, along with shiploads of palm oil Beware!

June 22, 1941
Operation Barbarossa
A time-minded people,
the doctor repeated.
Yes, Sir, said Joseph.
Time and machines.
Yes, Sir.
The Germans hurry towards their destiny as though it would not wait; they push the rolling world along with their shoulders.
John Steinbeck -The Moon is Down
When Adolf Hitler founded his third Reich in January of 1933 there was a decisive quickening of history towards the cataclysmic Second World War. The strong capable race had embraced the assertive philosophy of the Nationalist Socialist Party of Hitler; as events would show a portentous development for the rest of the world.
Humbled, despite their mighty efforts in the First World War, betrayal by both external as well as internal forces, their once strong and orderly country was reduced to near anarchy. To many Germans in 1933, the National Socialist Party of Hitler seemed like the benediction the nation had prayed for.
By 1939, in six short years, the evident abilities of the disciplined Germans had once again created a powerful nation with an awesome military machine. The martial race was armed and ready. Led by its extraordinarily able General Staff, which both friend and foe considered a corps delite, Hitlers Wehrmacht was easily the best fighting machine in the world at the time. It was said of the German officer class that they were men of outstanding intellectual aptitude and physical stamina, governed by a code of ascetic self-discipline. Their strength lay in their complete self-effacement to the point of anonymity. In times of peace, they were expected to devote themselves wholly to knowledge and education. In war, outstanding bravery and capability were demanded of them.
As the war drums rolled across Europe in 1939-40, the aggressive German army triumphed with surprising ease over once vaunted armies of Poland, France and other European nations. In the case of the French, they in fact out-numbered the Germans in many strategic aspects such as in men and tanks. But in military thinking, they seemed stuck in earlier wars, trench warfare or even the Napoleonic times when the infantry or the cavalry charge won the day. The Germans, on the other hand, were ready for mobile warfare fought with mechanized armoured forces, closely supported by deadly accurate air and artillery power, making optimum use of advanced technology such as the radio for real-time communication. The French were conquered in a few short weeks. The British were never more thankful for the English Channel! After a half-hearted attempt to subdue the stubborn island with air power alone, Hitler turned his eyes to the east. The stage was now set for the greatest human conflict in history.
Russian weather conditions
The Soviet Union, the largest country in the world, and which perhaps maintained the biggest army at the time, was shrouded in mystery. The Stalinist system did not provide statistics of its military strength at information bureaus. But it was obvious that in comparison to Western Europe the conditions in the Soviet Union were poor and primitive. The Russian roads were not anything like what the motorized German army had used in Europe. There were very few all-weather roads in the country proving a terrible obstacle in bad Russian weather conditions. And unlike other countries the Germans had vanquished in the previous summers, the Soviet Union was much too large to be brought under in one aggressive dash.
But the German army, full of confidence after its remarkable achievements in the previous summer campaigns, had come to believe that nothing was impossible for the German soldier. Addressing the higher echelons of the army Hitler boastfully predicted that when Operation Barbarossa, the name given to the German plan for the impending campaign against the Soviet Union, commenced The world will hold its breath. One good kick on the door and the entire rotten structure will collapse he further emphasized his conviction that the Soviet Union was no match for the proven, battle-hardened German war machine. This confidence was reflected in the astonishing fact that the German army launched the war against the Soviet Union where it was expected to conquer an area of about one million square miles in one summer campaign with just a few more divisions more than it had deployed in the previous summer against France, a country of approximately 150,000 square miles.
For the good kick on the door the Germans gathered nearly four million soldiers on the long Russian border. Provided air cover by the vigorous Luftwaffe, supported by nearly four thousand pieces of heavy artillery and most importantly given the cutting impetus by the brilliantly led panzer divisions, the German armys campaign in the East was indeed going to open with a breathtaking fury.
In view of the immense land area, it had to conquer with human resources Germany could not afford to keep in uniform for too long, the Wehrmacht had to gain a decisive result in that summer of 1941.With this strategic goal in mind its military planners aimed at fatally wounding the Red army west of the Dnieper River. Committing themselves to a huge undertaking with a numerically weaker army and limited resources, the Germans were gambling on the skills and capabilities of its soldiers to bring them a quick victory.
For operational purposes, they divided their forces into three large army groups. The Army Group North under the command of Field Marshal von Leeb was to capture the Baltic area and Leningrad (St Petersburg). The Army Group Centre under Field Marshal von Bock was to drive to Moscow through the Russian heartland. Field Marshal von Rundstedt leading the Army Group South was to bring fertile Ukraine under its heel.
Ill-fated invasion of Russia
After a few nervous postponements, the date for the opening of the campaign was fixed for June 22, the same day that Napoleon, in 1812, launched his ill-fated invasion of Russia. Starting their eastward thrust at about 3 a.m. on that day the German war machine once again gave an almost flawless display of its awesome prowess. Within forty-eight hours more than two thousand Russian fighter planes were down. The German Panzer divisions exploiting the gaps punched in the defensive barriers of the Russians by their opening salvos drove on eastward relentlessly with the aim of achieving strategic dominance, leaving the task of destroying the shocked and confused stragglers of the enemy forces to the rapidly following infantry divisions.
By mid-July, in just three weeks of fighting, Russians had lost 3,500 tanks, 6,000 planes and more than two million men. The famous German tank commander General Heinz Guderian leading a powerfully armoured corp attached to the Army Group Centre noted in a memorandum that the Russians were severely hampered by political demands of the State leadership and suffered a basic fear of taking responsibility. This, combined with bad coordination meant that orders to carry out necessary measures, counter-measures in particular, are issued too late. Soviet tank forces were insufficiently trained and lacked intelligence and initiative during the offensive.
In these early stages of the war to many observers, it appeared that the Wehrmacht had once again delivered a death blow to a powerful adversary well before it could even fully comprehend the attackers diabolical intentions.
Although German propaganda portrayed the average Russian as a semi-Asiatic primitive of sub-human qualities and no match in the battlefield to the masterful Teutons it did not take long for the German soldiers to realize that in the Russian vastness they were facing a fight to the death with this Slav/Mongol race. On that bloody battlefield German skills confronted Russian stubbornness, the attackers courage was met by the defenders recklessness, and the conquerors contempt was matched by the hatred of resisters. The eastern campaign that began so dazzlingly for the invader on June 22, 1941 raged on in the mind-boggling vastness of Russia until mid-1945. The young soldiers of the two nations were locked in a war of savagery on a scale rarely witnessed in human conflict. Russia alone suffered more than twenty million deaths in those four years of relentless fighting.
Undeniable heroism
Nazism and Communism, the ideologies professed by the two armies that clashed with such bitterness in 1941, are dead in these two countries today. Germany has rebuilt and is one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Russia after her failed experiment with Communism is yet struggling to find a place in world affairs that befits its size and potential. But they both surely remember the four years when the better of these two brave nations fought on a terrible battlefield and often died a soldiers death.
War is a terrible, tragic, and most times a wasteful thing. But paradoxically, war often brings out some of the best qualities in the man. The titanic clash that began in that summer of 1941 demanded of the combatants, superhuman effort, amazing physical endurance, boundless courage, iron discipline, selfless comradeship and finally the unflinching sacrificing of oneself. The stage and the human actors of that bloody drama to this day inspire awe by its sheer scale, intensity, wickedness as well as its undeniable heroism.
Two things have altered not, since first the world began, the beauty of the wild green earth, and the bravery of man.

Parkinsons drugs may turn patients into compulsive gamblers
Common drugs taken by thousands of patients battling Parkinsons may turn them into compulsive gamblers, research warns.
New evidence has uncovered a link between dopamine agonists and problems with controlling irresistible urges. Binge eating, frequent shopping and compulsive sexual behaviours were also listed as possible compulsive effects of the Parkinsons drugs.
French researchers believe more than half of patients taking the drugs to combat their condition may succumb to impulse control disorders. About 127,000 people in the UK have Parkinsons, while figures suggest there are around one million sufferers in the US.
Dopamine, a chemical in the brain that regulates movement, is gradually reduced in patients with the progressive neurological condition. It can be treated with levodopa, which converts to dopamine in the brain, or with dopamine agonists, which work by activating dopamine receptors.
Researchers at the Sorbonne University in Paris studied 411 patients who had been diagnosed with Parkinsons to make the conclusion. Volunteers were followed for an average of three years and were quizzed about impulse control disorders, such as compulsive shopping.
A staggering difference was noted in the rates of compulsive behaviour between patients who had taken the drugs and those who hadnt.
For those who had never used the drugs, 12 per cent had gone on to struggle with the disorders - compared to 52 per cent in the other group. The researchers also uncovered the risk of impulse control disorders was greater for those on higher doses of dopamine agonists.
The drugs pramipexole and ropinirole were the two medications associated with the highest risk of developing the disorders. A total of 30 people with impulse control disorders who stopped taking dopamine agonists were also followed during the study. The disorders gradually stopped over time, with half of the people no longer having issues after a year, the researchers noted.
Dr Jean-Christophe Corvol, study author, published the findings of the trial in the journal Neurology. He said: Our study suggests that impulse control disorders are even more common than we thought in people who take dopamine agonists. These disorders can lead to serious financial, legal and social and psychological problems.

PARKINSONS - THE INCURABLE DISEASE
Parkinsons disease affects one in 500 people, and around 127,000 people in the UK live with the condition.
Figures also suggest one million Americans also suffer.
It causes muscle stiffness, slowness of movement, tremors, sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue, an impaired quality of life and can lead to severe disability.
It is a progressive neurological condition that destroys cells in the part of the brain that controls movement.
Sufferers are known to have diminished supplies of dopamine because nerve cells that make it have died.
There is currently no cure and no way of stopping the progression of the disease, but hundreds of scientific trials are underway to try and change that.
The disease claimed the life of boxing legend Muhammad Ali in 2016. www.dailymail.co.uk

Petes beat Wesley to set up final clash with Joes
St.Peters College Bambalapitiya star player and their captain cum play maker - fly half Kenneth Wimaladasa had an exceptional game both in attack and defence as well as his spectacular leadership where he led from the front scoring 13 points in their semi-final win over Wesley College yesterday at the Sugathadasa Stadium to set up a final clash against traditional rivals St Josephs College next weekend in the Milo A Division inter-schools Presidents trophy knockout rugby tournament.
|Wimaladasas individual brilliance made him the unsung hero of their 23 points (2 tries, 2 conversions, 3 penalties) to 13 (1 try, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) victory over Wesley. At half time the Peterites led 10-7.
St. Peters forwards fought like terriers in the entire match combining effectively with their three quarters giving no room for their opponent - winning all the good ball and line outs to finally come out on top.
Peterites scored first in the third minute of the game with a 35-metre penalty slotted in by skipper Kenneth Wimaladasa and went into a 3-nil lead.
In the ninth minute of play Wesley grabbed the lead when full back Murshid Subair out foxed and went through the Peterite defence to score a try. He made the conversion himself for Wesley to lead 7-3.
St. Peters regained the lead in the 19th minute and went ahead 10-7 when winger Shenal Silva collected the ball from a sweeping three quarter move and dived over to score a try near the left corner flag, Wimaladasa fired across a spectacular touch line conversion.
At lemons the score stood at 10-7 in favour of St.Peters.
After the turn around with pressure mounting on the Wesleyites, the Peterites added more pressure by scoring in the 40th minute when prop forward Abdulla Faiz barged through for a try off a ruck. Wimaladasa made the conversion to increase the score to 17-7
In the 50th minute of play Wesley cut down the lead to 17-10 when fly half Tharindhu Walpitage put over a simple 25 metre penalty.
Peters increased their lead to 20-10 with a superb 35 metre penalty slotted in by Wimaladasa in the 55th minute.
Within two minutes Walpitage put over another simple 20 metre penalty to close the margin to 20-13.
The Peterites who had an outstanding game sealed the match in the dying stages when captain Wimaladasa who had a fine game with a 100% record with his boot slotted in the penalty to make the score 23-13.
It was a fantastic win for St. Peters College who reached the knockout final after a lapse of eight years under veteran head coach Sanath Martis who was also their coach when they achieved that feat in 2010.

P&G plans new strategy to  attract younger consumers
United States-based consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble, which has enjoyed three decades of success in China, is refreshing its development strategy to cater to the nations increasingly demanding younger generation of consumers.
P&G was among the first batch of multinational companies that entered into China. The company established its first joint venture in Guangzhou in 1988, and has now established a total of nine manufacturing plants and one research and development center in the country, with its products used by countless Chinese families.
Along with the rapid growth of Chinas economy, the needs and preferences of Chinese consumers have undergone tremendous changes, and people who were born in the 2000s have become a major force in consumer trends.
He Yabin, vice-president of Marketing and Media at P&G Greater China, said the younger generation of consumers prefer personalized and diversified products. He used pretty looks and charming intrinsic value to describe product appeal among those young consumers.
The company is using a variety of strategies to entice younger consumers: attractive product design and packaging, the use of futuristic technology and fashionable language, to name a few.
Based on big data research, strong products and marketing innovation strengths, we are starting to build new brands, which are young, personalized and can resonate with consumers, He said.
A newly introduced Crest dental device, for example, caters to consumers who pursue fashionable, cool technology in daily life. The advanced product uses the same cold light whitening technology from an American professional dentistry institution to quickly remove tooth stains and whiten teeth. Instead of running to the dental institution, people can enjoy dental beauty without leaving home, a prospect that has gained the attention of many young consumers.
Another innovation from P&G is the Digital Shelf, which can capture the attention of consumers as they walk by. The Digital Shelf presents personalized multimedia content to consumers, even allowing them to better understand their own skin condition.

Prime Minister Ranil Wckremesinghe called all followers of Buddha to return to the eternal truth and to shed light on their way of thinking to achieve deeper understanding this Poson.
He said this in a message released today in commemoration of Poson.
Furthermore, the Premier said, Buddhism is the greatest philosophy to enrich one's spirituality. The four sublime states of the mind; Metta, Karuna, Muditha, and Upekkha, which stand for loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity, teach us peace, reconciliation and spiritual calmness through the teachings of the Buddha.
During the 3rd Century BC, Arahant Mahinda introduced the doctrine of Buddhism on a Poson Full Moon day. From this moment we inherited new knowledge which enabled our society to flourish.

Putin invites two Koreas to economic summit
RUSSIA: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday invited his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in to an economic forum in Vladivostok in September, confirming his plans to host the leaders of both Koreas in Russia.
We would be happy to see you as an honorary guest at the Vladivostok forum which starts on September 11, Putin told Moon during a press conference after they held talks in Moscow.
The Russian leader has also invited North Koreas Kim Jong Un to the event, as well as the leaders of China and Japan.
So far, only Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has confirmed his attendance.
On Friday Russian media reported that Kim has not yet responded to the Kremlins invitation.
There has not been an answer yet, Putins aide Yury Ushakov was quoted as saying by TASS news agency.
During his press conference with Moon, Putin said he welcomed a recent historic summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump in Singapore, when the two leaders signed a joint document calling for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
We hope this will allow tensions to be significantly reduced in the Korean peninsula and in the future create conditions for the formation of a sustainable security system in the region, he said.
During his three-day visit, Moon is also expected to watch South Koreas World Cup match against Mexico on Saturday in the city of Rostov-on-Don. - AFP

Queiroz, Iran in Ronaldos crosshairs as Portugal target last 16
SARANSK, Russia, Saturday - Cristiano Ronaldo will look to fire his country into the last 16 of the World Cup on Monday at the expense of former Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz and Iran.
Ronaldo and Queiroz are both appearing at their fourth World Cup, as player and coach respectively, and their relationship dates back to the Portugal captains arrival as a teenager at Manchester United in 2003.
The 65-year-old served as Alex Fergusons assistant over two spells either side of a brief stint in charge of Real Madrid, the club Ronaldo joined in 2009 in a deal Queiroz helped facilitate.
But their relationship soured following a second-round exit to Spain at the 2010 World Cup, after which Ronaldo suggested Queiroz was to blame for the defeat.
Portugal then crashed out in the group stage four years ago in Brazil, but Ronaldo is single-handedly leading their quest in Russia with all four of his teams goals so far.
Our expectation is to continue our work and try to improve in the group phase, Ronaldo said after his early strike over Morocco left Portugal level on four points with Spain at the top of Group B.
Were almost there (knockout stages) and then well see.
Ronaldo is level with Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku in the race for the golden boot, leaving eternal rival Lionel Messi in the dust as Argentina scrap to stay in the competition.
Portugal coach Fernando Santos compared his talisman to a bottle of Port wine, marvelling at the 33-year-olds ability to refine his game with age.
Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone, the former Argentina midfielder, even indicated he would prefer to have Ronaldo rather than Messi in his team.
Messi is very good, but it is clear that he is very good because he is surrounded by extraordinary players (at Barcelona), Simeone said, in an audio recording published by Spanish media outlets.
The question I ask is if you have to choose between Messi and Ronaldo in a normal team, who would you choose
Portugal defender Pepe, a long-time team-mate of Ronaldos at Real, said it was a privilege for the country to have a player such as the five-time Ballon dOr winner.
He is getting better every year, Manchester City winger Bernardo Silva opined after Ronaldos hat-trick in an opening 3-3 draw with Spain.
People were waiting for him to get old and play worse, but he is only improving.
Ronaldo scored a late penalty to seal a 2-0 win over Iran when the two sides last met, at the 2006 World Cup, and Portugal will hope for further inspiration from the second highest goalscorer in international history.  AFP

Reviving indigenous rice
Himani Wijetunge about three decades back rose to fame as Sri Lankas sole manufacturer of body armour. During the period of war - the body armour she produced with help from her husband Ajitha Wijetunge, a former marine engineer, not only helped to protect the lives of the soldiers who waged battle with terrorists but also helped save foreign exchange as the military earlier used to import body armour at a much higher price.
According to Himani producing body armour locally and promoting it as a viable alternative to those imported was a battle itself, which had been won ultimately. Today in the aftermath of the war Himani, who dont take no for an answer, is waging another battle which is to preserve and promote traditional paddy farming and indigenous rice varieties.
Himani Wijetunge Pictures by Rukmal Gamage
Himani has bought several acres of fallow paddy land in a highly residential area in Kalalgoda, Thalawathugoda in the suburbs of Colombo and is currently cultivating many indigenous rice varieties using traditional farming methods sans harmful agrochemicals.
I had a passion for cultivation from a young age, but I never had an opportunity to make my dream a reality. By transforming this fallow paddy land to a cultivable land, I have fulfilled that dream, Himani says whilst lovingly touching the paddy leaves.
According to Himani applying traditional wisdom in farming will help in conserving indigenous paddy varieties that are under threat of extinction. She also says some indigenous paddy varieties are disease and drought-resistant and in the past people believed that they contain medicinal properties.
Traditional rice was considered as one of the most nutritious staple foods and traditional rice varieties were known among our forefathers for their nutritional and medicinal purposes. I intend to buy more fallow paddy land and make them cultivable and grow these varieties using traditional methods, she said.
Managing Director of several companies, especially in the garment sector Himani was known within the business circle and media for her courageous journey to promote her company product, the locally made body armour during the period of war.
According to Himani the business had its origins in a small family-run garments factory stitching pillowcases. At that time, almost everything used in the war was imported, even the uniforms worn by soldiers. We tried to promote our body armour and finally succeeded as it was something that could be made locally and helped save foreign exchange.
Passion is a driving force in my everyday life and the reason I chose a business career. Im not fond of the mediocre and well-beaten paths and decided, at an early age, that I wanted to be in a profession I could lose my heart to, where I could be creative, where I could follow my passion and, above all, do something that would make me happy she says.
I was already dreaming of becoming a business woman when I was seven  day in, day out, Id watch my father, leave the house to do business. I see business as something exciting and a challenge. Youve got to be willing to go the extra mile, to give up everything to achieve your goal and to dream the impossible. Youve got to have focus. You must not be too worried about the opinions of others. And youve got to be authentic. Dreaming big If youve set your sights on surpassing the mediocre, the chances are that youre going to come up against your fair share of obstacles along the way. My passion for new ventures and new challenges is still intact, she added while noting she will strive for new innovations in business as well as in indigenous farming.
As a citizen of this country we have a duty by the nation. Though we engaged in a business I have a strong feeling that we did our duty towards the country by producing top body armour locally to supply to the Security Forces and saved much needed foreign exchange for the government. I think that helped save many lives in the battlefront. In the same way, I feel that I also can do something to the nation at least in a small way by preserving the paddy cultivations and its traditions, she says explaining her efforts and future aims in her life.

Russia ride wave of World Cup euphoria into Uruguay clash
MOSCOW, Saturday - World Cup hosts Russia are surfing a wave of national euphoria as they head into Mondays encounter against two-time champions Uruguay after delighting their fans with a scintillating start to the tournament.
Written off as no-hopers before the World Cup, Russia head to the Volga River city of Samara for a game which will see the winner secure top spot in Group A following the elimination of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
A draw would also be good enough to give Russia first place, thanks to the eight goals from two matches that have made believers out of fans used to decades of World Cup futility.
Both teams then face the likely prospect of going up against either Spain or Cristiano Ronaldos Portugal in the last 16 -- although underdogs Iran are still in the running in a tight Group B.
Uruguay however are likely to provide the type of stern test Russia will need to overcome if they are launch an extended run in the knockout rounds.
Yet the hosts are brimming with confidence having made it past the group stage of a World Cup for the first time since the Soviet Union lost to Belgium in the last 16 in 1986.
Russia had won just two of nine World Cup matches before kicking off the most watched event on the planet with a 5-0 rout of the Saudis.
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko -- the former sports minister who still oversees football in an unofficial capacity -- said the squad had no right to relax.
Our mission has still not been accomplished, Mutko said after watching a team training session on the outskirts of a muggy Moscow.
We would like to get into the knockout stage from first place.
Russia followed their Saudi thrashing by limiting Egypts star striker Mohamed Salah -- nursing a shoulder injury but always dangerous -- to one goal in an impressive 3-1 win last Tuesday in Saint Petersburg.
Salah was contained by a Russian defence that had lost three starters and was forced to call back 38-year-old Sergei Ignashevich from international retirement.
Ignashevich turns 39 on the eve of the final on July 15 that Russia retain improbable dreams of playing in. Few believe they will.
A poll conducted in the wake of their win over Egypt showed just 14 percent think Russia can lift the trophy.
It was 11 percent when coach Stanislav Cherchesovs charges were plodding their wave through a seven-match winless streak that saw their ranking slip to a tournament-worst 70th.
But Cherchesov always thought Russia were underrated and a triumph over Uruguays Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani would do more to prove the mustachioed manager right.
It would also see Russia looking more confidently at the permutations of whom they might encounter in the quarter-finals.
The possibilities there range from France and Argentina to an impressive looking Croatia.
Midfielder Denis Cheryshev has been one of the World Cups big discoveries and a natural leader on a team without stars.
We have to be very happy with our wins, said the 27-year-old. But but this is just the start.  AFP

Sampanthan calls for moderate forces to work for new Constitution
If moderate forces work together, mustering a two-thirds majority and passing a new Constitution is possible, Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan told the visiting Norwegian State Secretary for Development Cooperation Jens Frlich Holte.
Holte met with the TNA delegation led by Sampanthan last Friday at the Office of the Opposition Leader in Parliament.
A media statement by the TNA said Sampanthan briefed the Secretary on the status of the political affairs in the country and had appreciated the support and partnership tended by the Norwegian government in the past in rebuilding Sri Lanka, especially in the area of a political solution to the national question.
Further, Sampanthan briefed the Secretary on the efforts taken to frame a new Constitution and said as representatives of the people we cannot throw away the opportunity that has come our way. He said he feared that any failure in this process will lead to further divisions among communities in the country.
I am not ruling out the chances of having a new Constitution, but we are disappointed about the delays in the recent past in taking this process further. This government can achieve what they couldnt achieve in the past if they are genuinely committed and have the political will do so, Sampanthan added.
The process of framing a new Constitution has been there since 1988 and every successive government has worked on this. We cannot entertain any further delays in this matter. The draft Constitution must be presented to Parliament and debated and upon receiving a two-thirds majority, it should be approved by the people at a referendum. The people who think on racial lines are not the majority in this country, but unfortunately, they are heard more than the moderates. But if the moderate forces work together in these matters, mustering a two-thirds majority and passing a Constitution is possible, Sampanthan said.
Speaking on the release of lands in the North and East, Sampanthan said there had been progress in this regard, but things can be speedily addressed given the fact that it has been over nine years since the war came to an end. Armed forces are cultivating in these lands and the crops are sold to the very owners of these lands, which is harmful to achieving peace and reconciliation in this country.
He brought to the notice of the delegation that people in several places in the North and East are staging protests over land, persons in custody and the issue of missing persons.
The Norwegian delegation also included Ambassador to Sri Lanka Thorbjrn Gaustadsther, Senior Advisers of the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Ministry Dagny Mjs and Kjersti Nordskog Nes and Counsellor/Deputy Head of Mission Monica Svenskerud.
The TNA delegation included Parliamentarians M.A. Sumanthiran and Selvam Adaikalanathan.

Scotland crush Argentina 44-15 after first-half thrashing
RESISTENCIA, Argentina, Saturday: Scotland blew away Argentina with a devastating first-half display to post a 44-15 victory and leave the ailing Pumas in dire straights after yet another pummelling on Saturday.
Scotland ripped through some feeble Argentine defence to post a barely believable 36-3 halftime lead against a team who have fallen away dramatically since their run to the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup.
George Horne crossed twice in the first half and there were also tries for Stuart McInally, Magnus Bradbury and Blair Kinghorn as Scotlands new-look side took total control.
Tomas Lezana and debutant replacement Santiago Gonzalez replied for an improved Argentina early in the second half but Dougie Fife added another try for the Scots who finished their tour on a high.
Scotland beat Canada but then lost 30-29 to the United States last week, prompting coach Gregor Townsend to make eight changes to his starting team.
The new boys grasped their opportunity to make it six wins out of seven against an Argentina team who lost both tests against Wales this month and have had victories over only Italy, Georgia and Japan in a dire run since 2016 that has seen 18 defeats from 22 games.  Agencies

SEC, CSE launch  Empower for SMEs
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) together with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) launched Empower - the SME Board to attract Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to the CSE thus creating a platform to attract SMEs to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Under a programme to launch a series of new Capital Market Development Initiatives proposed by the new SEC Chairman, Ranel T Wijesinha, this launch, will for the first time in the history of the country and the history of the SEC and CSE, establish a dedicated platform for the SMEs.
Chairman SEC, Ranel Wijesinha said this is bound to Empower Entrepreneurship, Making the Capital Market work for the SMEs.
 Sri Lanka, has achieved considerable progress in many areas, within a South Asian context, but it is yet an Emerging Economy in the larger Asia Pacific region, within which it can be a truly formidable player. We have yet to realise our full potential and we have been saying this for too long.
But growth must be balanced, growth must be honest and wholesome and most importantly, sustainable. If we are to achieve economic growth with equity, across the length and breadth of the country, with balance in economic development and employment, between the city and the rural village and between agriculture, industry and services, and among and between representatives of religions and communities, there is a compelling national imperative the country has to address.
We transitioned from a closed and insular country, to an open and outward looking country, with an export led growth strategy in 1977, 41 years ago. but yet, the SME sector, has not achieved the level of growth so vitally necessary, for this yet Emerging Economy, he added.
Chairman of the CSE, Ray Abeywardena said, The SME Board will offer a new avenue to drive Sri Lankan SMEs through their next phase of evolution, by offering a unique proposition and an opportunity to access a deep pool of international and domestic capital. Apart from access to capital, the new listing platform will offer SMEs opportunities to build credibility through disclosure of information and balanced governance standards, which would enhance their visibility and attract strategic investors.
The new listing platform has the potential to make an all-round impact, bringing a positive change and shaping the stature and longevity of an SME for years to come.
The launch is scheduled for July 5, at the BMICH.

Shot in the arm for anti-tobacco lobby
The countrys anti-tobacco campaign has found new vigour in the light of latest Supreme Court order on the Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) to pay for legal costs of a widow of a deceased smoker.
Sri Lanka Medical Association Expert Committee on Tobacco, Alcohol and Illicit Drugs Convenor Dr. Jayamal de Silva said the landmark judgement has set a precedent by which tobacco companies will be held accountable in the future.
The Supreme Court (SC) on June 14 ordered the CTC to pay Rs 400,000 within one month as costs to a smokers widow for delaying the trial for more than 12 years by filing petitions in the Appeal Court and the SC. Dismissing a petition by the CTC, the SC ordered to expedite hearing of the case at the Colombo District Court.
De Silva, who is also a Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry at the University of Sri Jayewardenapura, pointed out that this is the first experience in Sri Lanka where a victim of cancer has sued the CTC demanding compensation. He observed that similar individual lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers have become common today in the Western world, especially in the United States.
Plaintiffs have increasingly been successful in tobacco lawsuits in the USA. There had been instances where they were awarded millions of dollars as compensation. For example, on June 6, 2001, a jury in Los Angeles awarded more than USD 3 billion to a lifelong smoker, deciding that a tobacco giant is responsible for his incurable lung cancer. On March 31, 2009, a widow of a deceased smoker won USD 145 million after a 10-year fight with a tobacco giant as the US Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by that cigarette manufacturing company. Tobacco companies are in the habit of appealing against any judgement unfavourable to them, he told the Daily News.
Dr de Silva was insistent that tobacco companies must be directly held accountable for the harm their products cause to the people.
For over half a century now, the tobacco industry has been making deliberate attempts to conceal the fact that smoking causes cancer. Now that it has been proven by scientific evidences, the companies have started selling doubt with claims that not all smokers have got cancer and that smokers cancer may have been caused by other factors. Sri Lanka has had significant achievements in the recent years in terms of tobacco control policies. Imposing 80 percent pictorial health warnings on the cigarette packets, increasing tax on tobacco to 75 percent or close to that when the effective tax is calculated, and banning the sale of loose tobacco were some such achievements. On top of them, we are hopeful that a landmark judgement on tobacco litigation will drive the countrys anti-smoking campaign to new heights, he commented.
He also called on the health authorities to effectively implement the recently imposed ban on smoking in public places.
Our children are exposed to tobacco smoke and live ads due to the fact that smoking is allowed in certain public spaces such as sports events and restaurants. The authorities should take serious action to prevent such things happening and enforce the current ban on smoking in public places in an effective manner, he added.

SLANA improves awareness  of handling DG containers
SLANA (Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents) which has taken a leading role in educating the industry in specialized areas of Sea Freight handling, conducted a seminar on May 24, 2018 at the NDB Auditorium on Handling of Dangerous Goods.
With the increased number of accidents on ships and at ports, due to the lack of awareness in handling of dangerous goods, it was a most opportune time to conduct such a program. Specialists from the industry, with real time experience in managing DG containers and also handling crises were selected as panelists for the seminar.
The Associate Dean of the Faculty of Management at CINEC Campus Dr. Lalith Edirisinghe, elaborated on What is DG cargo , The IMO IMDG Classification, The perspectives of Exporters, Freight Forwarders and Shipping Lines.
Rohana Thudugala from the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, gave an insight from the Terminal operators perspective, where DG containers are received and stevedored to the ships. He also explained the the duties of the Safety office at port.
This gave everyone at attendance a very thorough understanding of the importance of the Dangerous Goods operation and the ramifications if not followed closely.
Master Mariner Capt. Peshala Medagama shared his diverse experiences at sea in handling DG cargo when on board the vessels, the real risk of IMDG from a Ship Captains perspective.
This gave the audience a more practical and a real time understanding of the DG operation apart from the theoretical aspect itself. It was also very educating to know how different countries operate when it comes to the handling of DG cargo and how we as Sri Lanka can emulate and improve as a whole to be more efficient and minimize risks.
There was an active discussion afterwards between the panellists and the audience where several unclear areas were brought up and answered through a very fruitful Q & A session.
At the inception, the Chairman of SLANA Captain A V Rajendra said that SLANA was formed in 2016 in order to protect the interest of the agents who represent Non Vessel Operating Container Carriers (NVOCC) and also to develop more opportunities for NVOCCs, the Port of Colombo, Exporters and Importers, by expanding the trade lanes and the frequency of sailing to / from Colombo. He also elaborated on the commitment of SLANA to educate and improve the knowledge of the NVOCC agents and the other industry stake holders, so that Sri Lanka would be known as a truly professional Maritime hub.

Triumph of words in unexpected places
By far the most talked-about award of this years Pulitzer cycle was the Pulitzer in music, awarded to Kendrick Lamar for his fourth studio album, DAMN. The discussion has ranged from confusion to distaste, but few can deny that Lamar deserves the recognition and respect the award indicates. On the contrary, Lamar has received accolades from musical and literary critics alike for his work in the past, particularly for its lyrical complexity and thematic cohesiveness from album to album.
His 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly has been widely regarded as one of the most delving, dominant, and downright beautiful musical compositions of the decade, if not of all time. For many, this win is a signal that the Pulitzer is finally catching up after an infamous track record of stuffiness and lack of representation for marginalized groups.
Jazz compositions
The main issue to be had with Lamars win, it seems, is that he doesnt need it.
The main issue to be had with Lamars win, it seems, is that he doesnt need it. Pulitzers in music have traditionally been awarded to classical and jazz compositions, genres that fly by the seat of their grants and survive off the skin of their endowments.
The monetary prize and notoriety that come with a Pulitzer may seem paltry to an artist whose album is already topping charts and raking in millions. Much like in the case of Bob Dylans 2008 award, many are also saying that rather than being an accurate accolade selflessly given to a deserving artist, the inclusion of these more mainstream figures in the selections for the Pulitzer is more of a publicity choice for the award itselfafter all, how many more people are now aware that there is a Pulitzer in music since Lamars win has warranted such discussion And are those who were already aware any more likely to respect Lamar, his work, or his genre for taking an award away from a more traditional composer or piece
Lamar clearly has a deep understanding of the effectiveness of his words, as his consistent use of literary devices such as anaphora, epistrophe, and apophasis contribute not only to the form of his language but to his musical composition as well. The central nature of verbiage to rap has been compared to that of the sung lyric in opera. Some have even gone so far as to say that Lamars work is representative of an oral history of black culture in the twenty-first-century US. Others have compared his past albums to novels in their structure.
Previous albums
In this same vein, DAMN. is fraught with religious references, setting up Lamar not as a youth coming of age or a revolutionary coming into his own, as his previous albums have, but as a Christ-like figure taking on personal torment to speak for his people. Lamar does not revel in being chosen to saverather, he is the Messiah during his time in the desert, tempted and tortured but determined.
Like any great novel, the interlocking themes and imagery on DAMN. are complex and warrant inspection and investigation as often as they warrant re-listening.What is perhaps most interesting about this award from a literary perspective, however, is how it centers the spoken word as an instrument of importance, both musically and socially. Rap as a genre very obviously centers language as one of its core elements and driving forces, but this is particularly true in the music of Kendrick Lamar. Lamars albums, DAMN.

UK funds 50 million for development in SL
The British Government is currently providing funding of more than 50 million for development support in Sri Lanka, British High Commissioner James Dauris said, while speaking at a reception in Colombo recently, to mark the birthday of Queen Elizabeth II.
The British High Commissioner hosted the Queens Birthday Party on June 13, celebrating the friendship between the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka.
The event was attended by President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, ministers, Members of Parliament, heads of industries and professional organisations, members of government departments and agencies, the police, armed forces, university chancellors, senior journalists and civil society leaders.
Speaking at the event, the British High Commissioner said, The playwright Oscar Wilde commented: I can resist everything except temptation.
I can resist almost everything except the temptation to tell you something about why 70 years of the relationship between Sri Lanka and the UK gives us lots of good reasons to celebrate. He said, 1948 was not, of course, the beginning of our relationship. But with Independence came the beginning of a new chapter. Throughout the past 70 years, ours is a relationship that many people have valued, invested in and cherished.
We have many reasons to celebrate today. We are proud of our people-to-people links and of the hundreds of thousands of people of Sri Lankan origin living in the UK, who help to make our country as successful as it is today, he added.
Today we celebrate our links through parliamentary traditions, the law and the Commonwealth. We were pleased to have President Sirisena lead Sri Lankas delegation at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at London, in April,  he said.
Our countries share flourishing educational and cultural links, a large part of the important work being done by the British Council in Sri Lanka. We are also proud of our links through sports and are looking forward to having the England cricket team here, later this year, High Commissioner Dauris said.
We also celebrate the many business links we enjoy; some of them more than a century old, others new and equally exciting. There are a number of companies who have stories of successful investment which illustrate the possibilities for doing business in Sri Lanka today, opportunities that will only grow with sensible economic reform,  Dauris added.
The High Commissioner said, And we are proud of the work that our High Commission does, with all the organisations we work with and the projects we fund. The UK supports Sri Lanka in a number of projects, including achieving its objective of being free of mines by 2020, promoting inter-religious dialogues in Trincomalee and Batticaloa, working with the Sri Lankan Police Service on tackling violence against women and supporting Sri Lankas peace-building priority plan. The British Government is currently providing funding of more than 50 million for development support in Sri Lanka. He added, As many of you will know, we dont have a national day in the UK. But we do celebrate Her Majesty the Queens birthday. This year, we celebrate her 92nd birthday and her 66 yearstwo-thirds of a centuryon the throne. We were delighted that Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex were able to represent the Queen at the official celebration of Sri Lankas 70th anniversary of Independence in February.
Winston Churchill, historian as much as politician, commented: If we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future. I think it can equally be said that if we continue today to build on friendships founded in the past, they will be stronger still in the future in ways that benefit us all. And that is our firm ambition, he said.
