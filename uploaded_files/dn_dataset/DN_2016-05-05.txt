Fonseka questions MRs morality
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who drastically downsised the security detail of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga when he was in power, has no moral right to comment about his security, Field Marshal and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said in Parliament on Tuesday.
He was speaking on the invitation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over a point of order raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the security given to former President Rajapaksa.
Why cannot former President Rajapaksa come to Parliament and talk about his security concerns without asking his acolytes to speak When former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was given a security contingent of 60, this was reduced to 30 by former President Rajapaksa by giving a call to the Chief Justice. Former President Rajapaksa, who behaved in such an immoral way, has no right to comment about his security, Fonseka said.
He said both Army and Police security was provided for him when there was terrorism in the country, adding that there is no such a necessity today.
The government has the decision making power in this regard. In Police, there are specially trained officers for VIP security. Some Army personnel former President Rajapaksa had kept for his security had had no such a training. They were only acolytes of Rajapaksa. If Police are capable of providing adequate security to the First Citizen and the Second Citizen of the country, Rajapaksa has no reason to say Police security is insufficient for him, he said.
At this point, the Speaker asked the minister to wind up his speech, but Fonseka continued. However, Fonsekas mike was switched off.
I gave you the opportunity as your name was mentioned. Now finish it please Speaker Jayasuriya said. Later, the Speaker switched on the mike.
Fonseka said even though the Elections Commissioner ordered to give security to him at the 2010 Presidential Election, former President Rajapaksa as the then Commander of the Security forces declined it.
My security was withdrawn five minutes after the results of the Presidential Election.
I was placed with other hard core terrorists when I was jailed. Orders had been given to shoot me if I attempted to escape Police custody, he said.
Fonseka said if he could manage his security with 15 Police officers, there was no reason to think that the former President could not manage his security with 200 Police personnel. He said former President Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa should take the responsibility of killing retired Major General Janaka Perera.
When Janaka Perera asked for security, it was Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who ordered Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva on the number of security detail of Janaka Perera, he said.
Fonseka said former Defence Secretary needs not be given Army security, adding that Gotabhaya Rajapaksas security should also be replaced with Police officers. He raised doubts about the bomb attack targeting former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa.
Terrorists never explode bombs keeping a distance of 25 metres. Nor they target bullet-proof cars. We have doubts whether it is a preplanned one, he said.
Minister Fonseka said the only threat for the life of former President Rajapaksa was the attempt by former Minister Johnston Fernando to kill him using a terrorist. He said former President Rajapaksa had no other life threat even when the war was ravaging.
He said Captain Neville, who was kept by former President Rajapaksa for his security, has human rights allegations before Geneva.
While keeping him for his security, he was used to commit murders, he said.

Provincial Councils seek to bar entry of Indian fishermen to SL waters
A Private Members Bill moved by TNA Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran to prevent the entry of Indian fishermen to Sri Lankan territorial waters illegally has been approved by all Provincial Councils, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Tuesday.
He said the Northern and the North-western Provincial Councils have agreed with amendments while the others agreed to the same.
The motion was moved in Parliament on February 10. The Speaker ordered that this should be informed to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry.

Report on MPs misbehaviour to Speaker
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said the report called by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya over the incident in Parliament on Tuesday was to be handed over to the Speaker at 12 noon today.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex on Tuesday following the adjournment of the House.
He said a special Party Leaders Meeting is scheduled today to decide on the action to be taken against those misbehaved in the House based on the report. He said the two member committee appointed to look into the incident, comprising Deputy Chairman of Committees S Adeikkalanathan and himself, would commence investigations. He said the video and audio tapes would be obtained from Parliament and studied for the purpose.
He said the report would be presented with evidence, adding that the relevant part of the video footage would be attached to it. Responding to a question by a journalist, he said the MPs would not be summoned before the committee for questioning.
Observing that the Speaker would take appropriate decisions with regard to the MPs who misbehaved in the chamber, he said the MPs had committed wrong doings during this incident.
We regret and vehemently condemn the incident. This incident belittles the dignity, prestige and confidence on the legislature. We will look into the reasons that led to the chaos. The MPs those who came to the aisle of chamber had contravened the Standing Orders, they had disobeyed the orders of the Speaker and exchanged blows, he said.
He said the Party Leaders should take firm action against the MPs who misbehaved to prevent recurrence of similar incidents in the future. He said the Party Leaders could think of suspending Parliamentary time allocated to the speeches of such MPs and restricting their Parliamentary privileges.
Deputy Chairman of Committees S. Adeikkalanathan also participated.


Dinesh asks if govt backs down on MRs security issue
Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena on Tuesday demanded Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament to state if the government would reverse the decision to remove the Army security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
MP Gunawardena, at the commencement of sittings soon after Speakers announcements and presentation of Public Petitions, got up and said that Army Commandos who had specialised in VIP security detailed for the security contingent of former President Rajapaksa had been taken away.
He is the former President fought against the most ruthless terrorist organisation in the world. Threat against his life still remains as remaining LTTE cadres are seeking opportunity to take revenge for their loss, Gunawardena said.
When we raised this matter in this House sometime back after we received information of the governments readiness to prune down the security provided to former President, the Leader of the House pledged that the government would not do so, he said.
What we feared then has happened. We need to know from the Prime Minister whether the government would reverse its decision and replenish the security reduced from the former President, Gunawardena said.

WORK ON HEDA OYA RESERVOIR
When considering the location and physical background of Pottuvil and Lahugala Divisional Secretary Divisions in Ampara District, it is evident that though it has a high potential for agriculture and animal husbandry, its land and water has not been duly managed for the benefit of the people. Moreover, when compared with other areas it can be identified as an area with minimum common amenities. Around 6,500 hectares are being cultivated by tanks in Heda Oya, Wila Oya and Karanda Oya valleys. Paddy fields in the banks of Heda Oya are being affected by floods in Maha season while the lack of water in the Yala season impacts on cultivation.

METHODOLOGY TO MEET SEED PADDY REQUIREMENT
It is required to produce 4.1 million Metric Tons of paddy to supply rice for the current population of the country. 1.2 million hectares are cultivated in one year during the Yala and Mahaseasons, while average paddy harvest per hectare remains at 4.2 MT.
Quality of the seed paddy could be improved if farmers themselves produce the seed paddy from registered seed paddy. Production of seed paddy by using parachute trays is a low cost method. It has estimated that a kilogrammes of paddy can easily harvest 100 kg of paddy.
It will be adequate to cultivate 2 1/2 acres in the next season. The seed paddy requirement can be reduced by 75% through the parachute method and there is a possibility of minimising the use of agro chemicals in weed controlling. Furthermore, the labour requirement for planting could also be reduced by 90%.
The proposal by Agriculture, Minister Duminda Dissanayake to facilitate 180,000 farmers in paddy cultivating districts under this programme, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Education must improve for countrys economic development - Premier
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday, the countrys economic development would take place only if the education system is improved.
The Prime Minister made this observation while replying to a question raised by UNP MP Ashu Marasinghe, during the Prime Ministers Question Time.
The PM said free education system will not be abolished. Our aim is to provide every child a pre school education, primary education, a secondary education, university education and tertiary education, to give them a better future. Advisers in the Education Ministry are now formulating a new national educational system which would make school education compulsory for every child. Once this Bill is ready, it will be forwarded to the Select Committee on educational matters for more suggestions. If school education is not strong enough, university education too would not be useful, he said.
Laboratories in many schools were opened during the former regime without upgrading University education. But, maximum benefits have not reaped from these projects. Action had also been taken to draft laws to regulate degree awarding institutions. We have to think twice about a university education and should restructure it. Today human resources in the university education system is not used efficiently. The University Act was introduced in 1978. Now the authorities are keen to grant more autonomy to universities. We have to increase autonomy to universities to upgrade the education system. The curricular in the university system should have to be developed. Many universities are not been limited to grant general degree programmes, while there is no improvement of awarding post graduate degrees at many universities. We have to upgrade the quality in degree programmes in order to increase the value of university education which would help to address the needs of the international job market, the Prime Minister added.


Anura, Bandula object tonon inclusion of questionsin PMs question time
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday, raised objections for failing to include the two questions submitted by them for the Prime Ministers question round.
Their questions were not taken up at the Prime Ministers Question Time yesterday, following a decision taken at the Party Leaders Meeting last month that the questions asked at this time slot must be handed over 5 days in advance.
However, MP Anura Dissanayake objecting to this decision, stated that it was not practical to raise matters of national importance five days in advance. My question was pertaining to the IMF loan pursued by the Government including its amount, time-frame and conditions. This is an important question.
The Prime Minister could reply to these questions by memory alone, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said his officials need sufficient time to obtain information from the relevant bodies to respond to the questions directed at him.
I cannot rebuke my officials asking for information immediately.
If we are to continue with this feature, let us think of a practical way, he said.
MP Bandula Gunawardena at this point requested to permit submissions of questions via email.
Prime Ministers Question Time contained only two questions yesterday, due to the non-inclusion of the two questions due to late submission.

Bill presented to enable SL become member of AIIB
The Government yesterday in Parliament presented a Bill to enable Sri Lanka to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank(AIIB).
Chief Government Whip and Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the Bill on behalf of the Finance Minister.
The Bill titled The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Agreement (Ratification) provides for the Finance Minister, on behalf of the Government, to ratify, accept Articles of Agreement establishing the AIIB, to which Sri Lanka is a signatory.
Sri Lanka signed the Articles of Agreement with AIIB in June last year. The AIIB was founded in October 2014 and is a development bank consisting of 21 Asian member countries.
Financial institutions must be regulated
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday, that financial institutions have to be regulated in order to strengthen the rural economy.
He said especially microfinace companies should be regulated to create a strong local economy which would create an environment conducive for foreign investments. There are a number of non government financial entities and micro finance entities at regional level to national level. Some rural people have been duped into depositing money in dubious financial institutions in the recent past because these are not regulated properly.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe moving the Microfinance Bill for debate, said present laws are not sufficient to regulate banks, financial companies and microfinance institutions. There is a exploitation of the consumers. Around 10 to 11 financial companies have turned bankrupt. Most of them are making losses which had affected investors, depositors and under privileged people in
rural level very badly.
If these are not regulated properly, national level finance will not be in a healthy position. They might become a threat to the country. Thus, only a very few people would attempt to direct the Stock Market and the financial system. There are large scale pyramid schemes in our country, while most of them are operating in Tissamaharamaya, Hambantota and Batticaloa as well. Perhaps, these existed because our laws are insufficient.
Once this Bill is passed, the Committee on financial matters could suggest more proposals in this regard. Laws have been submitted on the management and regulation and issuing of licenses for finance institutions under this Bill, he said.
Complaints against 114 public servants, five artistes and 18 businessmen to FCID - Sagala
There have been complaints against 114 public servants, five artistes and 18 businessmen to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake revealed in Parliament yesterday.
When, UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunga asked for the list of names of public servants, artistes and businessman who have been subjected to allegations, the Minister declined to provide the names saying that investigations are still underway and it was therefore not suitable to reveal their names at this point. Since none of them had been found guilty upto now, if the names are revealed, their careers might be affected, the Minister further said.

Sectoral Oversight Committees should incorporate all Parliamentarians - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday stated in Parliament that the Sectoral Oversight Committees should essentially incorporate all MPs.
He was responding to the concerns raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena that the names of some MPs had not been included into any of the Oversight Committees and that some MPs had been appointed to the Committees they did not request for. The Speaker directed the issue to the notice of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister directed the matter to be settled by discussing at the Party Leaders Meeting. However, he said the process of oversight committees should not be further delayed.
Replying to a query by MP Bandula Gunawardena over handing over the chairmanship of the newly appointed Sectoral Oversight Committees to the Opposition, the Prime Minister said chairmanship of the majority of them would go to Opposition parties.
The Sectoral Oversight Committees is a new procedure adopted in Parliament in place of Consultative Committees.
Sports Minister says: Fresh probe into entry of woman into cricketers room
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera told Parliament yesterday that the Cricket Executive Committee would commence a fresh investigation into the entry of a woman connected to the gambling business to a room occupied by an Indian cricketer at Hotel Kandalama during Indias visit to Sri Lanka for the 2010 Asia Cup.
In answer to a question raised by UNP MP SM Marikkar, the minister said Sri Lanka Cricket did not have any document concerning the matter.
He accepted that a woman had entered the cricketers room at Hotel Kandalama during the night of June 18 and remained throughout the night.
Such an incident had taken place, the minister said. He accepted that a letter by Major General Lawrence Fernando had been dispatched directly to the Manager of the Indian Cricket team with a copy to the Secretary, the Additional Secretary, the Additional Executive Officer and the Anti-Corruption Officer of the International Cricket Council.
The minister said there were no remarks regarding the said incident in the minutes of the Interim Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket meetings held in 2010.
MP Marikkar questioned the minister whether the latter was aware that there was an effort of offering a bribe according to the contents of the letter, the minister said that there had been an attempt of accepting a bribe.
MP Marikkar said the then Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga was the local agent of an Indian cement company owned by the owner of the Chennai Super Kings Team, to which the Indian player participated at the Indian Premier League and demanded to know whether that connection was the reason for the missing documents pertaining to the inquiry against the said cricketer from Sri Lanka Cricket.

Asst. Registrar to document SL refugees births and marriages
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday, that Sri Lankas Deputy High Commissioner in Chennai has been appointed an Assistant Registrar to document births and marriages of Sri Lankan refugees living in India.
The Prime Minister made this observation while replying to a question raised by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda during the Prime Ministers Question Time.
The Department of Immigration & Emigration in Sri Lanka will issue passports in just within two to three weeks for Sri Lankan refugees who wish to return to Sri Lanka.
All legal and other obstacles preventing the return of Sri Lankan refugees in India would be abolished and efforts have been made to facilitate their return.
We are implementing a hassle free programme to register their children as citizens of Sri Lanka. Only the birth certificates of parents and children and recommendations of the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commissioner in Chennai are needed for registration. There will be no basic fees and late charges for the registration of children under 22 years since 2003. This will be extended for those over 22 years soon.
Appropriate lands will be provided through land kachcheris conducted by the Divisional Secretariats for the families returning to Sri Lanka.
