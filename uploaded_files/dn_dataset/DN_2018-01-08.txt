The good governance score
The greatest victory is the victory of Righteousness... declares Emperor Dharmashoka in his 13th Rock Edict, and in his first Pillar Edict affirms: ...this is my role - to govern by righteousness, administer by righteousness .... Influenced as we are by the same Doctrine embraced and espoused by the great emperor, we, Sri Lankans, have long upheld the importance of good governance in the management of affairs of society.
The Mahavamsa also clearly favours those rulers who were dedicated to the welfare of the people and castigates those who brought oppression and hardship to their subjects.
In yet another rock edict, Emperor Dharmashoka exhorted his administrators that impartiality was key to good governance, key to managerial success in ensuring social stability in the realm. Nurtured in this great South Asian political culture,it was natural that, at some point, the concern of the Sri Lankan voter focussed on the mounting problems of bad governance that was experienced in the country during the years of the Mahinda Rajapakse regime.
That was why, despite the dramatic military defeat of the LTTE insurgency, the presidential elections of January 2015 saw the issue of Good Governance take precedence in the minds of the Sri Lankan electorate. After all, a military victory is an event that, over time, fades into a memory, while governance is an on-going process and a constant human experience.
On January 8, three years ago, the citizenry looked beyond that memory of a military success and, examining their state of existence, of Sri Lankan society, and of prospects for harmony and progress, decided to vote for the political forces that sought to take the country out of the morass of bad governance. The Rajapaksa regime epitomised too much the features of bad governance for its popularity to endure the fading memory of a military victory.
For the people, the the present-day social realities of continuing ethnic tensions - indeed the broadening scope of ethnic targeting - and ballooning losses of immense corruption, nepotism and mismanagement, were what counted when choosing the future political leadership.
It was not surprising, therefore, that, while some people remained diverted by the repeated fanfares of military triumph, a majority of citizens opted for an end to that large-scale misgovernance and put into power a political coalition that promised change. Hence, the historic presidential victory of Maithripala Sirisena and the cementing of a national coalition of political leaders across the spectrum whose primary goal was the re-imposition of good governance in the country.
It was the National Unity governing coalition led by the United National Party that then subsequently went on to win a parliamentary majority to govern in the general elections held the following August.
What has been the performance record of the regime so far in achieving its declared goals of Yahapaalanaya
To different sets of people there were, and are, different priorities in the achievement of good governance in Sri Lanka. Perhaps the broadest consensus on a national priority was about the ending of nepotism and a return to the normal rule of law. This aspiration was common to both the ethnic majority Sinhalese as well as to the ethnic minorities.
The ethnic minorities understood that progress toward post-war inter-ethnic reconciliation also depended on a return to a more open, transparent, and disciplined governance.After all, it is such institutionalised and rational administration that enabled attainment of such goals as social justice, fundamental rights and social security.
With the departure of the Rajapaksa regime, so ended a decades-long rule of a single family whose networks of power grew within the Sri Lankan State as much as the size of the Rajapaksa extended family would allow it. Even the most ardent admirers of the Rajapaksa-led military victory were outraged by the degree of nepotism that pervaded the Sri Lankan polity - a polity that prided itself in its post-colonial modernist progress.
The ending of that family rule ensured a quick return to a more normal rule of law but was not enough to seal it. Much more had to be done in the form of the renewal of state institutions with fresh managements that comprised professionally competent personnel rather than friends and relations of politicians.
Also, the first steps toward dismantling autocratic government took the form of the design of a structure of oversight bodies that brought in non-political civil society representation to ensure checks and balances that prevented too much political influence.
The passing of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in April 2015 was critical for the achievement of this aspect of Good Governance.
The 19th Amendment did much to repair that enormous damage done by the 18th Amendment engineered by the Rajapaksa regime which further consolidated autocratic presidential rule.
The 19th Amendment provided for the reduction in the tenures of President and Parliament from six years to five years; re-introduction of a two-term limit for the individual holding presidential office; empowered the President to dissolve Parliament only after four and a half years [unlike one year, as previously provided]; the revival of the Constitutional Council and the establishment of independent commissions. The most immediate impact on the polity and on society has been by the independent commissions. The independent functioning of the Police Commission, the Elections Commission and the Public Service Commission have all had the salutary effect of returning the political management of the country to some degree of transparency.
The rigorous practice of oversight and scrutiny by the civil society representatives now serving on these commissions has served to instil public confidence in the general running of the country.
Today, even if there are instances of police misbehaviour, the public has the confidence that redress action begins fairly promptly even if the process of inquiry remains slow. Even in the case of politicians misbehaviour, as some recent incidents have demonstrated, political loyalties and kinship has not served to block redress by the aggrieved parties.
For the first time in decades, politicians have begun serving jail terms while others are awaiting prosecution.
More importantly, the prosecution of politician and bureaucrat miscreants has not been reserved for appointees of the past regime - where, perhaps the most miscreants are to be found.
As the Central Bank Bonds scam report exemplifies, this government has fulfilled its Yahapaalanaya promise by acting swiftly to redress malpractice within the current regime.
The ending of harassment of news media enterprises and professionals, a hallmark of the Rajapaksa era, now provides for a vociferously critical media. Today, the din of the anti-government criticism is such that those citizens unused to such critical journalism have the impression that the government is unpopular - solely because, in the aftermath of autocracy, criticism is more sensational than praise.
More needs to be done in the area of media structure reform, especially in the state sector news media.
The consolidation of the Good Governance regime enabled work to begin earnest on post-war inter-ethnic reconciliation.
The essential confidence building measures for such reconciliation, such as redress for past human rights violations, atrocities and ethnic discrimination, could not have been done without the new structure of transparent and disciplined administration enabled by the independent oversight commissions.
Meanwhile, the Office of Missing Persons is a crucial step that needs swift implementation, and the return of private lands taken over for security purposes also needs to be expedited.
The new Right of Information law is a vital mechanism for public inquiry and direct accountability. All kinds of sectors of society, ranging from rural communities to business start-ups to giant corporates to professional groups to civil rights organisations, will soon realise the enormous potential of the RTI mechanism for a freer, more empowered society.
Perhaps the most political influential good governance measure taken by the Unity Government so far is that of electoral reform. The new system of voting and many other changes will shortly be put to the test when citizens go to the polls to elect local government bodies. In addition to the hybrid voting method combining the Proportional Representation method with the First-Past-the-Post method, citizens will also be voting for a bigger presence of women activists in the local bodies.
Also, from now on, local government bodies will all be elected in single election cycle.
Of course there is much more to be done and this regime cannot sit back with things only half-done.What is most important is that the current leadership sets a trend and provides inspiration for new generations of leaders to emulate.

Mulled wine hair colour for the season
The latest hair colour trend is inspired by a drink and we're already obsessed with the hue. Introducing 'mulled wine' hair, the hue everyone is talking about.
From the last few trends #CreamSoda, #Cider and #Spice to #MulledWine, it's all about holiday cheer now.
Wine, which is mostly a seasonal beverage, just makes this hair colour trend a perfect pick for winters. The colour trend made a way through the viral hashtag and now everyone seems to be obsessed with it. The hue is a mix of deep red, which is also kind of purple and has a hint of chocolate brown.
The shade was a quite a big thing back in the 90s, and is now being celebrated again with a new name. Trending now, the colour has resurfaced just in time for winters and even Aishwarya Rai Bachchan seems to be a fan of this hue. She has been flaunting this shade for quite some time now.
Her hair colour is a mix of brown and burgundy shades, which is kind of similar to mulled wine. From winter fashion to nail polishes to even lip colour, this season is all about this timeless shade. So, why keep the hair behind

Sathosa crowned largest shopping chain
State owned Lanka Sathosa shopping chain has dramatically ascended to become the largest retail player in Sri Lanka, beating all other local supermarket brands unmistakably.
Lanka Sathosa now stands as Sri Lankas largest retail shopping chain declared an upbeat Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on January 5 at Welisara.
Minister Bathiudeen, joined by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister John Amarathunge and Chairman of Unilever Sri Lanka Carl Cruz was addressing the launch event of the first ever mega model outlet of Lanka Sathosa at Welisara.
We are commencing the first ever mega model outlet of Lanka Sathosa here today, thereby launching Sathosas mega outlet series. We thank Unilever Sri Lanka for their support given to revamp the previous Welisara outlet to create the first mega model outlet here. We are planning another 25 such new mega outlets this year, and they are coming up with the support of private sponsorships and not from public funds, said Minister Bathiudeen
In fact, as we meet here today two other Ministers are also launching two Lanka Sathosa outlets in Badulla District at this moment, and I am pleased to say that together with all the three outlets launched, our network of branches has arrived at a total of 400 as of today, and Lanka Sathosa now stands as Sri Lankas largest retail shopping chain. We are transforming Lanka Sathosa from a loss making service institute to a marketing based profit oriented model so that it can serve our consumers without being a burden to our public funds. In fact I am pleased to say that we have commenced many cost control initiatives and as a result saved significant funds last year. We also launched many promotional campaigns with reputed Sri Lankan companies to increase sales turnover which has greatly helped Lanka Sathosa to increase its revenues. As a result today I am pleased to say that our monthly turnover has almost doubled and in December 2017 our turnover was Rs 3.2 billion, minister said.
Lanka Sathosa has seen great growth and I praise Minister Bathiudeen for this achievement said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and added, Government wants to give essential goods at most reasonable prices to the consumers. We have not deviated from this and in fact, implementing it. Lanka Sathosa is playing the great role of lowest price setter in local retail market, and helps government in its consumer support role.
In its quest to expand further in to rural areas, Lanka Sathosa plans 8000 franchised outlets partnering with privately owned MSME shops across the country and has already started registration of qualifying MSMEs.
The present Lanka Sathosa network of 400 is scheduled to be expanded further- so that when it celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2019, the network shall total 500 branches-along with a bigger monthly turnover. Lankan FMCG sources said that the second largest privately owned supermarket chain after Lanka Sathosa has only around 240 outlets.

Alumex spearheads effort to mould new generation of construction professionals
Even as Sri Lankas construction sector continues to enjoy an unprecedented level of growth and development  rising to a rate of 9.3% Year-on-Year in the second quarter of 2017, the construction industry itself is finding it increasingly difficult to find labour  skilled or unskilled  to meet the rapidly increasing demand for high quality residential and commercial space.
The growing shortage of labour in the construction sector has led to remarkable opportunities for growth, skills development, and the possibility of exponential income growth for those willing to put in the work.
Finished product
Having first established its Aluminium Fabrication training programme in 1998 Alumex  Sri Lankas pioneering extruder and manufacturer of aluminium profiles  has provided extensive practical training to over 15,000 fabricators free of charge.
According to Alumex Managing Director, Rohan Peris, this initiative was first established in order to ensure that the products which Alumex manufactured would be fabricated and installed correctly, in order to ensure that the companys reputation for producing Sri Lankas highest quality aluminium products would not be tarnished.
Our reputation for excellence is something we take very seriously and with aluminium products, you have to be very careful in how they are fabricated. Soon after we started this project, it became increasingly clear to us that this initiative was much bigger than just our company. The impact that this training was having on peoples lives, was truly remarkable, and we take great inspiration from the many success stories that Alumexs training programmes has helped to create over the past 19 years, Peris explained.
One of the programmes greatest success stories is Nalin Narampanawa, Managing Director of Nova Creations. A participant who joined the programme near its inception, Nalin shared his remarkable journey from his home village near Anuradhapura which he left with just a few thousand rupees to start training with Alumex.
I made the decision to come to Colombo after I was commissioned with the task of fabricating an aluminium window at our village school. At the time, I was involved in making photo frames using aluminium profiles, and very basic work like that.
The principal told me he had a job for me and while I didnt have much experience, I decided to take it up as a challenge. But I quickly realized that it was much more complicated than I had imagined, Narampanawa explained.
Given the materials durability and versatility, he realized that aluminium fabrication would be a skill that would only grow in demand, and therefore sought out help to develop his own expertise in the subject.
Classroom training
Today, Nalin is a successful entrepreneur in his own right, managing his own workshop that employs 30 youths from across the island, including his home district of Anuradhapura.
Another alumnus of this programme is Roshini Samaranayaka, Managing Director of Wijetunga Constructions. Having qualified as a civil engineer at the University of Moratuwa, Roshini noted that despite her extensive academic training, Alumexs programme had given her a strong advantage in her industry thanks to the hands on experience in sophisticated aluminium fabrication techniques it provided.
It is a common misconception that aluminium fabrication is a mans job  theres no such thing. I had a female fabricator who worked under me, received the training and started a workshop of her own. All it takes is passion, practice and precision and anyone who works at this job can earn well.
Roshini highlighted how Alumexs comprehensive training had proven invaluable in helping her to select the best profiles for each job, while the technical training gave her the knowhow necessary as a fabricator to speak to clients with confidence.
Demand for buildings that are furnished and fitted with aluminium is also on the rise, given the materials remarkable versatility and durability. These dynamics have made aluminium fabrication an increasingly vital part of Stylish Windows Lanka (Pvt) Ltds business.
Established in 2012, the company has grown to be one of Alumexs most sought-after firms for aluminium fabrication. Stylish Windows Managing Director, L.C. Lakshman Perera notes that it was the invaluable training and unwavering support of Alumex that enabled their continuing success.
Since receiving the training from Alumex, I have taken on major projects like Pegasus Reef Hotel, Anantara Hotel in Chilaw and Weligama Bay Marriott and completed them successfully. The training has been a key turning point in my life as it helped me to unlearn whatever I learned from being a helper for years and learn everything properly, once and for all
Not only has Alumex given us a good training, it also keeps us constantly updated on new technology, designs to make sure that were thorough and conversant with the global trends, Perera said.
Currently working out of a relatives property Jegatheesan hails from Jaffna and travelled to Colombo to start working in the construction sector as helper, before eventually commencing his training with Alumex.
Not just during the training but also after we completed the course, all of our instructors have been very accessible and helpful to us. Even now if we have a question, we can speak to them and get answers on anything to do with aluminium fabrication. Today I have four youth  including two from Jaffna and from Ratnapura - working with me and I have recommended the course to them as well.
Once they are also trained, we will be able to take on larger projects and in this way I am confident that I will be able to expand our business and get our own space to build a workshop in the near future.

[APPRECIATIONS - (08-01-2018)]
Ranjan Anandappa
The legend lives on
Ranjan Anandappa, 68, sports journalist, cricketer, cricket umpire, match referee, bilingual vocalist, and song writer, remains in death the way he lived; revered by all who knew him. If one of Ranjan's attributes stood out most, it must have been his humility. Ranjan's perpetual smile alone radiated his unassuming nature. Wise men have said that what the world lacks most today, is humility.
When in 2002, Ranjan's illustrious sub-editor father, Clarence, passed away, Ranjan requested that I writer an appreciation of my former colleague. Now, perhaps the junior Anandappa stands in line. Ranjan was in many ways like his father; dignified, soft spoken, and cautious in his comments.
When in 1994, I met Ranjan at the Sunday Observer, it was as if I found a long-lost, non-related brother. For, at my alma-mater, I had been the classmate of his wife Christine's brother, Brian, and there was the younger, Camillus. As a schoolboy, I had been a frequent visitor to their home; the same house Rajan lived in after marriage and up to a year ago, when he moved out of Kotahena. Besides, many of his and his wife's brothers and cousins were my classmates who studied at St. Benedict's, Colombo 13, during the 195'0s and 60's. At the same school, the succeeding generations of Anandappas and Pullayagams were my son's classmates or schoolmates.
A few days before Ranjan's passing, I told him on the phone that having come back to live in Kelaniya, I wished he could take me to meet his former classmate Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka. He said that he had never kept in touch with a politician, but for my sake, he would oblige. That confirms what the late journalist Ajith Samranayake said; that Ranjan had no politics in him.
Days later, when I called back, Ranjan's son Roshan answered; Ranjan had been laid to rest, I was told. On line, Roshan wished to speak to my wife, who had been his school librarian. Then, Ranjan's personal mobile went dead.
Ranjan, with his busy lifestyle, kept very fit; ironically, his first heart attack, claimed him. When he lived in my nearby neighbourhood, often on Sunday nights, we would go about on my bicycle for a beer.
Rajan atended De Mazanod College, Kandana, where he lived. To justify his cricketting talent, he got himself into Ananda College, Colombo. He sat next to Sarath Fonseka, who was a swimmer, he said. They studied in the Sinhala medium, making him bilingual.
Ranjan was an opening left arm swing bowler, idolising Alan Davidson and Garfield Sobers. He played Daily News Trophy cricket and could have graduated to Sara Trophy cricket, if in those days the opportunities for playing and working were conducive.
It was also unfortunate that Ranjan was for most of his school career, in a non-cricket-playing school and had the chance of playing just for two yeas at Ananda College.
Once, playing for a combined press team in India, Ranjan was referred to as Davidson,and he told me that it was the greatest honour he had received during his cricketing career.
At dinner, Ranjan would share the newspaper cutting on his cricketing career. He would talk of the way cricket had changed over 50 years. Ranjan liked to spend part of his Sundays visiting cricketers who were older than himself. On meeting Dr. Colman Perumal for the first time, the former left armers of different sorts went sentimental.
Ranjan kept the Sabbath, attending the 4 p.m. mass at the Kotchchikade church dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus, where he said many of his community, the Colombo Chettys, attended service. Often, on Sunday's, Ranjan also visited his mother.
Ranjan lived a happy family life. Colombo Chetty wives were the most faithful and loving wives in the world, he said. Covering cricket matches overseas, Ranjan never chose the Primrose path, other journalists said.
Ranjan would talk of a Barbados cricketing legend once charged for rape and released; and other things, little known.
He had covered cricket series in all or most cricketing countries. He spoke of Gary Sobers engagement to an Indian actress; then, his marriage to Prudence Kirby; and Sobers son and daughter, who he had met.
He said that Mustaq Mohammed having played cricket at 14 was possibly incorrect; that some Paksitanis of that era had their ages mixed up. Ranjan spoke of Muttiah Muralidharna; that the cloud over the spinner would pass away and the ICC would rule that Murali could bowl his doosra. Ranjan said a blast of wind could make a cricket ball move unpredictably through the air and that turf wickets had many surprises. He said that umpires were human and made mistakes, and after all cricket, being just a game, one's averages and wins and losses were not as important as playing the game.
Covering cricket matches late Saturday nights, Ranjan would invariably call and ask, Machan, are you there At the editorial, Ranjan would read his script to the late night reporter who was a touch typist. With hands free, he could better meet deadlines, he would say.
Just as cultural anthropologists say: when and old accomplished Bushman hunter dies, a library of information on survival in the Kalahari Desert is lost. With Ranjan's passing, a storehouse of cricketting and other sports information in a practical way, is gone with the wind. The sower went out to sow, and rarely indeed is a harvest of over eighty fold gathered. May the turf over Ranjan Anandappa be greener.
A former colleague
M. A. Bakeer Markar
An honest politician
The late Mohamed Abdul Bakeer Markar was born on May 12, 1917. His ancestry is traced to Sheikh Jamaludeen Al-Maghdoomi, the pioneer Arab settler who settled down in the sea board town of Beruwala.
His father, Hakeem Aliar Marikkar Mohomed Marikkar, belonged to family of physicians, whose ancestors were also physicians.
He was born in Beruwala and was educated at Zahira College, Colombo. The late Dr. T. B. Jaya was the principal at that time. Markar was the Chief Editor of college magazine. He excelled in debating and was elected speaker of the school majilis. He passed his London matriculation examination and later, pursued higher studies.
At his own alma-mater he became a teacher during Dr. T. B. Jayah's stewardship and later entered the core management as Chairman of the Board of Governors. His loyalty to his alma-mater was displayed by him throughout. As an eminent old Zahirian of great lustre, he set an example for other students.
He entered Law College in 1940 and passed out as a lawyer in 1950. His legal career was interrupted during World War II, as he had to take up duties in Civil Defence Services in 1942. During that period, he was also sent for civil defence training in India.
As a lawyer, he had a lucrative practice. He was President of the Kalutara Branch of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka.
Hailing from a minority community which had recently quickened to political activity, the late Bakeer Marker made an indelible mark in the political history of Sri Lanka. Dr. T. B. Jayah, who was his guru in education, turned out to be his political guru as well. With late Jahan, he was in the forefront of the activities of All Ceylon Muslim League as its Vice President, when Dr. M. C. M. Kaleel was President (he was the Founder President of the All Ceylon Union of Muslim League). He was unanimously elected as the Beruwala Urban Council Chairman in 1950. Further, he was the Chairman of the Beruwala Maradana Mosque Jama-ath until his demise.
He hailed from Maradana, Beruwala, where as historically revealed, the early Arabs who arrived at Ceylon built the first ever mosque in Ceylon, Viz Masjid-Ul-Abrar.
He took great pains in renovating the Jama-ath mosque with the help of his village. In doing so, he was careful to retain the original architectural shape and beauty of the mosque.
He first entered Parliament in March, 1960 and was re-elected in 1965 and 1977. He was elected as Deputy Speaker in 1977 and was elected as Speaker in 1978. Him being elected as Speaker was the greatest milestone in his local political career; he became the only speaker of Parliament to date to have acted for the President of Sri Lanka, when both the then President J. R. Jayawardene and the then Prime Minister R. Premadasa were away from the country.
He also served as the last Speaker of the old Parliament at Galle Face, and as the first Speaker of the new Parliament in Sri Jayawardenepura, Kotte.
He excelled in international relations as well; his close connection with the Iraqi government enabled him to build the Saddm Hussain village and Karbala village for cyclone victims and was the Iraq-Sri Lanka Friendship Association Founder President, remaining in the position until his demise.
In the early 1980's, a plane carrying Indonesian Haj pilgrims on their return journey, crashed in Sri Lanka. The then Speaker Bakeer Markar rushed to the scene and took personal interest to have the bodies of the pilgrims dispatched to Indonesia. As a token of appreciation, the President of Indonesia personally invited him to visit his country.
The Indonesian Haj memorial building of Sri Lanka was initiated by him.
During the end of his Parliamentary career, he served as minister without portfolio in the Cabinet of President J. R. Jayewardene and was appointed governor of Southern Province in 1988.
In this manner, following the footsteps of his political guru, T. B. Jayah, Bakeer Markar blossomed into one of Sri Lanka's senior politicians with honesty of purpose, and his sincerity in politics won him many friends.
During his Parliamentary career, he had a vision to serve the nation, which he fulfilled with determination and firm commitment until his demise on September 10, 1997.

Judge C.G. Weeramantry
A legal luminary
I first met Judge C. G. Weeramantry, or Judge (as we call him), in December, 2007; when by luck, I received the opportunity to intern at the Weeramantry International Centre for Peace Education and Research (WICPER). I had read and heard many stories about Judge Weeramantry and his contribution to the legal world, and was truly intimidated prior to meeting him. To my surprise, I was introduced to a humble and kind gentleman, who would always have a beautiful smile on his face. It was hard to imagine that this gentleman was the former Vice President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Subsequently, I had the privilege to work for his organization for four years, and got to know this wonderful human being quite intimately. Judges greatest strength and driving force was his wife, Rosemary. A strong-willed lady with a jovial spirit, Madam ran the show, enabling Judge to focus on his legal writings. Judge was also blessed with five wonderful children, and 11 grandchildren, all of whom treated us like we were part of the family.
Judge was a wealth of knowledge on various topics such as history, religion, law, and the environment; he was gracious enough to impart this knowledge on professionals and students alike. His constant message to the world was that we should utilize our resources sparingly, protect the environment, and fulfill our duties and responsibilities towards future generations.
Judge was a rare human being; generous and nurturing in spirit, with a heart full of love for all of humanity.
He was an amazing mentor, teacher and friend to all of us. The gift of legal teachings he presented to the world and his work towards the abolishment of nuclear weapons, would inspire generations to come.
Dearest Judge, thank you for all that you did for each and every one of us. It is one of the greatest honours of my life to have known a gentleman such as you.Heaven is blessed and richer now, with your presence. May you be blessed, always!

Marhoom M. S. M. Harees and Marhooma Husna Harees
They were wise and loving
We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves. - Henry Ward Beecher.
It was 25 years ago that our beloved mother, Noorul Husna, unexpectedly passed away peacefully in her sleep at our ancestral home in Galle, immersing our family into a state of shock and grief. Barely a year later, our beloved father, popularly known as Harees master, passed away as well, which made us inconsolable. The family, however, took consolation in the Quranic dicta: Every soul shall taste death and We are from Allah; to him will we return.
We don't think there was anything that could have prepared us to lose both parents two years apart, let alone one parent. It was a larger blow in adulthood, when we were at a point where we were actually beginning to set up our own families and becoming closer to them, as mother or father. Their wisdom sank into us only later in life, and we knew that all admonitions, punishments, and sanctions imposed on us as teenagers really were done out of love and affection and for our greater good, which proved much useful during our own roles as parents.
Our mother, Noor Husna Datha (as she was affectionately called by her circle of friends) taught what humanity, empathy and generosity means, not just to the three of us; but to all those she came into contact with, way beyond our family circles. She was the second daughter of Thangam Datha (Golden Lady), who was a respected religious figurehead among Muslim ladies of Galle Fort and her uncle Lafir Alim was in the board of scholars which translated the Quran into Sinhala for the first time. She was a role model who taught us to live and let live with the divine purpose of life in mind.
Our father Harees Master was a distinguished poet, literary genius, linguist, and an accomplished academic well-known all over the island, with many publications in Tamil and English to his credit.
He was the grandson of an Islamic poet of Galle; Cader Samsuddeen. He served at the Alhambra in Aluthgama, the Teachers' Training College in Addalachenai, and Malharus Sulhiya National College, Galle; as well as at Jamiah Naleemia, Beruwela, with great distinction. Dr. Shukri, one of his distinguished students, wrote in the commemoration souvenir published on the occasion of his 10th death anniversary in 2003, Harees was a multi-dimensional personality. He was an ideal devoted teacher; a teacher par excellence with vision, a poet with a fine aesthetic sense, and above all, a great human being.' We are eternally grateful to Allah for having blessed us with such great parents.
Their deaths have forever changed us and how we look at the world. In an odd way, it has made us better parents as well. We are always acutely aware of what such vivid and great memories of our childhood did and will do to enrich our lives and the lives of our children while we are on this earth. They deserve to know how much we still treasure them in our thoughts and memories, even after they have gone to join our Creator.
More importantly, the good values and morals they taught us and instilled in us will forever remain as their abiding legacy.
Although death is a mournful thing, the harrowing experience taught us very important lessons in life for which we thank the Almighty. May Allah make their resting place a garden of Jennah and join us with them in the hereafter.

Gupta Gunawardene
Computer genius
Of a very pleasant disposition, Gupta Gunawardene, whom we considered a computer genius, passed away on December 12, 2012. I came to know Gupta in 1981 at Radio Shack Computer Centre, to which I was transferred from Sky Travels in the Bartleet Group. The task Gupta Gunawardene and I were called upon to perform was to start a computer school for the company. I had experience in the administration of Catholic Private Schools prior to joining the Bartleet group. We clicked well and worked happily together.
Having worked with Gupta for nearly 10 years at the Bartleet Institute of Computer Studies (ICS), we came to know each other closely. Gupta was a successful computer programmer, formerly attached to AMS computer Systems. Until 1990, he conducted many computer programming courses in BASIC and Cobol languages, and more than 5,000 school leavers, both boys and girls, passed through his hands as computer programmers. Gupta used neither test books to teach nor did he consulted others for knowledge. He trained students mostly by practical exercises and computer time sufficiently assigned. His attention was equally divided among all students and he had neither favourites nor specially-considered students. Later, he conducted courses in Systems Analysis and Design combined with Systems Analysts engaged in other commercial establishments. As a lecture, Gupta Gunawardene won the favour of all students.
Successful students of the Bartleet Institute of Computer Studies found easy employment in Computer firms and commercial establishments, while the cream was absorbed into Bartleet Group itself and its clients.
Some students went abroad and secured employment in the computer field. Due to popular demand, a branch of the Institute of Computer Studies was opened in Kandy and, three of our best students from Kandy were assigned to conduct lectures while Gupta monitored them. After About 1990, Bartleet Electronics started dealing in mainframe computers and Gupta was absorbed in developing tailor-made programmes for its clients banks and so on.
Gupta has an elder sister who is a retired doctor, and his brother-in-law is also a medical officer serving in the Army Hospital. Gupta's father associated closely with former premier Dudley Senanayake, but Gupta's family was never politically inclined. In fact, Gupta was a close associate of present Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; frequent school gatherings at St. Thomas and the Royal College gave both of them ample opportunity to meet and develop a friendship. Gupta was an avid reader of astrology, astronomy, psychology and the like. He was a jewel of a human being who caused no trouble to others.
Bartleet Electronics gained much from the ICS, and I feel happy that I was able to contribute my little share in serving the younger generation to achieve success in the computer field.
As he was a perfectionist, Gupta could not find an accurately-matching marriage partner of computer precision, and consequently, he remained a bachelor throughout. I was stressed when I heard of his death. Born on December 16, 1947, he passed away on December 12, 2012, at the age of 65 years.
We have truly lost a perfect gentleman, a kind-hearted human being, and a computer genius. May he rest in peace!

Army Commander orders conservation of over 200 threatened herbs
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake has ordered troops to help conserve more than 200 varieties of indigenous herbs, now threatened by extinction, following a request by reputed Anuradhapura Ayurvedic physician Dr. S. S. Gunawardene.
The commander made this order to the Army Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL) Commander, the Army media unit said.
Accordingly, the Army Directorate of Agriculture has come forward to assist the re-cultivation of those species of plants in Oyamaduwa in the Anuradhapura area after the Army collected those rare herbal saplings from every corner of the island.
Army troops in the DAL, in close cooperation with the Indigenous Medicine Department, launched the project for cultivation of those plants a few days ago in a land belonging to Dr. Gunawardene in Oyamaduwa with the active support of professionally-qualified agricultural instructors at the Army-run Manic Farm in Vavuniya.
To be in line with the national Wana Ropa project of the Environment Ministry under the Haritha Gammana concept, the project was made a reality under the guidance of DAL Director Brigadier Buwaneka Gunaratne after the DAL collected those rare herbal saplings such as sudu hadun, rath hadun, beli, beraliya, beheth anoda, madatiya, thippili, kekirinda, dodampana, gansooriya, and mahahinna
Troops of the 21 Division at Anuradapura also joined DAL troops on Friday (5) in Oyamaduwa and assisted the cultivation work in Dr Gunawardenes land of about 2 acres in extent. The simple inaugural ceremony was held under the directions of the Security Forces - Wanni (SF-W) Commander Major General Kumudu Perera and under the supervision of 21 Division General Officer Commanding (GOC) Major General Ruwan de Silva who attended the inaugural ceremony as the chief Guest.
Seth Pirith chanting and religious observances were administered by Thammanna Viharaya Incumbent Ven. Meepawala Sirisumana Thera to invoke blessings on the project.

Point of view
Equities opened 2018 on a strongly positive note, maintaining last weeks uptrend (+46 points) to gain ~145 points W-o-W and pushing the Index past the key 6500-mark for the 1st time in 2-months.
Bullish sentiment by both foreigners and local HNI & Institutional investors helped buoy markets, and the benchmark ASPIs 145 point gain in the 1st week of trading contrasts sharply to the 75 point loss recorded in the 1st week of trading in 2017 and the 168 point loss recorded in the 1st week of trading in 2016.
Foreign investors remained net buyers in local equities to the tune of Rs.2.0Bn this week, mirroring the general trend of continued risk appetite at the start of 2018 for EM equities which hit 6-year highs as new economic data showed the global economy expanding at a healthy pace.
Local HNI and Institutional investors meanwhile, returned to markets strongly this week, accounting for 60% of market turnover amid crossings in blue chips HNB (55% of total crossings), JKH (17% of crossings), Melstacorp (8%) and Sampath (8%).
Renewed interest in fundamentally strong counters helped drive the Indexs 145 point gain this week, with index heavyweights JKH and CTC accounting for 35 & 24.8 points respectively, of the indexs 145 point gain; Banking & Finance stocks (COMB,SAMP,LOLC & HNB) meanwhile, accounted for 25.7 index points while Telcos DIAL and SLT accounted for 14.8 points.
The Indexs positive performance translates to a 2.3% gain in the 1st trading week of 2018, a notable contrast to the loss of 1.1% in Q417. Sri Lankan equities returned 2.3% in 2017 for the 1st time in 3 years (2016 =-9.7% and 2015=-5.5%) as strong gains in Q217 (11.3%) helped offset losses of 2.7% in Q117, -4.6% in Q317 and -1.1% in Q417. The positive return of 2.3% on the ASPI in 2017 however, contrasts sharply with peers in EM & FM markets, which recorded multi-year highs of 34% (MSCI EM) and 24%(MSCI FM) in 2017. Current market momentum is likely to continue in the week ahead.
CBSL forecasts lowerGDP growth in 2017
At the annual presentation of its Roadmap for the year, the CBSL noted that growth in 2017 is likely to be lower than originally estimated (<4% cf. 4.5% originally) but that GDP should recover to 5-5.5% in 2018 amid ongoing legal amendments, the continuation of fiscal consolidation and stronger reforms to attract investment and boost exports1.
The Monetary Authority noted that 2017 was a challenging year due the economy-wide effects of inclement weather, noting that while the drought and floods disturbed agriculture/agro-based industrial activities, the spillover effects of these adverse weather conditions impacted the other sectors of the economy too.
The CBSL also noted that low economic growth was partly due to the tighter Monetary and Fiscal policy (aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability) which impacted public and private investment spending.
Weather-related supply disruptions, revisions to indirect taxes and increased prices of imported commodities meanwhile, impacted inflation levels making the CBSLs efforts to anchor inflation expectations challenging.
The CBSL noted though that despite these challenges, macro-economic stability is being restored and the economy is trending in the correct direction due in large part to the significant progress in several policy measures taken by the CBSL in coordination with the GoSL.
The CBSL added that while it had implemented several proactive policy measures in 2017 to achieve the core objectives of maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability, the GoSL has also remained committed to a revenue based fiscal consolidation programme that aims reduce budget deficits and debt levels progressively.

Barcelona sign 160-million-euro Coutinho in 3rd richest deal
BARCELONA - Philippe Coutinho finally got his wish on Saturday when Barcelona agreed to sign the Brazilian star from Liverpool for 160 million euros ($192 million) in the third richest deal of all time.
Barcelona and Liverpool have reached an agreement for the transfer of Philippe Coutinho. The player will sign a contract for the rest of the season and five more years with a release clause of 400 million euros, said a Barcelona statement. The deal for the 25-year-old attacking midfielder will be the third biggest in football after the 222 million euros Paris Saint-Germain paid Barcelona for Brazilian star Neymar last year and the 120 million euros that Kylian Mbappe will cost PSG from Monaco once the French player's loan period with the Ligue 1 champions is completed.
It is with great reluctance that we - as a team and club - prepare to say farewell to a good friend, a wonderful person and a fantastic player in Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told the club's official website.
It is no secret that Philippe has wanted this move to happen since July, when Barcelona first made their interest known. Philippe was insistent with me, the owners and even his teammates this was a move he was desperate to make happen. Rio-born Coutinho arrived at Anfield from Inter Milan for 8.5 million in January 2013 and scored 54 goals for the club in all competitions, although he won no silverware during his five-year stay.
Barcelona had tried to sign him in the summer, but his departure is a blow to Liverpool as the playmaker has just returned to top form after an injury-hit start to the season. He scored six goals in the last seven games of 2017 to put his side firmly in the Champions League places. Capturing Coutinho allows Barcelona to move on from the bitter experience of losing his Brazil teammate Neymar last summer. Coutinho had stayed in Liverpool on Saturday while his teammates jetted off to Dubai for warm-weather training, fuelling speculation that he was set to leave the Premier League club.
He was then photographed giving a thumbs-up as he left London for Spain accompanied by his wife Aine.
Coutinho is expected to watch his new team host Levante on Sunday afternoon at Camp Nou. Video posted on the club website showed a locker bearing his name had already been reserved for their new recruit. Coutinho's age is highly attractive to Barca, whose three main stars, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta are all in their thirties. Iniesta, at 33, has shown signs of fatigue this season.

Bernardeschi keeps Juventus on Napolis heels
MILAN, Saturday - Fernando Bernardeschi scored the only goal as champions Juventus kept Serie A leaders Napoli in their sights with a 1-0 win over Cagliari in Sardinia on Saturday.
Napoli cemented their position in top spot before Italys two-week winter break with 51 points from 20 games after seeing off Verona 2-0.
They are one point clear of Juventus with Inter Milan a distant third, nine points behind the leaders, after being held 1-1 at Fiorentina on Friday.
Italian winger Bernardeschi nudged home on 74 minutes following a solo break by Douglas Costa down the right flank, but there were worries for Massimiliano Allegris side with Argentina star Paulo Dybala limping off in tears with a suspected hamstring strain, and Sami Khedira receiving a head knock.
Were doing well so far this season, just just behind Napoli, through to the Champions League round of 16 and into the Italian Cup semi-finals, said Allegri.
Fortunately were go into a two-week break now and hell (Dybala) obviously need to rest more than the others during that time.
Both Napolis goals came in the second half against a dogged Verona, with Kalidou Koulibaly breaking the deadlock after 65 minutes in Naples and Jose Callejon sealing the win 13 minutes later.
Coach Maurizio Sarri remains cautious despite heading into the second half of the season ahead of the reigning six-time champions.
We know that Juventus have years of certainties -- that they can safely close above 90 points, while we cannot say the same thing about ourselves, said the Napoli boss.
We know that we must repeat last seasons performances to get back into the Champions League and anything more than that is undiscovered territory.
Roma missed the chance to join Inter on 42 points, slipping to fifth after a shock 2-1 defeat to ten-man Atalanta in Rome.
Atalanta -- fresh from their Italian Cup defeat of Napoli -- were two goals up by half-time through Andreas Cornelius and Marten de Roon.
Edin Dzeko reduced the deficit on 56 minutes but Roma failed to take advantage of playing the entire second half with an extra man on the pitch after de Roon was sent off for a second yellow card.
We started well for 10 minutes, then fell apart and lost our confidence after going a goal behind, said Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco.
Lazio -- like Roma with a game in hand -- moved just two points behind Inter into fourth after Ciro Immobile hit four goals in a 5-2 goal blitz in against SPAL.
Immobile is having another great season at Lazio after scoring 23 times last campaign, and moveed two ahead of Inters Mauro Icardi at the top of the Serie A scorers charts, with 20 goals in 19 games.
Spaniard Luis Alberto opened for Lazio after just five minutes with Immobile bagging a first-half hat-trick, completing the scoreline five minutes after the break.
Its a magic time for us, said Immobile. My goals come thanks to everyones work, there were perfect assists on the first three. We can now enjoy the holidays after this win.
Captain Leonardo Bonucci headed in his first AC Milan goal to see off Crotone 1-0 win at San Siro, further boosting the struggling side after their Italian Cup win over Inter.
The new year could not have started better, said the Italy defender of Milan who are on 28 points in eleventh position.  AFP

Biological brothers discovered after 60 years!
Lifelong pals Alan Robinson and Walter MacFarlane have been best mates for 60 years, ever since they played football together at prep school in Hawaii.
So the pair have been left "overwhelmed" after discovering that they are not just friends, but brothers too.
The men learned of their sibling bond after separately taking DNA tests to trace details about their ancestry. Mr MacFarlane never knew his father, while Mr Robinson was adopted, Honolulu news station KHON-TV reported.
After using DNA-matching websites following unsuccessful searches on social media and other sites, Mr MacFarlane found a top match - someone with identical X chromosomes - with the username Robi737. Mr Robinson, who flew Boeing 737 planes for Aloha Airlines, had used the same website to find answers about his ancestry, it transpired. After realising the connection, the pair learned they have the same birth mother. They said it had been an "overwhelming experience" as they revealed the news to friends and family.
"This is the best Christmas present I could ever imagine having," Robinson said.
"I had a younger brother that I lost when he was 19, so I never had nieces or nephews. I thought I'll never know my birth mother, I'll never have any nieces or nephews."
Both men said it had never crossed their minds that they might be related.
"But there was times when I did think, you know, I look like Robbie, a little bit," MacFarlane said.
The pair are now planning to enjoy retirement together as brothers. Sky News

China oil spill sparks fears of environmental disaster

There are fears of a growing environmental disaster in the East China Sea as a tanker continues to leak oil two days after colliding with a cargo ship.
The Sanchi tanker was still ablaze on Monday morning, reports said.
The crew, 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, remain missing.
The US Navy has sent a military aircraft to help China with the rescue efforts which have been hampered by the blaze and oil slick.
The extent of the spill and environmental hazard are still unclear.
The tanker had been carrying an ultra-light form of oil known as condensate which in the case of a spill can be more dangerous for the environment than regular crude.
"Condensate is more likely to evaporate and mix in with the water," John Driscoll of JTD Energy Services told the BBC.
"It also can be colour- and odourless - so it is a lot harder to detect, contain and clean up."
Though Panama-registered, the Sanchi belongs to an Iranian company.
The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of Iranian oil whenthe vessel collided with a Chinese cargo ship on Saturday night, 165 nautical miles east of Shanghai.
The 21-strong crew of the Chinese ship were rescued.
China has sent several ships to carry out search-and-rescue operations while South Korea has also sent a coast guard ship and a helicopter.

Think before you point the finger
It may be recalled and also conveyed the public that it was the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in Parliament, who first referred the Bond issue. He was open-minded enough to appoint a JVPer, who normally are against the UNP, as Chairman of the COPE committee.
We must not overlook the fact that it was the Premier Wickremesinghe who appointed a three-member committee to inquire into this Bond issue and then was on the verge of referring it to the AG. Then due to a demand by public, the President referred it to a Presidential Commission for a report.
After a full circle of eight months the report is out and I am sure it will be referred to Courts by the AG, if there is a Prima Facie case. Only then will the courts give a verdict and point out the accused parties. The media, however, have been quick to name the accused after repeating false headlines.

Colombo Engineering performs major crane repair afloat
Colombo Engineering of the MTD Walkers Group the most efficient ship repairing organisation located in Sri Lankan waters recently performed a major a crane repair operation whilst the ship lay afloat in the Port of Colombo
The 'Queen of Luck' managed by Victoria Oceanway Limited of Greece contacted Kiran Atapattu of Colombo Engineering over the telephone and requested immediate assistance to repair one of its defective and immobilized cargo cranes.
The repair location stood at an enormous height of sixty feet and a scaffolding system was installed for the technicians to reach the repair location.
Promptly the repair was inspected and it was discovered that both the hydraulic cylinders were defective. New pistons were manufactured using high quality material and the repair was completed. Sophisticated repairs of this nature prove that Sri Lanka has the expertise to match the technology of other International Ports in the world in this high foreign exchange earning business.

Combined operations to protect elephants and wild animals

The Wildlife officers, Police and Security Forces will launch combined operations to protect the elephant population and wild animals in forest reserves.
The decision was taken by the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry in the wake of escalated number of elephant deaths last year.
The full strategic plan of carrying out combined operations will be handed over to Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera onJanuary 16.
It was prepared by a Committee comprising of the representatives of the Wildlife Department, Forest Conservation Department, Mahaweli Authority, Archeological Department, Police and Security Forces.
The basic plan will be handed over to the Minister tomorrow.
The plan has been made after a careful study of the geographical location of the forest reserves, behavior of wild animals and other related matters.
The plan aims at combating wildlife crimes in a more effective manner.
The Security Forces and Police personnel will conduct operations in forest reserves and subject to the approval of the Director Generals of Wildlife, Forest Conservation and Archeological Departments.
Environmental activists and wildlife enthusiasts raised concerns over the killing of several tuskers in the recent past including Galgamuwe Dala Poottuwa.
According to the wildlife statistics, 279 elephant deaths had been reported in the island in 2016.
A considerable number of elephant deaths occur each year due to gun-shot injuries, hakka patas (explosives), and electrocution, poisoning and train accidents.

Constituted evolution
Title: Evolution of Constitutional Governance in Sri Lanka
Author: Prof. Lakshman Marasinghe
The first edition of this book was published in March 2007. Ten years have passed since the first edition was released. Sri Lanka has passed through many Constitutional stages since the first edition was published. The final constitutional document awaited is the new Constitution of 2017. Between the first set of instructions sent by the British Colonial Administration to the first Colonial Governor Fredrick North on May 25, 1798, and the last of the instructions, sent to Governors in place of constitutional documents there were eleven instructions. Thereafter, commencing from the Crewe-MacCallum Reforms of 1912, the Colony of Ceylon was governed by means of Instructions followed by Constitutional documents, by way of dispensations.
Commencing from the Crewe-MacCallum Reforms, there were six constitutions introduced for the Governance of the Island. Of those six, Whitehall was responsible for drafting the first four Constitutions. And the last two - of the 1972 and of the 1978 Constitutions, were home-grown. The responsibility for drafting them and promulgating them were undertaken by the same body; the two Sovereign Legislatures of Sri Lanka. These two last mentioned Constitutions may be characterized as autochtonous constitutions.
In the year 2000 an attempt was made to introduce a third autochtonous constitution. That attempt was rejected by Parliament and the attempt made under the Presidential Watch of Chandrika Bandaranaike failed without serious discussion.
Executive presidency
The next turn of the Constitutional wheel is currently unfolding. One of the central issues that is proposed to be amended in the new Constitution is the executive presidency. Centre periphery relations and revision of the fundamental rights chapter are also expected to be far reaching.
Together with the 19th Amendment, amending the 1978 Constitution, the above this work represents, a thumb-nail survey of, the Evolution of Constitutional Governance in Sri Lanka from Governor North (1798) to President Sirisena (2015).
Governor North was an appointee of the East India Company, a trading company incorporated at the time in the UK. It was incorporated with a memorandum and articles very similar to the other sovereign trading companies, which were the vehicles used at the time, both, to advance and establish British colonial rule and to obtain the earnings from colonial investments back to the U.K. The British East Africa Company and the Hudson Bay Company which operated from Canada were two such Sovereign Trading Companies.
In the instructions referred to above, dated May 25, 1798, the Board of Directors of the East India Company wrote:
You are hereby strictly enjoined to make diligent enquiry and to examine such documents and communicate with such persons as may best enable you to transmit to us the information thereby required, and for the better ordering of your Report on this subject it will be proper that you should arrange the same under several heads following: (1) Legislature, (2) Executive Government, (3) Courts of Justice, (4) Different Orders of inhabitants in the said settlement, (5) Revenue, (6) Commerce, (7) Religions and Religious Establishments, (8) Military, (8) Estates of absentees and of Minors. (Sri Lanka Archives  Log 5/1, File 1, Paragraph (5))
In a lengthy response to those questions raised in the first of the colonial instructions, North paid particular attention to the issues concerning the Legislature and the Executive. North wrote of that aspect, in his response:
The power which resided in the Dutch Governor and Council of Ceylon, subject to the Governor-General in Council at Batavia, is now, by his Majestys instructions to be exercised by me subject to the supreme government .----- The Executive power which resided in the same Governor and Council with the legislative, has in some manner been transferred to the Governor. The principal officers under him are: (1) The Commander of the forces, (2) the principal Secretary (3) The Auditor-General, (4) The Commercial Resident,
(5) The Deputy-Secretary, (6) The Collector of Jaffna, (7) The collector of Galle and of Matara, (8) The collector of Batticoloa and Mulativu. (Sri Lanka Archives- Log 5/1- File (1), Paragraph 17).
The Origins of constitutional governance in Sri Lanka, it may be considered, to have begun with the Colebrooke Reforms in 1833, under Governor Horton. Until those proposals were made and conveyed by way of a constitutional dispensation, to Governor Horton, the period of early Colonial Governance in Ceylon under North, Maitland, and Brownrigg were conducted under instructions drafted in Whitehall under the hand of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and transmitted to the Colonial Governor in Ceylon.
One part of the Colebrooke Cameron Report provided a system for the administration of Justice-that was the part of the Report drafted by Cameron. The other part of the same Report marked the commencement of a process for constitutional development which was ultimately to result in the grant of Dominion Status in 1948.
The author in his monograph, deals with this movement towards independence from the Colebrooke Reforms, through the Crewe-McCallum Reforms of 1912, The Temporary Constitution of 1921, The Manning Reforms of 1924, The Donoughmore Reforms of 1921 and into the Soulbury Reforms of 1947, which provided the Constitutional basis for the grant of Dominion Status in 1948.
Separately, the author has dealt with the first and the second Republican Constitutions of 1972 and of 1978. In addition the author has provided a separate chapter on the 2000 Constitution which failed to pass its Parliamentary scrutiny.
Historical factors
In dealing with each of these constitutions the author has quoted from original sources, gathered from the National Archives of Sri Lanka and from the National Archives of the UK. He has also considered several memorials written and submitted by Ceylonese, political, social, religious and ethnic groups which had at that time been formed within the country.
The author has woven into the fabric of his writing the conflicts that had arisen between the Ceylon National Congress and the All Ceylon Tamil Mahajana Sabbhai. He had dealt with the historical factors which had caused the several rifts among these groups, from original sources obtained from his archival research.
The author additionally and extensively deals, in the relevant chapters, the memorials presented by the Indian Association of Ceylon, The Malay Association of Ceylon and the Moor Community. These were principally targeted at the Manning and the Donoughmore Constitutions. The Tamil Congress headed by Mr. Ponnambalam dealt with what has now been referred to as the 50-50 plan for post Independent constitutional governance claimed by the Tamil Community. Those proposals were the principal proposals made, at that time, on behalf of the Tamil Community, and presented to the Soulbury Commissioners. The author extensively deals with those proposals in the chapter written under the Soulbury dispensations.
As an important appendix to the chapter on the 1978 Constitution, the author deals with some of the important Amendments to the 1978 Constitution, such as Amendments 13, 17, 18 and 19. As an addendum to Amendment 13, the author has devoted a separate chapter to the Role of the Provincial Governor under the 13th Amendment. This chapter is very relevant to the issues that have recently arisen between the Provincial Governors and Chief Ministers of the various Provincial Councils.
Of the three amendments included by the author, Amendment 13 deals with establishing Provincial Councils and their functions. Amendment 17 deals with the introduction of Constitutional Councils, the performance of which have been further strengthened in the 19th Amendment. Amendment 18 deals with the repeal of Article 30(2) of the Constitution which read:
No person who has been elected twice to the office of President shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people.
The author points out that its repeal gave the incumbent President at the time the right to seek the vote from the people for the third time. The author analyses in detail the weakness in the Determination made by the Supreme Court of the constitutional validity of that repeal. Amendment 19 principally repealed the repealing provision of 30(2), contained in the 18th Amendment. That re-established the integrity of Article 30(2). The author has provided extensive footnotes to his writing amounting to nearly 1800, and found in a total number of pages amounting to nearly 900. This work is the result of a long and laborious study of original documents found in the British national archives and the Sri Lanka national archives. It furthers and completes Lakshman Marasinghes earlier works and in particular the first edition of this work in 2007.

Cooked England lurching to defeat after Marsh brothers' tons
SYDNEY Sunday: Nathan Lyon was spinning Australia toward an emphatic victory in the final Ashes Test as beleaguered England unravelled on a torrid day in Sydney on Sunday.
The Australians amassed a massive 303-run innings lead in blistering heat and then reduced the battle-weary tourists to 93 for four at the close with a day to play. Compounding England's woes was a finger injury for skipper Joe Root, his team's last major hope of staving off a 4-0 series rout on Monday's final day of the Test.
Australia's Mitchell Marsh celebrates scoring his century against England on the fourth day of the fifth Ashes cricket Test match at the SCG in Sydney on January 7, -AFP
Root was unbeaten on 42 at the close with Jonny Bairstow not out 17.
Australia called a halt to their epic first innings at 649 for seven, and soon had England in trouble after the tourists had been cooked in the field for more than two draining days.
Mark Stoneman was leg before wicket to Mitchell Starc for a duck and lost a review in the process, and next ball Alastair Cook was put down at first slip by Shaun Marsh off Josh Hazlewood for five.
But Cook's reprieve did not last long and he was bowled for 10 when a sharp Lyon turner hit the top of off-stump in the off-spinner's first over.
Cook, who became during his innings only the sixth batsman to score 12,000 Test runs, finished the series with 376 runs at 47.
James Vince survived a caught behind off Lyon on review on 15, but three runs later edged Pat Cummins to Steve Smith at slip.
Dawid Malan followed when Lyon trapped him leg before wicket for five. Shaun and Mitchell Marsh earlier became the third set of brothers to score centuries in the same innings for Australia.
The Marsh boys joined Greg and Ian Chappell and Steve and Mark Waugh to score brotherly centuries for Australia, while it was the eighth time overall it had happened in Test cricket. The Chappells were the first Australian brothers to notch centuries in the same innings at The Oval in 1972 with the Waughs the last to do it against England, also at The Oval, in 2001.
Mitchell Marsh almost spolied his century in all the excitement as he embraced his brother mid-pitch before he had completed the second run scrambling back to his crease to avoid being run out.
Mitchell Marsh was bowled next ball by Tom Curran for 101 off 141 balls with 15 fours and two sixes. The century came after his 181 in the third Test in Perth.
He was the third centurion of the massive Australian first innings total, following Usman Khawaja's 171 on Saturday. Shaun Marsh was eventually dismissed after lunch, run out for 156 by Stoneman's direct throw from the covers. He batted for 403 minutes and faced 291 balls for his second century of the series and his sixth in 28 Tests. Starc slogged Moeen Ali for six and was out the next ball finding Vince at long on for 11.
Tim Paine (38) and Pat Cummins (24) were at the crease when Steve Smith called them in about an hour before tea. Big-hearted paceman James Anderson bowled with great economy in the stifling conditions as temperatures hit 42 Celsius (108 Farenheit), taking one for 56 off 34 overs.
Spinners Ali and debutant Mason Crane conceded a combined 363 runs in taking three wickets between them.

Cooking with Sylvia Plath
In Valerie Stiverss Eat Your Words series, she cooks up recipes drawn from the works of various writers.
In her diaries, Sylvia Plath (19321963) liked to boast about her damn good lemon-meringue pie, which she was able to produce even under difficult conditions. She once wrote that she cooled lemon custard and crust on cold bathroom windowsill, presumably due to lack of refrigeration at a rental apartment at Smith College. Pie-making enthusiasts will know that keeping the dough cold, cold, cold is the trick, and also that the fridge is pretty essential for setting a lemon curd. They will marvel, as I do, at Plaths excellent domestic skills.
Plath was committed to perfection both as a writer and as a woman of the 1950s, a work-life dilemma that still resonates with women today. In her stories, she tends to distill the nightmarish aspects of the feminine. In Mothers, for example, Esther, a character trying to fit into small-town life, cooks a giant rutabaga, which looked storybook at the market but after two minutes in the pressure cooker  shrank to a wan, orange mash that blacked the bottom and sides of the pot with a slick, evil-smelling liquor. Later, Esther dines at a buffet containing a startling number of cakes, all painstakingly decorated, some with cherries and nuts and some with sugar lace. Theres a sense of time wasted, of an intelligent person confronted with the absurd that I, who once set off for my Manhattan office job still wearing my apron, recognize myself in.
In Plaths diaries, however, the quotidian is mostly a source of joy. She loved to eat and cooked maniacally for dinner parties. In The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, she calls the author of the cookbook The Joy of Cooking, my blessed Rombauer, and reads the book like a rare novel, full of delectable recipes  with all the right touches of seasoning. She laments that instead of studying Locke, for instance, or writing    I go make an apple pie. But the pie makes her happy.
I made a breakfast mentioned in her journals of sauted cabbage on toast with bacon and potatoes, based on a technique found in the cabbage section of The Joy of Cooking. That right touch of seasoning is paprika. Though Plath loved coffee (we sipped scalding coffee, felt gray and diffuse as the wet weather), I paired the toast with her husbands preferred morning drink of brandy milk. Then, influenced by the scene in the movie Sylvia where Gwyneth Paltrow bakes all the cakesitself based on a story idea noted in Plaths diary I tried to produce a startling number of desserts. I did Plaths lemon-meringue pie and then, through a tantalizing mention of an angel topping in her diaries, made two more curds, of lime and orange, and two curd pies with angel crusts. I also made a loaf cake with a fancy decoration of nuts and cherries.
Plath committed suicide in her kitchen in 1963, at the age of thirty, carefully taping off the room her children slept in before turning the gas on and putting her head in the oven. Her diaries are full of the fight between her good self, that loves skies, hills, ideas, tasty meals, bright colors and the demon [that] would murder this self. Yet as bad as it got, she always felt that dusting, washing daily dishes, talking to people who are not mad  helps.

Coventry pile misery on Stoke, Chelsea held by Norwich
LONDON - Fourth-tier Coventry City piled on the misery for Stoke City manager Mark Hughes by pulling off the only genuine upset on a hectic day of FA Cup third-round action on Saturday.
Former Cup winners Coventry, now plying their trade in the bottom division of the Football League, revived memories of happier times as Jordan Willis and Jack Grimmer scored the goals in a 2-1 victory at the Ricoh Arena.
Elsewhere, the 25 ties offered only crumbs for the romantics seeking Cup magic although second tier Norwich City did hold champions Chelsea to a 0-0 draw.
Top-flight Bournemouth needed a late Steve Cook goal to draw 2-2 at home to League One leaders and 2013 Cup winners Wigan Athletic and Leicester City drew 0-0 at third-tier Fleetwood Town who struck the post in stoppage-time.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte made nine changes and his side struggled to make clear-cut chances in a dour game at Norwich who created the better opportunities. Runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City maintained their pursuit of an unprecedented four trophies, Sergio Aguero scoring twice as they came from a goal down to beat Burnley 4-1. Goals by Leroy Sane and Bernardo Silva killed off Burnley who had led at halftime thanks to an Ashley Barnes effort. Several clubs in the thick of the Premier League relegation battle survived potential banana skins.  Agencies

Dementia  A threat to the Asian region
We are all at some level of risk of developing dementia- some of us have a higher risk than others. A typical 70 - year old person is much more likely to develop dementia in the next five years than a typical 30 - year old person. It means the ageing population much more likely to face the risk of dementia than the younger age range. According to a report issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the number of people living with dementia has been increasing and is projected to reach 75 million worldwide by the year 2030 with the majority of these individuals living in low - income and middle - income countries as the result of the transformation of the ageing population. Because, it is considered the life expectation is high in those countries.
What is dementia
Dementia is a condition that results from disease of the brain. In medical terms, dementia is a syndrome - that is to say, a set of difficulties that a person experiences that can result from a number of underlying causes. Simply, it affects memory, thinking ability and ability to perform everyday activities. Over a hundred different types of dementia have been identified  fortunately the majority of them are extremely uncommon. The most common types of dementia are Alzheimers disease, Vascular dementia, Dementia with Lewy bodies and Fronto-temporal dementia. Vascular dementia is caused by conditions such as multiple mild strokes that block or reduce blood flow to the brain. Vascular dementia and Alzheimers disease can be difficult to distinguish because they present with nearly identical symptoms. One way to tell them apart is that Alzheimers dementia develops gradually, whereas vascular dementia appears suddenly. It is not always easy for doctors and their patients to pinpoint exactly when symptoms began and whether those symptoms were sudden or gradual, so further testing is needed to rule out one or the other condition. Depending on its cause, dementia can be reversible; however, symptoms caused by Alzheimers disease are irreversible and guaranteed to worsen over time. In most cases dementia does not affect a person until later in life - the large majority of people with dementia are 65 or older- but some disease that lead to dementia can affect younger people.
How it impacts the country
According to a recent World Bank Report, Sri Lanka is categorised as a lower middle-income country as per the capita GDP in 2016. Whilst, the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reports, Over the next 15 years, the number of older people is projected to increase by 66% in Asian region. World Health Organisation says, Currently 47.5 million people have dementia with just over half- 58% living in low and middle - income countries. And, Sri Lanka, as a country in the region needs to setup appropriate strategies to overcome the issue that could impact the country in both socially and economically due to the huge cost of dementia care and services. There is an urgent need for government to put in place policies and plans to ensure that adequate care and services are provided to people living with dementia in the future. Singapore has already started a National Dementia Network through the Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Ministry of health by stepping up funding and efforts in the eldercare sector as a whole. As of March, 2014, the Singapore Government has unveiled a budget that is targeted at the 450,000 post-65-year-old citizens who known as the pioneer generation that required assistance with healthcare needs. The Pioneer Generation Fund works on dementia - care to reduce the strain on the needy elderly with dementia. Alzheimers Association Japan (AAJ) also works for dementia which has been developing year by year and taking an important role as a key body formed by family caregivers and professionals concerned about dementia. In September 2012, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of the Japanese National Government announced a five year plan from 2013 to 2017 for promotion of measures against dementia.
In Sri Lanka, Lanka Alzheimer Foundation (LAF) based in Colombo operates with limited resources in order to cover dementia care services. On the other hand, dementia remains a relatively unknown subject in many areas in the country, and it is important the work in raising awareness amongst general public and policy makers.
Challenges for lower and middle-income countries
Resource limitation is evidently a major obstacle, particularly for lower and middle-income countries in Asian region. Inadequate policies, limited resources, lack of funding and also lack of awareness of recommendations, lack of appropriate prioritization of the needs of these marginalised group are major challenges to carry on appropriate care services for the people living with dementia. Dementia which has a uniquely devastating impact on capacity for independent living is often forgotten when policies for prevention and treatments. The organisations attached to care services need to stimulate a wider debate about older peoples health and social care needs, and how they should be met. Therefore, these societies have an important role to play in engaging the attention of public and policy makers to overcome the challenge.
Global impact
According to the World Alzheimer report published in 2015, it revealed the total estimated worldwide costs associated with dementia in 2015 was US Dollar 818 billion and it warned this amount is expected to become a trillion dollar by 2018 and rising to US Dollar 2 trillion by 2030. Alzheimers Disease International (ADI) urging policy makers around the world to approach the issue with a broader agenda and a wider representation of countries and regions, particularly those in the G20 group nations. A key recommendation of the report calls for a significant up scaling of research investment into care, treatment, prevention and cure. There is lack of awareness and understanding of dementia in most countries resulting in stigmatization, barriers to diagnosis and care, and impacting caregivers families and societies physically, psychologically and economically.
The report is expected to facilitate governments policy makers and other stake holders to address the impact of dementia as an increasing threat to global health. The report will promote dementia as a public health and social care priority worldwide.
Currently, around 47.5 million people living with dementia worldwide. It is estimated the total number of people with dementia is to 75.6 million in the year 2030 and almost triple by 2050 to 135.5 million with 7.7 million new cases every year. According to the World Alzheimer report published in 2015, it was projected to 46.8 million people with dementia worldwide in the particular year, indicating 9.4 million in the USA, 10.5 million in Europe, 4.0 million in Africa and 22.9 million in Asian region. The highest number of people living with dementia is from Asian region. Dementia mainly affects people over the age of 65. However, it can affect also younger people. Scientists are investigating how dementia develops at the young age. According to report published by The Public Library of Science (PLOS), certain types of dementia are inherited as a single gene that directly causes the disease. People with on of these genes will usually get dementia before the age of 65.
Can dementia be prevented
It is not usually possible to say for sure why a particular person has developed dementia. Factors such as high blood pressure, lack of physical exercise and smoking  all of which lead to narrowing of the arteries  increase and vascular dementia. There is evidence that a healthy lifestyle, especially in mid-life, can help reduce the risk of dementia. Regular physical exercise like cycling, swimming, brisk walking and maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and drinking alcohol only in moderation, if at all, are linked to a reduced risk of dementia.
A healthy balanced diet also helps to reduce a persons risk. A balanced diet is one which is low in saturated fat, does not have too much salt, sugar or red meat, and includes plenty of fish, starchy foods, and fruits and vegetables. All these healthy lifestyle choices will also reduce the risk of other serious conditions such as stroke, heart disease and cancer.
Following seven simple tips on cardiovascular health can help stop your brain deteriorating as you age, scientists claim. A study found we can fend off dementia by managing blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, being active, eating a healthy diet, losing extra weight and not smoking. Dr Phillip Gorelick - a vascular neurologist and the Professor of Translational Science and Molecular Medicine and the medical Director of the Hauenstein Neuroscience Centre in Michigan, USA says overtime, arteries carrying blood to the brain may narrow or become damaged, which can lead to dementia. Managing risk factors can make a world of difference for our long-term brain health. Dr Laura Phipps, from Alzheimers Research UK, added: What is good for your heart is also good for your brain.
Recent studies show a decline in the prevalence of dementia in high income countries. It has been suggested that this decline might be the result of changes in the profile of risk factors for dementia, suggesting that dementia may, at least particularly, be preventable. Considering the cost of dementia care, primary prevention is likely to be the cheapest way to reduce the projected impact of dementia in future generation.

Digital Economy Strategy to be launched in April
Sri Lanka plans to launch the proposed Digital Economy Strategy in April, which could uplift the nations economic growth by around 1-3 percent in 2019, the Prime Ministers Office said in a statement.
At a Steering Committee meeting held on January 4 at the Policy Development Office at Temple Trees where the inception report was presented, it was decided that the diagnostics phase of the assignment would commence by January 15 and last a period of two weeks. This would be followed by a five-week design phase, during which it is expected to have relevant programmes and projects identified and ready to be launched by early April, 2018.
McKinsey and Company, while presenting their inception report, confirmed that the proposed digital economy strategy for Sri Lanka, could uplift Sri Lankas GDP by 1 - 3 percent in 2019, the statement said.
Explaining the initiative, the Prime Ministers office said, In the middle of December, 2017, the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry, with the support of McKinsey and Company, embarked on the process of developing Sri Lankas digital economy.
This initiative would enable Sri Lanka to scientifically identify the appropriate opportunities for the promoting of Sri Lankas digital economy and the key enablers to promote the digital economy, as well as initiate three flagship programmes that would promote Sri Lankas digital economy strategy.
According to the Premier's office, the current consultancy with McKinsey and Company is a short-term eleven-week assignment which would be conducted in three phases.
The first phase would focus on the diagnostics to develop an understanding of Sri Lankas readiness to move into the digital economy.
The second phase would concentrate on designing three flagship programmes to initiate the digital economy and ten projects to establish key enablers to support the digital economy. The final phase would focus on launching the identified programmes and projects.
This initiative would strategise the promotion of the digital economy through the lens of three economic development thrust sectors, namely the agriculture, tourism and manufacturing sectors.
It is expected that each of these sectors would develop at least one flagship programme to support this initial stage of Sri Lankas Digital Economy Strategy.

Eleven Technological faculties started in universities - Minister Kiriella
Eleven Technological faculties and 35 departments have been started in the Universities by the Yahapalana Government, said Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Lakshman Kiriella.
Only the deans of the medical faculties and the medical council have the right to take decisions and express views on medical education. The Minister made these observations at the stone laying ceremony for the new building of the Technological faculty of the Colombo University.
According to the decisions taken by the government the doors will be opened for more than 20000 students in technological studies. No doubt that the number of technological students in the universities will be more than arts students within five years. The objective of the present government is to produce disciplined qualified graduates who are fit for the job market. But some graduates who are not fit for the available jobs since they have not trained for the requirements, the minister said.
The government is unable to arrange university education for each and every student who qualifies university education. That is how private universities had been established by other countries, the best example is India, the minister said.
We will start another three medical faculties in Ratnapura, Moratuwa and Northwestern province soon, safeguarding the free education policy and we will be able to enroll another 150 students to those medical faculties, minister said.
He further said that safeguarding the free education policies the government invites internationally reputed universities to Sri Lanka and Manipal University has already started discussions with the authorities.
Referring to the Saitum issue the minister said now it was solved successfully. A committee was appointed by the President and all parties accepted the solution given by the committee. The most important fact is that all the deans of the medical faculties of the state universities were in that committee. Today Saitum institute is not belongs to Nevil Fernando family. Saitum was closed. Government announced that an non profit earning institute will be established for Saitum students, minister said.

Fitch downgrades Sunshine Holdings to A-(lka); Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lanka-based Sunshine Holdings PLCs National Long-Term Rating to A-(lka) from A(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
The downgrade reflects Fitchs expectations that Sunshines net leverage - defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR, including proportionate consolidation of Estate Management Services (Private) Limited (EMSPL), the holding company for the agriculture and consumer goods segments - will remain higher than the level commensurate with a higher rating over the next three years.
The higher leverage is due to the substantial increase in debt following Sunshines acquisition of an additional stake in EMSPL from Tata Global Beverages for Rs 2.9 billion on 28 December 2017.
The acquisition will increase Sunshines ownership of EMSPL to 60%, from 33.2%, and improve the fungibility of group cash flow.

## Title: Four ways to drive diversity and inclusion in workplace
## Supertitle:

## Date: Monday, January 8, 2018 - 01:00
Four ways to drive diversity and inclusion in workplace
The global workplace is evolving and women are the next emerging market in the world (Ernst & Young, 2013).
The female labor participation rate in Sri Lanka stands at 35.9% (Department of Census and StatisticsSri Lanka, Q2 2017). Furthermore, Asia Pacific is home to 700 million adolescents or 45% of the worlds youth population.
The likes of which will lead to an increasingly diverse workforce with people possessing different upbringings, beliefs, principles and motivations; the subject of my talk at the Female Futures Forum 2017 held in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
There have been serious gains in the number of women graduating university and then entering the workforce. But that pipeline of educated, experienced women starts to leak when you look at the number of women assuming leadership roles. As a result, traditional workplace cultures need to change for businesses to remain competitive as the workforce evolves.
Empowerment has always been at the core of our industry and is core to Microsofts mission to enable every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
When we talk about empowering people, we simply mean that with the right tools, anyone can become anything. Empowerment, therefore, is key to building a diverse and inclusive workforce.
At Microsoft, we have been on a journey to leverage the strength of our diverse workforce through greater inclusion. After all, the diversity of our workforce and the inclusion of talented women from different backgrounds are the fuel that keeps our engines of innovation and growth running.
Create a more inclusive culture
It is important to have an inclusive workforce to be productive and competitive. However, unconscious biasor the attitudes and stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious mannercan work against this in unintentional ways.
For the past several years, we have set goals to increase diversity and inclusion across the company. And if there is one thing we have learned, building an inclusive organization is very much about the attitude and behavior of our leaders. It takes strong leadership and unwavering accountability, starting at the very top of the company.
As such, we have invested in unconscious bias training across the company, starting with leaders and then expanding unconscious bias training to reach every single one of their employees. Better yet, we have made this training publicly available via our Global Diversity & Inclusion training website.
Empower people
Wouldnt it be nice to work for a company that harbors smart, curious people who reflect all dimensions of diversity Our employee resource groups (i.e. disAbility; Women; Asians; Blacks; Gay, Lesbian, & Transgender; Hispanic/ Latino; and Parents) represent many different segments of our population and serve as outreach mechanisms between diverse communities and Microsoft as a whole.
These groups help support important business initiativesfrom recruiting and retention to the marketing of Microsoft products and services.
During my tenure at Microsoft, I have been both a participant and a speaker at our Women @ Microsoft events and know personally the impact that this investment can have on the empowerment and retention of employees.
Leaders that hope to inject diversity and inclusion in the workplace will need to scale learning and career development through such programs.
Expand the pipeline
Tech companies are often criticized for their slow process in employing more women and other underrepresented groups.
The reasons range from traditional mindsets to the lack of females in the STEM pipeline. At Microsoft, we hope to collaborate with other technology companies and non-profits to broaden the pipeline of diverse talent flowing into the industry.
Through Microsoft YouthSparka global program designed to help children prepare for the workplace of tomorrowwe have built partnerships with more than 65 schools, trained over 35,000 teachers and created new opportunities for more than 1 million young men and women in Sri Lanka. Annual hour of code sessions, and student hackathons, have given them a glimpse of what STEM and a career in technology can offer. We have also invested over $11m towards building a future-ready generation in Sri Lanka since 2006.
Today, our board of directors is among the most diverse of any company in technology, with women and ethnic minorities representing six of our 14 positions.
Delight your customers
Leveraging global diversity and inclusion will help create better ideas and better products to serve customers.
Over the last several years, we have hosted an annual Ability Summit which brings engineers, designers and other tech professionals together to work side-by-side with people with disabilities, who represent 15% of the world population, to help create the next wave of great, accessible products and services that will help them achieve more.
Customers are aware of the needs of the people with disabilities and make purchasing decisions based on how companies treat them.
During my speech at the Females Future Forum, I challenged more men to become a part of the conversation. I also suggested to women the following advice: be unapologeticmeaning let go of the guilt that often keeps us caught in the middle between work and family; seek out diverse feedback; be part of the solution; garner the support of your partner; and as Sheryl Sandberg famously said, Lean In.As businesses face stiff competition, workplace models across industries are also being scrutinized.
Therefore, leadership in this age requires a collaborative mindset, and an ability to collectively envisage a diverse and inclusive future.

It is a great accomplishment that we were able to secure Galle Fort in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and if we had failed to retain its place in the list, it would have been a shame to our country, the Minister said.

GSP withdrawal; Overall impact on countrys total exports will be small - AmCham
With effect from January 1, 2018, the United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was discontinued for 120 countries across the world. Sri Lanka is one of them.
This decision while not being country-specific, is one stemming from the US Congress simply not re-authorizing the program before adjourning for the year 2017.
The United States is Sri Lankas top export market. In 2016, the US imported USD 2.8bn worth of Sri Lankan goods. We expect 6.2% of these exports to be impacted by the discontinuation of the GSP program.
While recognizing that these particular goods will be affected by the rescinding of the GSP program, AmCham is of the view that the overall impact on countrys total exports will be small.
AmCham said they do recognize that some of their members will be affected by the rescinding of the GSP program; and as such, AmCham pledges its fullest support to its members and will work alongside relevant authorities with regards to this as well as to further improve bilateral trade, investments and relations, and to support the countrys economic development by strengthening the business environment and stimulating foreign direct investments.
The GSP program, like many other U.S. trade preference programs provides opportunities for many of the worlds low-income countries to use trade to grow their economies and alleviate poverty. GSP is the largest and oldest U.S. trade preference program and was established by the Trade Act of 1974.
GSP promotes economic development by eliminating duties on thousands of products when imported from one of 120 designated beneficiary countries and territories.

HUAWEI nova 2i released in Sri Lanka
HUAWEI nova 2i was released in Sri Lanka in early November 2017.
In addition to being equipped with the Kirin 659 chip and Huawei EMUI 5.1, the highlight of the smartphone is the HUAWEI nova 2is quad-camera and FullView Display flagship configuration.
In 2016, Huawei released the "Leica dual camera" concept on the new P9 as its first collaboration with the photography industry. Not only did this place two cameras on the back of the phone, Leica colors was also introduced to greatly improve the phone camera's performance in capturing vivid colors and light.
This also made "dual-camera technology mainstream in the industry. From the actual shooting effect perspective, a camera with dual back cameras has a significant advantage and the photo gets a naturally blurred background that highlights the main subject. Regardless of whether you are a professional photographer or not, you can use the dual cameras to take great photos and share them in your posts with your friends.
By using the dual cameras on the back, we gradually noticed the limitations of a singular camera, especially for selfies. It's difficult to take the perfect selfie when so many come out blurry or looking unrealistic.
Why not place two cameras on the front as well And so, the "quad-camera" concept of having two cameras on the front and on the back was created. The HUAWEI nova 2i is Huawei's first "quad-camera" phone.
The two cameras work together to implement background blurring at various levels based on the depth information. Blurring is increased farther away from the subject for a more realistic effect.
To provide users with better selfie effects, the HUAWEI nova 2i is equipped with a studio-quality, smart Selfie Toning Flash that provides the perfect soft-light in low-light environments or even when there is no light.
The Selfie Toning Flash, in addition to the dual cameras will be able to capture people and backgrounds under dim lighting. You no longer need to feel restricted by your environment. Now you can take beautiful selfies even under dim lighting.
In order to avoid having a front light that is too dim, too bright, cant be adjusted, or creates unrealistic lighting, the HUAWEI nova 2i adds smart Selfie Toning Flash modes in Camera, including auto off and Selfie Toning Flash. This allows you to adjust the lighting as you see fit for beautiful and natural-looking photos.
The HUAWEI nova 2is front light provides 120-degree lighting to ensure maximum light coverage when taking selfies. This casts a Selfie Toning Flash on the subject's shoulders and chest as well as on top of the subject's head for the most flattering selfies.
In addition, the HUAWEI nova 2is front-shooting mode is equipped with Beauty 4.0, which incorporates gender identification, beautification, video beautification, and other features so that you'll always look your best whether in selfies or video chats. There are also 18 different fun effects to make taking selfies more interesting and fun.
Since its release, the Huawei nova series has focused on hard work, fearlessness, and growth, making it a favorite among college students. And now the new nova 2i, as the first Huawei "quad-camera", "full-screen" smartphone, stands ready to meet the needs of its young customers and to demonstrate Huawei's confidence in its performance.

Less than eight hours sleep is linked to anxiety and depression
Insomniacs are unable to overcome negative thoughts
Less than eight hours sleep is linked to anxiety and depression, new research suggests.
Insomniacs are less able to overcome negative thoughts than those who get sufficient shut eye, a study found.
Being unable to nod off also reduces peoples ability to disengage from negative emotions, the research adds.
Study author Professor Meredith Coles from Binghamton University, said: We found that people in this study have some tendencies to have thoughts get stuck in their heads, and their elevated negative thinking makes it difficult for them to disengage with the negative stimuli that we exposed them to.
We realized over time that this might be important - this repetitive negative thinking is relevant to several different disorders like anxiety, depression and many other things.
Up to 50 percent of people in the US have difficulty falling or staying asleep. Anxiety and depression affect around 40 and 16 million adults, respectively, every year in the US.
+1
How the research was carried out
The researchers analyzed 52 adults with repeated negative thinking (RNT).
RNT is the compulsive focus of attention on thoughts that cause sadness, anxiety and distress.
The studys participants had varying sleep durations and bedtimes. Interviews were carried out to determine their sleep patterns.
They also viewed images intended to trigger an emotional response, as well as neutral pictures, while the researchers monitored their eye movements.
People have tendencies to have thoughts stuck in their head
Results reveal getting insufficient sleep causes people to spend more time looking at emotionally-negative images.
Insomnia also results in sufferers being unable to disengage from the negative pictures they view.
Professor Coles said: We found that people in this study have some tendencies to have thoughts get stuck in their heads, and their elevated negative thinking makes it difficult for them to disengage with the negative stimuli that we exposed them to.
While other people may be able to receive negative information and move on, the participants had trouble ignoring it.
We realized over time that this might be important - this repetitive negative thinking is relevant to several different disorders like anxiety, depression and many other things.
This is novel in that were exploring the overlap between sleep disruptions and the way they affect these basic processes that help in ignoring those obsessive negative thoughts.
The researchers are carrying out further studies to determine how the timing and duration of sleep contributes to psychological disorders.
This may allow psychologists to one day treat anxiety and depression by aiding sufferers shut eye.
The findings were published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry.

LACK OF SLEEP COULD BE EXPANDING YOUR WAISTLINE, STUDY FINDS
Lack of sleep could be expanding your waistline, research suggested last July.
People who get an average of six hours sleep a night have a 3cm thicker waist than those who have nine, a study found.
Shorter sleep is also associated with lower amounts of good cholesterol in the blood, which previous research demonstrates helps to protect against conditions such as heart disease.
Study author Dr Laura Hardie from the University of Leeds, said: Because we found that adults who reported sleeping less than their peers were more likely to be overweight or obese, our findings highlight the importance of getting enough sleep.
How much sleep we need differs between people, but the current consensus is that seven to nine hours is best for most adults.
The researchers did not speculate on why lack of sleep causes weight gain, however, past studies suggest it causes excessive amounts of the hormone ghrelin to be released, which is linked to appetite.

Lasantha died exposing corrupt deals of former regime  Rajitha
Co-Cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, speaking yesterday at the 71st General Convention of the UNP at Campbell Park made startling revelations regarding the brutal assassination of Lasantha Wickrematunge whose 9th death anniversary falls today.
Lasantha Wickrematunge, Editor-in-Chief of the Sunday Leader, a correspondent for TIME Magazine and an outspoken critic of the government was ambushed and assassinated at the Attidiya junction on the morning of January 8th 2009, while driving himself to work.
Lasantha was privy to confidential information emanating from a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ukranian government, Minister Senaratne stated. Lasantha knew of the extent of corruption and went on to publish an article on it, but couldnt prove his claims later at a court case.
The Minister added that the then government engineered a scheme to enter into a second MoU. By this time, Lasantha gathered much more information and intended to publish an article. The government got to know and felt it would be better if they got rid of him before tabling the second MoU.
Minister Senaratne said that the investigations were ongoing and that that he was confident of the Police bringing the culprits to book. In 2016, a military intelligence officer was arrested for abducting Wickematunges driver and intimidating him against implicating former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in the assassination. Wickrematunges body was exhumed in September 2016, and it was revealed in courts that Lasantha died from a blunt blow to the head, and that the cause of death certificate initially submitted to court by then Judicial Medical Officer Dr. K. Sunil Kumara contained false and misleading statements.

## Title: Let them eat bread
## Supertitle:

Let them eat bread
Bread is important. One cannot put it more simply, and yet the reasons could scarcely be more complicated. It is the staff of life, transubstantiated in the eucharist into the body of a divinity; we break it with our companions (com + pnis, with + bread); we pray for it daily to our Lord (from the Old English word hlford, which originated from hlfweard, meaning loaf-ward or bread-keeper); at the Passover Seder, observant Jews eat the bread of affliction, the unleavened matzo (the Catholic communion wafer is made to the same recipe).
There is the enriched challah, which is blessed and thus sanctified on the Jewish Sabbath, the sweet Twelfth Night bread that contains a token effigy of the infant Jesus, dozens of Easter breads, numerous iftar breads baked for ending the fast in various Muslim cultures, and the Parsee drn offering.
In the Hebrew scriptures lechem is the sole word used to denote bread, although it is also used to signify food in general, or a particular unit of food, so when God, in Genesis 3:19, tells Adam in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread, He is employing synecdoche to express Adams vast punishment.
Yet, as Scott Cutler Shershow points out in his eye-opening short book Bread (which treats bread as an object, in a series that also includes Refrigerator, Hotel and Cigarette Lighter), the Jewish Sabbath blessing over bread doesnt mention human toil, but praises God who brings forth (ha motzi) bread (lechem) from the earth.
Moreover, in the Rabbinic tradition, man doesnt thank God for the harvested grain itself, but for the baked loaves; and there has been Talmudic speculation that, when the messiah comes, God would yet again bring forth not merely grain, but also bread itself, directly from the earth. Note, too, that Jesus was born in Bethlehem (bethlechem, the house of bread). Before all this, in ancient Greece, the Eleusinian Mysteries involved the goddess of the harvest Demeter (Ceres in Rome), and, according to surviving inscriptions, initiates would glimpse the secret in an ear of grain in silence reaped.
Our bread and butter is the source of our income; bread and water, our severe punishment; and bread and circuses describes how a despot (or even a legitimate ruler) keeps hoi polloi from rebelling. But man does not live by bread alone, although we strive to earn our crust, to put bread on the table, because we want to be the breadwinner, not on the breadline, or fed the crumbs from the rich mans table; we struggle against having the bread taken out of our mouths.
From the ancient Greeks to Karl Marx, from Peter Kropotkins The Conquest of Bread (1892) to the cry  le pain se lve!  of the Jacquerie in the peasant revolt of 1358, and the Egyptian bread riots of 1977, provoked by the abrupt end of government grain subsidies, bread has represented the concept of value itself.
The overarching slang trope of money as bread is easy to explain (dough is a bit more puzzling). As Di Murrell comments in her surprisingly wide-ranging Barges and Bread: Canals and grain to bread and baking, as early as 1266 in England the creation of the Assize of Bread and Ale used grains of wheat as the underlying measure from which all weights and measures were derived, and in 1303 it decreed that an English penny shall weigh 32 grains of wheat dry. (Commentators have long noted that even the premodern taxman could not have been bamboozled into thinking that thirty-two grains of wheat, though taken from the middle of the ear, was an exact measure.) Perhaps more optimistic American slang prefers dough because dough can expand and increase.
Before dough can be made, though, wheat must be ground or milled. Volume Two of Nathan Myhrvold and Francisco Migoyas Modernist Bread (which comes in five massive instalments plus a spiral-bound kitchen guide, encased in its own metal bookcase, the whole weighing 24 kg) lists some common expressions derived from flour milling, including the serious impediment implied by having a millstone around your neck (for Jesus it was not only a difficulty, but a method of capital punishment: Matthew 18:6, But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea); putting someone through the mill; and grist for the mill.
Keeping your nose to the grindstone can mean working conscientiously by being alert for the smell of an overheating millstone  or it might be related to knife-sharpening. Henry Wadsworth Longfellows threatening verse, Though the mills of God grind slowly, / Yet they grind exceeding small, can be traced back at least to Plutarch, while separating the wheat from the chaff  making a judgement of quality  has a literal as well as metaphorical application, as does run of the mill meaning average, in reference, say Myhrvold and Migoya, to the mill run, which includes all the grain processed by the mill before its sorted.
The British Isles, with a population of about 3.5m in the 1300s, write Myhrvold and Migoya in their first volume, needed to have at the ready as many as 7m loaves of bread [weighing 1 kg each] every single day. Today, the UK population (which they put at 65 million at the time of writing) buys about 12 million loaves daily. Whereas most of pre-modern mankind relied on this single food for subsistence, bread is no longer our primary food; bakers no longer occupy a central place in our culture as, with a few exceptions such as war-time, the bread supply is no longer a matter of state.
Still, we can appreciate the force of this, from a poem by John Penkethman in 1638 (quoted by Shershow): Let Butchers, Poulters, Fishmongers contend, / Each his own Trade in what he can defend; . . . / Yet no man can deny (to end the strife) / Bread is worth all, being the Staff of Life. The staff of life, Shershow reminds us, also represents death. In Robert Burnss version, from 1872, of the ballad of John Barleycorn, three kings swear a solemn oath / John Barleycorn should die.
They plough, and sow him under a clod, but in cheerful spring he is resurrected, to their surprise; and in summer he grows thick and strong, before growing wan and pale in autumn, when his enemies cut him at the knees, and take him to be tortured  a miller usd him worst of all, / For he crushd him between two stones. Or, in a couplet Shershow remembers (but cant attribute), It goes in living, it comes out dead; / It goes in dough, it comes out bread.
His contemporary John Wesley, meanwhile, compared the life and death of wheat to the Passion of Christ; and the Yiddish proverb has it that Alts drait zich arum broit un toit, everything turns on bread and death.

Major insurance scheme introduced for crop damages
A new insurance scheme for crop damages was introduced from 2017/2018 Maha cultivation Season proposed by Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake on the instruction of the President, Anuradhapura Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board Deputy Director N.P. Munasinghe told the Daily News.
The scheme approved by the Cabinet was empowered by the circular No. 07/2017 of the Agriculture Secretary. Compensation up to Rs. 40,000 per acre for crop damages caused by wild elephants is granted under the insurance scheme. Munasinghe said that from 2017/2018 Maha season, compensation for paddy, maize, potatoes, big onions, Soya bean, chillies (six varsities) will be granted up to Rs. 40,000 per acre. Farmers has to pay only a Rs.675 premium twice per year for the Yala and Maha seasons for them to be eligible for the scheme.
A steering committee headed by the government agent along with agencies in agriculture sector manage the scheme. Divisional level committees chaired by divisional secretaries maintain the regional payments.Agriculture Research and Production Assistants issue insurance receipts and carry out crop damage inspections and report the process to the committee through district agrarian services deputy commissioners. Munasinghe asked farmers in the Anuradhapura district to inform crop damages caused by wild elephants to the nearest Agriculture Research and Production Assistant or directly to the Anuradhapura Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board for them to have compensation.
They can inform crop damages on 0252222741/0255679094 as well to get relief.
Representatives of farmer organisations said the new scheme has no provisions to cover damages to coconut and several other cultivations that wild elephants destruct more often.
Therefore, they urged the authorities to include them as well in the new scheme.
Munasinghe said the Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board, Anuradhapura has paid Rs. 452.5 million as compensation to 34,607 farmers for drought damages for the 2016/2017 Maha season.
The farmers, however, had not paid any instalment for the crop insurance scheme. Each farmer was paid Rs. 10,000.
The amount will be increased to Rs. 40,000 in future, he said.

A mission unswayed through four decades
Sri Lanka would finally come to terms with the winding trajectories of the Mahaweli river as President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe declare open the Moragahakanda-Kaluganga scheme; completing the saga of a 40-year Development Programme, today.
Former River Valleys Development Board and Mahaweli Development Board Chairman Douglas Ladduwahetty.
The completion of the Mahaweli Development Programme celebrated today at a grand ceremony in Polgolla, the first diversion by the President and Prime Minister, would bring to an end an era of major dams and irrigation projects.
The Mahaweli Development Programme, in many instances, brought out the best in public service, while also highlighting their ingenuity, commitment, perseverance and capability to adapt to difficult and changing circumstances. For many, it was a platform to boost their careers, and it gave a generation of civil servants, the courage and capacity to dream of something bigger than themselves. Forty years later, many who spoke of the Mahaweli Programme with the Daily News, did so with awe, especially in the case of its Accelerated Phase.
What we gained during that time was tremendous confidence and that took over a short period of 10 years. Unfortunately, this is not something local engineers are exposed to now, because you dont have much material to play with, said Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) Consultancy Division Head T. B. Wickremaratne, who joined the Mahweli Programme as a civil engineer, right out of university, 36 years ago.
It was not a bureaucratic problem; it was about funds. It showed that the very same people who were thought of as inactive, were working well. If you design something and have no money to construct it, people would not be motivated. But when we got the foreign inputs, we did it, he added.
It has been an arduous task over the years and a thorn in plans of several governments, but as a concept, the Mahaweli Development Programme has been the favourite child of every consecutive government since the 1960s. D. S. Senanayake, the father of resettlement and multipurpose irrigation projects, had started his Gal Oya scheme and passed on his passion to his son Dudley Senanayake, who initiated the first Mahaweli Development Programme, with a grander vision than that of his father.
The idea came in 1968, it was not one mans idea. Many politicians had thought of it since independence. But around 1968, the government felt that we needed to do something to increase our agricultural productivity, but we first needed to solve the problem of having large tracts of land in the North, and North Central Provinces were without water, recalled Wickremaratne.
In addition to food security, since 1945, the government saw a sharp rise in population in Ceylon; and the Wet Zone, where the people were mostly concentrated in, reached a figure of around 1,200 people per square mile. This motivated the government to develop the Dry Zone and settle more people there.
The 30-year plan
CECB Consultancy Division Head T. B. Wickremaratne.
The CECB, set up in 1973, was formed exclusively to provide consultancy services, mainly engineering for large-scale water projects identified in the United Nations Development Programme/Food and Agriculture Organization (UNDP/FAO) Master Plan of 1968; otherwise known as the 30-year Mahaweli Development Programme. The Project covered 39 percent of the whole island and 55 percent of the Dry Zone. It included the Mahaweli Ganga basin, the basin of the Maduru Oya, and rivers in the North Central part of the island. Further, it looked to build the major dams and reservoirs of Polgolla, Bowatenne, Victoria, Kotmale, Rantambe, Randenigala, and Moragahakanda.
The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka noted, The area classified as suitable for irrigation extended to approximately 1.5 million acres, of which 900,000 acres would be commended by the proposed irrigation systems (of this 246,000 acres are at present partially irrigated). There remains therefore, 600,000 acres of land of which 54,000 acres presently cultivated, but not commanded by the irrigation systems. Its envisaged that the balance of 546,000 acres will remain under forests of the new land to be developed for irrigation, which is 654,000 acres (900,000  246,000), 360,000 acres area in the basins of the Mahaweli Ganga and Maduru Oya, and 294,000 acres are in the North Central region.
The UNDP/FAO study on the Mahaweli had given the green light to then Dudley Senanayakes government to go ahead with the project, but given the size of the economy and perceived resource capabilities of the then government, they had proposed that it be implemented over a 30-year period under three phases. The land was to be grouped into 13 irrigation systems from A to M.
Thus, with all confidence, Senanayake commissioned the first project of the Mahaweli; the Polgolla Dam on February 28, 1970, a few weeks before Parliament was dissolved. His project was thereafter taken up by next SLFP government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The 1970s were a tough period for Sri Lank; the Cold War was in full force, and in 1973, the Oil Crisis hit the world, making all major development programmes difficult to be implemented in the country, and Bandaranaike, though choosing to follow a policy of non-alignment, had drifted towards the Soviet bloc.
We were thinking of self-reliance at the time, said Wickremaratne. In a way, we had no choice; the oil prices made imports very expensive and we had to find ways to save our foreign reserves. More importantly, we had to stop importing agricultural produce such as rice, he added.
A map of the Mahaweli projects and areas in 2010.
Hence, it fell to the CECB to have its own engineering board and work on developing plans for the irrigation projects locally.
We had already done Gal Oya, and we did have the engineering know-how to do it. The basic planning capabilities were there, and we had a good engineering resource base, addedWickremarane.
Polgolla
Though commissioned in 1970, the Polgolla Dam took over two and a half years of political bickering to actually start, as the United Front coalition commissioned a Dutch firm for the further development of the irrigation and water resources of the Mahaweli. This came to be known as the NEDECO report.
Polgolla was the main place to divert, and it was ideal having considered several other places close by, explained Wickremaratne.
It was planned 100 percent by locals, and the State Engineering Corporation and Mahaweli Development Board (which was newly-formed for the project), was involved, he added.
According to Wickremaratne, if you were to take water from the Mahaweli to the areas of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Kala Wewa, you had to start doing that at Polgolla. It was also an area without many human settlements, thus, social impact was minimal. This dam, however, took the longest time to build of all the Mahaweli projects (five years), given the intricacies of its tunnel construction.
The tunnel was done by a Yogoslovian company and the powerhouse, by Sri Lankans. A lot of local engineering and resources were used, said Wickremaratne.
It was the first and only Mahaweli project of the United Front coalition government.
The Accelerated Programme
K. M. de Silva and Howard Wriggins in their biography of late President J. R. Jayawardena, note that by 1967-77, the UNP under J. R. had been preparing their own plans for the future, and among these was the revival of the Mahaweli.
J. R. had identified three positive benefits from a revived and revamped Mahaweli programme. First of all, it would substantially reduce unemployment which stood at 20 percent of the work force in 1976-77second, it would be a great fillip to the attainment of self-sufficiency in rice.and finally, there was the whole question of power generation for industries and for rural electrification in a country which had no coal or oil.
The new government thus changed the priorities of the project to add energy generation and not just irrigation, said Wickremaratne.
This meant that they would have to set aside the development of Moragahakanda; a reservoir mainly for irrigation, with very little power-generation capabilities.
The total installed capacity in the 1980s stood at a mere 300 MW; 5-6 hour power cuts were normal. And when you took the Mahaweli, Victoria alone would add 200 MW, so it was a wise decision to concentrate on power, added Wickremaratne. Eventually, it helped J. R.s government to treble the countrys power generation, and by the early 80s, Sri Lanka had the highest consumption of power in Asia.
Plans to develop Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, and Maduru Oya were thus underway. The challenge, however, was to complete the whole project in a short span of six years and not 30a decision President Jayawardena had made during the first three months of coming to office in 1977.
When J. R. took over, he sent for me; he knew I had worked on Uda Walawe and had completed it. He showed me a document and asked me, how long will you take to do this I said six years, immediately. I was not sure, but I said so, and it got done by that time. It was not an analysis; I had not analysed it, but I gave a figure, and it was done during that period. Not sure if it was luck or what. Then just like that, he said to take it and do it, said 93-year-old retired Civil Engineer and former River Valleys Development and Mahaweli Development Boards Chairman Douglas Ladduwahettythe man who spearheaded the implementation of the Accelerated Programme.
The one condition put forward by the engineers to J. R. was that they could do it if they were given the money and equipment.
To solve the problem of finance and technology, the government decided to give each project to different countries; we had shifted towards the US at the time and the West was willing to fund and help us, said Wickremaratne.
According to de Silva and Wriggins, on October 14, 1977, the government held a five and a half-hour Cabinet meeting at the Mahaveli Development Board premises on Jawatte Road, Colombo 5. This was the first and only Cabinet meeting ever held outside the Cabinet office or the Presidents House. All technical officers were invited to this meeting and it was decided here that they would accelerate the programme. The green light was given by cabinet to go ahead with all arrangements.
In early November, 1977, the new mega of the Mahaweli Development Ministry was created and Gamini Dissanayake was put in charge of it. This ministry also created the Mahaweli Development Authority and the then UNP Chairman N. G. P. Panditaratna was appointed as its Chairman. The Mahaweli Master Plan then condensed to six years, was put up for foreign funding.

Polgolla Diversion Complex
ThePolgolla Diversion Complex consisted of a diversion dam built across the Mahaweli Ganga at Polgolla to divert river water to the Dry Zone through a five mile-long under-ground tunnel connecting Mahaweli to the Sudu Ganga and a hydro-electric power station of 40 MW. An extent of approximately 140 hectares (350 acres) of land had been acquired for this complex.
Execution of Project I of Phase I was commenced in 1970 and completed in 1977. It comprises of a barrage across the Mahaweli Ganga at Polgolla to divert a maximum of 2,000 cusecs through a five-mile long pressure tunnel to a power plant of 40 MW of installed capacity situated in the adjacent Amban Ganga basin. The tail race water flows down a tributary of the Amban Ganga into a reservoir at Bowatenna formed by a concrete dam across the river, which diverts part of the flow into the adjacent Kala Oya basin through a four-mile long tunnel and a Tran basin canal into Kalawewa and Kandalama reservoirs. The rest of the diverted water, along with the natural flow of the Amban Ganga, is sent down the river to be diverted at the existing Elahera and Angamedilla diversion weirs into existing conveyance canals. The total extent of land benefitted by Project I is 132,000 acres of existing fields and 91,000 acres of new lands.
The discharge of 1,300 cusecs is sent farther down the Amban Ganga and diverted at the Elahera anicut through Elahera  Minneriya  Kantalai  Yoda Ela canal to Minneriya, and from there, to the Kaudulla and Kantalai tanks, which supply water to system D-1. The Mahaweli System G is irrigated directly from this canal. The remaining 700 cusecs is transferred through the Polgolla  Kala Oya canal (P K) to Kalawewa and Kandalama tanks, from which 70 percent of System H is irrigated.
Dam type - Concrete Barrage
Dam height - 14.6 m
Length - 144 m
Gross storage - 4.1 mcm
Live storage - 2.1 mcm

Monfils back in business with Doha title
QATAR, Saturday - Persistence finally paid off for fit-again Frenchman Gael Monfils as he claimed the Qatar Open title with a 6-2 6-3 victory over promising Russian Andrey Rublev on Saturday.
Monfils had lost three times in the final, most recently in 2014 against Rafa Nadal, but left nothing to chance this time as he outclassed Rublev in 61 minutes. The 31-year-old former world number six slipped down the rankings last year as injuries struck and ended his year after the U.S. Open citing a right knee injury.
Im very happy, Monfils said. I like this tournament so much. I always come back and I finally got it. So Im just very happy and very proud.
Its been a while. I was waiting for that moment to get back in shape. In 2016, I was almost on my top and I had a very good year, finishing at six. I couldnt really defend my chances in 2017. I had a long rest and came back strong in 2018.
Although it was a disappointing day for Rublev, the 20-year-old has sent out an early signal that he will be a force this year. He more than matched Monfils for firepower but was frustrated by the Frenchmans defensive skills and despite defeat he is projected to rise to a career-high 32 in the rankings.
Monfils, who reached the final after top seed Dominic Thiem withdrew on Friday due to illness, made it a good day for Frenchmen in the build-up to the Australian Open after 33-year-old Gilles Simon also returned to form to beat Kevin Anderson and win the title in Pune.

Moragahakanda project, Rajagiriya flyover commissioned today
The Moragahakanda Kalu Ganga multi-purpose development project and the Rajagiriya flyover project, are to be commissioned today to mark the three-year anniversary of the unity government since President Maithripala Sirisena won the 2015 Presidential Election.
In addition to the the vast changes that the unity government brought about since President Maithripala Sirisena's victory, including democratic independence, fairness, and a fear and suspicion-free environment, these projects would be commissioned today, while the Ganemulla and Polgahawela flyover projects would be commissioned on January 11 and January 17, respectively.
The national ceremony organised today to mark the commissioning of the Moragahakanda reservoir, which is four times bigger than the Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa, would be attended by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the chief guests. The President would release water from the reservoir at the auspicious time of 11.20 am.
With the commissioning of this project, an increase of 64,000,000 cubic metres of water would flow from the reservoir to far-flung regions, including Vanni, Matale, Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, and Polonnaruwa, to support agricultural needs in an area of at least 81,422 hectares. This would increase rice production by 81 percent (109,000 tonnes), amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of US$ 1.67 million, annually. In addition to the irrigation of land, water from the same reservoir would be used to power the 25-Megawatt Moragahakanda hydroelectric power station.
The Rajagiriya flyover, which opens today, would increase the driving speed along Parliament Road from 2 kmph to 16 kmph, bringing a long-term solution for the heavy traffic congestion in the area.
The flyover, comprising of four lanes, is 533 metres in length and 21.4 metres in width. Several roads leading to Rajagiriya would also be developed as a part of the project, while an alternative road towards Narahenpita would also be developed in due course.
The road towards Buthgamuwa is in the agenda to be developed with three lanes. The 504-metre long Ganemulla flyover, which was constructed at cost Rs 1.768 million, would resolve the longstanding traffic congestion in the town, which is caused by the closure of the rail gates as frequently as 90 times per day. Around 87 trains travelling to and from Colombo, Badulla, Kandy, Jaffna, Trincomolee, Mannar, and Batticaloa, pass the Ganemulla railway station, resulting in the excessive closure of the of its rail gates.
The 883 metre-long Polgahawela flyover, which is built at a cost Rs. 2.203 million, would be opened on January 17.
It would greatly benefit the Polgahawela - Kegalle (A 19) road users.
The town is the entry point to a number of cities, including Kegalle, Rambukkana, and Narammala. It comprises a two-lane carriageway and two pedestrian ways on either side.

Play abandoned in SA v India Test
Cape Town: Rain prevented any play on the third day of the first Test between South Africa and India at Newlands on Sunday, but with fine weather expected for the remaining two days there is still a good chance of a result.
South Africa were on 65 for two in their second innings an overall lead of 142 at the close of play on Saturday.
With a potential 98 overs on both Monday and Tuesday, the bowlers of both sides will be hoping for more success on a pitch which has helped the fast bowlers.
South Africa will be without fast bowler Dale Steyn, who suffered a left heel injury on Saturday. He was consulting a specialist on Sunday and was not at the ground but initial estimates were that he would be out of action for between four and six weeks.
Unseasonal rain fell for much of the day across drought-stricken Cape Town. There was a brief break in the weather at lunch-time when the ground staff started to remove the covers, only for rain to return. AFP

Rajagiriya flyover opens today
Rajagiriya flyover which is considered as the longest flyover in Sri Lanka will be vested to the people by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the request of Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Lakshman Kiriella today.
The Rajagiriya flyover will definitely help ease traffic congestion at Sri Jayewardenapura Mawatha, Borella, Battaramulla and Rajagiriya by reducing the traffic between the main flows at Rajagiriya junction.
Traffic congestion has a number of negative effects such as wasting time of motorists and passengers. As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health, causes delays which may result in late arrival of employees for work or meetings and students at their educational institutions, resulting in lost business and other personal losses. The length of the flyover is 533 meters while its width is 21. 4 meters. This will be a four lane flyover along Parliament road, constructed at a cost of Rs 4.6 billion, funded by the Spanish government with expertise fully overseen by the Road Development Authority (RDA).
Sri Lanka needs more flyovers and expressways as the volume of traffic increases daily with increased vehicle imports.

Ranil wants Parliament to debate Bond report
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday called for the summoning of Parliament two-weeks ahead of schedule to debate the Bond Commission report which has called for a forensic audit of the Central Bank.
Addressing the 71st Convention of his United National Party, Premier Wickremesinghe said he had already asked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to examine the reconvening of the Legislature without waiting for its first scheduled session for 2018 later this month.
The Prime Minister said the government was keen to go ahead with a debate, which would be the third on the bond issue which had been examined by a Parliamentary Committee as well as a Presidential Commission.
UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe greeting the large crowd present at the United National Partys 71st General Convention held at Campbell Park in Borella yesterday. The Prime Minister is flanked by Senior Party officials, Deputy UNP Leader and Minister Sajith Premadasa, UNP General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim and UNP Chairman and Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
He said Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena had asked him if the Presidential Commission report could be discussed in Parliament and he had readily agreed.
Dinesh Gunawardena asked if we could debate the Bond Commission report to which I have said we should. Ive requested the Speaker to hold a debate soon, Wickremesinghe said amid loud applause at Campbell Park on Sunday.
This is the third time we will be holding a debate on the same issue. We have nothing to hide.
He said the Presidential Commission has recommended a probe into transactions since 2008.
A sum of Rs.4,000 billion has been defrauded without the approval of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, while Mahinda Rajapaksa made away with billions that could not be reimbursed.
The Prime Minister had asked Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to secure important confidential documents, while Minister Kabir Hashim has been instructed to ensure that the paper trail at the National Savings Bank and the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka was kept securely.
The Presidential Commission which submitted its report to President Maithripala Sirisena last month noted that possibly the biggest fraud was perpetrated on the Employees Provident Fund administered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka between 2008 and 2014 during the tenure of President Rajapaksa.
I didnt mince my words, these are the recommendations of the Commission, he said. There are 19 court cases, 40 Police probes and 24 other matters relating to the Presidential Elections (of 2015) to which we have set up special units. We will bring these culprits to book, there is no question about it.
There had been wide spread allegations that the former regime used State funds for Rajapaksas failed re-election bid three years ago today.
The Premier reiterated the UNPs mandate to work at the grassroots level. He said the UNP-led coalition government had achieved many feats, including the re-payment of a trillion dollar debt despite the economy being in dire straits.
He called on the general public who were gathered in large numbers on Sunday to exercise their franchise for a party that has salvaged the country.
I urge you to vote for women, empower them to lead you. It is the UNP that called for a greater participation of women and it is apparent by the turnout today, he said.
He made a reference to Rosy Senanayake who is the Colombo Mayoral candidate. She could be the first female Mayor of Colombo.
The Premier said they had clearly laid out its plans and initiated many projects which will uplift the rural economy. We have allocated funds and initiated projects, we are looking at a future without unemployment and corruption, and it is here that the party needs your support. Uplift the rural economy to develop the country.
The UNP was founded on September 6, 1946 under the leadership of D.S. Senanayake, who became the countrys first Prime Minister. During the past 70 years, the party has represented the Government and the Opposition.

Ravi seeks bond report under RTI

Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake today filed an RTI application at the Presidential Secretariat to get a copy of the report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Bond issue.
The former Minister, speaking to the media outside the Secretariat, insisted on fast-paced investigations on the MIG craft deal, hedging deal, Greek bond issue and loss of Sri Lankan Airlines. He said some were trying to bring disrepute to him, the UNP, and the party leadership using the bond issue.
The UNP is targeted in an unfair manner during an election period. I have been engaged in politics for 25 long years. We do politics with the people and our hands are clean. You may assassinate me, but please do not assassinate my character, Karunanayake said refuting the allegations made against him on the bond issue as well as giving false evidence.
He also reiterated that the Central Bank and Commercial Banks were not under him at the time the controversial bond transaction occurred.
It is our Government that made the Right to Information Act a reality and pioneered a new political culture. I have sought a copy of the report under the RTI Act as some elements and the media have leveled allegations against me quoting the bond commission report. I will aptly reply after reading the report, he added.
The Bond Commission report was handed over to the President on December 30.

Shocking! Indian team not allowed to take a bath in SA
CAPE TOWN: In South Africa, there was not enough water on the pitch. These conditions were made due to drought. The water problem in the ground and around it can be estimated from the fact that the spectators sitting in the stadium were seen taking cold drinks instead of water despite the heavy heat.
Earlier, when the pitch was made, the field workers had to face water crisis and to prepare the pitch for the ground staff, only 87 liters of water was allowed to be consumed in one day. For this reason, the grass was not left on the pitch and it was believed that pitch can now help the spinners.
Now the news is that due to this the players have been banned from taking bath. The first Test match in Cape Town between South Africa and India was played on Friday. But due to the heat the water problem has arisen and players have been given only two minutes to take bath so that water can be saved.
South Africa's Cape Town city is surrounded by sea on both sides, but due to lack of rain there is a shortage of drinking water in the entire city. The administration has also made provision for action against those who have consumed excess water to deal with the problem.
The administration has set a two-minute time for the Indian players as well as the South African players to take a bath, so that the excess water cannot be consumed. Players need to take bath after exercising and after the match is over.

Stick to handy solutions for year-end resolutions
The New Year is all about new beginnings, a fresh start, the chance to hit the reset button after a season of eating, drinking, and being merry. Ahem, and then eating some more. So its not surprising that come January, many of us feel the need to set some pretty lofty goals. The thing is, only a tiny number of resolution-makers actually achieve them.
It can be daunting when your list of New Years resolutions is as long as your holiday shopping list. In addition to the post-holiday slump, not being able to keep your resolutions by February, March or even late January may increase your anxiety. When your holiday decorations are packed up and stored away, the frustration of what you failed to do or other reminders of failed resolutions can make the later months a period of seeming hopelessness.
However, it is important to remember that the New Year isnt meant to serve as a catalyst for sweeping character changes. It is a time for people to reflect on their past years behaviour and promise to make positive lifestyle changes. Its very easy to make New Years resolutions in the heat of enthusiasm and glowing joy but most of us are more familiar with the difficulty of sticking to them. It is possible but it does take quite some focus, planning, and a determination to stick with the resolutions for the same amount of time it takes to change a habit, so that the resolutions also turn into new habits.
Actually, setting small, attainable goals throughout the year, instead of a singular, overwhelming goal on January 1 can help you reach whatever it is you are striving for. That is because it is not the extent of the change that matters, but rather the act of recognising that lifestyle change is important and working toward it, is best taken one step at a time.
By making your resolutions realistic, there is a greater chance that you will keep them throughout the year, incorporating healthy behaviour into your everyday life. People change with time, so do their aspirations.
Making resolutions is a purification rite of self appraisal and penitence that demands personal honesty and ultimately, reinforces humility. Breaking them is part of the cycle. But in the estimation of the less sardonic souls among us the New Year is a great era for everyone. It is the start of a new beginning. It can also be the start of a new life if the right resolutions are made and kept.
However, it is also a pretty funny time of year in a way. People often make resolutions they dont keep and do some pretty silly things at midnight. Some take it seriously. Some bid it farewell just after the clock strikes twelve. Some call it a second chance to dream with eyes open. Seriously taken, New Year resolutions are an opportunity to measure our goals. For the adventurous soul, it is the opportunity to tickle a funny bone or to try something bold.
It is also a time to look where you stand. For those who have made all kinds of declarations last New Years Eve should take time to reflect how far they have stood by them. If not, it is time you did! The most practical thing to do is to get down to accomplishing the incomplete decisions. If you still feel that the resolutions you made last year and abandoned mid-way are worth a second shot, give them another chance!
And be sure they are realistic resolutions. Instead of weaving dreams in the air make a decision that would have significance that adds meaning to your life. Resolve this year to monitor how far you are holding on to your commitment, it will help you to hang on.
Many people resolve to quit an addiction. If it does you no good, why stick to it If needed, seek help of support groups or professionals. If you have the will, you shall find the way. For many of us it would be a sagacious move to go back to school, so to say. Learning has no age limit.
Pick up where you left off. Fit in a fitness programme that ensures a future with fewer trips to the doctor. Select an exercise regime you can stick to. A group activity may add the element of fun to the routine. Lose some flab. But dont set any strict targets or attempt to over extend a schedule. Chances are that over enthusiasm may make the going too tough and de-motivate you to quit.
Soaking up new skills, learning something new and interesting is always fun and a value addition too. Try to stop pigging out. Eating to live and not living to eat should be the aim. Yet dont deny yourself the occasional indulgence.
Endeavour to lose the loan that keeps niggling at your mind and causing stress. Pay off any debt you may have and feel light at heart. One element that can make you feel better and help you sleep better at night is to contribute to a charitable cause. Giving back to the society is the least we can do to make the world a better place to live in.
Learn to liven up your lifestyle. Certainly, paying attention to your professional growth is fine, but your personal life requires attention too. Strike a balance. Try to be organised in everything you do and pay attention to the smallest detail. That is the key to make life easier, manage time and live stress free. Make a proper to-do list, and you will be half way there already.
Unhealthy habits develop over the course of time. As such, replacing such behaviour with better ones requires time. Dont get overwhelmed and think that you have to reassess everything in your life. Instead, work toward changing one thing at a time.
Dont strive to be a perfectionist. Perfection is unattainable in any human endeavour. Remember that minor missteps when reaching your goals are completely normal and acceptable. Dont give up completely or feel guilty if you indulged in a sinful pudding or dessert and broke your diet or skipped your exercise regime because you were busy. We all have our ups and downs. Simply resolve to recover from your lapses and get back on track.
But there are many out there who start getting real about resolutions. Instead of setting their sights on one meteoric milestone, they begin shifting their focus to the smaller things that can add up to make a major, lasting impact on overall health and happiness.

Successful notes
She spreads the magic of the piano among music enthusiasts. Sri Lankan born international concert composer-pianist, record producer, improviser, musicologist and linguist Dr Tanya Ekanayaka is known to bring diverse classical works, cultures and genres of music together in her work.
A recording artiste, composer and producer for Naxos Records, the worlds second largest music classical record label, Tanya was lured to music at a tender age. Growing up in a home that was heavily inclined towards western classical music she was introduced to the piano by her mother, Indira Ekanayaka, when she was five years old. Her debut public recital appearance was when she was 12 years and she performed her first concerto (Mozarts Piano Concerto K.488) at 16 with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka as the joint winner and the youngest competitor of the SOSL biennial concerto competition.
My love for the piano grew over the years as I came to spend many hours with the instrument on a daily basis. I can still recall how as a child I would run my tiny hands which were yet incapable of controlling the keyboard over the entire keyboard imagining I could play incredibly challenging and beautiful music effortlessly, Tanya recalled.
She continued to engage in piano practices in a private studio during her postgraduate years at the University of Edinburgh. Another member of the music department recognized her potentials and set her on her career in piano performance. After performing at St. Martin-in-the-Fields in 2010, Tanya has performed in some of the worlds most prestigious stages in the US, UK, Europe and Asia. Speaking about what drew her to the field of musicology Tanya says, I think it was something of a natural progression from an early age leading to my doctoral research and underlying the musical styles which I have developed through my own compositions. Suffice to say that I have always been interested in exploring the relationship between musical structures and their respective socio-cultural, political and historical contexts through which they evolve and in which they are straddled.
She notes that music has been in her blood for as long as she can remember. It is more of a first love in a sense.
However, it was never the case that I consciously aspired to build a career in music as a young teenager. I was passionate about music and was performing publicly by the age of 12. During my life in Sri Lanka the country suffered from terrorism until I turned 29 and looking back I realize that evolving music was how I sought hope in an atmosphere of hopelessness and loss resultant of the awful violence in which Sri Lanka was engulfed. Yet a career in music seemed but a distant dream best left as a dream, as it were. My mother encouraged me to develop an academic career while developing my musical skills alongside it. This was how I ended up also specializing in theoretical and socio-linguistics. Strange as it may seem, the kind of thinking I developed through the process of my training in Linguistics has played a pivotal role in the evolution of my compositional style conceptually, she mused.
She notes that whatever success she has had internationally might owe to her sense of creative purpose which involves creating music which she believes in and enjoys. This in turn, she hopes, will be a source of enjoyment to others.
Similarly, whatever unique qualities my music may purportedly possess pivot on the fact that I am uninfluenced by musical trends which do not inspire me from a creative perspective, Tanya explained. Tanya has the first album of compositions done entirely by a Sri Lankan composer to ever be launched by a major record label to her name. Her maiden album Reinventions: Rhapsodies for Piano was represented by Naxos Records (Grand Piano) since 2014. She says that she has faced many hurdles in her life, each which is equally challenging in its own way. According to her opinion inspiration and an intuitive sensibility are necessary attributes to becoming a good composer in addition to possessing a sensitive perfectionist temperament and solid grounding in core skills.
Music composition across many genres globally has always tended to be a male dominated field. As for myself, I would say that my identity as a woman resides at the heart of my music as perhaps reflected in the fact that my music contains autobiographical narratives in musical language arguably analogous to mirrors of my life led as a woman, she said.
Give yourself space to grow, be courageous, humble and passionate while doing all that you can, with integrity, to ensure that you cultivate a discerning mind together with essential skills to become an expert in your chosen field, is her advice to young women who wish to follow a profession in the field of music as composers/ instrumentalists.
Tanyas second solo album of her own works for solo piano performed and produced by her and recorded by a gifted recording engineer at The University of Edinburgh is expected to be released worldwide by Naxos Records in the ensuing months. The album evolved between 2016 and 2017 and presents two concepts, one being an extension of a previous concept she introduced in her debut album. Her second album contains entirely new compostitions.

They Tried to Ban Fahrenheit 451 and Replace It With. . . My Book
As a writer and an avid reader, few things trouble me more than efforts to ban literature.
Year after year, some of Americas greatest authors seem to be catnip for the censorious. Mark Twain. Toni Morrison. Jack London. John Steinbeck. Ray Bradbury. I feel all of these, but right now, banning Ray Bradbury is what hits me hardest.
I grew up reading Bradbury, and hes one of the reasons I both love and write science fiction. As a boy, I must have read R is for Rocket a dozen times, curling up with the book on a sleepy Sunday afternoon. His short story Sound of Thunder is a work of lingering genius. Given the way 2017 has gone, Im not sure some panicky time-traveling hunter didnt trample a butterfly somewhere in our past.
And Fahrenheit 451 I read that book in seventh grade, checking it out of the library on my own because it was Bradbury, absorbing his vision of a world gone sour. That was in 1981.
Article continues after advertisement
Now In 2018 Its increasingly, terrifyingly prophetic. Bradburys imagined dystopia revolves around the story of Guy Montag, a fireman. In a deliciously perverse twist, his job is to find and burn print books, as well as the homes. . . and the persons. . . of their readers. Reading is viewed as inherently subversive. Reading is upsetting, making people think upsetting thoughts, which are to be avoided at all costs. It is disruptive of the order in what has become a trivialized, post-literate, manipulative culture.
Back in 1953, Bradbury imaged an impossibly horrific future world where humanity has become obsessed with ever larger screens, which are constantly on in homes defined by omnipresent media. That media, as Montags wife Mildred experiences it, is populated by braying, buffoonish characters who act as surrogates for actual human relationships.
Bradbury imagined a world where corporate-authoritarian politics maintain the shallow mask of democracy as a gullible populace is spoonfed candidates. He visualized insurgents and criminals being hunted and killed by the hound, an unstoppable drone. He cast a vision of callow selfish brutalism as an endless war burns, far away from a populace willingly subjugated by distractions and banality.
Information, in the society of Fahrenheit 451, is an endless cavalcade of trivia, tightened and shortened until every mind is filled with a blinding, churning nothing. At a key point in the narrative, Montags boss Beatty visits him, and in a monologue gives the reader a vision of the way information was presented in this strange and nightmarish future:
speed up your camera. Books cut shorter. Condensations, digests. Tabloids. Everything boils down to the gag, the snap ending [] classics cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten- or twelve-line dictionary resume. [.] Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click Pic, Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes! Whirl mans mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers, exploiters, broadcasters, that the centrifuge flings off all unnecessary, time-wasting thought!
Bradbury may not have actually used the word Twitter, but this 1953 description of the low-attention-span future cuts rather too close to home.
Fahrenheit 451 has never been more relevant. And as Beatty knew, relevant critiques are dangerous. Unsettling. Unsafe.
So it was no surprise when from Santa Rosa County in the panhandle of Florida this past month there came familiar news. A parent, discovering their child was reading something they found problematic, approached a school board and asked that Fahrenheit 451 be removed from the curriculum.
Filth, that parent called Bradburys work, as she pressed for it to be removed from an eighth grade reading list. The concerned mom leading the banning effort didnt see its prophetic relevance. All she saw was a vulgarity, the word bastard, which she felt was inappropriate for her 13-year-old daughter. Im just trying to keep my little girl a little girl, she said.
This kind of book-banning effort isnt unusual, but this one was a gut punch. Why Because the parent organizing the banning effort suggested that Bradburys work should be replaced with something more acceptable to her.
Among her suggestions for more suitable material: my own dystopian novel, When the English Fall.
I cannot imagine receiving a more troubling and heartbreaking endorsement.
Sure, my Amish protagonist and narrator doesnt use vulgarity in the face of the worlds collapse. Because hes Amish. Old Order Mennonites dont tend to swear like sailors. But my story contains its fair share of death and murder and human horror, at least as graphic as anything youll find in Bradbury.
The mother bringing the complaint was concerned at the violence in the book, and worried that the book wasnt safe, and suggested that kids might read about murder and violence and become murderous and violent themselves. As a pastor, I preach the Bible every Sunday, and teach it in classes.
My gracious, I cant imagine a less safe book than the Bible. Try reading Genesis sometime. Thats a rough, rough book. My Adult Ed class has been discovering this last month as weve been reading it together. Murder Rape Betrayal Incest Ray Bradburys got nothing on the Word of God.
Or the news. Lord have mercy.

Three more large hospitals will be built in Sri Lanka assisted by Russia, and the United Kingdom. One hospital will be built at Panadura at a cost of Rs. 21,000 million, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Another will be constructed at Kirimandala Mawatha, Narahenpita and the other in the Colombo city limit.
The Minister was addressing the gathering during his recent visit to the Kotelawala Defence University, Ratmalana.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that 45,000 nurses are required and 14,000 will be recruited soon.
"A nursing faculty will be established at Sri Jayewardenepura and Sri Lankan health officers will be trained in Singapore.
More medical faculties should be established in Sri Lanka," he said.
"Foreign medical students do not go to Bangladesh, Nepal and other countries but they come here since we provide better facilities," he said.
"Former President J. R. Jayewardene introduced the open economy amidst objections. Today all are talking about the open economy, he said. "We should thank the former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa for establishing the institution by making a prompt decision.
Such persons should be in the country to introduce new policies," the Minister said.
Officials of the university and Health Ministry were preset.

Three years in the hot seat
Today marks the third anniversary of the election of President Maithripala Sirisena as Head of State. President Sirisena spearheaded a campaign to establish good governance in the country following virtual family rule that was not accountable to the public, and to dislodge a government mired in unprecedented corruption, gross violation of human rights and general maladministration. The President who presented himself as the Common Candidate pledged to cleanse the body politic of the serious malaise that had infested it and restore a clean and transparent administration. In this endeavour he received the fullest backing of a wide range of civil society organisations, artistes, professionals, intellectuals and all those clamouring for good governance led by the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and his National Movement for Social Justice. The President lost no time in living up to the ideals espoused by the Ven Sobitha and his followers, upon being elected. He divested himself of much of the Presidential powers that was abused by his predecessors and transferred these powers to parliament. Independent Commissions were set up to ensure justice and fair treatment to public servants.
For the first time in the countrys post Independence history, a Unity Government comprising arch rivals, the UNP and SLFP, was formed with the intention of working for the common good of the public and achieving the long term goals of the nation.
Of course, it hasnt been all smooth sailing. Much needs to be achieved yet in terms of the pledges made. There certainly has been tardiness in the implementation of the main pledge of bringing to book those involved in massive corruption under the former regime. The President also had to contend with other issues that had unexpectedly cropped up that has tended to diminish his good governance project, somewhat.
But there are plenty of positives that the President could certainly be happy about, going into the fourth year of his Presidency, the most significant being the climate of peace he has ushered in and the elimination of the once all pervasive fear psychosis. This change is seen virtually in all sectors and spheres of activity. There is today complete independence of the judiciary and the Attorney Generals Department has been totally freed from government interference. Sri Lanka, which was virtually in the dog house, internationally, has today won back the goodwill of foreign nations in good measure. World leaders and dignitaries who gave this country a wide berth in the not too distant past today visit us on a regular basis. For the first time in nearly four decades, a US Foreign Secretary paid an official visit to Sri Lanka, shortly after the election of President Sirisena. The GSP Plus facility which was withdrawn by the EU due to human rights violations was restored, giving our exports to EU countries, particularly garments, a tremendous boost.
On the ethnic front, the President has endeavoured to remove all irritants that stand in the way of reconciliation between the two major communities. The government is gradually handing over civilian land occupied by the army to their original owners and the process has gathered pace recently, with more and more lands being released. He makes frequent visits to the North and continues to interact with the northern population who overwhelmingly voted for him on January 8. A constitutional process aimed at meaningful power devolution has been embarked upon with the participation of all stakeholders. Violence directed at religious minorities which was a frequent occurrence in the past has been contained, with the President maintaining cordial relations with all religious heads.
Going into his fourth year, no doubt, there are mounting challenges the President will have to confront, both, political and on the socio-economic front. There is also the dissidents of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who are waiting their opportunity to trip him over. The outcome of the Local Government elections in this respect may prove crucial and force the hand of the President to act decisively. The challenge to his Presidency, interestingly enough, comes not so much from the UNP, as one would expect, as by the faction led by his predecessor.
President Sirisena will also have to make a decision on the MOU his party has signed with the UNP, very early into the fourth year of his Presidency. The matter has been held back pending conclusion of the LG elections. He no doubt will have a difficult choice to make in this regard, with the SLFP falling far short of the numbers to form a government of its own. He certainly is placed in an unenviable situation. On the one hand, as the leader of the SLFP, he has to work in the interest of his party. On the other hand, he is left with little alternative but continue with the present arrangement in the name of stability. Whatever it is, the Sri Lankan public will be in for interesting times as the political denouement unravels in the new year.

THREE YEARS IN RETROSPECT
Three years in power is sufficient time for a government to convincingly demonstrate that it has justified the trust the electors in the country have placed in it.
Let us go by the yardstick that the ordinary people would use for assessing the performance of the government they have elected. They would consider whether the government has made a genuine effort to improve their lot and also whether it has fulfilled the pledges its leaders made when they sought the peoples mandate or how far they have succeeded in honouring the pledges.
Ven. Maduluvave Sobitha thera
It is already part of history that it was a vibrant popular movement calling for an administration committed to upholding social justice and the basics of democratic governance, not the run-of-the-mill issues like the high cost of living, nor the esoteric issues such safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and its image in the eyes of the international community that paved the way for a regime change in this country in 2014 and 2015.
The movement for social justice and democratic governance was the upshot of a desperate cry out for a political change by a large section of the populace who had grown sick of the despotic regime in power at the time which was steeped in corruption, nepotism and gross abuse of power.
It was a time of anarchy and a de facto rule of a despotic monarchy. It was the era of whitevans; individuals disliked by some elements in the seats of power were abducted and were made to disappear leaving no trace. There were several media personnel among such victims. Some media men who were abducted escaped death, but were maimed for life. Death stared in the face of everyone who was considered anti-government. The judiciary was openly undermined. A Chief Justice was sent home following a Kangaroo court trial. And later she was subjected to ridicule and numerous indignities. It was a well-known secret even the Ministers feared to utter a word against the highest political authority.
It was quite obvious to all that there was no law and order in the country and they were living under a virtual dictatorship. Corruption was rampant from top to bottom. It is in this context that the enlightened public led by a section of the countrys intelligentsia, threw in their lot with the Movement for Social Justice and Good Governance led by the Naga Viharadhipati the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Nayaka Thera.
There is a general belief among the people that Sri Lanka is a blessed nation and no evil power can last long. True to this belief, a series of events that played out later turned out to be blessings in disguise for the people in the country.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa decided to go in for a midterm Presidential poll. Of course, by then he had prepared the legal ground to seek office for a third term. Then the question of finding an opposition candidate to challenge President Rajapaksa who appeared invincible at the time arose. It was at this critical moment of the countrys history by a strange auspicious turn of its destiny, a Minister of the same government with a clean record of public service and a popular image because of his simple and unassuming ways emerged as the common opposition candidate while the rest is history.
Now let us assess the performance of the National Unity government which came into power on the platform of a democratic governance, going by the yardstick the common man would use.
Civil society activists including the Puravesi Balaya played an active role in bringing about change of governance in January 8, 2015.
Has the government made a genuine effort to improve the lot of the common man Has the common man got a square deal from this government It is a fact that government has taken a series of measures to lessen the cost of living burden of the people. In fact, shortly after assuming office, the government took the country by surprise by reducing the price of a number of essential consumer items including fuel. We have to take into consideration that the government took the trouble to provide a measure of relief to the ordinary people despite the daunting foreign debt-servicing commitment.
The law and order situation has now come back to normal. People in all walks of life can go about their workaday business sans the fear psychology that plagued them in the recent dark era. The White Van culture is now a thing of the past!
As regards, the pledge made to bring about a new political culture and an era of democratic governance, the government took immediate steps to reduce certain powers of the Executive Presidency which could pose a threat to democratic governance. In fact, President Sirisena himself took pains to ensure the passage of the relevant Constitutional Amendment!
Constitutional Council and the Independent Commissions abolished under the 18th Amendment by the previous regime were also restored under this Constitutional Amendment.
The Right to Information Act was passed to ensure the transparency of the administration.
The media freedom which suffered a heavy toll in the past is now available in full measure. Opposition politicians featuring on State TV programmes and criticizing the government is a common sight nowadays.
The National Unity government strengthened the CIOBAC and set up several investigative agencies like the Presidential Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption and the FCID in a bid to bring to book the politicians and the politically associated persons involved in financial crimes. It is obvious that the government is determined to eliminate the corrupt elements within it as well. The Presidential Commission appointed to investigate the Treasury Bond fiasco stands testimony to this fact.
It is true that the government has yet to go a long way in its efforts to raise the quality of the people, upholding social justice and democratic governance in general and eradicating the scourge of corruption from public life for good in particular. None would or could say that the country has an ideal government in power. Of course, there are many shortcomings and acts of commission and omission too which are not uncommon.
In this context, we have to understand that we have got a type of coalition government unprecedented in the countrys political history. Two main rival political parties have come together to raise the country from the morass it has fallen into due to decades of narrow sectarian politics and a host of other reasons. It is obvious that people are looking forward to the success of this new experiment in governance.

Tourist arrivals reach all-time high in 2017
Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka reached an all-time high of 2,116,407 in 2017 according to the latest data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
The arrival figure for 2017 represents a 3.2 growth or 65,595 more arrivals over the preceding year when the figure crossed the 2 million mark for the first time.
The higher number of arrivals has been achieved despite serious set-backs to the tourism industry right throughout 2017. The first setback was the partial closure of the countrys main airport from January to April where many airlines either scaled down operation or completely halted flights to Colombo.
However just weeks after the airport reopened in April, the southern half of the country experienced devastating floods that cut off access to many resort areas resulting in adverse international media publicity that had an impact on forward bookings.
This was followed by an unprecedented dengue epidemic centered around the commercial capital Colombo that lasted several months which too resulted in negative reports on international media resulting in at least one country issuing a travel advisory based on the issue.
Further flooding and a severe drought in the central and northern parts of the country in the latter part of the year added to the climatic woes suffered by the tourism industry during the year which according to industry sources impacted forward bookings.
According to SLTDA data, arrivals in December grew from 224,791 in 2016 to 244,536 in 2017 reflecting an 8.8 growth rate which augurs well for the winter season ahead.
India continued to be the top source market with 384,628 arrivals (up 7.8%) followed by China with 268,952 (down 1%) and UK 201,879 (up 7.3%). Of the total number of arrivals 2,085,272 reached the country via BIA in Katunayake, 5,491 via MRIA in Mattala, 10,569, via Colombo Harbour, 14,099 via Galle Harbour and 976 via other ports according to statistics from the Department of Immigration and Emigration.

Trump: I am a very stable genius
US: US President Donald Trump on Saturday praised himself as a very stable genius, following the release of a bombshell book that raises doubts over his mental health.
But Trumps response to the books allegations, in tweets and in remarks made during a hastily convened news conference at his Camp David presidential retreat, had Washington focusing anew on the question of his stability and mental state. In a series of extraordinary early-morning tweets, Trump said that throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.
I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....and a very stable genius at that!
The new supposed tell-all book -- Michael Wolffs Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House -- was rushed into stores Friday after the Trump administration failed to suppress it.
The book quickly sold out in Washington, where it has been the talk of the town, and rocketed to the top of Amazons bestsellers list. At Camp David, where Trump was meeting with top Republican lawmakers and cabinet members to set an agenda for the coming year, he seemed eager to focus attention on legislative priorities including immigration reform, a budget plan and infrastructure spending.
But he also forcefully pushed back against Wolffs claim to having spent hours interviewing Trump. I did a quick interview with this guy a long time ago, having to do with an article, but I dont know this man, Trump said. The idea of a long White House interview was in his imagination.
Trump said the book was a disgrace and suggested the United States needs stronger libel laws.
The President earlier decried the work as full of lies, while the White House issued a scorched-earth dismissal of both the author and his sources. In tweets Friday, Trump called Wolff a total loser. Trumps stability has been questioned by critics almost since he declared his candidacy for the presidency. They cite remarks and tweets they say show him as impulsive, petulant and erratic.
On Friday, Washingtons chief diplomat Rex Tillerson was obliged to defend Trump after being asked during an interview about claims that the President has a short attention span, regularly repeats himself and refuses to read briefing notes.
Ive never questioned his mental fitness, said Tillerson, whose office was last year forced to deny reports that he had referred to Trump as a moron after a national security meeting.
Even in defending Trump, the former ExxonMobil chief executive told CNN he has had to learn how to effectively relay information to the president. The book claims that for Treasury Secretary
Trumps tweet spawned hundreds of mocking comments on social media. Joe Walsh, a former Republican Congressman, tweeted: If you have to tell people youre a stable genius, then youre not a stable genius.
Publication of Wolffs book came as news emerged that at least a dozen members of the US Congress were briefed last month by Yale University professor of psychiatry Bandy Lee on Trumps mental health.
Last November, Lee wrote to The New York Times that she and other concerned mental health professionals were detecting more than his usual state of instability, with characteristics (that) place our country and the world at extreme risk of danger.- AFP

Turkish delights from Ankara
Ankara of Heritage Property, will take you through a culinary expedition authentic to Turkey. Chef Mehmet Orgutis sure to thrill you with his culinary skills this season, as he prepares to dish out traditional desserts exclusively for the holiday season.
Turkish Delights are traditional Turkish sweets that date back 600 years, to the time of the Persian Empire, one of the most important civilizations of world, having ruled between 226 AD and 652 AD During the Ottoman period. These desserts were served only to royalty and nobility. The sweets further became popular in the Ottoman Empire from the 17th century. At the same time, an English traveler took the first Turkish Delight to England.
The Turkish Delight was initially prepared using a combination of a honey and flour mixture in its early days, and with time, its quality improved and flavours were enhanced, that made it even moredelicious, when refined sugar and starch were added, when found and brought to Turkey in the 17th century. The recipe includes various choices such as pistachios, walnuts and hazelnuts while natural flavours such as rose, lemon, orange, and mint are finally added for this mouthwatering dessert.
Baklava on the other hand is a rich, sweet / dessert that is a combination, set in layers using filo sheets, sprinkled in-between with chopped nuts that is finally sweetened and held together with syrup or honey. Although the history of baklava is not well documented, its current form was probably developed in the imperial kitchens of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul and is now a popular sweet sensation across the region.
These amazing desserts are imported exclusively for Ankara from CerezPazan, a confectionary company established in 2009 in Istanbul. Over 300 luxury hotels and restaurants in Turkey, United Arab Emirates / Dubai and USA are supplied with fresh and high quality nuts, dried fruits, Turkish delights and spices besides exporting to countries around the world.

Unity Government has achieved much - PM
When President Maithripala Sirisena and I embarked on the campaign for Yahapalanaya on November 21, 2014, we were responding to a nationwide outcry to lift Sri Lanka out of the shackles of nepotism, and into the spotlight as a proud and independent member of the community of nations, states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a statement to mark the third year of the Unity Government.
The Prime Ministers statement adds: Our promise to the people was that should they elect us to right the course of our country on January 8, 2015, we would rescue the economy, put an end to state-sponsored extra-judicial violence, and restore the independence and respectability of our law enforcement and criminal justice systems. While our journey together has much more to accomplish, I am proud today to reflect on how many hurdles have been overcome so far.
In the three short years that we have been at the helm of the state, the Unity Government has implemented the 17th Amendment to the Constitution and given life to the Constitutional Council and Independent Commissions that allow the police, judiciary and public service at large to act according to their conscience and not the whims of their political masters of the day. We have passed legislation enshrining the right to information to all citizens, and the right to assistance and protection for those of our citizens who are victims of crime or witnesses before the law.
We have empowered the police, for the first time in the countrys history, to investigate and bring charges for complex financial crimes against the state.
The unity government has been at the forefront of these steps, making it a priority to take powers and privileges that were for so long hoarded by the executive branch, and indeed by a single family, and restore those powers to the independent arbiters of the people, where they rightfully belong in a transparent, secular liberal democracy.
Despite all we have accomplished, there is much left to be done to bring justice for the sins of the past and heal this country from the culture of brutality that prevailed for nearly a decade.
Ours was a fight against unchecked corruption, against the re-engineering of the entire public service to serve the whims of a single family, and against the deadly white vans and death squads that aimed to cow the media into acquiescence.
One of the most heroic victims of this culture of brutality, Lasantha Wickrematunge, wrote in his last ever editorial of how it was the family of President Mahinda Rajapaksa that operated what he called the machinery of the state. His editorial, written in anticipation of his own murder, could not have been clearer: Now, it is clear to all who will see that that machinery has operated so well that my sons and daughter do not themselves have a father.
Today, three years from the inception of the Unity Government, also marks nine years from the date that Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed. We vowed then, that his killers would face justice, as would the perpetrators of so many acts of violence perpetrated against media personnel in the dark days of the former regime. The government remains committed to this goal, which is an essential step in allowing the country to permanently rise out from under the threat of lawless rule by the sword.
I thank the people for placing their faith in us and in President Sirisena as they cast their votes on
January 8, 2015, and assure them that both the President and I remain committed to the ideals and vision that united us three years ago. Today, let us unite not only in reflection of all we have accomplished together, but in appreciation of all that is left for us to do.

The United National Party in its 71st Convention sounded a warning to all its candidates citing that law breakers and the corrupt will be severely dealt with.
With position comes power and responsibility. As a member of the UNP and a contestant for the forthcoming polls, we urge you to use it wisely, Minister Kabir Hashim told the convention gathering at Campbell Park yesterday.
Education Minister, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam reiterated the governments commitment to further education in the country based on a new education sector plan. We have spearheaded a new insurance scheme where every child is covered for life, he said. Weve begun the process of digitalisation and will ensure that every student stays in school for 14 years.
Sri Lankas first female mayoral candidate for Colombo, Rosy Senanayake commended the efforts of the UNP for calling for a greater participation of women at the upcoming LG polls.
The issue of garbage disposal and the dengue menace are two issues she highlighted as being of paramount importance. I request you to join me in ensure we come together to make Colombo, a beautiful and clean city.
Vadivel Suresh, a former minister and parliamentarian from Badulla praised the Premier for giving him the opportunity to speak at the event, adding that the gesture speaks to the heart of the Tamil speaking community.
I would not have had the chance to speak to you today if werent for the Prime Minister, he said in Tamil. This gesture speaks volume on how the UNP does not divide by caste, creed or ethnicity.
