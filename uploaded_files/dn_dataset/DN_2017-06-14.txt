Sri Lanka left ruing after costly mistakes
A Sri Lanka versus Pakistan virtual quarter-final was always likely to be an intriguing encounter with an unpredictable outcome  in the end Pakistan scraped through, thanks to some woeful lapses in the field from Sri Lanka and a really gutsy 61 not out from Sarfraz Ahmed.
It was a fantastic low-scoring game of cricket, full of twists and turns as both teams made plenty of mistakes, but ultimately Sri Lanka made more mistakes and it ultimately cannot claim it deserved a victory.
At one stage, Pakistans triumph appear unlikely after a brilliant spell from Nuwan Pradeep, who has been the most threatening of the Sri Lanka bowlers throughout this tournament.
Bowling with heart and aggression, he dragged Sri Lanka back into a game it looked set to lose with Pakistan 76-0, while chasing a modest 236 all out. It collapsed to 162 for seven and it looked like Sri Lanka would once again rise to the occasion in a major ICC event.
When you are defending small totals, even if playing on a pitch with a little help for the bowlers, you need to take all your chances and Sri Lanka missed far too many opportunities.
Lasith Malinga should have had Azhar Ali out in the first over for a duck. He survived a run-out chance in the next over and went on to score 34, while adding a 76-run opening partnership.
Then later, more crucially, Sarfrazs victory charge should have ended on 38 when he misread a Malinga slower ball. Thisara Perera dropped the simplest of chances and hell be hurting really badly as the team returns home.
Sarfraz gave one final chance two runs later, Seekkuge Prasanna dropping a harder tumbling chance in the deep, but then took the game away from an increasingly ragged Sri Lanka.
Earlier, Sri Lanka had started strongly with Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis combining so effectively at the top of the order, carrying Sri Lanka to 82 for one.
Dickwella was particularly impressive. He is a very organised and skilful player who has a very bright future for Sri Lanka if he continues to develop. The fact that his 73 came from 86 balls with just four boundaries just shows how intelligently he played.
Pakistan created panic with a mid-innings collapse, inspired by the aggressive Hasan Ali. His confidence seemed to be ski-high after his brilliant three for 24 against South Africa and he found a great rhythm.
Angelo Mathews again showed how critical he is to this Sri Lanka batting line-up, rebuilding the innings with Dickwella with some authority. Sri Lanka look a completely different team when they have him in the middle-order.
Angelos dismissal prompted a late collapse before Asela Gunaratne once again showed impressive maturity in the lower middle-order. Unfortunately for him, he was handicapped by batting with the tail.
Helped by Suranga Lakmals 26, Sri Lanka limped to 236. It could have been worse, but still a par total was 250+ and they looked in trouble. With better fielding, a problem for a while now, Sri Lanka might well have conjured up a surprise victory for that weak position. Instead, it is left ruing very costly mistakes in very critical moments.
Pakistan will be thrilled with the manner in which it has battled its way into a semi-final berth with England. It was thrashed by India in its first game, but has showed character and fierce spirit to overcome that and win against South Africa and Sri Lanka.
The tournament is left with three Asian teams in the top four, an outcome predicted by few before the tournament begun. I certainly did not expect Bangladesh and Pakistan to qualify, but credit to them for doing so. They deserve their places.  ICC news

Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) Chairman Joseph Starling said a male teacher of the Kuliyapitiya Central College has been transferred to Narammala Central College on charges of writing poems to Facebook.
Starling said the teacher, who taught technology at the Kuliyapitiya Central College, has been writing poems to his Facebook page as a habit.
The teacher has been transferred as poems written on the education sector have hurt some education and political leaders, he said. National School Director Jayantha Wickremanayake said the teacher has been transferred not in connection with his Facebook post, but as part of a disciplinary action.
An inquiry is being carried out into a misconduct of the teacher by the Education Ministry. The transfer is part of that inquiry, he said.
Wickremanayake said: The Teacher Transfer Boards approval is needed for a normal teacher transfer, but this is a special case as the teacher has been transferred to make room for the smooth conduct of the inquiry.

Techno Sri Lanka from October 13 at BMICH
The 32nd National Engineering and Technology Exhibition, the flagship event of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL), will be held on October 13 to 15 at the BMICH.
The best of its kind to be held in Sri Lanka, the event is a beacon for the transfer of technology towards scientific and technological excellence of the profession and related industry in the country.
Each year, since its inauguration in 1985 the event has brought forth the latest in technologies, products, skills and best practices from the world over to its target audience while maintaining optimum standards both in quality and quantity.
Being the largest one-stop exhibition related to engineering and technology, Techno Sri Lanka completed its 31st consecutive event last year with nearly 50,000 visitors.
The President Elect of IESL and Chairperson of the Organizing Committee for Techno Sri Lanka 2017, Eng. (Prof.) Niranjanie Ratnayake said that the this years exhibition theme is Empowering Innovation with the tagline 'Smart, Inventive, Disruptive Technologies for Sustainable Development'.
The world is changing. Engineers are in the forefront of this change. Expectations are very high in todays society. We need disruptive technologies that will revolutionize the day-to-day activities, such as mobile technology, nanotechnology, household solar PV technology and perhaps other inventions and breakthroughs to satisfy societys expectations and still not be blamed by our future generations for not leaving them a livable Planet Earth, she said.
In keeping with its theme of 'Empowering Innovation', this years exhibition will introduce several competitions that will encourage and promote smart, inventive, disruptive technologies among the younger generation.
The Young Members Sections (YMS) of the IESL is collaborating with the private sector and the universities to organize an array of seven competitions.
IESL-UTE Raspberry Pi Challenge: The objective of the competition is to promote innovation through smart solutions among university students and young engineers. The popular and cost-efficient Raspberry Pi platform will be used as the core of each product in the competition.
IESL-INSEE Concrete Challenge: The vision of this competition is building brighter futures for Sri Lanka.
INSEE Cement, formerly known as Holcim Cement, for the fourth consecutive year is partnering with the state engineering universities of Moratuwa, Peradeniya, Ruhuna, and Jaffna, and the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka and Open University of Sri Lanka to conduct an innovative concrete mix design competition for the final year civil engineering students.

Voice of  the dumb
The new collection of poems by Prof Kamani Jayasekera titled Voicing the DUMB is astonishingly rich with implicit analogies from Western Classical Culture. Therefore it enriches Lankan contemporary poetry. In other words, her poems display unusual nuances in understanding poetry. Published by Godage & Brothers (Pvt) Ltd, the book has a dashing blue and white colour showing a womans face. There are 50 crisp poems that are seemingly underscoring human values that are constantly changing in the contemporary digital world.
The first poem in the third stanza itself demonstrates the poets purpose in her writing. Here is the poem itself:
Just as a child at play
Crushes and crumbles
What he has built in clay
Or watches in glee
How his sand castles
Are swept away by the tide or
Vanish in the dancing foam
Nature watches idly
The waves
The floods
The Quakes
The landslides
Awe inspiring, magnificent Ruthless and terrible in themselves.
Officiating as a levelling force
Reminding man of his vulnerability
And impotence. Robbing him
Of stability, dignity and tranquillity.
I like the line Savour the beauty of luxury in the poem titled Satisfaction. The irony in the poem Justice such as Making Sri Lankans do the same seeking solace from him (Hanuman) for their benefit and protection is very striking. I also like the philosophical lines - And attachment evokes nothing but pain. The statue was only a symbol and in it vested no value. In the poem called Lessons. The humour in Sibling attractions is enjoyable.
The poets keen observation of the everyday life of mundane things (as most of us may dismiss,) in most of her poems, are brought to our attention in a humorous way. And those are revelations.
The poem titled Ethical Lessons is again sprung from the poets classical learning of being humane in complicated issues. The surprise ending in the poem titled A Different Language is very touching incident in the conjugal relationship.
Again, Dignity of Genetics is rhythmic and the concise descriptive expression is pleasing:
Asian girl, with dark hair flowing
Doe like eyes sparkling in the dusky
Face of divine expression,
Sings in the subway, the guitar in hand
I enjoyed the way how the poet handled a parallel from classical literature to current happenings in the poem titled Impact which concludes this way:
Unable to evoke emotions, let alone the tragic
FOR
This is the twenty-first century
Of the Common Era
After and not before.
In some other poems, the irony stands out.
I like this last stanza in the poem called Hallucination:
Forgetting the past,
Not knowing the future,
Under the mirage of certainty.
In Word Power, the poet gives a quotation in a dialogue: Words could kill / If not immediately / after they seep into conscience / Absorbed, soaked and digested / to corrode and infest the system / She complained in utter misery
In another poem, the poet surprises us with this at the end as this lady who rides the garbage truck. Please read the poem No. 26 for a nice description.
Please read rest of Kamani Jayasekeas poems for they are evidently self  explanatory with a pungent social comment. I enjoyed reading with pleasure this collection of poetry.

Wonder  of  music
Dictionaries say that music is a set of sounds emitted by man, beasts, cascading waters and rustling leaves. These sounds have always given relaxation. Rarely the precursors of doom.
H G Wells in his Outlines of world history Vol 1 says that man has not determined when music originated. It has been recorded in ancient writings. Living beings have strived to imitate sounds they hear. The man sighed into a reed and the beautiful flute was born. Music consists of a series of sounds for sleep, to sing, to dance and to weep, to love and to pray.
Starting with the animal world, the female cicada makes a shrill sound with her wing. A call of love. A nuisance to the male. Happy is the cicada whose wife has lost her wings! The stillness of the night is broken by the melodious sounds of much lower and higher animals.
All during their mating seasons. The mouse, cockbird, birds that roam the skies, the cat and much more make music their call for a mate. Just think what the world would be if a man was to make music the call to love. With no specific time for making the call, the air would be full of songs and instrumental music. A real cacophony indeed.
Music has grown with the man. He tried to imitate the sounds he heard. Some high and some low pitches. We can start at the very beginning. The beginning of life. The shrill cry of the new born babe announcing its arrival into this world. It was and will be music for all mankind. Later music was set according to a scale-Do-Ray-Me-Fa and Sari-Ga-Ma. They fitted the sound of music. Harmonised with the voice. The voice imitated the sounds around. The sounds fascinated man. As sung by Julie Andrews in the immortal Sound of music the scale was the beginning.
The drum is one of the oldest sources of music. It was used in sending messages and various rituals practised by ancient man. For the Incas, the Red Indians, Africans and Asians, the drum was a part of their life. In our own land, different kinds of drums keep us enraptured, during religious pageants, and many other functions. The ear of man recognises the occasion on hearing the music. It is universal. Our viridu and the South Indian villupaatu have the same rhythm. The wailing, sound of music denotes sorrow or death.
Music is a must when a young couple is united in marriage. The Ashtaka, the Jayamangala Gathas, Lohengrins wedding march as the bride enters the sanctum with her father. Then Mendelssons wedding march when the new couple walks proudly among their kith and kin.
All this is music most heart-warming with tunes so very appropriate to the occasion. Have you ever thought about the two goodbye songs  sung after the wedding Kedelle un kirilli of Mignonne and Raththaran Duwe of Carlo Fonseka  so very heartwarming.
Music soothes a troubled mind. Its there, even in funeral parlours. Soft music makes the sick relaxed.
The sounds of music are very pronounced in religion. The sound of drums in the perahera, the Dhammang Saranang Gatchami, church music, the Iman calling to prayer from the minaret, the devotions in the kovil are very distinct to their faiths.
We thank our musical giants Devasooriyasena, Amaradeva, MS, Jothi, Victor, CT and Chithra, Carlo Fonseka, Baig, Mignonne, Nanda also Jim Reeves, Pat Boone, Elvis, Bill Haley and also Schubert, Strauss, Chopin, Bizet and much more for giving us the dew drops of music.
The National Anthem, be it the fiery La Massaille of France to our Own Matha, a countrys anthem gives a feeling of pride and patriotism. An immortal melody. Six decades ago, the London Symphony Orchestra was here.
A hanger at the Ratmalana Airport was the venue. At the end of the first performance, as was the custom, they played our anthem.
Ninety-six artistes took part and Matha soared to celestial heights that day. Traditions were broken. Ten minutes of applause and an encore. Yes, traditions were broken. They played our beloved Anthem again, it was applause of tears. I am sure our sweet Mother Lanka and our beloved Ananda Samarakoon too would have wept with joy.

Would have been a different story if not for pathetic fielding: Mathews
CARDIFF, Monday: Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews described his sides fielding performance against Pakistan as pathetic as they were dumped out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. Sri Lanka dropped three relatively straightforward catches, all off the bowling of Lasith Malinga, which allowed Pakistan to win the match by three wickets and set up a semi-final against England on Wednesday.
Defending a below par 236, Sri Lanka needed to take all the opportunities that came there way. They got off to the worst possible start after Azhar Ali was dropped in Malingas first over. Later, Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistans best batsman on current form, was dropped twice, the first occasion when Pakistan still needed 43 runs to win. Had that been taken, it is likely that Sri Lanka would have gone on to win.
All three of the catches should have been caught - Thisara Pereras drop of Sarfraz at mid-on when the batsman had 38 was about as easy a catch as you could see at international level - and Sri Lankas failure to take the chances on offer allowed Pakistans captain to lead his side to a nail-biting victory. He finished on 61 not out and shared an unbeaten 75-run partnership with Mohammad Amir for the eighth.
Not that this is a new problem for Sri Lanka. Their fielding has long been regarded as poor - they are hampered by a distinct lack of athleticism in some players and a lack of concentration in others - and it is something the team have admitted themselves. Looking at todays performance, I thought we were pathetic once again, said Mathews. If we had held those catches, it would have been a different story today, especially at very crucial times.
Their performance in the field in this match was not for lack of effort. The Sri Lankan players threw themselves at everything today but their execution was found wanting. Perera never got his feet set so he was not ready when the ball arrived and Seekkuge Prasanna took his eye off the ball at the vital moment when diving forward on the deep square leg boundary to attempt to hold on to a Sarfraz pull shot. How to describe Danushka Gunathilakas drop off an Azhar Ali cut shot Its still hard to work out how he dropped it.
The boys have worked extremely hard, said Mathews in support of the effort his side have put in to their fielding when asked if the team was really giving their all in that department. Today, yes, we dropped three catches, but there has been a genuine effort from the boys and from the support staff. Weve expressed a lot about our fielding and we put a lot of energy on our fielding. So, yes, there has been a genuine effort.
While the fielding was clearly under par so too was Sri Lankas batting performance. Well set at 161 for 3 with nineteen overs remaining, they were looking at a score of close to 300 but four wickets for seven runs in the next five overs changed the whole complexion of the game. In truth, Sri Lankas batsmen did little wrong against an inspired Amir and Junaid Khan but they needed to show more resolve on a wicket which was slow but which offered little in the way of lateral movement for either seam or spinners. This performance stood in stark contrast to their tremendous chase against India in the previous match.
Perhaps it was due to a lack of experience in the middle order. Injury to Kusal Perera and the suspension of Upul Tharanga for a slow over rate in the first match when he was captain robbed Sri Lanka of two of their frontline batsmen. That meant they were forced to pick Dhananjaya de Silva just 48 hours after arriving in the country. Mathews admitted it wasnt easy for de Silva to come in to the side in such circumstances but suggested Sri Lankas hand was forced by the lack of other batting options within the squad and the conditions.
We had to play the extra batsman on this, he said. We had to play the seventh batter because we knew there was some grass on the wicket. When you lose a game, you can always say it was poor batting, it was poor fielding, and it was poor bowling, but I thought it was kind of a funny wicket today. Yes, we were 30, 40 runs short obviously, but Im really proud of the guys, the way they came out and tried to defend that. Unfortunately, the fielding let us down.
The performance of Sri Lankas bowlers was the bright spot and Mathews, who marshalled his troops shrewdly in the field, said he was really proud of their efforts. The attack was led by Malinga who, at 33, has clearly lost a yard or two of pace yet he still managed to cause problems for the Pakistani batsmen with his unique mix of yorkers interspersed with the odd bouncer. It may be the last time he is seen on the global stage for Sri Lanka.
Hes been a great servant for Sri Lanka cricket, said Mathews. Hes been fantastic. We saw the effort that he put in today as well. It was unfortunate that we dropped his catches.
He would have been a different bowler but still he came out and gave his heart. He is a champion. That he is but Malinga and his Sri Lankan teammates will head back to their Cardiff hotel tonight knowing they let a brilliant opportunity to reach the semi-finals of this tournament slip through their fingers.
They have had some misfortune during this Champions Trophy but today, they had nobody to blame but themselves.

Cess tax increase on sugar does not affect retail price
The cess tax increase on sugar does not affect the retail price of sugar, Development Finance Department Director General Priyanka Attapattu said yesterday.
Attapattu addressing the media at the Government Information Department said the recent increase in the cess tax from Rs. 13 to Rs. 23 per kilo of sugar, though added an extra Rs. 10 to the price, it was absorbed by the decrease in world prices from Rs. 89 to Rs. 69 in recent times. The Rs. 10 increase would still be a decrease in overall retail prices, he said.
The government increased the tax to help local farmers compete with the decrease in world sugar prices. Only 8 percent of the demand is met by local farmers, he said.
According to the Director General, in 2016, the cess tax was at 25 cents per kilo of sugar, in October 2016, it was increased by Rs. 2 per kilo, in December, it was again increased by Rs. 7 and finally to Rs. 23 per kilo The 2017 Budget promised to pay a minimum of Rs. 4,500 per metric ton of sugar cane. This tax is an insurance to local farmers, Attapattu said.
He said world sugar prices will continue to drop in the future.
Sugar Importers Association President P.M. Abeysekara said there is no need for retailers and bakery owners to increase sugar prices as the price increase has not been passed on to wholesalers.

Engaging Citizen through New Technology workshop held in Ampara
The Federation of Local Government Sri Lanka with the International Republican Institute (IRI) conducted a workshop titled, Engaging the Citizens through New Technology at the Akkraipattu Municipal Council in Ampara recently.
The workshop focused on engaging people to get maximum service from Municipal Councils using social media platforms.
Through social media, a Municipal Council can improve its services and reach out to the people very fast. People now gather information via modern technology devices. Internet users are increasingly visiting social media sites to learn and share their findings, Steve Cima, Country Director, IRI and Zergio said.
Local Government bodies need to develop and maintain a dynamic social media presence to effectively reach out to their citizens. Communication include direct and indirect ways. The Municipal Council has to decide which social media can engage the citizens effectively in getting the service of the Municipal Council. The MC has to appoint a person as a Communication Manager to observe and expedite the service of the Municipal Council to the people, he said.
Steve Cima, Country Director, IRI and Zergio, resource person from Colombia and Hemanthi Gunasekera, Federation of Local Government Sri Lanka, A.Azmy, the Commissioner of Akkraipattu Municipal Council along with officers attached at Akkaraipattu MC participated.

Lanka has taken measures to uphold independence of judiciary
Sri Lankas Permanent Representative in Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha yesterday said that Sri Lanka has taken a number of steps to uphold the independence of the judiciary and lawyers since the 2015 Presidential election.
He said that Parliament of Sri Lanka enacted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, introduced Constitutional safeguards to uphold the independence of the judiciary and the Bar.
The most significant among these are  safeguard to the process of appointment of senior judges: appointment of the Attorney General and the Attorney Generals Department and the appointment of the members to the Judicial Services Commission,he said.
Aryasinha was speaking at the interactive dialogue on the report of the former Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers Monica Pinto at the 35th regular session of UN Human Rights Council in Geneva yesterday. The report prepared by former Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers Monica Pinto following a visit to Sri Lanka was presented to the Council by her successor Diego Garcia-Sayan.
Pinto undertook an official visit to Sri Lanka, at the invitation of the Government , together with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment from April 29 to May 07, 2016.
In keeping with governments commitment to transparency and open engagement , the Speical Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers was granted unrestricted and unhindered access to all the places that she wished to visit, and every effort was taken to facilitate practically all the meetings that Pinto requested with the government officials, he said
He said that the appointment of the Attorney General by the President is subject to the approval of the Constitutional Council in terms of the 19th Amendment.
Previously, the President had the authority to appoint the Attorney General on the observations of the Parliamentary Council, Aryasinha said.
Aryasinha stated that the report compiled by Pinto reflects how the country has adopted many positive rebuilding mechanisms towards protecting the independence of the legal system, and that the 19th Amendment made to the Constitution gives it predominance over other matters.
He added that many senior judges,along with members of the Legal and Judiciary Committees in the country have been appointed independently.

SLFPYF stands to give most prominent place to Buddhism
We are always stand to give most prominent place to Buddhism. It is the responsibility of the government to protect Buddhism while giving due respect and recognition to other religions, SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said. He was addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday. He said the SLFP Youth Front has forwarded its proposals for the Constitutional Reforms based on the unitary states of the country, foremost place to the Buddhism, and non mergence of the Provinces.
He said the SLFPs policy is based on the facts of unitary country, clean politics and sustainable development.
The present electoral system should be changed and a new system should be facilitated to emerge clean politicians to serve the people.
There should be a stability in economy, politics and defence sectors, he said. Referring to the recent changes in the Cabinet, he said the final decisions with regard to appointing ministers and deciding their subjects are always taken by the Party leadership.
Since the Prime Minster decided the UNP ministers subjects, the President has to agree to those recommendations, he said. It should be considered if there are any detrimental effects on the people and the country by these decisions.
But since the NLB and the DLB are managed by a separate Chairman and a director board, there will be no negative impacts on the people and the country, he said.
Even during the previous regime, there were three ministers in charge of coconut cultivation, sugar and minor export crops, while there was a separate Agriculture Minster, he said.
Kalutara District electoral organiser Asanka Ediriweera said there should be a database with all the details of people living in each Grama Niladhari division maintained by the respective Divisional Secretariat. Then it would be easier to deal with rescue operations and catering to relief needs during a disaster, he said.

With 13th Amendment in effect: Power devolved, power retained
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the establishment of Provincial Councils. Article 154G (I) introduced by the Amendment vests legislative power in respect of the matters set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule (the Provincial Council List) in Provincial Councils. Article 154C vests the executive power within a Province extending to the matters in List I in the Governor to be exercised in terms of Article 154F (I) on the advice of the Board of Ministers. In terms of Article 154F (6) the Board of Ministers is collectively responsible and answerable to the Provincial Council
Devolution is one form of decentralisation that provides the opportunity for local people to participate in local decisions and local programmes within the national policy and to act above all as centres of initiative and activity conducive to development. Devolution of power is seen not only as a solution for ethnic, religious, indigenous or grass root level conflicts but also as a means of regional and local development. This is because the devolution of power facilitates the participation of the local population in problem identification, planning, implementation and monitoring. Moreover, the devolution could help to promote planning, resource mobilisation and development activities at a regional level. Effective poverty alleviation often hinges on improved sub-national growth and service delivery.
The organisation and structure of the Parliament which the British left behind, was profoundly centralist, with too much power concentrated in the centre. The countrys administration established under colonialism (and which continued thereafter) was also characterised by a very strong element of centralism. Its key figure was the Government Agent (GA) at provincial (later district) level responsible directly to the centre. In each area, parallel to his administrative organisation, there also developed departmental field agencies responsible to their respective central head office in Colombo. Prior to 1987, there did exist a decentralised administration under the Local Government System. The functions and duties of local authorities related mainly to matters connected with public health, welfare and convenience. However, the Central Government not only had control over the local authorities but also exercised specific and wide-ranging powers which effectively reduced the local authorities to the status of agents of the Central Government.
Judgement of the 13th Amendment Bill
In 1987 the Indo-Lanka Accord generated the two Bills, viz, the Bill titled the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Bill. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Art. 120 of the Constitution was invoked by the President and a number of Petitioners in respect of the said Bills. A full bench of the Supreme Court was nominated by the Chief Justice to hear the case. The determination of the Chief Justice and the three Judges was that the said Bill to amend the Constitution (the Thirteenth Amendment) does not require the approval of the people by virtue of a Referendum under Art.83 and that once the said Bill is passed (by 2/3rd majority) and the Constitution amended accordingly, the Provincial Councils Bill will not be inconsistent with the so amended Constitution.
The determination of four other judges was that the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment require the approval by the people at a Referendum. The determination of Justice Ranasinghe was that clauses 154(G)(2)(b) and 154 (G)(3)(b) which, inter alia, require the approval of the people at a Referendum for the amendment or repeal of Chapter XVII A or the Ninth Schedule (which) contained the lists of subjects), require the approval of the people at a Referendum. Subject to this dissent, he agreed with the Chief Justices view, thereby constituting the majority judgement which enabled the Parliament to enact the two laws by a 2/3rd majority. The passage into law of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the Provincial Councils Act No. 42 of 1987 to satisfy that demand, has been hailed as the most controversial codification of the 20th Century Sri Lanka.
Unitary State
The Thirteenth Amendment introduced a new conception of a Unitary  decentralised State based on a system of Provincial Government at a sub-national level. This description is of extreme importance since the Constitution specifically provides that the Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State and the majority of the people attach much sentiment to the unitariness of Sri Lanka. The question whether the Thirteenth Amendment, in fact, devolves power would largely depend on the willingness and the capacity of both and National Government, and the Provincial Councils to achieve national unity rather than destroy it.
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the establishment of Provincial Councils. Article 154G (I) introduced by the Amendment vests legislative power in respect of the matters set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule (the Provincial Council List) in Provincial Councils. Article 154C vests the executive power within a Province extending to the matters in List I in the Governor to be exercised in terms of Article 154F (I) on the advice of the Board of Ministers. In terms of Article 154F (6) the Board of Ministers is collectively responsible and answerable to the Provincial Council.
The three lists in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution are the Provincial Council List, the Reserved List and the Concurrent List. The Provincial Council List contains in respect of which the Provincial Council is empowered to make statutes.
These mainly cover those areas of activity where decisions affect primarily persons living in the Province and applicable to the Province. The Reserved List contains matters in respect of which the Parliament is empowered to make laws. These cover areas of national importance.
The Concurrent List contains matters in respect of which both Parliament and the Provincial Councils may make laws and statutes respectively. Both Provincial Councils as well as Parliament have legislative powers relating to matters set out in the Concurrent List. Parliament may make laws with respect to such matters after consultation with the Provincial Councils. The power given to Provincial Councils to make statutes with respect to matters set out in the Concurrent List is restricted.
The main constitutional provisions relating to the Governor are found in the Article 154B. The Governor is appointed by the President and the holds office in accordance with Article 4(b) of the Constitution, during the pleasure of the President. The term of the Governor is five years. The degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Provincial Councils in the exercise of their legislative power is not found in the area of the exercise of their executive power. The relevant provisions of the 13th Amendment and the Provincial Councils Act demonstrate that in the exercise of executive powers, the Provincial Councils are subject to the Centre and not sovereign bodies. The provisions relating to the Governor and his powers show that the Governor is not a mere figurehead, but is an active participant in the activities of the Provincial Council. Unlike the plenary power of Parliament in relation to a Bill, with requires no executive assent, a statute of the Provincial Council requires the assent of the Governor who is the Chief Executive of the Province. It is to be noted that a statute of the Provincial Council does not attain the constitutional status of law as the definition of law in Article 170 of the Constitution remains unamended. Similarly, it does not enjoy constitutional immunity or protection that is accorded to an Act of Parliament. Therefore it is subject to the review by the Court.
Land utilisation issue
On the one hand, land utilisation laws and policy reflect the attitude shown by the policy maker on land. On the other hand laws and policy relating to land reflect the attitudes of the people on it. When the balance between these two extremes is lost, issues relating to land utilization arise, and at the first stage, such issues of social and economic nature are not resolved, later these issues become a complicated social economic and political issues. The present Sri Lankan issues relating to land have to be analysed on this foundation.
Sri Lankas land utilisation issue is related to economic, social and political factors. In order to resolve these economic and social issues, the State since 1930s intervened through various state policies by implementing schemes such as land colonization schemes, expansion of villages, alienation of land to the middle class, alienation of land through special permits, regularization of encroachment by deeds, settlement on highlands, youths resettlement programmes and Maha wawe settlement schemes.
However, the contributions made through the aforesaid efforts to resolve economic and social issues in the rural sector have not been satisfactory at all. The fact that the aforesaid issues still remain to mean that state policies formulated and implemented by the capital city of state do not adequately represent regional needs. It is also evident that the central planning from the capital city cannot resolve some issues based on regional diversity.
Although 13th Amendment to the Constitution was introduced in 1987 conferring powers of land to Provincial Councils, subject to restrictions, however powers relating to land have considerably been still fully retained by the Central State. Land ownership issue in Sri Lanka is highly complicated and confused issue among other political, economic and social issues of the country. On the one hand, it is a complex economic and social issue faced by the whole country. On the other hand, it has gone to such an extent demanding separate State. The one important ground for these both issues is the fact that the biggest landowner in the country is the State and the slow movement shown by the State towards the full implementation of the 13th Amendment.
If the Provincial Councils system is to function smoothly and meaningfully much needs to be done legislatively and administratively to fill the lacunae in the law to ensure that the transition from a centralized system of administration to a decentralized one facilitates the achieving of the main objective of the scheme a means of power sharing among the different ethnic-cultural groups providing a settlement of major grievances of the people. The present status of the Provincial Councils system with all its infirmities does not warrant such optimism.
There are two principal issues that the devolution debate over state land needs to address. The first is the extent to which the regional units are given power and autonomy to control and manage state land in the region. The second is what needs to be reformed at the centre, in order to make these a reality. Very often the second does not automatically follow from the first.

Ali Kathava: Beautiful, meaningful and creative
Having seen Professor Sunil Ariyaratnes latest cine creation, Ali Kathava (An Elephant Tale), I felt that it was a fairytale which suits the modern day conscience.
Though in many ways it rests upon the term once upon a time realm, it may refer to any counts at any time. Children, adults, kings, queens, hunters and hermits play a vital part in this story which culminates in the inculcation of a conscience for the time. The king and the queen have no heir to their kingdom even following a lapse of five years. They lament over that, despite the ceremonial activities swinging on.
It so happened that in the process of the grand ceremony, the peaceful living conditions of the elephant family in the nearby jungle by the side of a river is disturbed. The outcome is a fascinating event. An expectant she-elephant finds a newborn, keeps it on her back and retreats into the jungle. The vision of innocence as against the turmoil of humans is sensitively captured.
This is one of the most sensitive visuals that had ever been picturised in Sinhala cinema. There lives a hermit in the village who foresees the well-being as well as the calamities in the vicinity. He accepts the newborn child in the basket to bring up, naming him as Bhanu.
Hunter hunted
The she-elephant gives birth later to a baby elephant named as Raju. The cine spectator sees two sides of the wildlife: elephant and human cultures. Ariyaratne has written the screenplay carefully in order to bring about an affinity for the two creatures, amalgamating them as one entity. But at the same time, he had been extra careful to pinpoint salient behaviour patterns among hunters who live in the same jungle. After the queen was enticed by Bhanu, there appeared a move to capture him.
As a result, the whole jungle life is depicted as disturbed. Bhanu who had developed a firm intimacy with Raju at a particular moment falls apart. As a result, the hunter family lays a net, enslaves him and take him to the palace. A sensitive series of scenes ensues from here onwards. I noticed several layers of visual meanings in the process.
The royal family that include king the queen and the advisors (who are almost clowns), the elephant clan and the hunters who laid the net trap to catch Bhanu as well as the entire environment is shown as disturbed. The meditative hermit tries to visualise what had taken place.
The hermit is symbolic of the mindfulness which I felt is a sensitive portrayal well maintained by actor none other than Ravindra Randeniya.
Though the movie is titled as Ali Katha, meant mainly for children, I felt that it could well reach a wider audience of all ages and all types of audience in the global context. The film is a total creation though rests on a well-made narrative that resembles a fairytale where the original creator is credited as Laticia Botheju. The screenplay presumably is a reconstruction of the original work giving vent to more creative layers which rest on symbolism and realism. Perhaps this is the best director function of a local filmmaker that would be commended by the critics.
The mans effort to protect the nature is sensitively hinted when Bhanu is trapped by the hunters. What happens ultimately is not a question raised. Bhanu, symbolic of the protector, makes the entire progeny of adult that the life should be blessed by nature and not by the rigid rule or rough governance. Similarly, the love of lie rests not on those who love the life as it is despite perhaps temporary upheavals. The message of naturalism and spiritualism lies like a thread of the whole work.
Animal affinity
I feel that this is the type of visual work that should be promoted by teachers to their students at all levels of education in order to make a better world for living beings. The creative commotion via visuals is at its best in the visual exercise. The creators of the film at home as well as abroad (Thailand) have taken pains to bring about a lasting human-animal affinity, a need of the hour. There is hardly a scene of dullness or bore. The songs, inclusive of a lullaby, are in the most pleasing and sensitive manner possible.
The reel work as an entity could be summed up as a work of virtue, both distancing as well as bringing close and interoperations of human behaviour.
As Rudolf Arnheim has shown carefully in his pioneer work Film as Art, a film resembles a painting, music, literature and the dance will, in turn, may embrace most of these areas.
Professor Ariyaratnes Ali Kathawa attempts to embrace all these areas appropriately with the intention of rewarding the audience with delight and wisdom, reaching a high point in maternal love and eradication of cruelty to all that encircle the natural habitats. To achieve the goal, it is observed that all players inclusive of the baby elephant are well trained creatively insight with a vision.
One of the most ecstatic episodes in the film revolves round the two child character portrayals of Bhanu and Sumangali who join hands to enhance the humane high point in the cine work. Bhanu who is brought to the palace as trapped by the hunter family in the forest meets Sumangali in the royal physician's cubicle. Although in the first instance they happened to be strangers, gradually they feel that they are like-minded. As such, Sumangali too leaves the palace to join hands with Bhanu. I sincerely feel that these two child actors bring about new vistas in their skills hitherto unseen in any other cine work.

THE ANSWER MY FRIEND IS BLOWING IN THE WIND
War and violence around the globe seem to take its biggest toll now. Almost all the print and the electronic media are laden with the latest terror attacks and highly critical and philosophical essays. The readers and the viewers are kept abreast of time doing their entrusted duty to the hilt. In other words, peoples in every nook and cranny of the world are well-informed on the gravity of the ground realities related to war and violence.
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind naturally resonates in the mind of the literary lovers, especially the enthusiasts of the genre of war songs, in the 1960s because of the very reason that it was the theme song of the agitators against the Vietnam war, the worst war during that period we witnessed. It is an open secret who fuelled that human carnage and with what ulterior motives the battle went on for such a long time. It is the American university student community who took the vanguard to annihilate that war. In most of the instances, the voice of the university community proves to be intellectual unless it is coerced by disgruntled politicians.
Uncertain future
Escalating loss of human life, frightened running and the death of animals, incalculable loss of property, uncertain future, to cap them all, grave environmental catastrophe have fuelled an unformidable voice in the world to opine that time is high to draw a line between the war-stricken savaged the world that we live in at present a brave new world sans war and violence in the nations vocabulary. Unless a universal bloodbath would be very nigh. The writers around the world could render a yeoman service in this regard and our own writers could extinguish the burning flame and join that bandwagon and do the need of the hour without peaching hair splitting logics on national thinking whereas the intellectuals should essentially be internationalists. In the rapid globalisation process, our cultural identities would evaporate because of its heat.
In my literary endeavour to find a permanent solution to this chronic disease, the other day I perused through the immediately available poetic sources painstakingly for the with the sublime aim of leaving a better world for our posterity to live in. EUREKA, I found. I started jumping up and down in my storehouse of unimaginable treasures, my little home library. For the readers information, I would like to write what my eldest daughter domiciled in Australia has written at the very entrance of my little library: Books are kings treasures  Ruskin.
Metaphorically, my daughter has made me a king!
Excitingly, for digressing your attention to a family anecdote, the writer would like to bring you a very pertinent and valuable piece of poetry as it seems timely to the modern world.
Hardcore terrorists
Wislawa Szymborska is considered in the literary circles as one of the prominent poetic figures who adorned the tapestry of English literature by writing poetry in her peculiar style of composing to reach into the very hearts core of the literary enthusiasts. She was a multifaceted writer and for my endeavour here, I selected one of her poems on terrorism, in a sense, terrorism in the digital world. Yet, the hardcore terrorists still come forward to undertake suicide killings because of their bloodlust. Digital technology is widely and wildly used around the world for destructive purposes unprecedentedly and the writer would like to ring the alarm bells to the peace loving people to take utmost care, because if you spend your time at the wrong place at the wrong time, it would invite you to take the last breath as our veteran cricketer Kumar Sangakkara fluently put in records in his memorable Colin Cowdery lecture in England where the latest bombing took several lives.
She was awarded the coveted Nobel Prize in literature in 1996. She was Polish. She was born on July 2, 1923, and died in 2012. She inherited her patriotic feelings and charity towards the society from her father.
Her war experiences are very authentic and in her writing, it is candidly reflected. It is said that she had had terrible war experiences. In her most crucial period of childhood emotional development, she has had her early education in underground classrooms. The second world war added very bitter experiences to almost all the people everywhere in the world and this great poetess has laboured as a railway worker to earn a living in general and to evade forced labour in Germany, in particular. Her education was multi- dimensional and her poetry seems to be her forte. Her political leniency at the beginning had been towards socialism, yet she has alienated from that line of thinking with the passage of time. On her poetic career path, she was able to bag several prizes and win laurels.
In my poetic selection for this discussion, The Terrorist, He Is Watching, she gives us an accurate description of how a terrorist explodes a digital bomb very accurately and how he watches the explosion. He describes the movements of the general public staying at a very nearby place where the bomb is planted. Even the description is very exciting and this poem would open the eyes of the readers to be vigilant about the environment one life and walk about.
It is high time for all of us to educate the general public in this regard even though it is a thing of the past due to brave decisions our great leaders have taken and our battle-hardened militant leaders have executed them. It is a plural victory of the nation because people suffered a lot and sacrificed their comforts to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Imminent tragedy
In order to get a life and blood experience, just imagine that we are at the very place where the tragedy is going to occur. The time, scheduled to explode the bomb, is thirteen-twenty. In our time, twenty minutes past one. Take utmost care. For Gods sake please behave as I tell you. Your valuable life is in my hand as said of the bus driver. I am monitoring the whole situation. We are near a liquor bar, look at that name board. You just check your time. It is thirteen sixteen.
The terrorist has already crossed the street.
That distance keeps him out of danger,
And what a view just like the movies.
It could be your common experience of watching movies. Being away from the place he seems himself detached from the imminent tragedy. There you see how he is watching the movements of the people in the vicinity and how he is counting from the very second. He is well protected from any harm, yet others do not know the precarious situation. In literary appreciation, we call it dramatic irony.
We should move a bit towards the other side to capture the full view of the situation, so please follow me. Now you can clearly see,
1.A woman wearing a yellow jacket is going into the liquor bar.
2.A man wearing dark glasses is coming out.
3. Some teenagers are having a big talk.
4. A short fellow is getting onto his scooter.
5. The tall man is going in.
Lets lie down for our own safety. What is your opinion about the situation I think only that short one will escape unhurt. See how the terrorist is counting the minutes. It is thirteen seventeen now. Please check it with your watches, because we have to move away before it goes off. The woman who entered the bar did not come out. So, her life is at severe risk. I think that the man wearing dark glasses will escape. This is a very exciting situation; yet please do not make panic. My assignment is to prepare a newspaper report. I bet that the tall teenager will definitely embrace death.

Ariana Grande to get honorary citizenship of Manchester

Ariana Grande is to get honorary citizenship of Manchester under plans put forward by the city council.
The council is proposing a new system to recognise outstanding contributions to the city.
The US singer is in line to be the first recipient for organising the One Love Manchester concert in aid of victims of the bomb attack at her gig, in which 22 people died.
An event to mark "selfless acts" after the blast is to be held, too.
'Love and courage'
Under the proposals for the new scheme, honorary citizenship of Manchester could be granted to those from outside Greater Manchester.
Council leader Sir Richard Leese, said many people would already consider Grande to be "an honorary Mancunian".
He said: "This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city.
"We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May - with love and courage rather than hatred and fear."
He said Ariana Grande had "exemplified this response".
Some 50,000 people went to the One Love Manchester concert at Old Trafford on 4 June, which raised almost 3m for victims of the Manchester Arena attack.
Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer at the end of Ariana Grande's concert.
Manchester City Council has also announced it would hold an event later this year to recognise the "great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit in the aftermath of the atrocity".
The authority said there was a need for a new system of honours in addition to the rarely-awarded freedom of the city, which will remain the highest honour the city can give.
The freedom of the city has only been awarded four times this century.
The plans will go before the council on 12 July.

Arrest warrants, dismissals and constitutional concerns
It is now almost one week since Qatar was cut off diplomatically by several Gulf States including Saudi Arabia and our Foreign Ministry was in regular contact with the Ambassador A.S.P. Liyanage to ascertain whether the crisis would in any way affect the 125,000 plus Lankans living and working there. It has now become apparent that there is no danger of food supplies running out per se, because several other Gulf States have come to Qatars aid and assured a continued supply of goods. This means that there is no immediate danger of a major effect on the Qatari economy and hence, on the jobs of Sri Lankans. With that concern out of the way, attention was focused once again on local political developments, although Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake will no doubt keep an eye on developments in UK and France, both of which had polls.
Dismissal of four Ministers in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC)
The Northern Province is in the news again due to several developments there. When the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) was first appointed, many politicians in the North as well as the South praised the composition of the NPC, saying it was an example for other Provincial Councils and even local bodies to follow.
However, over a period of time, it seems that the NPC has fallen prey to the same temptations that bedevil many other political bodies in the country. In the latest development, parties in the Tamil National Alliance including EPRLF, TELO and PLOTE have demanded the dismissal of four Ministers in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) charged with mass scale corruption. A special committee appointed by the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has recommended to remove Agriculture Minister Ponnuthurai Ayngaranesan and Education Minister Thambyrajah Gurukularajah.
EPRLF, PLOTE and TELO parties in the alliance have expressed in one voice the importance of removing these provincial ministers who were accused of corruption. EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran has stressed that there is no point of dismissing provincial ministers one by one, adding that his party is of the view that all four provincial ministers should be removed, as charges of corruptions are leveled at them. Sixteen members in the Northern Provincial Council have handed over a letter to the Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran demanding the removal of four ministers.
Education Minister Thambyrajah Gurukularajah has already submitted his resignation to pave the way for what he called a complete investigation. The NPC will hold a debate on the corruption issue this week and more action on this matter is awaited.
There have been many allegations against the NPC that it was not properly utilizing the funds made available by the central Government as well as its own funds for Northern developments. While the details of corruption allegations are not exactly clear, this is not a good omen for the NPC.
The latest happenings at the NPC coincided with a (totally unrelated and pre-planned) visit to the peninsula by President Maithripala Sirisena, though what he said at subsequent meetings there has a bearing on the NPC. The President said that public representatives and public officials should have a proper plan to spend the money allocated by the government annually for the development of the Northern Province.
The President pointed out that it was the duty of public representatives and public officers to use the money allocated by the government in a given year for the benefit of the people in any given province. The President reviewed the progress of development activities in the Northern Province and discussed about future development programmes. Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, who had previously not attended many Government functions, was seated next to the President.
The President directed the officials to fulfill the essential requirements of the people in the Jaffna district, such as health, education and drinking water. Following the discussion, President Sirisena met a group of parents of disappeared children at the Governors Office where they handed over a letter to the President. This was an emotional moment that showed the Presidents fullest commitment to the process of reconciliation. The Government has already initiated a Missing Persons Office, a mechanism that seeks to address their concerns. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are known as advocates of lasting peace and reconciliation.
PM returns
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe returned to the island on Saturday afternoon after a visit to the US, where he also addressed the World Ocean Summit that coincided with World Ocean Day (June 8). Although the Opposition initially criticized the premiers visit, they fell silent after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too went abroad (to Japan) on a private visit. Ministers and officials regularly briefed the Premier via phone on the flood situation and other developments and the Prime Minister chaired an extensive meeting on flood relief hours before his departure to the US. A number of Ministers and officials were at the Bandaranaike International Airport to greet him on arrival. The Premier immediately went to work upon his return.
Bodu Bala Sena and religious disharmony
One of his first priorities was to call for tougher action on communal rabble rousers. There has been a spate of incidents targeting both Muslims and Christians in the last few months, which go against the very concept of reconciliation. The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) which was very active during the previous regime has been linked to a campaign against Muslim places of worship and followers.
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was again absent in Court for the hearing of the alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court case, citing that he has received death threats. The Court of Appeal observed that the Court will have to issue warrant against the accused if he failed to appear in Court on next inquiry date.
President's Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda with Counsel Sasika Mithunaarachchi appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera told Court that their client was not appearing in Courts since he has received death threats. However, on a previous occasion, Counsel who appeared on behalf of Gnanasara Thera tendered a medical certificate to Court informing that Gnanasara Thera was being treated at hospital for an illness.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appearing for the Attorney General moved Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of accused for not appearing in Court on several occasions citing various reasons. The Court of Appeal Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Devika Tennakoon observed that they would not issue a warrant against accused but Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on July 18, 19 and 20.
On January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant. Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts Jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
Since the Thera did not turn up in court for several court days in a row, many have expressed the fear that powerful persons could be giving him refuge. In fact, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne expressed a similar sentiment at the Cabinet news briefing. The Rupahavini news bulletin on Monday night had a special segment titled Sodisi (Investigation) on this aspect of the drama, where civil society representatives decried any attempt to shield the Ven. Thera from the law. Police, on the other hand, say there is no deliberate going slow to nab the Ven. Thera whose trail four Police teams are already following. Any attempt to provide a safe haven to the Ven. Thera is misguided and may end up damaging the good name of the Government among the minority communities, the civil society leaders said.
Meanwhile, the outspoken Minister S.B. Dissanayake has once again pointed the finger at former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who the minister said formed, bred and maintained the BBS. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had communal and extremist ideas, and I always detested his brand of politics, Minister Dissanayake said at a meeting in Kandy. If the BSS is behind communal and religious tensions at present, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa may be aiding and abetting it, he said. It is widely believed that Gotabhaya is planning to enter politics big-time since his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa will be unable to stand for a third term as a Presidential candidate in 2020 under the terms of the 19th Amendment.
Responding to criticism that the Government has been slow to deal with extremists, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera said the government will never let any extremists spoil the religious and racial harmony of the country. The Minister said several groups now attempt to create ethnic and religious conflicts by spreading false information via Facebook and other websites to disrupt the progressive journey of the government. (It was reported in foreign media that UK and French Government are considering a plan to fine YouTube and Facebook if they carry any extremists propaganda).
An organised group of members numbering about 40 are conducting mudslinging campaigns using separate websites against government parliamentarians, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told the media last week. They are led by a Joint Opposition MP, he said. The Minister said: We will conduct a formal investigation into this and take legal action against this group. This is a well-organised attempt to tarnish the unity between the two major parties as well as to sabotage the process of providing long-term solutions for unresolved problems. The problem of fake news seems to have raised its ugly head in Sri Lanka too.
Minister John Amaratunga and Media!
Minister John Amaratungas run-in with some members of the media last week naturally got a lot of coverage in both print and electronic media, though the minister later regretted his behaviour.
The Minister is known for causing controversy, but the incident will no doubt be a black mark for him. Politicians from all parties must conduct themselves with dignity and decorum at all times, not just in Parliament (whose proceedings are now telecast live). They also have to remember that smartphones with video capability are everywhere and any incident could be on Facebook and gossip sites in next to no time.
Gazette notification
These sites and newspaper columnists argued endlessly over the subjects of ministers and the gazette was finally published last week. It ended weeks of speculation over the National Lotteries Board and Development Lotteries Board, with Foreign Minister Karunanayake known to have made overtures to the effect that he wanted to retain them. This wish has been granted in the gazette and along with the NLB and DLB, several other institutions have been gazetted under the Foreign Ministry. Newspaper cartoonists had a field day over this, but several ministers from both sides were of the view that the two lotteries boards are more or less autonomous and the supervising ministry really does not matter.
According to the Gazette notification, the Department of Government Printing, National Film Corporation and State Printing Corporations are under the Minister of Public Administration and Management under Minister Vajira Abeywardena. The Ministry of Development Assignments, a new ministry, headed by Minister Tilak Marapana has been entrusted with the Department of Project Management and Monitoring, Employees Trust Fund and Academy of Financial Studies (Miloda). There were no other surprises.
Constitutional reforms
A lot of attention has been drawn to the process of constitutional reform with emphasis on whether the Executive Presidency should be retained or scrapped. It is common knowledge that a section of MPs in both the UNP and the SLFP want the Executive Presidency retained. Indeed, many of them have publicly said so. Another point of contention is whether Sri Lanka should be known as a unitary or a united country. The parties represented in the constitution making process are divided over this issue. The Joint Opposition and the Jathika Hela Urumaya seek to retain the unitary nature of the country while the SLMC, Tamil Progressive Alliance, All Ceylon Makkal Katchi and the EPDP prefer the wording united republic of Sri Lanka. The JO says this would make Sri Lanka virtually a federal state, bringing the f-word to the debate.
A prolonged discussion is now expected on nine different areas  the introductory chapters of the present constitution including Nature of State, Sovereignty and Religion, Principles of Devolution including land, Central Legislation on Provincial List Subjects, the Capital Territory, Second Chamber, Electoral System, the Executive, Constitutional Council and Law & Order. Changes and amendments will be accommodated as the process moves forward but there seems to be a general consensus to avoid any amendments that would require the peoples approval at a referendum.
There is also no consensus yet on the method of picking the Prime Minister yet, though three scenarios are available: Direct election, pre-nomination and the present Westminster system. The most favoured system seems to be pre-nomination where each party can nominate a prime ministerial candidate either from their party or another one. According to this draft proposal, after declaration of results, the Election Commission will determine whether or not a candidate for PM has received pre-commitments from a majority of all elected MPs. The candidate receiving the majority of pre-commitments will be declared elected as PM.
The draft Constitution will have clauses that prevent separation by any of the nine provinces and a proposal to establish a second chamber (with around 55 members), a feature found in many other countries. The Parliament will have around 233 members, a marginal increase from the present 225, which now includes 29 National List MPs. The electoral system is certain to be changed, with the Mixed Member Proportional Representation system in the lead. That is one thing that all parties agree on.

Assessing flood disaster: Understanding problem will save lives: Wajira
Minister of Home Affairs Wajira Abeywardena speaking on the recent flood situation, in the South, said, President Maithriapla Sirisena requested to set aside political desires and prevent national calamities.
The following are excerpts of Minister Abeywardanas speech:
We know that many people expressed various opinions regarding the massive floods that occurred recently. Whatever these opinions are, we should first realise that this devastating flooding has brought us to an important and decisive juncture. We should understand that if we developed our irrigation systems as King Parakramabahu the Great did to preserve water in the manner Not a single drop of rainwater should be allowed to go waste, we would have never faced a tragedy of this nature.
Recently, in Galle, President Maithripala Serisena emphasized that all politicians should set aside their political differences, think of the country and the people and take necessary action to solve this problem without fear. We warned that if correct decisions are not made to prevent natural calamities like floods, at least at this point of time, there can be greater disasters in the future.
He also pointed out that it would be possible to arrange funds, if we work according to the correct necessary plans. Although it may be necessary to make difficult decisions in implementing these plans, he advised that such decisions should be made irrespective of power, preferential votes, or political ambitions.
As a government, we took steps to save people from similar disasters fourteen yeas ago. As the floods were not controlled previously due to protests from people, this time, water went up to 8  10 feet above rooftops of houses. The government is hoping to bring the affected areas and lives of the people back to normal within two months.
Floods should be understood properly
When the floods occurred, religious leaders provided leadership in villages and under the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the armed forces and all ministries got together to save people from the calamity. If we do not properly understand this problem at least now, in ten years, time even 20,000 live scan be lost in the same way we lost 200 or so today.
We, as a Government, say with responsibility at this decisive point, that this flooding can be prevented completely. If the general public and politicians work together in unison with one objective, we are sure that not only the areas affected today can be protected from floods in the future, but also through that, these areas can be developed and improved.
In 2003, floods very badly affected Galle District, Matara District, a part of Hambantota District, Ratnapura District, and also Kalutara District. This time also, the people in these districts were distressed and reduced next to nothing.
The reason for this in Galle District is that we do not properly control the water in Gin Ganga. Take Nilwala Ganga and Kalu Gnaga; the situation is the same. Now, what happens when we fail to properly control the water of the three rivers is that all the water just flow into the sea without any use. On the other had, when there is flooding, it destroys everything. Our livelihood, our houses and all what we have earned in our lifetime.
Sixty-year-old reports of USA and Irrigation Ministry
At this point, I would like to remind that this is a shocking moment for the whole nation. I say this with two reasons. First, because this a terrible destruction. The other, is, even when there are clear solutions to these problems, the inability to take these solutions to the people of the country. As a nation, we should be ashamed of ourselves about this.
One main fact I can state now is that in 1960s, it was the time when our country was called Ceylon not Sri Lanka. ECI Engineering Consultants of Colorado, USA, carried out a feasibility study for the then Ministry of Agriculture, irrigation, Land and Power. They handed over its report to our country in 1968. In fact, I have read the entire report. Based on the contents of that report, they have stated that if these three rivers, namely, Gin, Nilawala and Kalu, were not properly controlled in time, there would be landslips and disruptions to the lives of people. It was recommended that the three river basins should be thoroughly studied and six dams should be built.
Gin Ganga can be taken as an example. It starts from the Gongala area. It first flows through Lankagama in Sinharaja forest. Starting from Lankagama, Gin Ganga flows through its branches to the sea at various locations and at the same time, the main river falls into the sea at Gintota. As the massive run-off from the heavy rainfall over a few days could not be controlled, it has completely surged into the sea, causing devastation.
That is why we are telling these people that they should in fact, protest against the government, demanding to know when the project will be started and when they will be protected. If we do not do it, that is what will happen exactly. In Galle District, 1.3 million people suffered in 896 Grama Niladhari Divisions. In the future, suffering will be more than this.
Then there will be more landslides in Neluwa, Thawalama, Nagoda, Niyagama, Udugama, Baddegama, Weliwitiya Divithura, Akmeemana, Galle and Karandeniya. We are facing this problem as a nation that failed to properly control water.
Cultivate paddy fields and generate electricity
This is why I said that according to the report published in 1968 by ECI Engineering Ltd of United States, the present situation is very clear. There is nothing new to be done. If we can start these projects by laying foundation stones before April, next year, we all will never have to face this type of floods in the future. This is what the above report has clearly stated 60 years ago about flood-protection and generation of electricity in the three river basins of the Nilwala Ganga, Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga.
When we look at this feasibility report, it is very clear that Jasmine Dam has to be constructed across Gin Ganga as a flood-protection system. Sixty years ago, three more dams have been proposed as Maguru Dam, Kukule Dam and Ratnapura Dam as a flood protection system. In addition to these dams, the report says that it is possible to construct power plants in Ratnapura and Galle Districts. As far as Nilwana Ganga is concerned, the report mentioned about Binghamara Dam and Hulandawa Dam. A power plant was identified for Binghamara Dam. Then there will be 3 to 4 power plants and 6 large dams. Up to now, we have failed to achieve this as a nation. This report was written before the Mahaweli programme was commenced. However, Mahaweli was undertaken successfully including Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, Inginimitiya, Maduru Oya, Polgolla projects and power was generated. Electricity for Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Ratnapura was brought from the above.
People should urge politicians to undertake the projects
If there is flooding at heights over one thousand feet, we will have to leave Sri Lanka and settle on Mars. We will have to leave Sri Lanka and shift to the moon. People spread similar stories when the 2004 Tsunami hit the country. Our people measured 100 ft into the land when Tsunami came. In Japan, people measured 100 ft into the sea. That is why Prime Minister and I went towards the sea with a tape to give this massage to people. New cities were created in Japan. People were settled. Today, in the world, there are hotels built in the middle of rivers. Today, in the world, there are hotels built in the sea.
I am not saying now, we should build hotels in the river or not. This one has to be decided later.
As such, the entire nation has to understand this problem properly. In fact, I hear some people saying that these floods are due to the expressway. I saw former President saying that the expressway was not done by them, but by the United National Party. It is a great thing to say like that, at least, during a time like this. We laid its foundation stone during the government of Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge. The then Minister of Highways Thilak Marapana, Ananda Kularatne and I laid the foundation stone. The plan was to complete this road in 2007. But by the time the road was opened in 2012, there had been additional expenditure of billions of rupees.
At the time of its opening, they said that this wonder was created by them. When the massive floods struck, they claim that this was done by the United National Party and not by them. We are ready to accept it. The truth is that we built the Southern Expressway.
There is flooding from Imaduwa to Kurundugaha Hathepma. A few new place get under water. But theres no effect from the expressway. There is some effect in Kalutara which can be fixed. As there was the expressway, one side of it was closed by deviating from the normal rules and regulations and action was taken to help the flood victims. These areas were affected by flood even before the expressway was constructed. We have solutions for these problems.
Floods can be controlled
However, when reservoirs are built, water would not go down destroying everything on the way. Therefore, you must say things that you do not know carefully in front of the nation. As such, I do not wish to talk about this at length. But, I would like to tell one important fact. There is a solution to the floods. These reservoirs have to be built. When these reservoirs have been built, there would never be floods in these areas. We can take one example for this from Galle District. Forty years ago, the first stage of Gin Ganga project was implemented. Baddegama town is situated 12 miles from Galle. In the past, after rains, the area from Baddegama town to Iriyagaha Junction in Akeemana electorate got flooded with water up to 7 ft. in those days, people did not reside along the sides because of the floods.
However, when the Gin Ganga project was implemented, people built houses on both sides of the road. Water was controlled by an earth bund. This bund is now too old. If this bund is breached at any point of time, the area, up to 10 km or so, will be completely inundated. Thousands of people will die. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure proper water management is done. Water management has to be properly carried out by the government. If it is not done properly, people will suffer.
Heavy rains create massive amount of water, which is also a huge asset. The inability to properly control that asset as a Nation is really unfortunate. Therefore, I would like to remind you that our President is a former Minister of Irrigation. He is well aware of this situation. Our Prime Minister also has a good knowledge about this. Therefore, I am sure that it will be possible to find a permanent solution to this problem and that through proper water management, flooding in these areas can be prevented in the future. For this, people must give their fullest support to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Specially, the politicians are needed to set aside their narrow political goals and work for the people at this point of time. If you support these massive flood protection projects by laying the foundations stones in April next year, we can undertake today, with responsibility, the task of completing all the works by the year 2022.

Blue skies in sight
Decorum befitting a young lady of Methodist College and humility are two characteristics that the Head Girl of Methodist College Diyumalie Goonewardene possesses. Perfect Prefects features this young lady who is at the helm of this institution leading and guiding the girls.
One of the most important leadership qualities a Head Prefect should possess is to always be calm and be prepared to make decisions in the most unexpected of circumstances in a calm manner. You need to be able to command respect from everybody and work with your teammates while understanding the other people. As a leader, you need to identify what everyones unique talents are and be willing to listen to the ideas of other people. Most of all you need to pull yourself together. You need to know what exactly you want, said Goonewardene.
The Head Prefect is chosen from Grade 13, which is one year before they leave school.
So all the Grade 12 teachers get together and nominate students from their classes. And then they address the criteria of who has leadership qualities, who can manage their studies and their involvement in schools activities and if they can command respect from students their own age and even girls younger than them. After that a few students are nominated and the teachers and senior students vote and the head prefect is appointed, stated Goonewardene.
The primary duty of the Head girl is to maintain discipline and have it throughout the time a girl spends at school and from how the girls wear their ties, their ribbons and do their nails and to walking in line.
We do projects at school that help the girls become rounded and projects that will enhance their personalities before they leave school. We try to also go out of school and do a project to help people outside of school in society. We have 29 people in our committee and I need to make sure that all of them are working and that they grow as girls into fine young ladies and have the opportunity to broaden their perspectives by seeing what is outside. As a school committee we have to do two projects, inside the school and outside the school, added Goonewardene.
The committee includes Prefects, Games Captain and Head Prefect and the House Captains and Vice Captains are from a year younger than Diyumalie.
The duty of the committee is to keep the school in order and help out in events. Our primary duty is to inculcate values of proper conduct. I and my fellow Prefects are supposed to be an example to everybody  an example of virtue. Girls are supposed to look up to us. For example, you need to show them what they should aspire to be. They should be able to come to us when they are facing an issue. And as prefects we need to be there for them when they need us without feeling alone, explained Goonewardene.
One of their programs is to build girls self-esteem up and take it to a higher standard.
One of the school activities which is not confirmed yet is helping out with the flood relief or to help people who are affected to learn how to earn their income and motivate them to be independent.
I used to swim. I am in the Choir and the Senior Christian Movement and as the Head Prefect, I have different responsibilities and sometimes it is hard to balance everything. But sometimes you need to assess your priorities. For me, Head Prefect responsibilities come before my choir commitments but I have to set my limits because I enjoy being in the choir. So I have to manage the time I have, explained Goonewardene.
The sky is the limit for this young lady.
I have always wanted to become a pilot abroad. I am doing my London A-Ls now. I want to get into the aviation industry. I have many friends and relations in the field. I did an aviation course of three months provided by my school last year. That fuelled my passion for aviation. The industry has so many different aspects to it. I have always liked to travel. So I would love to be able to be a pilot and learn to travel as well, shared Goonewardene.
Goonewardene has received a fine education at Methodist.
At Methodist, I have learnt to be able to identify who I am and I have had so many opportunities to bond with the girls, to get to know other people and help out in so many activities. As School girls at Methodist College, we get to learn and experience so many different things. You get to work as a team. There are so many moral values you learn through school life. I am so glad I am a member of this school having received so much from it, elucidated Goonewardene.
Goonewardenes parting words to any girls who wants to take up a position of leadership at Methodist is to be humble.
Every leader is different. Every leader has her own style. Be who you are. Try to be the best you can in every situation. Dont show off but be humble and always give God the glory, said Goonewardene.
Support is something she has had in abundance.
I have received a lot of support from the Prefect body at Methodist. The girls have been very cooperative making it so easy for me. As a result, I have been able to enjoy my responsibilities as much as they enjoy their responsibilities. They have been so helpful to me in so many ways. They have always had that respect for me even though they are all my age or a little younger to me. My family is pretty supportive. My father and mother were both in school committees. My sister is a swimming champion and I have a younger brother who is always loving. It is a very supportive environment and they help me to relieve my stress and help me enjoy life. Our principal, Hiranya Fernando, has been very supportive throughout the entire process and always is there if I need anything, elucidated Goonewardene.
Divine Grace more than anything else is what Goonewardene attributes to her success.
My faith has helped me a lot. I am only here because of God. I believe that my position was given by God. I have faced so many challenges throughout this year, it is stressful being a head prefect. I have overcome all these challenges up to now by the grace of God. I give God all the glory because he has helped me become a humble person, stressed Goonewardene.
I think it is very important for a school to have a prefect body because the students are groomed in the right way and it provides opportunities for leadership and develops leadership skills. It helps all to work through their difficulties and gain new experiences. Our school is also known for its discipline and to maintain that discipline you need a prefect body, summed up Goonewardene.

BOOKED BOTHER
The online book community is a wonderful place for meeting new people and gushing about our favourite books. But if you live anywhere other than the USA, you begin to notice that despite being a global platform, the internet and everyone on it is usually assumed USAmerican until proven otherwise. I wont deny that Canadian and USAmerican book lovers have a lot in common, but there are a few things that set us apart. Although there are plenty of great things about living in Canada, here are a few problems we have that other southern neighbours dont have to worry about.
Shipping costs
In the US, they have this wonderful thing called Media Mail, where books can be shipped so cheaply it would bring a tear to your eye. The US has the lowest shipping costs in the world! Theres no better place to have a book flung from coast to coast! Unfortunately, Canada has one of the highest shipping costs in the world, which makes ordering books online a lot less fun.
Every Canadian who has ever tried to buy online knows the gutting disappointment of seeing $13 shipping on a $4 book. Well, hopefully itll keep our used bookstores in business. The US/Canadian cover price difference
Once upon a time, though you wouldnt believe it now, the US and Canadian dollars were on par. Little known fact: this was the worst time to work in a Canadian bookstore. Because despite the dollars being the same, books were still printed with the Canadian price and US price side by side, and wow, was there ever a gap between them. Though the Canadian dollar isnt as strong now, Canadian book lovers are still used to sighing at that US price and then paying the Canadian cover price that is only rarely accounted for by the exchange rate alone. There are a lot of factors that play into that difference, but because our books almost always show the US price above our price, its hard not to envy it.
Of course, this (and several items on this list) is an international book lover problem, but it feels particularly striking when you live so close to US border. It doesnt take long before Canadians on the bookternet just begin to assume any all-caps GIVEAWAY going around on twitter doesnt apply to us. Damn our high shipping costs! The lack of book subscriptions
Chalk another loss up to Canadian shipping costswe rarely have book subscription services available to us. Or, if they are, its about half again the cost of the box itself to have it shipped to us.
There are so many interesting subscription boxes out there now, packed with bookish goodies and exclusive items, not to mention carefully curated titles! The good news is, its a lot easier to choose between them when the majority arent available to you! Canadian literatures reputation
Even within Canada, its not uncommon for Canadian authors to bring up Anne of Green Gables, Margaret Atwood, and not a lot else. Take a Canadian Literature class and theres a good chance youll be introduced to a rich world of dry literary fiction. The good news is: there are lots of fantastic Canadian authors out there, writing in lots of different genres! The bad news is, its hard to find them, when only Canadian literary fiction seems to get any attention, and even that is pretty slight.
Cover confusion
Canada gets an interesting mix of UK and USAmerican culture filtering in, which sometimes translates to being completely confused about which books people are talking about, because we got a version with a different title and/or cover. Sometimes we get the USAmerican one, sometimes the UK one, and sometimes our own versionoh, and sometimes its only the subtitle thats changed (or the title has changed, but the subtitle has stayed the same). If you work in a Canadian bookstore, it means you get to experience everyones confusion! (But you also get very good at researching this kind of thing.) Netflix let-downs
So, youre probably wondering what Canadians think of Anne with an E. After all, its the controversial new take on Canadas most beloved series. Im sure youve read tons of Canadian reviews of the show. You havent Oh, right, thats because its not on Canadian Netflix. Really Anne Not available in Canada How dare you.
There are more Canadian bookish pet peeves, of course: stripping Canadian books of their setting in the movie adaptation, for instance, or trying to read while wearing mittens, but these are some of the ones that get under my skin.
If youre a Canadian reader, let me know your favourite and least favourite things about being bookish in Canada! If youre from the US, I hope you appreciate your low shipping costs just a little bit more. And, of course, if you live anywhere else, let me know your bookish pet peeves about reading in your country!

'Buhuman' health insurance policy relaunched
The Government Pensions Department together with ColomboRe Insurance Brokers and relaunched 'Buhuman' - a unique health insurance policy, recently.
Introduced to the market in 2014, this policy was previously designed and developed by ColomboRe Insurance Brokers. Subsequently modifications to the product were made with the assistance of Fairfirst Insurance.
'Buhuman' which means respect, is a health insurance scheme well known to state pensioners. The product was re-designed with added benefits specifically aligned with the evolving insurance needs of pensioners. Increasing the insurer age limit for the personal accident cover up to 90 years and the addition of a coverage for expenses incurred on drugs purchased, tests, scans and X-rays are a few of the added benefits.
Existing benefits offered under 'Buhuman' include personal accident cover, hospitalization cover and critical illnesses cover. The policy is available under three insurance plans ranging from Rs. 125,000 to Rs. 500,000. Pensioners can choose from one of the three plans depending on their financial capabilities and the affordable monthly premiums offered ranging from Rs. 200 to Rs. 400. The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding took place at the Pensions Department in presence of Jagath Dias, Director General of the Department of Pensions, Dr. Sanjeev Jha, Managing Director and CEO of Fairfirst Insurance and Roshini Silva, General Manager of ColomboRe Insurance Brokers along with several other officials from the three parties. According to Jha, there is a strong need for insurance products to assist senior citizens of the country. This is an important line of insurance for us and another step towards continuing to address the growing needs of the Sri Lankan insurance market.
Roshini Poshitha said, Having identified a need in the society, 'Buhuman' was redesigned specifically to provide the perfect solution to the need of the senior citizens. The Director General of the Pensions Department Jagath Dias said We are happy to be partnering with Fairfirst Insurance for this upgraded beneficial scheme offered to pensioners."
"With the rate of senior citizens in the country on the rise, its imperative that we do whatever possible to uplift their social and economic status.

Criticism, ozone of public life
A piece of information published in the newspapers is subject to criticism. Readers have the right to make observations and lodge their complaints/appreciation. It is the duty of the newspapers to publish same with or without editor's footnotes.
Regrettably, some newspapers do not follow this. They feel that it is an insult to the writer. Newspapers duty is to give correct information to the readers and healthy criticism has to be recognised.
They sincerely feel that correct information should be published. They may be highly qualified professionals or aware of the true position due to experience. This is healthy and commendable.
Those who wish to show their intelligence and seek publicity. This is also fairly acceptable. Those who are biased against the writer and wish to undermine him. The intention may be to insult him and put him in an embarrassing situation. This also could be tolerated if it is correct.
Those who wish to suppress the correct information given in the papers for their personal benefits. They are afraid that the correct information published may affect their future.
Some politicians are of this type. This is called covering a pumpkin on a plate of rice.
However unhealthy criticism should not be encouraged. Personal vulgar attacks, filthy language, information which may spark communal, disharmony, violence etc should not be published.
The press should be mindful of this matter.

Commission reprimands Auditor General
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe was told to testify with accuracy and clarity before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue yesterday.
Wijesinghe was requested to think deeply before answering questions on subjects that he does not have expert knowledge on.
AG Wijesinghe was informed so, following certain answers he provided to questions posed by legal representative Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando regarding the loss calculation of the auction held on February 27, 2015 which was included in the AGs special report on the matter.
The Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said it is important that Auditor General Wijesinghe give correct answers to questions or refrain from answering to questions that he does not have expert knowledge on.
Or else we may have to discard your testimony. The Commission will have a problem with including your testimony into our final report. It is alright to say no to questions for which you need expert knowledge to answer. Justice Chitrasiri pointed out.
Commissioner, retired Deputy Auditor General V. Kandasamy informed that the AGs Department has provisions to employ expert sources to assist any investigations they are leading.
Thus, it is perfectly alright to say that you are unaware of certain subject matters, Justice Chitrasiri told the Auditor General.
Legal representative of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Nihal Fernando PC requested Auditor General Wijesinghe to explain how to calculate the price of a Treasury bond, to which the latter answered as it is not relevant to the auditing process.
Fernando PC asked whether AG Wijesinghe knows, or does not know how to calculate the price of a Treasury bond, to which the latter said it is not a relevant question. Fernando PC also asked AG Wijesinghe whether he knows the formula with which the price of a Treasury bond is calculated, to which the latter replied as I dont have all the formulas by heart.
AG Wijesinghe asked from the Commission Chairman whether he has to answer to the questions Fernando PC asks. Chairman Chitrasiri said, Wijesinghe indeed has to.
Meanwhile, asked as what alternative methods the Auditor General proposes that the government could have opted for, rather than fulfilling the borrowing requirement on February 27 2015, through an auction, AG Wijesinghe said taxation, money printing, issuing Sri Lanka Development Bonds and obtaining an overdraft facility from the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank were some. Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned Wijesinghe whether he believes the options like money printing and taxation are not harmful to the government and the countrys economy at large.

## Title: Death by selfie
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Death by selfie
The selfie-craze in recent times has proven to be more dangerous than just a bad picture, as countless victims have been killed while looking for the most dangerous and unusual places to take a selfie.
In October of last year, two Sri Lankan girls living in Oman drowned while trying to take a selfie in a water spring in Salalah, Oman. This year in May, a doctor attached to the Colombo National Hospital slipped and fell at the Makeli Ella in Palindanuwara. And in the second case of death by selfie this year, two brothers were killed on the Colpetty-Bambalapitiya railway line as they attempted to take a selfie.
The Superintendent of the Railways Protection Force, Anura Premaratne speaking to Daily News said the use of phones on the railway tracks, committing suicide and crossing rail roads carelessly, continue to be a major issue for the Railways Department.
Within the last six months around 20 people have died using phones on the rail roads. Within this week alone, four deaths of those who have lost their lives while taking selfies on the rail road have been reported, he said.
Premaratne further explained that after the death of two young girls on the rail road near a restaurant in Dehiwela, the Railways Department conducted several awareness programmes and distributed leaflets about the danger of such activity and that people needed to be more careful when crossing the rail road. Sign boards alerting the public to the impending danger also have been placed on railway tracks from Colpetty to Mount- Lavinia.
Another big issue is the unauthorized constructions closer to the railroads from Colpetty to Mount Lavinia. The rail road is the entrance to their houses. There are many famous restaurants along that way. During the weekend, large crowds visit the beaches and restaurants along Marine Drive and people have to cross the rail roads as they are the only way to access them. It is very dangerous, he said.
Premaratne added that the Railways Department had suggested that the Urban Development Authority (UDA) build bridges over the rail roads along Marine Drive and he said that this was currently being discussed at ministerial level.
This phenomenon of risky selfies has become a trend worldwide and many countries have taken stern action to curb such irresponsible behaviour. The Russian government for example, launched a campaign to make young people think twice before snapping selfies in risky situations. The initiative was taken after a series of accidents in which adolescents were killed or seriously injured. India which had one of the highest selfie related deaths has taken action by declaring certain areas no selfie zones. In Mumbai, they had declared 16 such areas and police patrol the areas. The Waterton Canyon Park in Denver, USA in the meantime, had to close because there were too many people trying to take selfies with bears.
Given the increasing number of accidents in Sri Lanka too, perhaps it is time the government thought of certain measures to reverse the trend of death by selfie.

Two brothers killed whiletaking selfies
Anuradhapura - Central Special Correspondent
Death is unpredictable and none can predict when it would take you by surprise. Thus it was for two brothers living in Anuradhapura; the elder had just completed three years of university education in Singapore and was home to spend his holiday with his parents and younger brother. The two would face death in the most unlikely manner; falling victim to the most dangerous form of photograph - 'the selfie'.
On Sunday (11), the two brothers decided to take a selfie on the Colpetty to Bambalapitiya railway track as the evening Galle to Fort train passed by. Unfortunately, the train came faster than their picture.
The victims have been identified to be 24-year-old Sashi Madushan Ranaweera and 12-year-old Theekshana Shakshan Ranaweera, residents of Anula Devi Mawatha, Wijayapura, Anuradhapura. Their father; Prasanna Priyankara Ranaweera (49) is a retired corporal of the Sri Lanka Army and their mother R.A. Bandara Menike (47) is a retired soldier of the Army Womens corps. They have three children and it was their eldest and youngest who succumbed to such a fate. Sashi Madushan who is an old boy of St Josephs College, Anuradhapura had left to Singapore for a course on hotel management. He had returned to Sri Lanka on Sunday evening at around 4.30 pm. His parents who were overjoyed to welcome their son three years later with his certificates, had gone to the airport along with his two brothers, grandmother and other relatives to bring him back home.
The family then had come to Galle Face Green in Colombo to enjoy the evening and thereafter left to a relative's house in Colpetty. Their grandmother, W. Prema Gunawardena (68) who is in shock, speaking to Daily News amidst tears said that as they were travelling along the railway track on Marine Drive, when 12-year-old Theekshana had pestered his father to stop the vehicle so that he could capture a selfie there.
We stopped the van because our younger son was insisting on it. We did not like to do so. Then the two brothers went to the railway track close to the sea and took pictures. I too was there, it was around 5.45 pm. I saw a train approaching with its lights but because of the sound of the sea, they did not hear the train approaching until the last minute, she said.
I shouted at the younger one saying that the train was approaching. As we shouted, he got scared and he jumped across the railway track and then again jumped back into the direction of his brother. Sashi shouted at his brother not to come and as he tried to save the younger one, both got caught to the train. Both kids just fell on the spot. We could not even register what had just happened, added the grandmother.
For a time, no one came forward to take them to hospital. The elder sons leg was cut off, we picked the leg up and put it into a three wheeler. How can a grandmother take all this in When I looked at the younger one, his head was separated from the body. Their mother and father were simply screaming, our children!, I initially thought they were in shock unable to do anything, said Gunawardena. The grandmother continued to cry, Why did our son leave us so soon He did not even show us the certificates he brought home, and fainted. The younger boys head which had been stuck on the wheels of the carriage was found on Monday (12) morning at the Gampaha railway station. The railway officials of the stations had handed it over to the Colpetty Police for further investigations.

What dopeoplethink ofselfies
Pasindu Heshan- Attorney-at-law
Many foreign countries have banned taking selfies in certain public places. Recently, a study revealed that more people have died from selfies compared to other factors. When I visited India recently, I saw a board near a rock which stated Be careful when taking selfies. Apparently, many youth have died by falling from that rock while taking selfies. The boards will not save their lives.
If people are so careful about following the rules there would be zero accidents in Sri Lanka. I would say no selfie zones are not going to save their lives, they are stupid enough to try doing it anyway.
------------------
Lakshani Wijeyakoon- university student
Even I have the habit of taking selfies wherever I go. My mother often scolds me that I am addicted to it. I am very careful about the surrounding though; I wouldnt risk my life to take a photo. But, I know there are a lot of people who consider taking selfies at dangerous places as an adventure.
I like taking selfies. There is a good and a bad side to everything. People should be cautious when they want to take selfies in dangerous places. Anyway, ignoring the rules and taking risks are not new to people right Dont drive while speaking on the phone is a traffic rule. But, how many are following it This is also something similar to that. Its not about selfies its about how ignorant and foolish some people are.
------------------
Nirmalie Bulumulla- Entrepreneur
I use social media to sell my products and I hardly upload my photos on Facebook. The government should impose a fine on people taking selfies in dangerous and public places.
I saw selfies taken during the floods also. It has become a trend now. Sometimes it is very annoying to see people taking selfies. I think it is a disease. Some do not need friends around them but they want likes for their photos.
------------------
K. Chandrasiri-Manager at a private company
I have always seen people taking selfies in public places. Now it is not only the youth who take selfies but also older people. Everyone wants to upload it on their Facebook or Instagram. I use social media but that does not mean that you need to upload pictures at the risk of your own life. Today, social media is all about showing off. The selfie sticks took the problem to another level. Now, people are so obsessed with it.
The government should ban taking selfies in dangerous and sacred places in the country. Some people go to temple and take selfies near the Buddha statues. Who does that
Meanwhile, some have this crazy habit of taking selfies in dangerous places. Recently, I saw a photo on Facebook taken by my friends son; he had gone hiking and taken a selfie at the edge of a cliff. What if he had slipped It would be just news for the country, but its a loss for his parents.

Ekaterina Sergeeva, a soloist of the Mariinsky Theatre, delivered a flawless performance last Tuesday which was glorious. Ekaterinas singing was second to none and she was simply dazzling. All those who attended the Evening of Russian Songs, romances and live music were thrilled by her vivacity and friendliness. Her personality came out in tangible ways making the evening memorable and sensational. Her performance celebrated the 60th anniversary of Russia- Sri Lanka diplomatic relationship. The evening was made possible through the efforts of the Russian Cultural Center in Colombo.
Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha addressing the gathering.Colombo Russian Centre Director Anastasia Khakhlova
Ekaterinas interaction with the crowd was certainly pleasing to see as she moved smoothly through the audience. In fact, possibly all who saw and heard her that evening may have wondered whether they would see this powerful singer again. A singer who was committed to that evening and dedicated to making the evening enjoyable for everyone involved!
Song after song, Ekaterina regaled us all with her dynamic character and charisma. Song after song she showed much energy and enthusiasm. Truly it was a night to remember. It was obvious that she too was excited and passionate performing to the crowd.
It was not only Ekaterina though. The four other gentleman who played their musical instruments alongside her cannot be forgotten. Their music and Ekaterinas singing made the evening something special. The music these four performers churned out added so much to the event. They too performed with passion and showed such zeal. It was obvious that playing in Sri Lanka meant so much to them.
The joy on their faces and Ekaterinas face showed their involvement in the event and how serious they were about their music. Let us all hope that one day we will see them again. The Wonderful Ekaterina and her ensemble.
The bilateral relationship between the two countries can be seen in multiple spheres, one of which is cultural cooperation. This was highlighted by the recent visit by his Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena to Moscow. We are most pleased to hold this rare musical event. Nothing brings people closer quite like the Arts. It is full of passion, exquisite in its nature and complete in its form. Thus I am deeply convinced that events like this facilitate mutual understanding and further development of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Russian and Sri Lanka. Events like this put a spotlight on the rich cultural heritage of Russia. This is done by live music and songs, said Russian Centre Director Anastasia Khakhlova
Russian Ambassador Alexander Karchava also expressed his deep pleasure and satisfaction at being present at the event.
Russian Art and Culture is renowned throughout the world. Art and Culture are some of the greatest phenomena right in this world. I have no doubt that these days world renowned Russian Culture and Performing Arts, are precious. During my tenure in office, I have tried my best to introduce these performances here and we have been able to realise that goal today.
I am very happy tonight that you will enjoy music and singing of some of the finest Russian Performers who belong to the company of the world renowned Mariinsky Theatre, which is one of the most prestigious cultural centres. This musical ensemble is from one of the most beautiful cities in Europe  St. Petersburg. Mariinsky Theatre is one of the most successful and reputed theatres in Russia. I invite all of you to enjoy good music and good singing, said Karchava
Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said that he has first -hand experience of the beautiful city of St. Petersburg and the renowned Mariinsky Theatre.
I had the opportunity to visit the city of Moscow with the presidents delegation in March.
We signed four agreements with our respective counterparts. I was able to sign another two agreements in the field of my portfolio.
One with the Samara State University and in the future, we hope that more Sri Lankan Scientists and Engineers will be sent to Samara for further training. And we plan to send a Nano-Satellite into orbit with the help of Samara University.
That is one of our dreams. I take this opportunity to thank his Excellency Alexander Karchava and all the officials for organising this event today to mark the 60th diplomatic relationships between Sri Lanka and Russia. I have had the opportunity to attend many of these events, said Minister Premajayantha.

Essex defeat Surrey to consolidate top position
LONDON, Monday: Two counties that pressed for the title until the final day of last seasons English Championship combined to produce a gripping finale at Taunton on Monday. It ended with a three-run victory for Yorkshire. They went top of the table, at least for a few hours, while Somersets fears of relegation are now impossible to ignore.
Tom Westleys 108 not out, and an equally fine innings of 77 from Nick Browne, took Essex to an emphatic eight-wicket victory against Surrey at Guildford which takes them to the top of the County Championship Division One table.
Needing 253, from a minimum of 83 overs, after they had bowled Surrey out a second time for 288 earlier in the day, Essex reached 253 for 2 little more than half-an-hour after tea and always looked totally in control despite a wearing last-day pitch.
Westley was joined in an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 105 in 27 overs by Dan Lawrence, who finished unbeaten on 32. Essex took 24 points from their third win of the season, with Surrey having to settle for seven.
Since gaining promotion last year, Essex have surprised the rest of the first division with their early-season success - but this was a comprehensive win against a team who themselves led Division One until the last round of matches and was achieved despite seamer Matt Quinn suffering a back spasm on day one which has prevented him from bowling since.

Estate esplanade
I was born in a tea plantation district at Nawalapitiya and spent my holidays in tea estates where my father was a Tea Estate Conductor, a prestigious position, in estates and a later a small holder of tea plots and my eldest brother too ended up as the superintendent of Brambley Estate Kandapola, when the European planter enlisted to join the army in World War II.
Hence my interest in recalling the happy times I spent during my school holidays, brings back to mind the contribution made by Indian Labour for James Taylor and his successors to bring the Tea industry to a major foreign exchange earner. It was due to the disliking of our Sinhalese to work in tea estates which made the tea plantation owners to bring South Indian labour.
In this context it is apt to quote Emerson Tennent:
The temptation of wages and no prospects of advantages has hitherto availed to overcome the repugnance of the Sinhalese and the Kandyan to engage in any work on estates, except the first process of felling trees.
Again Sir Hugh Clifford, Governor of Ceylon, in his address to the Second Annual Agricultural Conference  Ceylon held on March 11, 1927, had this to say, confirming the statement of Emerson Tennent:
The Ceylon Estates enjoy a perennial supply of voluntary labour is one of the happy accidents which has contributed to the welfare of this fortunate isle, but if the soil of the districts of Madras Presidency, from where that supply was drawn were as fertile as is that of most thickly populated parts of Ceylon, the estate owners might whistle in vain for Tamil labourers to flock to their assistance and our principal agricultural industries would quickly languish, for the place of these workers on the upland tea estates at least could never be taken by the people of this island, The repugnance to work upon estates is I believe as an unconquerable today as it was seventy years ago.
Annexed is a poem describing the life of the early estate Indian woman labourer, for those of today to know the toils and hardships they underwent to bring this valuable asset for prosperity of Sri Lanka
I conclude I this historic note, with the present trend of young Tamil estate youth, both girl and boys taking to other employment in cities and urban areas, there would be no hands to work in Tea Estates  plucking, pruning etc in the near future. What plans have the authorities, the government, made to sustain this industry.

LETCHUMIE
Here lies an unknown Letchumie
Under the Tea Bushes, green and shady
From where she came and where she went
None cares to know how her life was spent.

Rises to the beat of Tom Toms in misty morn
Rapped in a Kambili to keep her warm
To the Perettu she walks to earn her wage
Sun or rain, to her, is the same.

Up the hills and down the dales,
Every tea bush she reaches with eager face
Her fingers go clip clap, plucking the leaves
When the basket is filled, with smiles she beams

The shouts of Sinna Dorai, Kanakapullai and Kangani
She is accustomed to that endless daily symphony
She bears all that for the love of her brood
Her naked children wait for her return with eager looks.

When days work is done, she hastily walks
To her Line Room for her household chores
Lovingly she pets her dog, cat and hens that lay
The only leisure and pleasure she gets for the day.

Sitting, Dining, Bedroom, all in one, except the Lat
The floor is swept to spread her mat
A tin contains her savings of few rupees and cents
The world revolves in this room, Ten by Ten.

Ebony coloured skin, tanned in sun and rain
Her lips are Red with betel stains
Hair parted with Pottu on her radiant face
She is a beauty on a Thai Pongal Day

Huddled in this only room, she goes to sleep
With her brood and pets around her feet
Thus ends the day with no regrets
With daily duty daily done to her ability best.

Far away from her homeland now she rests
After her blood, tears and sweat she had shed
Offering her bones and flesh to nourish her alien soil
For the prosperity and peace of this beautiful Isle

Her blood runs in our countrys veins
And her toils were to our national gains
Future generations could live without any need
For she had left a fortune in a Cup of Tea

Let not racists speak and look with scorn
As she, to this world was lowly born
She has played her part well in her struggled life
Let us be grateful and not unkind

When she is judged on the Judgment Day
She would head the list for the sacrifices made
For her merits are boundless and her sins are less
Her place in Heaven is assured, with eternal bliss.

Fire engulfs Grenfell tower block in west London [Video]

A huge fire engulfed a tower block in Latimer Road, west London, with eyewitnesses claiming people are trapped in their homes.
The fire at Grenfell Tower on the Lancaster West Estate was reported at 01:16 BST and about 200 fire fighters are tackling the blaze.
The Met Police said people were being treated for "a range of injuries".
The BBC's Andy Moore said the whole tower block was alight and there are fears the building might collapse.
At about 04:00 BST police said: "Residents continue to be evacuated from the tower block."
Forty fire engines have been sent to the tower, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khansaida "major incident" had been declared.
London Underground said the Hammersmith and City and Circle lines have been closed between Edgware Road and Hammersmith because of the fire.
Eyewitnesses said they could see lights - thought to be torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, which people say is "close to burning through".
Our correspondent added: "We've seen debris falling from the building, we've heard explosions, we've heard the sound of glass breaking.
"The police keep pushing back their cordons, pushing back members of the public for fear the building might collapse."
The BBC's Simon Lederman said the tower could be seen burning "from miles away".
'Covered in ash'
He said the building was "burning out of control", from the tenth floor onwards.
London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Dan Daly said firefighters are "working extremely hard in very difficult conditions to tackle this fire".
"This is a large and very serious incident and we have deployed numerous resources and specialist appliances."
London Ambulance Service medics specially trained in life-saving medical care in hazardous environments have also been sent to the fire.
One eyewitness, George Clarke, the presenter of Channel 4 TV programme Amazing Spaces, told Radio 5 Live: "I'm getting covered in ash, that's how bad it is.
"I'm 100 metres away and I'm absolutely covered in ash.
"It's so heartbreaking, I've seen someone flashing their torches at the top level and they obviously can't get out."
'Building crumbling'
Tim Downie, another eyewitness, told the BBC part of the building was "completely burned away".
"It has burned through to its very core," he said.
"It looks very bad, very very bad. I've never seen anything like this. It's just such a big fire.
"The whole building is just crumbling. It's just billowing black smoke."
Sophia, who is about 500m away from the building, said: "There are lots of people gathered in the street. I just see more and more flames burning and tragically I hear people crying for help.
"The entire building is burning through."

Flood disaster leaves tea estates high and dry
Tea estates in Baddegama, Neluwa, Mapalagama, Nagoda, Elpitiya, Polgahawila, Divitura, Welivitiya, Ethkandura in Karandeniya electorate, Rekadahena and Kahaduwa were severely affected by the floods. Cultivation was found submerged for over four days. After the flood water receded, acres of dead tea plantations in the affected areas could be seen brownish in colour. Over 75 percent of tea estates of tea smallholders were affected by the floods.
Cultivating tea is the only livelihood of tea smallholders of a major of tea-growing areas of the Galle district. A well-grown tea cultivation yields a good crop and a majority of tea smallholders earn a good income of around Rs. 100,000 per month. A kilo of fresh green leaves fetches a price of Rs. 100 to Rs. 110.
Smallholders tea estates of the Galle district are located mostly in the river valleys of Gin Ganga and its tributaries, in the low-lying areas and close to stretches of paddy fields.
Galle District Tea Smallholders Societies President P. H. Susantha de Silva predicted that it could take at least two years to obtain a crop if replanting had to be done replacing the dead plantations.
Tea smallholders of these areas have become traumatic and emotionally disturbed, unaware of how to cope with the burning issues of earning their day to day living under the existing circumstances. Even the private factory owners find it difficult to function without green leaves which they usually obtain from smallholders on a daily basis for production.
Ishanka attached to the Disaster Management Section of Elpitiya Divisional Secretariat said the damage caused by the floods is yet to be assessed. So far, no action is taken to pay compensation to affected tea smallholders till the ongoing surveys are completed. She said paddy cultivation and home gardens are also affected. In addition to floods, even small-scale soil erosion at Ketandola, Rekadahena and Metiviliya had destroyed tea estates, she revealed.
Elpitiya Tea Inspector I. D. Dusantha said surveys of dead tea estates had already begun to assess the exact number of acres affected. He said in addition to tea, even cinnamon estates in certain areas were damaged by the floods.
Jayanthi Thuduwage and one of her daughters had been rescued by neighbouring villagers. Her tea cultivation of nearly two acres at Akuretiya, Baddegama adjoining Gin Ganga was completely destroyed by the floods. She said she could never dream of replanting her tea cultivation.
The grieving tea smallholders of affected areas said relevant authorities had to devise immediate plans for the rehabilitation of their tea cultivation.
After the flood receded, the donations from other sources had become scanty, some of the victims revealed.

Green AGRO for eco-friendly farming
Living with nature is a lifestyle that is healthy for us and the environment. Following an environmental friendly lifestyle is mainly, consuming organic foods cultivated without using chemicals such as, inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and insecticides that can destroy ones health.
Eco friendly farming is a process of cultivation, without harming the environment using only natural sources to provide nutrients to plants. Organic concept is becoming popular among Lankans and many government and voluntary organizations are working on promoting the green concept.
ICEI and Overseas are two Italian nonprofit organisations that are working in Sri Lanka together with Ecowave, a local social enterprise. Both international organisations are in Sri Lanka since 2005 implementing projects in the fields of integrated rural development, focusing on the food supply chains and community-based responsible tourism.
Thanks to funds from the Italian Cooperation and Cariplo Foundation trough the initiative Feeding the Planet 2015 - a unit for producing a liquid biological fertilizer GREEN AGRO for paddy has been established and the production of organic fertilizer has recently started. GREN AGRO is a consortium of friendly Bacteria that helps to accelerate the microbial process in the soil allowing crop plants to uptake nutrients more easily avoiding the use of chemical products.
GREEN AGRO-GRO, is produced by Green and Biofert Guarantee Ltd, established in Buttala in 2016 to support organic farming in Sri Lanka.
The company is not for profit and it reinvests all its earnings in research and development to identify new innovative organic solutions for agriculture.
Feedbacks from the paddy farmers using the product are encouraging as well as the field trials conducted in Moneragala and Ampara districts over the last four years, in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture says the Managing Director of the Company. A fertilizer for vegetable and one for fruit are currently undertesting with the Sri Lankan Department of Agriculture.

The Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), the pioneer in providing globally renowned IT and Business higher education in Sri Lanka, recently held the Big Data Analytics Open Forum at The Mirage, Colombo.
The event was attended by IT and corporate professionals who represented several renowned multinational and local blue-chip companies.
The Open Forum discussed the uses of Big Data, Business Analytics and Business Intelligence tools to empower organizations to achieve success.
The event was addressed by CEO of IIT Dr. Sampath Kannangara, Professor Nirmalie Wiratunge - Professor Intelligent Systems Research for Robert Gordon University, UK, Cassim Farook  Senior Lecturer /Course Leader at IIT and Alroy Mascranghe Senior Lecturer and Course Coordinatorat IIT.
Dr. Wiratunga from the School of Computing Science and Digital Media at the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland, addressing the Forum said that Big Data is a popular topic which has gained much attention and is of strategic importance to Robert Gordon University and Scotland.
Speaking at the Forum, Dr. Kannangara said, "IIT is a pioneer in providing internationally renowned undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Over the years we focused on producing all-round graduates who are able to empower their respective organizations. IIT graduates are in high demand in the Government and Corporate sectors mainly due to our focus on catering to the industry needs. The postgraduate degree programmes offered at IIT will enhance knowledge and provide the students with the necessary skill sets that are required to excel in their chosen career. The specialized masters programmes offered at IIT in collaboration with globally renowned universities will definitely give our graduates a competitive edge.
What is Business Analytics Everyone is talking about it these days. It is simply turning data into insight. If you have heard of Netflix, they have a lot of subscribers as well as data. After further investigation into the types of TV shows that subscribers prefer to watch, they found a relationship between specific pairings of TV shows and they went onto produce the American version of House of Cards which was a huge success. Another heavily used example in business analytics is on pampers and beer. A famous supermarket wanted to get an idea of the products customer like to buy together when they shop at the grocery store and they found a very unusual pairing which was pampers and beer. They put these products next to each other and even gave a promotion on these two products together and the sales increased by a vast amount, Alroy Mascrenghe, said.
Farook said Big Data Analytics is targeted towards a tech savvy, R&D and research oriented architects, solution designers, implementers and engineers.
He added that the MSc Big Data Analytics offered at IIT will provide students following the programme an in-depth knowledge on technologies and tools that will give rise to efficient Big Data Analytics solutions. IIT is currently offering MSc Big Data Analytics and MSc Business Analytics postgraduate degree programmes from Robert Gordon University.

## Title: Impact of UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, June 14, 2017 - 01:00
Impact of UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka
Continued from yesterday
It is trite law that a sovereign State has complete control over its territory and population as well as control of movement across its borders as long as other Sovereign States grant formal recognition to that State.
However, the international polity consisting of other sovereign States and the UN as a whole could, and obviously should, intervene where gross violations including loss of human lives are being caused by unlawful or excessive domestic State action. This unfortunately has too often proved to be a proclaimed objective of totally unjustifiable intervention and inroads into the sovereignty of a State.
Evidence on which UN High Commissioner bases findings
The Report of the UN High Commissioner states that it should be read in conjunction with the oral update on June 29, 2016, the comprehensive report of the High Commissioner and the detailed findings of the OCHR investigation.
This Report (A/CHRC/30/CRP2) which runs into 261 pages contains 32 pages of findings and 16 paragraphs of conclusions and recommendations. It is not practical to deal with the finding in this presentation and I do not attempt to do so. Perhaps paragraph 169 which sets out the recommendations would of relevance.
It is relevant to note that the OCHR investigation is subject to reservations contained within the report, such as in [par 5] It is important at the outset to stress that the OISL conducted a human rights investigation, not a criminal investigation. The time frame covered by the investigation, the extent of the violations, the large amount of available information, as well as the constraints to the investigation, including lack of access to Sri Lanka and witness protection concerns posed enormous challenges.
This reservation is expressed again in par 153 quoting lack of adequate time as one of the reasons. Whatever the reason, evidence of an issue of such significance to a Member State needs to have been subjected to close and careful evaluation.
Recommendations
The recommendations include requests of an advisory nature for implementation by the GOSL and can roughly be divided into protection of the community from violations by investigation and punishment of transgressions and the restoration of civilian normalcy and reformation of the justice system.
There can be no doubt that investigation, trial and punishment according to due processes of law for offences of causing enforced disappearances, extra judicial executions, sexual violence, and recruitment of children into armed conflict is the duty of any civilized government and calling upon the GOSL in specific terms to perform this duty is unhelpfully obnoxious.
However, taking the recommendation in proper spirit, the GOSL should ensure the preservation of evidence, protection of witnesses, judges, prosecutors, investigators and ancillary staff, listing of persons in detention and the criminalization of war crimes and genocide.
The GOSL is also called upon to release the reports of the Commissions of Inquiry and Military Courts of Inquiry. It is not clear whether the laws in operation permit the publication of all the proceedings of a Military Court.
A further step recommended is the establishment of a comprehensive transitional justice policy for addressing the human rights violations of the past 30 years and preventing their recurrence. The term 'Transitional Justice' has the unfortunate connotation of emerging from a dictatorial regime or the reparation for war crimes.
No doubt a credible investigation into the violations of human rights during the preceding thirty years can and should be undertaken.
The GOSL has mechanisms evolved over the past, such as Criminal Justice Commissions [with powers of imprisonment] and Presidential Commissions of Inquiry to examine evidence for reliability and where there is prima facie evidence of criminal offences to place such material for trial and punishment. The Commissions had the power to instruct investigations, seconding trained investigators to carry out their investigative functions under the supervision of the Commissions. The Commissions could, and did, employ Special Prosecutors who along with Counsel from the Attorney Generals Department examined witnesses and made legal submissions. Persons who were considered to be interest to an allegation, could and did retain Counsel who cross-examined witnesses and made submissions in defence of their clients.
In the circumstances, the recommendation to establish an ad hoc hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, with a specific mandate appears unwarranted. There obviously cannot be any objection to Counsel being permitted to watch the interests any party or to participate as observers to the Court proceedings.
What is meant by an ad hoc hybrid court
The UN High Commissioner contemplated a special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors and investigators, with an independent Sri Lankan investigative and prosecuting body, defence office, witnesses and victims protection programme.
Such Courts have functioned to try Nazi War Criminals, [The Nuremberg trials] and evolved to try offences such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as the Special Panel in Dili, Siera Leone and Cambodia. The Courts were occasioned by particular situations caused by singular political and historical situations.
The High Commissioner has not chosen to disclose why such an ad hoc hybrid court was required. Nor has the High Commissioner chosen to indicate the level of seniority or expertise of the international judges, prosecutors or investigators. It is noteworthy that a large number of Sri Lankan Judges have served on International panels and have done so with acknowledged distinction.
Some of the recommendations cover an area of human reparation, such as the development of a national reparations policy in consultation with victims and their families, considering the specific needs of each victims, including women and children and finance appropriately from the state budget and to strengthen programmes of psychosocial support for all victims of the conflict.
Thirdly, an area of determining the whereabouts of missing persons is to be achieved by a comprehensive mapping of all pending criminal investigations, habeas corpus, and fundamental rights petitions and all of the cases submitted to the Disappearance Investigation Unit and the Missing Persons Unit by the Zonal and All-Island Commissions and the current status of over 11,000 individuals known to be linked to the LTTE and reported to have been registered and rehabilitated.
It is requested that where necessary, to amend legislation to ensure that those who have received death certificates for the missing are not prevented from pursuing judicial cases to determine what happened to their loved ones;
Fourthly, recognizing the right to know the results of all cases related to serious human rights violations, as well as the findings of all Commissions of Inquiries where they have identified specific cases, and refer these cases to the special court upon its establishment;
Under this category, the GOSL is called upon to initiate prosecutions in all cases in which the Presidential Commission to Investigate Complaints Regarding Missing Persons has identified perpetrators and prima facie evidence and to review all cases of detainees held under the PTA and either release them or immediately bring them to trial. The GOSL is also requested to review the cases of those convicted under the PTA and serving long sentences, particularly where convictions were based on confessions extracted under torture;
On the political front, the GOSL is requested to provide durable solutions for old and new displaced populations through land restitution, resettlement and livelihood support, and to the military for civilian activities. Prioritize the return of private land which has been occupied by the military and end military involvement in civilian activities;
The GOSL is requested to reform the judicial system by strengthening the Human Rights Commissions independence and its capacity to refer cases to the courts, and to seek a review of the Supreme Court decision in the Singarasa case to affirm the applicability of international human rights treaties in domestic law and reinstate the competence of the UN Human Rights Committee to consider individual complaints;
The Resolution has exceeded its mandate when it calls upon a Sovereign Member to ratify an International Convention [in this case the Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances or the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]
It also appears that the UNHRC has exceeded its mandate when it calls upon the GOSL to ensure that the Constitutional Council is fully operational as soon as possible, so that it can appoint qualified new members of the utmost independence and integrity to key institutions such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka;
The GOSL is requested to issue clear, public and unequivocal instructions to all branches of the military and security forces that torture, rape, sexual violence and other human rights violations are prohibited and that those responsible, either directly or as commander or superior, will be investigated and punished. This is a helpful recommendation. Subject to due process, anyone suspected of being involved in such acts should be immediately suspended until an effective investigation has been completed.
Order and end to all surveillance, harassment and reprisals against civil society actors, human rights defenders and journalists, and to prepare an overall plan for security sector reform to ensure the civilian nature, independence and professionalism of the law and order forces, and reducing the role of the military in internal security matters;
Clarify the roles and chain of command for all branches of the security forces, including the different intelligence services, the CID and the TID.
Develop a fully-fledged vetting process respecting due process to remove from office military and security force personnel and any other public official where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they were involved in human rights violations;
Ensure that no member of the Sri Lankan security forces is sent on a UN peacekeeping without vetting to establish that the individual, including commanders, have not in any way been involved in human rights violations or criminal acts. Any allegations of abuses by Sri Lankan peacekeepers while on peacekeeping duties must be fully investigated by the authorities;
Take immediate steps to identify and disarm groups affiliated with political parties and sever their linkages with security forces, intelligence services and other Government authorities;
The recommendation to invite the OHCHR to establish a full-fledged country presence to monitor the human rights situation, advise on implementation of the High Commissioners recommendations and of all HRC resolutions, and provide technical assistance; and to ensure full cooperation with the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council and to Invite the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict, the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial killings and torture, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and other relevant Special Rapporteurs is clearly a matter for the GOSL to determine at its discretion.
What does the UN expectthe GOSL to do
Prepare the foundation for a just and equitable society in which the entire population can enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the sphere of civil and political rights.
The achievement of this objective involves the identification of grievances both, real and perceived with a view to making reparation and avoiding future conflict. The first step would be:
1. To call for statements from persons guaranteed protection or permitted to testify through video link from undisclosed locations.
2. Have the information checked by experienced investigators, adopting such technical investigative tools or procedures approved by law.
3. To place the material before experienced prosecutors who could assess their credibility at the level of satisfaction prima facie.
4. Frame charges against those who appear responsible for criminally punishable human rights violations.
5. Place the material before a panel of persons who have the capacity under the relevant laws in Sri Lanka to exercise judicial power, for trial according to due process and punishment, if found guilty.
The second step would be to restore normalcy in the day to day civilian life with gradual demilitarising and withdrawal of the armed forces. Obviously, a step to be taken with the concern for the protection of the society from unlawful violence.
While these processes are on-going measures to ameliorate the trauma undergone during the conflict and to provide closure for families of missing persons would prevent the festering of unresolved grievances that constitute the feed bed for unlawful violence.

London fire updates: Blaze engulfs apartment block [Video]

A massive fire has ripped through a 27-storey apartment block in west London, causing an unknown number of fatalities and at least 50 injuries. Two-hundred firefighters in 40 trucks have been battling the blaze, which began shortly before 1am local time, and several hours later continues to burn. Eyewitnesses said they had seen people fall or jump from the stricken building. Large pieces of debris could be seen falling from Grenfell Tower, a 1970s block in the working-class north Kensington area  a short distance from chic Notting Hill  which underwent an extensive refurbishment only last year.
What we know
London Fire Brigade has confirmed a number of fatalities following a blaze at Grenfell Tower in north Kensington.
London Fire Brigade was first called at 12.54am on Wednesday to the Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, North Kensington. Fire commissioner Dany Cotton said the first crew was on the scene in less than six minutes.
It is a 27-storey building.
Forty engines with more than 200 firefighters attended the scene.
Thirty people have been taken to five hospitals.
The fire is burning from the second to the top floor.
The cause of the fire is not yet known
London mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire has been declared a major incident.
Grenfell Tower was built in 1974 and contains 120 homes, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
Police statement
The Metropolitan Police have released a statement confirming there have been a number of fatalities in the fire. Commander Stuart Cundy, from the Metropolitan Police, said: All the emergency services and other agencies continue to work together at the scene.
I can confirm there have been a number of fatalities and others receiving medical care. We will be soon making contact with next of kin.
Anyone who is concerned about loved ones in relation to the fire should contact Casualty Bureau which has been opened following the fire. If you do not get through immediately please do try again.
Extensive cordons remain in place and a number of nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The A40 is closed in both directions. We kindly ask that the public stay away from the area. I thank the public for their patience and their co-operation today which has already greatly assisted our policing response.
It is likely to take some time before we are in a position to confirm the cause of the fire.
Fatalities confirmed
A number of people have been killed in the massive fire in a west London apartment block on Wednesday, London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton told reporters at the scene. At least 30 people have been injured in the fire which engulfed all floors from the second to the top of the Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, where several hundred people lived.
At this time I am very sad to confirm that there have been a number of fatalities, I cannot confirm the number at this time due to the size and complexity of this building, Dany Cotton, Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade told reporters.
They were trapped
Witnesses have told how they heard screaming from the upper floors as the flames rose in the night and one desperate resident could be seen waving a white cloth from a top floor window.
They were trapped. They couldnt come downstairs, especially from the top floor ... people have been burned, a witness identified as Daniel told BBC Radio London. I have seen it with my own eyes. And I have seen people jump.
Jody Martintold the BBC that he battled his way his way to the second floor only to encounter choking smoke. I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window ... hearing screams, I was yelling everyone to get down and they were saying We cant leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors, he said.

Mahinda Rajapaksa trying to distort facts on GSP+: Samaraweera

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to distort facts regarding the GSP+ concession.
The Minister said this in a statement made in response to the comment made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa regarding the GSP+ concession.
Minister Samaraweera said that by saying that the Government should not create unrealistic expectations about GSP + former President Rajapaksa is saying that obtaining GSP+ concession is trivial sinceSri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country.
A country has to be classified as upper middle income by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for the GPS+ he said.
Even if Sri Lanka was to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantaged of GSP+ for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said that Rajapaksa cannot acknowledge that the Unity Government has managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy, in application of Article 4(1) of the GSP+ regulation of 2012, for four years.
The Minister said by the end of these four years the European Union will show growth recovery.
With less unemployment and more consumer demands, this is the moment to join in and enhance partnership with the European Union the Minister said.
Furthermore Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the statement made by the former President saying that GSP+ puts Sri Lanka under the supervision of the EU is absurd.
By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to give their input and views. Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition Minister Samaraweera said.
In addition to this, Minister Samaraweera said that Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to retain the GSP+ facility by misjudgments made by his advisors who advised not to implement the 2011 recommendations of the LLRC, which he himself appointed to protect citizens from torture, criminalized disappearances and fully investigate cases of human rights violation.
We know very well how Rajapaksa and his advisors tried until the last minute to retain the GSP+ facility in 2010 and lost he said.
The Minister said that the GSP+ system is a partnership that helps our nation to gain its due place once again in the international stage to stand shoulder to shoulder with the international community.
On the contrary, we feel stronger when our laws reflect the best of global humanism and when our citizens benefit from the best law enforcement Minister Samaraweera said.
The full statement is reproduced below:
Statement issued by Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance & Mass Media in response to a recent statement made by Mahinda Rajapaksa, MP for Kurunegala District on GSP+ concession. 

Mahinda Rajapaksa and his advisors, instead of working to take our country to the heights that our country could have achieved soon after the conclusion of the conflict in 2009, chose to run our country to the ground. He made our country heavily indebted on the one hand, having borrowed at exorbitantly high, commercial rates; while taking decisions that made Sri Lanka withdraw from the international stage, on the other, thus making our country and our people isolated and shunned by the world. He hides the fact that time after time, major donor countries voted against Sri Lanka at the time, in international financial institutions.
Having eventually lost an election which he himself called for, ahead of time, he appears to still not be able to come to terms with that loss. His hunger for power makes him and his advisors continue to indulge in the lies, tricks and games that were so much a part of his regime and so much a part of his personality. Just recently we saw how he lied to the people about his travel to Japan. He said that he was travelling to Japan at the invitation of the Emperor of Japan! The Embassy of Japan responded to a question from a journalist denying this. Why resort to this kind of lying to hoodwink the people, Rajapaksa If you are in fact a follower of the teachings of Gautama Buddha as you try to show the people, isnt it about time, at least at this stage of your life, to try to abide by even one of the five precepts, and refrain from indulging in lies.
Rajapaksa, in a statement titled Government should not create unrealistic expectations about GSP Plus says that obtaining the GSP Plus facility is trivial, since Sri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country.He conveniently hides a fundamental issue. A country has to be classified as "upper middle income" by the World Bankfor three consecutive yearsin order to be no longer eligible for the GSP Plus. Even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, andfor one additional yearafter the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit. This shows that Rajapaksa is clearly trying to distort facts because he cant acknowledge the fact that the National Unity Government has in fact managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy, in application of Article 4(1) of the GSP Regulation of 2012, for at least four years.
This period of, at the very least four years, comes just when the European economy starts to show signals of growth recovery. With less unemployment and more consumer demand, this is the moment to join in enhanced partnershipwith the European Union!
But let me add a point. Rajapaksas reasoning that we shouldn't aspire to a better deal, because some time in the future the economy will grow iscallous and insensitive to the workers of our country and their families. It reflects a complete lack of concern for our workers who expect progress in the immediate present, and they deserve progress in the immediate present. So what if Sri Lanka, thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of its entrepreneurs and workers looks poised to cross a certain threshold of average income Does it mean that we, as a government, should sit on our hands without giving them the opportunity for a better deal that they deserve now in the present Shouldn't we help them to reach our national goals sooner rather than later
The idea that GSP Plus puts Sri Lanka "under the supervision" of the EU is simply absurd. By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to give their input and views. Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition. It is a sovereign decision from a humanistic nation, towards its own citizens, inspired by the most sacred human values and principles. How ironic that Rajapaksa who claims to be not just a follower but a guardian of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not advocate granting the very basic human rights principles and rights and freedoms to the citizens of this country! Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of protection Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of human rights and freedoms
It was incompetence and arrogance of Rajapaksa and his advisors, and their determination to deny the people of this country their rightsthat resulted in Mr. Rajapaksa failing to retain the GSP Plus facility. It was ill-advised to not implement the 2011 recommendations of the LLRC, a Commission which he himself appointed, to protect citizens from torture, criminalize disappearances, and fully investigate cases of human rights violations. In fact it was an injustice caused to the law abiding soldiers of this country as well. Having failed himself, and the people of our country, now in 2017, it is simply invidious to criticize a successful measure that the Government seeks to implement for the benefit of the people of our country.
We know very well how Rajapaksa and his advisors tried until the last minute to retain the GSP Plus facility in 2010, and lost. Licking their wounds, they then sought to lie to the people by saying that he decided to not pursue the facility, to avoid damage to the countrys political, legal and institutional framework. He probably still cant get over those lies. So he keeps repeating them in different formulations and words even seven years later in 2017.
For this government, the GSP Plus system is a partnership that helps our nation and our people regain their due place once again on the international stage as a respected nation and a respected people standing shoulder to shoulder with the international community, shedding the pariah tatters that the former government chose to put on our nation and our people. Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people deserve the best in the world. Sri Lanka is a proud nation and the Sri Lankan people are a proud people with the self-confidence to speak and act as equals with every country or group of countries in the world. We don't need to hide from global dialogue in order to feel better. On the contrary, we feel stronger when our laws reflect the best of global humanism, when our citizens benefit from the best law enforcement, when our workers and entrepreneurs see the ports of the world open to the fruit of their efforts.

Malays at Padang assist deserving Muslims during Ramadan
Muslims all over the world during the holy month of Ramadan, focus themselves in making as much charity towards the underprivileged as one of the key principles in their belief. In prayer, charity and avoiding behaviors that would hurt your fellow being are the cornerstones of this principle.
The Sri Lanka Malay Association established in 1922 celebrating its 95th year conducted its annual Zakat distribution on a larger scale to cover a wide cross section of the country from North, South, East and West. The program carried out every year was supported to reach a greater number of the less privileged. Dry ration packs were distributed to 130 needy households . In addition funds were provided to defray expenses for Iftar programs (arrangements for break fast) in remote villages consisting of 200 to 300 families which would last the fasting period. This program is conducted annually by the Religious Affairs and Janaza Committee of SLMA.
SLMA President Taslim Rahaman lauded the membership and well-wishers who supported the program and made it possible to serve a greater number this significant year. The SLMA the premier Malay institution in country in its quest to showcase the Malay culture carries out many activities annually. Consisting of approximately 0.5% of the Sri Lankan populace has gelled with the Sri Lankan culture and today many of its facets are a part of the Sri Lankan life style. This is observed in the variety of its cuisine, dress, and vocabulary. Its advent trace back to the 6th / 7th century.

Moves to guarantee administration officers rights
Measures will be taken to guarantee the professional rights and prestige of officers of the Public Administrative Service, said Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
He said, as the subject minister, he had tendered a cabinet paper to rectify these issues.
He was addressing the annual general meeting of the All Island Administration Officers Union.
Administration officers play a pivotal role in public administration but as the subject minister, I know that they face an issue with their professional rights and prestige, the minister said.
He said although he presented the Cabinet paper, the deprived rights of administration officers cannot be guaranteed only on its own.
However, the process has come to a standstill with the recommendations that has been made by the Finance Ministry, Minister Bandara said. Anyway, I would standby to win the rights of administrative officers.
He also said some public officers use their brawn rather than brain to get their problems solved. He added that some are doctors, employees of Water Board and Ceylon Electricity Board who attempt to take patients and consumers as hostage to get their things done. These are incidents where the humane aspect of the public service is diminishing, Minister Bandara said.
He pointed out that there are disparities in the public service. He added that an engineer of the Water Board and CEB gets a monthly payment of Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 300,000 while an engineer of the public service gets a salary of Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 80,000. The minister added that the government would take measures to solve these issues in public service.

Nishanthinis ordeal
The ordeal of a Sri Lankan housemaid who had gone 15 years without being paid her wages by her Saudhi employer is just one of the many cases of trauma and anguish forced to be endured by our women who leave our shores to seek the proverbial pot of gold in the West Asian countries. According to our front page news item is yesterdays edition Gnanapragasam Nishanthini of Eravur who had left for Saudhi Arabia in 2000 had been slaving at a house in Saudhi Arabia till 2015 in return for nothing. In desperation she had fled the home and sought refuge in a Welfare Centre maintained by the Sri Lankas Saudhi Embassy whereupon her plight was brought to the attention of Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale who succeeded is securing for her, her back wages amounting to Rs. 4.9 million (said to be the highest salary arrears received by an expatriate worker in the history of the foreign employment sector).
The Minister indeed should be commended for her endeavour in ensuring justice was done to Nashanthini, who, being a native of the North, would have sought employment abroad to escape the war, with the hope of collecting enough money to build a new home and provide for her family some day when peace dawns in the country. As mentioned, Nishanthinis is just one instance of what Sri Lankan women who seek menial jobs in the Middle East, driven by poverty, have to prepare against. Not that all our housemaids have been so unlucky. In a majority of cases they have struck it rich and have returned to the country to build new homes, equipped with brand new household goods and other semi luxury items which they only could have dreamed of when they left behind their humble abodes and pitiable belonging to seek greener pastures.
In this connection the late Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike should be commended for initially opening the doors of the West Asian job market for our women, following the Non-Aligned Summit, hosted by her government in 1976. The outflow of Sri Lanakan labour that began with the trickle transformed into a virtual exodus with advent of the liberal economy of the new UNP government which lent more opportunities for foreign employment. At the time it was a common sight to see returning Lankan women from their stints in the Middle East being conveyed in lines of cars or taxies from the airport to their destinations in the villages donned in imported outfits and other finery.
However on the other side of the coin there were also reports of our women being ill treated and even subjected to torture by their employers, with some even taking the drastic step of committing suicide unable to endure their grueling ordeals. There was a time when it was common to read of women who left for the Middle East returning in coffins at the airport. It is a matter for comfort that such incidents are rare today perhaps due to the fact that the export of housemaids are no longer encouraged by the government which has commenced programmes to offer skills and vocational training to those seeking jobs abroad, equipping them to be gainfully employed, earning a decent wage, but also keeping them out of harms way of predatory, sadistic employers to whom they would have been exposed to had they been sent as housemaids.
Considering that the government depends on our housemaids as the main source of its foreign exchange earnings, steps should be taken to look into their welfare and the future of their families. True, all budgets spell out such welfare programmes and subsidized schemes for our housemaids, but whether these are being implemented is extremely doubtful. Adequate measures should also be taken for the protection of our women employed in the Middle East. A special unit should be created in our Embassies to monitor the working conditions and to ensure a harassment free environment for them. The practise all along has been to come to their rescue after the damage is done, so to speak, by which time the employee concerned would have undergone much trauma and privations.
The dengue spectre
Dengue is on the march once again with nearly 60,000 cases reported island-wide and 150 deaths so far this year. As usual, the worst affected is the Western Province (25,279 cases) with 13,111 dengue afflicted reported from the Colombo district alone. The recent floods will no doubt exacerbate the situation and unless adequate preventive measures are taken, the outbreak of dengue in the affected areas will be of very serious proportions although Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has stated that so far no dengue epidemic had been reported in the flood hit areas. The Minister has also taken prompt action to rush in a vital drug in the treatment of dengue for which he was even commended by the GMOA. However the authorities should be prepared for any emergency given high risk nature associated with the areas that went under floods.

No need to deploy Army to curb hate crime - Defence Secretary
The need to deploy the Army to control hate crime has not arisen, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi said.
The Defence Secretary responding to a question at a press conference at the Defence Ministry auditorium said the tri-forces however were giving necessary support to Sri Lanka Police to maintain law and order in the country.
There is no urgency to deploy the Army. We have not received such a request either from the President or Police. Yes, the Police reports say there had been 16 incidents of racial violence, but many of them are minor incidents and some were related to personal disputes.They do not mean there is a major communal clash. As in any other country, we too have a few extremist groups and they are being dealt under the law, Hettiarachchi replied.
He was of the opinion that certain minor incidents were blown out of proportion by the media. The media should not add fuel to the communal flames, but try to douse them. The majority in this country do not condone the acts of those extremists he added.

Pakistan fined for slow over rate
Pakistan has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate against Sri Lanka during its last Group B fixture in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in Cardiff on Monday.
Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fine after Sarfraz Ahmeds side was ruled to be one over short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration.
In accordance with Article 2.5.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.
As such, Sarfraz has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee, while his players have received 10 per cent fines. Sarfraz pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.
If there is a second minor over-rate offence committed by Pakistan during the event with Sarfraz as captain, he will be suspended for one match.
The charge was laid by on-field umpires Bruce Oxenford and Marais Erasmus, third umpire Chris Gaffaney and fourth umpire Ian Gould.

RAIN,UNRULYRAIN
Rain, unruly rain, are you a friend or a foeFor days and months, you were hiding somewhereHow much we suffered we cannot explain.No water to drink, no water to cookNo water to wash  what a mess it was.Animals were roaming searching for waterPlants were withering, drooping they were.We all were praying watching the skiesYet you were deaf to all our prayers.Youve come back. Oh! What a blessing.But ...Whats going to happen,I began to wonder!From morn till night, you poured and pouredWithout a pause, without a break.Overflowing were the drains, flooded were the gardens.Please dont become so disastrous, I prayed.Are you punishing all of us,For the irreparable disasters, a few had committedWe know that our healthy forests,Were stripped off of their age-old trees,Flattened and levelled were the beautiful hills,To make way for skyscrapers.Brutally damaged were the river banksWith incessant, illegal sand mining.Mother Earth had bitterly criedSeeing her own children ruining her.Only a few are culprits, we knowYet, One bug bites: but all are killedDo we all have to sufferBecause of a few an unruly ones

Lonely
Not a soul to be seen,Can't understand what it means,Have to say it leads to fear,Fear that the end's very near.No human stepped in,Only cats searching the bin,The wind was so fearfully mild,Playing its tunes in the wild.Then again the nasty silence,None came to break the silence,I would've committed suicide in pain,If only I got out of being in vain.No face turned up to smile,I stopped breathing for a while,The falling leaves touched me kindly,To make me realise  that I was, after all; lonely.

Prelude to Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series 2017: The Fear Never Leaves You
Fear and safety  two major parts of cliff diving. The conditions on Portugals Azores islands are unforgiving  a pure cliff face with only a tiny ledge to take off from, you need to jump out and clear a few metres to meet the safe landing point, gusty winds might destabilise your handstand position high above the water, and the choppy sea can unexpectedly extend your flight or hit you sooner than you expect. Of course you are afraid, even when youre amongst the best in the world. Youre 27 metres above the sea and youll flip and twist your way down to the concrete-like water in the next three seconds. In this moment, fear is a cliff divers best friend.
Looking at the platform, my heart beats faster, my hands sweat, the body reacts immediately, its telling you to relax, explains cliff diving legend Orlando Duque, that fear is good, I like it. It helps me focus, it helps me concentrate. Reading this it becomes obvious that fear is part of this sport that involves diving acrobatically from great heights. Fear never leaves you, says rookie Jonathan Paredes, who knows what hes talking about. No training in Ireland, no training in Portugal, only diving during competition.
Why Everything is better under pressure. I know I have to do my dives in the competition, there is no option. The 24-year-old Mexican is not the exception to the rule in the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, but one of the best in the elite group of athletes. For these daring men, fear is a natural instinct that causes the organism to seek safety and may cause a release of adrenaline. Psychologically, this has the effect of increased strength and heightened senses such as hearing, smell, and sight. Never lose your focus, sense everything around you and be aware of the changing conditions. Even triple World Series champion Gary Hunt has to go through an inner conflict before each dive: When you are on the end of the board everything in your body is telling you to stop doing it, you have so many doubts, your mind is just saying you dont need to do that dive, why are you doing this dive, and its a real difficult challenge to not listen to those voices and to just tell yourself to go.
So what gives these athletes the confidence to launch from the equivalent of an eight-storey building over and over again, pushing the limits of the sport to new heights Its more or less two factors that support the athletes in overcoming their fear  experience and the safety precautions. Unlike in regular diving, where youre mostly indoors in a controlled environment, cliff diving challenges the athletes anew at every location. You need to be able to adapt really quick, you have to be able to make changes and that only comes with experience. After learning and feeling that speed of the fall, being able to react faster, being able to finish the dive a little bit faster, that comes from repetition, from doing so many. Its something that only comes over time, says Colombian Duque.
After almost 20 years in the sport, hes come to appreciate a rock-solid platform; something the World Series sports director, Niki Stajkovic, tries to provide to the satisfaction of his athletes. Another fact is a whole team of experienced scuba divers waiting for the divers in the water. Always ready to help in case something goes wrong. They are the first ones who have contact with me when I have a bad landing.
They are the first people I see and I can just show them help me, come to me, hold me, describes Michal Navratil, from the Czech Republic, the first thing on the platform is I look down and see those guys waiting for me.
Every diver learns to put previous accidents behind them because otherwise we would not be able to go up there and do it. Once you start thinking about accidents and what could happen on the platform its very hard to take off, says Gary Hunt, for whom putting mistakes in the back of his mind is a real challenge. And the best strategy to correct things like the loss of orientation or bad landings is to take the dive apart, and figure out what happened. Then go straight back up on the platform and try again, says Orlando Duque.
For those who play the game of cliff diving successfully, fear is an essential part of their professional lives, no matter what dive they do, simple or difficult. Theres a certain amount of fear that you take with you up on the platform, concludes Gary Hunt, the most successful athlete in the World Series to date, but knowing what a great feeling it is doing a successful dive makes me get off of the platform.

President built SLFP second, third tier leadership: Amaraweera
Late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike built up several prominent figures in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to take over the party leadership after him.
Ever since, President Maithripala Sirisena is the only party leader, who has built up a second and third tier leadership in the SLFP suitable to takeover the party mantle, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. He was addressing a meeting held at Middeniya on June 11.
The Minister said the SLFP has several leaders in its front-line along with President Sirisena. They are Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, W.D.J. Seneviratne, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadharshana Yapa. The second tier leadership in the SLFP includes Duminda Disanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene, Dilan Pererra, Vijayamuni Soysa, Dayasiri Jayasakera and Peshala Jayaratne. Several youth leaders were also being built up in the SLFP today including Anuradha Jayaratne and Taranath Basnayake. Many other young parliamentarians were also contributing towards the effort to steer the SlFP forward, Amaraweera said.
Today the SLFP was moving forward from strength to strength. Another section was clamouring to break up the SLFP. History proved that those who tried to divide the SLFP were always doomed. No one would be allowed to break up the SLFP. The ordinary masses loved and followed the SLFP like a religion, he said.
The UNP-SLFP consensus government was able to restore within two years the image of the country which had earlier been relegated to pariah status. The government was able to gain many other victories for the country including the GSP plus facility.
The country today had no enemies because all countries treated it as a friend, he said.
Minister Amaraweera said he believed that the UNP-SlFP partnership would continue for the next four years too on the strength of the victories it gained to date.
He said his role as the UFPA General Secretary was to foster unity among all its partners.

Proteas no one to blame but themselves
South Africa has earned the tag of chokers for no other reason than failing to perform on the big stage. Their recent fall from grace was in the ongoing ICC Champions trophy in England where they folded without a fight in a crucial Group B match to hand to defending champions India a comfortable eight-wicket win with 12 overs to spare at the Oval. It was one more instance where South Africa has been knocked out of another global event. On this occasion South Africa had no one to blame but themselves for their shoddy performance. It was a must win game for both teams and everyone expected South Africa, the current number one ranked ODI side to come out with all guns blazing against India. But what we saw was a comedy of errors.
Within five balls of each other South Africa who was comfortably placed at 139-2 lost two crucial wickets to run outs that turned the game in Indias favour. Skipper AB de Villiers was run out responding to Faf du Plessis call and immediately afterwards three runs later David Miller, one of the hardest hitters in one-day cricket also followed his captain when he found himself at the same end as Du Plessis. South Africa never recovered from these stupid dismissals and to add insult to injury they suffered a third run out that ended the innings at 191 in 44.3 overs when Imran Tahir was also dismissed short of his crease. It was an awful batting display by one of the best batting teams in the world.
Over the years South Africa have been at the receiving end of so many global cricket events that finds this rainbow nation with only one victory in an ICC conducted tournament  that is in the inaugural Champions Trophy held in Bangladesh in 1998 where they beat West Indies in the final by four wickets under the captaincy of the late Hansie Cronje. We all know what an incredible team South Africa is and how much they have contributed to world cricket. They have given us some mind blowing players like Allan Donald, Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock, Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers to name a few.
But their chequered history has been replete with performances that have given them the tag of perennial chokers in major tournaments having lost all seven of their knockout matches in ICC tournaments over the past 22 years.
Here are some of the matches which led them to earn the title chokers:
l 1992 World Cup semi-final vs. England:
SA needed 22 of 13 balls when it started to rain and the D/L method came into action. When play resumed, South Africa were given an impossible target of 22 from 1 ball. Technically not their fault but it all started from here.
l 1996 World Cup quarterfinal vs. West Indies:
South Africa needed 265 to win from 50 overs. They started off well and were cruising at 186/3. But they lost the next 8 wickets for 59 runs and with it the match. South Africa had won all 10 ODIs prior to this match and on form the target was gettable. But they choked.
l 1999 World Cup semi-final vs. Australia:
South Africa needed 9 runs off the final over. The first two balls were hit for 4s by Lance Klusener and they needed one run off 4 balls. But there was a horrific misunderstanding in running between the wickets between Klusener and last man Allan Donald that led to a dramatic run out which resulted in a tie and South Africas exit from the tournament.
l 2003 World Cup group match vs. Sri Lanka:
Another rain interrupted match for South Africa. They did some horrible calculations with regard to the Duckworth/Lewis method and Mark Boucher, the man on strike got the wrong message. He hit a six off the penultimate ball of a Muthiah Muralitharan over and punched the air thinking they are ahead of D/L method. He just played the last ball down casually and didnt score a run. When play was stopped according to the D/L method the match was tied. Sri Lanka went through to the Super Six. South Africa lost because of its own mistakes, said Frank Duckworth who devised the rain rule with fellow-mathematician Tony Lewis. Both Shaun Pollock and Sanath Jayasuriya had the same papers with the run-rates. Sanath read it right and Shaun didnt.
l 2007 World Cup semi-final vs. Australia:
South Africa managed only 149 runs and Australia scored them inside 32 overs to win by seven wickets.
l 2011 World Cup quarterfinal vs. New Zealand:
Chasing 222, South Africa were well placed at 108/2 but again collapsed like a pack of cards, losing 8 wickets for 64 runs to be bundled out for 172.
l 2015 World Cup semi-final vs. New Zealand:
In another rain affected match South Africa scored a defendable 281-5 of 43 overs. According to D/L, New Zealand needed 298 from 43 overs. South Africa stayed in the match till the last over. New Zealand needed 6 of the last 2 balls. Grant Elliot hit a six off Dayle Steyn for New Zealand to win with one ball to spare.
When South Africa can get this unfortunate monkey off their back only time will tell. But for the moment they will have to live with it.

Public ultimate victim of bailouts - Samaratunga
The government stands only to safeguard the greater interest and stability of the financial system, not each and individual depositors interest irrespective of their mysterious conduct or imprudent risk taking behavior, Secretary to the Treasury and Ministry of Finance R.H.S Samaratunga said.
Delivering the keynote speech at the 22nd convocation of Institute of Bank of Sri Lanka, held in BMICH, last week, Samaratunga noted that Sri Lanka has been confronted with number of financial frauds and is still struggling to resolve or avert any possible crisis.
Such crisis and failures can be taken your lifetime or hard-earned wealth overnight. When there is a crisis, people always tend to blame the government and ask for bailouts. If the government is to bailout the risk takers when they lose money, the rest of the public should be prepared to pay in two different ways, by paying additional taxes or foregoing existing government services.
Risk is the possibility of losing money;, he said, adding that at the same time money is an asset that gives a return in various ways, in various amounts.
Samaratunga stressed that banks and financial service providers need to be mindful of managing risks of money, businesses, and various other industry related things. According to him, all stakeholders of the financial system must play their role to keep the system stable.
Depositors, borrowers, investors,board of directors, shareholders, employees, auditors and regulators are the stakeholders for the system. They together keep the system stable assisted by governments policy support, he said.
Samaratunga further noted that no government will or can compromise the role of these stakeholders.

Qatar Airways urges UN action against Gulf blockade
QATAR: Qatar Airways on Monday called on the UNs aviation body to declare a Gulf boycott against the carrier illegal and a violation of a 1944 convention on international air transport.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt this month announced they had suspended ties with Qatar over the emirates alleged support for extremists, banning all flights to and from the capital Doha and shutting down the offices of the countrys national carrier.
The four countries have also granted Qatari nationals two weeks to repatriate and barred Qataris from transiting through their airports.
In televised interviews on Monday, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker called the move an illegal blockade and urged the United Nations civil aviation branch to intervene.
The International Civil Aviation Organization should heavily get involved, put their weight behind this to declare this an illegal act, he told CNN Money.
Baker said the move was in violation of the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, charged with overseeing and regulating international aviation.
Saudi Arabia is not a signatory to the convention. In an interview with Al-Jazeera English, Baker also came down hard on US President Donald Trump, whose country has been a longtime ally of Qatar. We expect our friends to stand up with us in this unfair, illegal blockade conducted by four countries, the CEO told Al-Jazeera. I want the American people to realize that they are trying to intimidate a small country which has the closest relation with the United States, Baker said.
I think that President Trumps comment about my country is ill-placed, ill-informed, and I can again repeat that Im very disappointed in him.
Trump on Sunday accused Qatar of bankrolling extremists, throwing his weight behind Saudi Arabia and its allies in the worst crisis to grip the Gulf in years. As part of the measures against Qatar, Al-Jazeera has also been blocked in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. - AFP

Sarfraz hopes Cardiff run continues in England semis
Cardiff: Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed hopes the teams high confidence in Cardiff will stand them in good stead when they return to the Welsh capital to face England in a Champions Trophy semi-final on Wednesday.
It will be Pakistans second key match at Sophia Gardens in a matter of days after a tense three-wicket victory over Sri Lanka there on Monday saw them into the last four of a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international (ODI) sides.
Pakistan, chasing a seemingly modest 237 for victory, were on the brink of defeat at 137 for six.
But Sarfraz made Sri Lanka pay for dropping him twice with a superb 61 not out and received excellent support from Mohammad Amir (28 not out) in a decisive and unbroken eighth-wicket stand of 75.
It was Sarfrazs second impressive innings at Cardiff after the wicket-keepers 90 on the same ground last year saw Pakistan chase down a target of 303 against England in a four-wicket win that prevented a 5-0 ODI series whitewash.
We played the last ODI here. We win that time, we chased 300, so definitely our confidence is very high playing in Cardiff, Sarfraz told reporters after Mondays nailbiting triumph.
Positive cricket
England, however, have arguably improved their white-ball game even more since that series.
Theyve won 11 of their last 12 matches at this level, a far cry from their woeful first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup, and Eoin Morgans men were the only side to exit the group stage of the Champions Trophy with a perfect played three, won three, record.
England is a very good team, a very, very good team, said Sarfraz of the tournament hosts.
If you are playing a world-class team, definitely, you play more positive cricket, so we will do so against England, he added.
But Sri Lanka might well have won had they dismissed Sarfraz, with Thisara Perera guilty of dropping a simple catch at mid-on when he had made 38.
If we had held those catches, it would have been a different story, said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
Pakistan certainly made far harder work than they ought to have done of getting to the knockout stage in a winner-takes-all clash given they held Sri Lanka to 236 all out, with pacemen Junaid Khan (three for 40) and Hasan Ali (three for 43) doing the bulk of the damage.
I think its a great win today, and credit goes to the bowlers, who bowled really well at a crucial time, said Sarfraz.
Yes, there is a little bit of concern about the middle order batting, but we will sort out the problems.
A two-day turnaround does not leave much time to address such issues but, then again, Pakistan only needed three days to bounce back from a 124-run thrashing by arch-rivals and title-holders India in their tournament opener before defeating top-ranked South Africa.
Roy worry
If Pakistan have middle-order concerns, the big decision facing England is whether to drop opener Jason Roy, whose latest low score against Australia means he has now managed just 51 runs in eight ODI innings this season.
Morgan, previously unstinting in his praise of Surrey batsman Roy, was not quite so effusive after a win at Edgbaston on Sunday where England slumped to 35 for three before their captains 87 and Ben Stokess 102 not out bailed them out, with the duo sharing a stand of 159.
Its unfortunate that Jason didnt get runs, said Morgan.
We revisit it every game, everybodys position, whether it can be changed around, can we do anything better
England do have the in-form Jonny Bairstow waiting in the wings.
Although he has never opened in ODIs, Bairstow did make 174 at the top of the order for Yorkshire against Durham in a domestic 50-over match this season.
Roy apart, England appear to have all bases covered as they go in search of their first major ODI tournament title, with key fast bowler Mark Wood summing up their mood by saying: Its great to be part of a team with so many game-changers ... so many match-winners, with bat or ball. AFP

Saudi Arabia has denied barring Qatar nationals from entering the holy city of Mecca.
It confirmed that 206 people coming from Qatar were allowed to cross the Salwa border on June 9 so that they could perform Umrah pilgrimage in Mecca, Xinhua news agency reported.
The Saudi authority that supervises the affairs of the two grand mosques in Mecca and Medina confirmed in a statement that it provides services for pilgrims from all countries of the world, including Qatar, describing circulated news in social media as baseless accusations.
According to Al Arabiya, several media outlets reported on Sunday that Qataris were denied access into Mecca and the two grand mosques, which Saudi Arabia has refused.
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Yemen, Libya, the Maldives, Mauritius and Mauritania last week severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism.
Saudi officials also declared that it would provide all facilities and services needed by Qatari pilgrims currently in the kingdom. (First Post)

Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana with Counsel M. Thilakaratne appearing on behalf of the petitioners had informed Court that the history of the Pannipitiya Bo-Tree runs back to about 400 years and the story of its origin has been passed by word through generations of the people of Pannipitiya.
The petitioners stated that in 2015, the RDA tried to cut down the Bo-Tree to develop the High-level Road and the move was defeated by public protests.
The petitioners said the Bo-Tree has its own history and has become part of the tradition and culture of the Buddhists and practices relating to Buddhism.
Cutting down or removal of the Bo-Tree shall deprive culture and religious rights of us and the other Buddhists in the country, violating Article 12(1) (2), 14(1)(e)(f) of the Constitution. Cutting down or removal of the Bo-Tree would violate the Constitutional responsibility of the State to protect and foster Buddha Sasana and give the foremost place to Buddhism as provided in Article 9 of the Constitution, the petitioners said.
The Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with the petition and fixed the matter for argument on January 24. The respondents were directed to file their objections within three weeks.
Senior State Counsel Awanthi Perera appeared for the Attorney General.

Shakespeares dramas: Heart in flowers and soul in their Brilliance
So colossal were their impact on all his plays, poetry and prose that made other poets appear dull and listless when nature in her glory offered the best of all four seasons so much so that even winter had little flowers peering through crevices in search of daylight only to die upon winter blast but not before Shakespeare caught a glimpse of them. He was able to appreciate their contribution in some small way.
Over twenty-nine scenes containing flowers and foliage are found in his writing adding so much beauty and character upon his wondrous writings.
He was such an accurate observer never missing any detail as to their individuality that made him a natural botanist. Botany, pollination, horticulture and plant maintenance were never heard of during his lifetime nor were the study of plants that made him the starter to give impetus to people about planting and caring for them that made it a huge international industry, employing thousands of workers worldwide for research and commercial purposes and countries like England and Japan leading the way with flowers for occasions, churches, wedding etc., Today it is a booming industry.
He was by birth and instinct a countryman and raised in the native Warwickshire among the rising cliffs and valleys and pastoral scenes, watching the wonders of the changing seasons along with the environment that made early impressions in his young mind he carried through to his writings. His parents from both sides belonged to farming families and not far from his birthplace, Stratford - upon - Avon which at that time was a little market town.
It linked the River Avon the poet cherished, holding back memories with snow-white gliding swans beside the open fields and pastures. As he grew up in the freshness of the rural and left behind Stratford when London beckoned him where he made his fortune and name as a poet, Shakespeare remained the man from the native village that divided the Arden woodlands and forests. Very often he wandered in the land at Welcomed on her rising ground looking beyond the river valley and perhaps made his fortune as playwright and part owner of the Globe Theatre.
He excelled his exquisite expressions of varied emotions linking many a character to each other that became his powerful signature we were to study two centuries later in our classrooms. Look at the romantic settings he used in AS YOU LIKE IT with the lush freshness of the Avon Meadows and the wooded landscape of the Arden forest clearly display Shakespeares inspiration from nature as no other would have.
The drowning Ophelia has left an indelible impression in our minds clinging to flowers, garlanding herself and her hair which later became the subject for iconic painters to put her on canvas, paintings fetching millions of pounds for originals.
PANSIES: No one knows why the Bard loved this small wildflower so much as to christen it with more names such as Heartsease and Love-in-idleness and feature it in Hamlet, The Taming of the Shrew as well as in A Midsummer Nights Dream. One reason can be that they came in abundance in the fields of Warwickshire dressed in purple, yellow and white throughout Spring and Summer. Many of the modern varieties of the pansy is derived from the wild pansies of Shakespeares time. In Hamlet, he says;-
And there is Pansies, thats for thoughts
DAFFODILS: Symbolises the joy of youth as spoken by Autolycus and Perdita. They convey the freshness of Spring and the glory of March, found in woodlands and meadows as Shakespeare describe them in Winters Tale,:
When daffodils begin to peer,
With hey, the doxy over the dale,
Why then comes in the sweets o the year
For the red blood reigns in the winter pale:
LILIES: For the most part of his works where the Bard had to use flowers for description, lilies and roses took priority, the former being very close to his heart as he put life into many of the characters. Shakespeare many have influenced the rose to become the national flower of England.
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet..
Is wasteful and ridiculous.
OXLIPS: When poet wanted to suggest the tall confident character of a player, he opted to use the brilliance found in Oxlips which closely resemble Cowslip that is found in Warwickshire during Spring. He best describes them IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM:
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where Oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quiet over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-rose, and with eglantine.
There sleeps Titania sometime of night,
Lulled in these flowers with dance and delight
The cowslip blooms in early spring particularly on wayside verge that the poet would have seen in every spring of his life. The song Ariel sings would have merged from the old pastures, now set to nursery rhyme which I still remember clearly and hum without missing a word:
Where the bee sucks, there suck I
In a cowslips bell I lie.
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bats back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Beautiful and simple and are these not wonders of a childs world of imagination that Shakespeare wrote for them with flying bats, sleeping fairies, crying owls surrounded by nature and her flowers of spring. I can count up to twenty-five flowers named by the poet across his plays and they are all found in the woodlands of Warwickshire during the four seasons and belong to the Bard, I suppose. The ones used in the article are Pansies, Daffodils, Lilies and Oxlips and their photographs original.
For children, he was a favourite in the only play written from them. In TEMPEST, he uses the cowslip where Ariel would curl and lie, denoting their Size.

The weekly yoga session at the resort is another most looked forward event and many staffers were seen participating in the session on Global Wellness Day. The musical chants, the setting sun and cool breeze caressed body and soul, leaving us at total peace and contentment. What a wonderful wellness day..!
