Government should not follow its predecessor
While accusing the former regime of using the human rights issue as a political tool, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna yesterday said that the government should not follow the footsteps of its predecessor.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said that although the protection of human rights was the government's responsibility, the rulers should not use the prevailing debate on the issue to stifle the economic issues faced by the people.
While providing an adequate solution to the human rights issue, the government should also bring immediate relief to the burning economic issues faced by the country and the people.
Silva, meanwhile, blamed the former Rajapaksa regime for opening doors for a possible intervention in the country's domestic affairs.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime engaged in serious human rights violations after the war while destroying democratic institutions. In addition they used the issue as a political tool. At every election Rajapaksa requested people to vote for him to send a strong message to the international community and save him from the electric chair, Silva said.
Silva charged that the Rajapaksa regime also had meddled with the affairs of the country's judiciary and shattered the trust placed upon this key institution.
He said the former regime had also repeatedly given false promises to the UN and the international community.
Through all these Silva said that the former regime had opened doors for an international intervention in the country's domestic affairs.
On the resolution adopted in Geneva, Silva went on to say that although it has been watered down, the proposals still called for foreign intervention in Sri Lankas domestic affairs.
There are some clauses we can accept but there are some we should not take in, he added.
Silva said that the JVP feels a revamped local judiciary was fully capable of handling a credible domestic investigation and subsequent prosecutions.
The JVP Secretary insisted, it was important to ensure justice to victims of human rights abuses but added that this should be through a fully owned domestic mechanism sans foreign intervention.

Hameed Abdul Karim:
A people - friendly man with a golden heart
A reason to write a second appreciation on the demise of someone close to your heart, should not happen to anyone within a space of one month. In August, I wrote on the demise of my brother in law, Prof. Uditha Liyanage and in September I am writing this with a heavy heart on Hameed Karim who was a very close friend for nearly 40 years.
I met Hameed for the first time at a Jaycee meeting at the then Hotel Ceylon Inns at Wellawatta in the mid 70s. He greeted me as if we had known each other for ages and this was the start of our friendship. Since then, I have been a regular visitor to his house at Hampden Lane and lately at Saranankara Road, and he to my residence, where we spent hours in friendly banter.
Hameed was a live wire at any gathering and his public relations kept everybody happy and part of the works.
To describe him, two words would suffice. A "good man" . A good man - a simple, unpretentious, well read, articulate, fun loving, people friendly man with a golden heart.
He was a prolific writer who had an excellent command of the language and expounded views on public interest, governance, the cause of Palestine, Islam and politics. We had contradictory views on some matters and he would listen and try to understand the issue without any prejudices.
He was not into communal politics and throughout his life supported national political parties where all communities were present. He despised political parties based on ethnicity. Yet he worked for the betterment of his community and made people understand Islam. He knew where to draw the line. Hameed had the opportunity to mingle and closely associate with the political elite including the highest of the country, but he never expected or obtained any personal gain from them. It was for the cause that he worked and nothing else.
He was happy with his two wheels which kept him on the move and his house, but nothing more. He was a contended man. His two daughters Nabia and Huda were his treasures and the new addition to the family made him immensely proud.
Yasmin his wife took good care of him, sometimes being the mother figure to him. He had his points and I had mine and those bonded us for nearly 40 years.
He has gone to the world beyond, performing Hajj, a religious obligation and had a noble death. Our thoughts are with him and we as a family will miss him here on Earth.

Australia shooting 'an act of terrorism'- PM
AUSTRALIA: Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Saturday that a Sydney attack in which a 15-year-old gunman shot dead a civilian police employee appeared to have been an act of terrorism.
Police said the teen, who they did not name, was shot dead in an exchange of fire with officers after he killed finance worker Curtis Cheng at close range outside the New South Wales force's headquarters in western Sydney on Friday.
Reports said that the youth, who police said was of Iraqi-Kurdish background and had been born in Iran, had been shouting religious slogans before shooting Cheng in the back of the head.
"I saw him pacing up and down at police headquarters with a gun above his head, he was yelling something and dressed in a black robe," one witness told Sydney's Daily Telegraph.
Turnbull called on Australians to go about their lives as usual as they begin a long weekend in which two major sporting finals will be held in Sydney and Melbourne.
"This appears to have been an act of politically motivated violence so at this stage it appears to have been an act of terrorism. It is a shocking crime," the prime minister said in Melbourne.
"It was a cold-blooded murder, targeting the New South Wales Police Service. It was doubly shocking because it was perpetrated by a 15-year-old boy.
"And it underlines the importance of families, communities, leaders being very aware of whether young people are becoming radicalised," he said.
Andrew Scipione, the police commissioner for the state of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, told reporters that investigators were a "long way" from establishing what exactly prompted the attack, adding that the boy had no criminal history.
Australia has stepped up its efforts in countering the risk of extremist attacks, lifting its terror threat alert to high a year ago, and Scipione said police were aware they could be targeted.
In September 2014, Melbourne police shot dead a "known terror suspect" who stabbed two officers, just one day after the Islamic State group called for Muslims to indiscriminately kill Australians.
And in December, Iranian-born self-styled cleric Man Haron Monis and two hostages were killed following a 17-hour siege at a central Sydney cafe. - AFP

Australia will get better, Cheika warns World Cup rivals
Australia will get better as the World Cup goes on, coach Michael Cheika said as the Wallabies celebrated knocking old rivals England out of the tournament.
But Cheika acknowledged the tournament will not get any easier as Australia next play Wales. He described Wales boss Warren Gatland as a "master coach."
Australia outclassed England in virtually every area on Saturday night to guarantee their place in the quarter finals.
The 33-13 score was their biggest winning margin over England at Twickenham. Fly-half Bernard Foley's 28-point haul was the highest by an Australian against England.
Cheika insisted there is room for improvement before the Wallabies return to Twickenham next Saturday to face Wales to see who tops Pool A, the so-called "Pool of Death". Australia have beaten Wales 10 times in a row but their coach said a new victory was not assured.
"It is just about ourselves at the moment and trying to improve on that," said Cheika.
"We are coming up against the master coach (Gatland) next week. I'm not going to change what I do because we won a game."
Cheika, the only coach to have guided sides to victory in the northern hemisphere's European Cup and the southern hemisphere's Super Rugby, said: "There are a lot of areas we can improve on."
"The commitment was very good and we will improve on that going forward. "We really wanted it, to win and to play well. We knew there would be a lot of pain in England's backyard. "It was outrageously loud (at Twickenham) and we wanted to get stuck in from the start."
Scrum success
Australia were overpowered at the scrum in losing their last two Tests at Twickenham. But they forced a number of scrum penalties on Saturday and Cheika praised the work of Argentine forwards coach Mario Ledesma.

Britain will double drone fleet - Cameron
UK: Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday he will double Britain's drone fleet and warned about the prospect of Britain's exit from the European Union.
Cameron said the government would purchase 20 "Protector" drones and spoke confidently about the prospects of a parliamentary vote to join air strikes targeting the Islamic State group in Syria.
He said Britain's fleet of 10 "Reapers" would be replaced by 20 new models as part of the country's 2015 Defence Review.
"This will be combined with increasing the capacity of our special forces, so that the country remains ready to address any threats to our nation's security," he said in a statement.
The Protectors, to be imported from the United States, can be used as surveillance craft but can also be armed, the Ministry of Defence said Sunday.
More drones will "keep us safe and... give us the intelligence and information and potentially give us the capacity to hit people who are potentially planning to hit us", he told the Sunday Telegraph.
Cameron announced last month that a Royal Air Force drone strike killed two British Islamic State jihadists and another militant in the group's stronghold of Raqa in August.
In his first newspaper interview since winning a May general election, Cameron also spoke about his negotiations with fellow European leaders about EU reforms.
He described the talks as "bloody hard work".
"I think the right answer is for Britain to stay in a reformed European Union," he said.
"But I've always said if we don't get those things that we are asking for I rule nothing out and I am very serious about that," he added.
Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on whether Britain should stay in or leave the EU by 2017 at the latest but has said he wants to renegotiate its terms of membership.
He has said he will push for broad changes including protecting sovereignty, opting out of the EU's commitment to "ever closer union", limiting access to benefits for migrants, and boosting competitiveness.
The interview comes ahead of the annual conference of Cameron's Conservative Party on Sunday in Manchester, where a major rally by trade unionists and anti-austerity campaigners is also expected.

Bully-Proofing Kids
Books about Self- Confidence, Empathy and Compassion
Kids may say the darndest things, but left to their own devices they also say some of the meanest. If yours has even the tiniest flaw or any characteristic that makes them remotely different (and, assuming you had a human child, welcome to the club, kid), chances are theyll have to face some bully who hasnt yet learned that nobody thinks theyre funny. Since you already know that helicopter parenting definitely doesnt work, youve got to at least try and prepare them for real life. Read them these 9 books and theyll never have to Houdini their way out of their locker.
Enemy Pie
A bully named Jeremy Ross moves into the neighborhood and forces the narrator to craft his first Enemies List. Summer is ruined until dad comes up with the perfect plan: Enemy Pie. The one catch: no dessert until youve spent a full day with your enemy, which teaches the ultimate lesson in making friends. Thats predictable, but at least it doesnt end the same way as Cartmans Enemy Chili.
The Hundred Dresses
Since 1945, Eleanor Estes Newbery Honor classic has been the gold standard for making kids feel horrible about being such wretched little jerks. If you love your child but suspect they might be just a bit of a dick, read them the story of how bad Maddie feels after her classmate, Wanda Petronski, is forced to skip town due to the other girls merciless teasing. They ought to take it easy on you after that.
Bully
While calling a hen CHICKEN! or telling a skunk, YOU STINK! might technically be just as literal as it is mean, this bull is definitely being a total punk to every animal on the farm. The bull (and his ego) grow with every insult he spews until a goat calls him out  BULLY!  which is again both literal and insulting, and he deflates, because he just got owned by a goat.
Spaghetti In A Hot Dog Bun
When the tables are turned and Ralph the bully needs help, Lucy steps up, because Lucy trusts her values even after suffering endless taunts about her curly locks and unique sandwich preferences (which, incidentally, a very real, very successful person impossibly shares). Lucy becomes a leader among her peers by being confident in herself and remembering, as her grandfather says, What a boring world it would be if we were exactly alike.
Confessions Of A Former Bully
Through weekly meetings, a patient school counselor named Mrs. Petrowski (which has to be an homage to The Hundred Dresses) helps a bully named Katie (which is probably just a coincidence to Mean Girls) see the error of her ways. The story unfolds as if Katie is narrating journal entries of those meetings in a style youll find familiar if your kid likes the Wimpy Kid series (which they definitely do).
Eddie Longpants
Eddie gets ruthlessly tormented for his enormous stature by a little twit named Pete who apparently hasnt learned yet that NBA players get paid extremely well. When Pete finds himself up a tree without a ladder, its Eddie who comes to his aid. Hes the bigger man after all. Zing! Presumably, this experience helped Eddie to grow as a person and live a happy productive life in Springfield.
The Juice Box Bully
These books have covered dealing with your bully and avoiding becoming one, but not what to do if you witness bullying. The bystander is the focus of The Juice Box Bully and The Promise Petes classmates teach him when he starts acting a fool. Make sure your kid is the one who speaks up when they see unacceptable behavior like bullying or wearing socks with sandals. Sorry, you needed to know.
The Tease Monster
After finishing The Tease Monster, your child will know the difference between laughing at someone (bullying) and laughing with someone (teasing). Once theyre armed with this knowledge, all your hilarious jokes about them will have to wait until after theyve fallen asleep .
Llama Llama And Bully Goat
If you have a kid whos new to school, Llama Llama has a few rhyming quips they can use to diffuse any potential new kid bullying scenarios, and even get everyone to be friends again by recess. Alternatively, you can teach them just to hold out until sweet, sweet nap time.

Clear skin strategy
In todays Beauty Talk Hasini Gunasekera shares her top beauty tips on how to keep your skin spotless and blemish-free.
Q: What is pigmentation
A: Dark spots, age spots, sun spots whatever it is called it is pigmentation.
Uneven complexion mostly dark brown patches seen around the cheeks, face and sometimes even around the shoulders are called pigmentation.
Ageing dark spots caused by sun exposure (and specifically the UVA rays which penetrate deep into your skin and cause ageing) are also known as pigmentation. UVA stimulates your pigment cells called Melanocytes to manufacture the pigment called Melanin. This is responsible for your tan and also your unwanted dark patches. This is not an immediate reaction, rather shows after a few years of sun exposure. Pigmentation in young women also may be due to pregnancy which alters hormone levels.
You can prevent future pigmentation and sun damage by wearing a UVA and UVB shielding sunscreen and feeding your face with antioxidants (primarily fruits and veggies).

Q: Is there a home remedy to get rid of it
A: Potatoes:
It is a good source to prevent a range of skin pigmentation problems such as melasma, dark circles, hyper and hypo pigmentation. As potatoes can lighten the skin with continuous application, slice or grate a potato and squeeze the juice of medium size potato and rub it on the skin pigmentation area or leave it applied for half an hour. And rinse with water. Doing it regularly will have a noticeable difference.
Lemon and Cucumber
These two are also a great skin lightening agents. So applying a few drops of lemon and cucumber juice every day on affected area will give you desired results. To get best result apply twice a day, morning and evening. Leave for 20 minutes and wash it off your with water.

Q: What should be the best criteria to select sunscreen
A: A sun screen at least must contain the following two features;
SPF 15 or higher for UVB protection: The SPF factor rates how effective the sunscreen is in preventing sunburn caused by UVB rays. If you'd normally burn in 10 minutes, SPF 15 multiplies that by a factor of 15, meaning you could go 150 minutes before burning.Water and sweat resistance: If you're going to be exercising or in the water, it's best to get a sunscreen resistant to water and sweat.

Q: Will applying sunscreen on acne skin worsen the condition
A: In short, yes its possible to worsen your acne condition, but it really depends on the type of sun screen youre applying to your skin. Look for not oil-free, but non-comedogenic sun screens which means that the product is designed not to clog your pores and then cause further irritation, pimples, and blemishes.

Q: How to get rid of dark skin on your neck A home remedy
A: Many people suffer the embarrassment of having dark skin patches around their neck. This is a fairly common skin pigmentation disorder mainly caused due to aging and sun exposure. Other causes are diabetes, genetics, polycystic ovary syndrome, poor hygiene, and sudden weight loss or weight gain.
Make a thick paste of powdered almonds, milk powder and honey, leave it on skin for half hour and wash it clean. Best to apply it twice or thrice a week.

Q: If you have acne/ problem skin what food should be avoided
A: Cut back on pasta, white rice, white bread, and sugar also avoiding hormone-laden dairy products, meats, chocolate, french fries, and other junk foods.

Q: What food should be consumed by acne prone people Please name.
A: Food is only about 25% of the picture when it comes to acne, The other 75% is influenced by hormones, stress, sleep levels, and good skin care also plays a role such as exercise and drinking enough water. A balanced diet is also extremely important.

Q: What is the best time of the day to eat fruits Theres a recently emerged medical view that fruits should not be eaten soon after meals What is your view as a beautician
A: Fruit should be eaten alone or with other fruit on an empty stomach.
This is because when fruit is eaten, the digestive process works very quickly and our body uses different enzymes to digest the fruit. The simple sugars contained in fruit need time to be completely absorbed by your body. When fruits are eaten alone, your stomach can more easily process all of the nutrients, fibre and the simple sugars contained in the fruit. This is the best way to benefit from the fruit you eat.

Q: A beauty tip for this week please
A: Have a fresh tomato a day to maintain beautiful and youthful skin.
Tomatoes are filled with riches when it comes to their antioxidant benefits. Tomatoes provide an excellent amount of vitamin C and beta-carotene; a very good amount of the mineral manganese and a good amount of vitamin E.

Tips for growing vegetable plants in your backyard
1) Start small and plant things you'd really like to eat.
2) Pick a spot with at least 6 hours of good daytime light and access to water.
3) Make your own compost
4)Consider using a raised garden bed, which allows you to control the soil and nutrient blend.
5)Talk to other backyard gardeners in your area to get a sense of what grows well in your region and when.

Can you guess who said this
On March 20, 2009, I was like any other hopeful gardener with a pot out on the windowsill or a small plot by the back door. I was nervously watching the sky. Would it freeze Would it rain I had spent two months settling into a new house in a new city. My girls had started a new school; my husband, a new job. My mother had just moved in upstairs. And now I was embarking on something I have never attempted before: starting a garden.
It was First Lady Michelle Obama who said so, in her first ever book: American Grown.
All those who guessed the right answer may now proceed to quiz number two.
Who said the following
I love to travel all over the country, spend at least six hours a day glued to my Mac writing away to earn a living and am always ready for an argument (provided it's about books) or an evening at the Punchi Theatre. Yet, since I started writing the Down to Earth series I realize I'd rather be digging around in my backyard than any other place on earth. Yet, during all these years I existed, the closest I came to gardening was over-watering the snake plant on my desk, which had an untimely death six months ago.
If you can see the grin on my face right now, you would guess straight away who said the above. I did, of course.
I confess my attempts at gardening are still too amateurish to boast about. But, what I learned even within this short span with a spade in my hands is enough to keep me hooked to digging, for the rest of my life.
It came as no surprise that, after a spell of gardening of an evening, when I logged onto gardening sites on the net, I came across sites that said gardening could be a stress-buster.
I didn't need psychiatrists, though, to tell me that the process of gardening is incredibly cathartic. I already knew, from experience.
Even though, this may seem hard to believe (until you try it) every plant in your garden, will make you feel good. It is incredibly gratifying to watch a seed of bitter-gourd raise its tiny head from the ground, turn into a graceful vine and finally sprout beautiful four petaled yellow flowers. You might find the hours spent inspecting a Kathurumurunga plant for worms, too tedious, but scientists say, bending, stretching, reaching and stooping are invigorating. A good way to stop things from getting monotonous, according to expert gardeners, is to rotate your tasks from day to day. Variety is a must if you want to develop a garden work/pleasure ethos. One day it's weeding, the next it's removing branches and dead leaves, the next it's watering. I love visiting nurseries-buying new plants and bushes is better than buying new shoes, says Marian McEvoy, former editor of Elle Dcor and House Beautiful magazines.
I know, you might find the transition from clothes and books and furniture to trees and flower beds not that easy. But the wonderful thing is whereas a skirt, or a settee, stays the same, a plant grows, changes shape and color, attracts bees and butterflies. They depend on you the way clothes and furniture do not. You have to water them, protect them from snails and beetles, pamper them with compost. Besides, clothes and furniture might fade, but they do not often wither and die. But, alas, death is a constant occurrence with plants, reminding you, every day, the philosophy of the sages:Nothing in this world is permanent, and we are foolish when we ask anything to last.
Still, it's hard to watch an innocent plant in the throes of death. So, making a fist at death and chanting Donne's famous lines, Death thou shalt die, I called the Horticultural Crop Research Development Institute, at Gannoruwa and asked them for advice. The answer I wanted to hear the most was what kind of vegetables will grow in my backyard, here in Colombo. The Programming Assistant who listened to me, very kindly explained brinjals, chillies, tomatoes and leafy vegetables like gotukola are the best plants for me. She assured me saying, Gardening is not as complicated as you might think. All you need is a few square feet of the great outdoors, a water source, and a little time. Your grandparents did it, and so can you. In other words, the mantra goes like this: Find a good nursery and buy three or four plants of each kind. Dig the holes in a sunny place, within sight of the house. Wait. Watch. Repeat.
The important word here, is repeat. For, gardening is a never-ending process. Massive rainfalls or extended droughts cause havoc. Weeding is a pain until you get into the rhythm of it. Snails, caterpillars and beetles have insatiable appetites. Some plants need pruning every week, some never flower, some flower but never bear fruits. And yet, when something actually takes hold, sprouts and grows tall and straight, it is worth all the mistakes and frustrations.
Specially when the seeds you planted end up as food on your family's plates. I remember, Chef Pubilis, telling me sometime ago, it is essential that every household should have one tree of Karapinchha, one plant of green chilly and one bush of Rampe. In addition to all the other poison free, organic vegetables we could grow in our garden, that is. For, unarguably, fresh food is the best food! Ever wondered for how long the vegetables on your supermarket shelf have been there For how long did they travel from Dambulla or Nuwara Eliya to your table Comparing the flavor of a homegrown bundle of dambala with the taste of a store-bought one is like comparing Ceylon tea to any other tea in the world. If it tastes better, you will be more likely to eat the healthy, fresh produce that you know your body needs.
And, when they are growing in your backyard, you won't be able to resist them. Moreover, their vitamin content will be at their highest levels as you bite into them straight from the garden. Parents, take note: A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that preschool children who were almost always served homegrown produce were more than twice as likely to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day-and to like them more-than kids who rarely or never ate homegrown produce.
So, keep digging: If I can do it, anyone can.

From a great gardner..
We may have a wider approach to garden design if we have been helped to appreciate other forms of art: to be aware of basic principles - balance, repetition, harmony and simplicity - which apply to all forms of creativity'
- Beth Chatto
The Beth Chatto Gardens prove that a garden can be created in any conditions if the correct plants are used.
When creating a garden you have to accept the existing conditions, choose the right plants for that location and work with what is there  plants must fend for themselves.
According to Chatto, using what is there is the key, rather than taking the option that most gardeners do, of making wholesale changes to the soil and site to suit the traditional style.
Everything in the garden is arranged so it looks good now and contributes in the future  one year, five years, ten years  so it is advantageous to know your plants.

Keeping orchids alive in your home
As indoor plants, orchids can look beautiful (although mind the petals as they are liable to drop off).
* When you buy an orchid, it usually comes in a pot of loosely packed material, often chips of barks and small stones. Beware of over-watering, for it likes nothing less than to sit in a wet container.
* It is better to be purposely forgetful with an orchid and ignore it rather than over-watering. When you do water it, give it a thorough wetting and allow it to dry out again before the next water.
* The colour of the leaves provide a good scale for how much light the orchid is getting. A rich, dark green leaf is a sign that your orchid isnt receiving sufficient light, and a grass green colour  a light or medium green with yellow tones  means that your orchid is receiving enough light to bloom.
* A south of east-facing window is best for your friendly orchid, so position it well.

Drone market to hit $10 billion by 2024
UK: The market for military drones is expected to almost double by 2024 to beyond $10 billion (8.9 billion euros), according to a report published Friday by specialist defence publication IHS Jane's Intelligence Review.
"The global defence and security market for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will expand at 5.5 percent per year over this decade, from the current figure of $6.4 billion," according to the analysis.
"Unmanned systems are here to stay," said Derrick Maple, principal analyst on unmanned systems for the London-based group.
"These systems are well established, combat proven and are an essential and expanding element of future operations across the globe."
Israel was the top exporter of UAVs last year, but is set to be overtaken by the United States through sales of General Atomics Predator series and Northrop Grumman Global Hawk, said the report.
Western Europe is forecast to reach $1.3 billion in sales by 2024 as it seeks to reduce its reliance on US and Israeli imports, it added.
However, it also faces competition from China, Russia, India, South Korea and Japan -- whose combined sales are predicted to reach $3.4 billion by 2024.
The market is being driven by demand for new technology and different ways of using UAVs, according to Jane's.
"Operators are now moving to expand their mission sets beyond visual surveillance and reconnaissance, and are introducing sophisticated intelligence and electronic warfare systems, as well as a wider range of munitions," said Huw Williams, unmanned systems editor for IHS Jane's. "As technology matures, we are set to see Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs) come in to service," he added.
"These will feature 'stealthy' characteristics and advanced payloads and weaponry. They will operate alongside manned aircraft and eventually even replace them in many roles."
Drones were used extensively by the US military during its operations in Afghanistan, but have since been increasingly used in civil applications. - AFP

Early warning risk in section of Southern Expressway
An early warning system will be installed near the section between Kokmaduwa and Imaduwa of the Southern Expressway within the next couple of days due to the existing landslide risk in the area.
National Building Research Organization (NBRO) Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Head R.M. S. Bandara told the Daily News yesterday an early warning application was now being designed to suit the area and the requirements.
He said the early warning system would mostly be a combination of sirens and lights to immediately alert the public and other relevant units of the Expressway.
Bandara noted that the NBRO has commenced a detailed investigation with the coordination of the Road Development Authority to determine the measures to mitigate the landslide risk in this section of the Expressway.
He observed the study has been expedited and it would be concluded within a week, adding that there could be delays if the rainy weather prevails.
Bandara pointed out the landslide risk cropped up after the construction of the Expressway.
"The area at risk is 200 metres in length and 50 metres in height. This area shows features of an active landslide with fractures. The heavy rain is the main cause. We have to identify how deep these fractures have gone and the amount of water in the soil. Then we will design the strategies to minimise the landslide risk and accordingly the estimates will be prepared. We are doing this work with the coordination of the regional administration," he said.
Bandara said even though the section of the highway between Kokmaduwa- Imaduwa was opened for traffic from 10.00 a.m. yesterday, the NBRO would continue post monitoring, adding that if there were changes it would once again be closed.
He said residents in households near the road have also been advised to be vigilant and to shift to safer locations. However, he added the preliminary studies have shown that they were not at a higher risk.
Bandara pointed out the NBRO has identified 38 locations in Galle with landslide risk, but added these were minor.
The area between Imaduwa and Kokmaduwa on the Matara-Galle stretch of the Southern Expressway was closed time to time over the past few days after the NBRO warned that there was a risk of landslide near the 114 km post.

Her first success came at the Central Province Table Tennis Championship held in 2014 when she won the girls under 15 title.
From there onwards there was no looking back as a little star was born. Her maiden success egged her to perform better and she had to prove that this was no 'flash in the pan.'
She continued to perform well and was looked at the local version of David who is bent on taming the Goliaths.
Next she finished runner up at the Central Province Ladies Singles event in 2014.
She represented Mahamaya Girls College at the island schools games organized by the Ministry of Education in the girls under 15 team event.

[Health Watch - (05-10-2015)]
* Currently, there is no licensed vaccine in the world for HIV or AIDS
* During the 'Window Period' HIV can be transmitted to another person without detection and knowledge, because only sensitive tests such as antigen detecting test can detect the virus in blood in less than two weeks.
* 160 HIV positive Sri Lankans have been detected as of October 2015
* Majority of them are between the ages of 25 and 45
* Nearly 230 HIV positive Sri Lankans identified in 2104 (last year)
* It is believed that there are 3000 HIV positive persons in Sri Lanka but the actual number of positive persons (including undetected HIV positive persons) could be much higher than this.
Q: What is HIV and AIDS
A : HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus. AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Q: How does HIV transmit from one person to another
A : There are three (3) main modes of transmission
1. Mother to child transmission. (4%)
2. Sexual transmission (95%)
3. Blood born transmission (1%)
In Sri Lanka, 95% of HIV transmission is through unsafe sex. 60-80% of transmissions are heterosexual transmissions and male homosexual transmission is 20-40%.
It will take one to ten years from the date of becoming HIV positive to develop AIDS. Between one to three months, there may be little viral manifestation with symptoms such as mild fever, lymph-node enlargement, mild skin rash etc. But these symptoms will disappear without notification.
If a patient is infected with HIV Virus, he or she may live without any symptoms from one to 10 years. During this period HIV virus remains alive in their blood and sexual secretion. From HIV positive blood or sexual secretion contaminated with HIV virus, the HIV virus enters into the body of a normal person through blood or through mucous membrane of the genital organ, anus or mouth.
Even if the HIV Virus is present in the blood, the blood test for HIV may give negative results if tested before three months from the date of infection. This is because the antibody development takes about three months from the date of infection. This period is called 'the window period.' If a more sensitive test is done (antigen detecting test) the window period will be reduced by less than 2 weeks.
Q: Who are in the high risk group
A : If people have more than one sexual partner and if they do not use condoms, they are in the high risk group. Sex workers, Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM), Intravenous drug addicts too are in the high risk group.
Q: How can HIV infection be prevented
A : 1. Abstain from sex and using intravenous heroin.
2. Confine to one sexual partner.
3. If you have sex with multiple partners, use condoms correctly.
4. Avoid using heroin
5. Do not share needles if take intravenous heroin
6. Screening of pregnant mothers for HIV and if there are positive ones, offer antiviral treatment.
7. Screening of all risk groups for HIV and treat with Anti Retro-Viral (ARV) for all HIV positive people.
8. Treatment acts as prevention because treatment with ARV reduces undetected virus level in blood.
Q: Many prominent medical experts and professionals say that homosexuals have taken the lead in spreading AIDS in the world. How about Sri Lanka
A : There is an increasing trend of transmission of HIV among male homosexuals (MSM) in Sri Lanka. The prevalence of HIV in MSM is more than 1% in Sri Lanka. It is less than 0.1% in normal population.
Hypertension drugs may be more effective if taken at night
Taking hypertension medicine at night may control blood pressure more effectively and significantly lower the risk for diabetes.
A dip in blood pressure during sleep is normal, and a nighttime dip of less than 10 percent in systolic pressure (the top number) is known to be associated with a higher risk of death.
Researchers studied 2,012 men and women with high blood pressure. Their average age was 53, and none had diabetes at the start of the study. The researchers randomly assigned half of the people to take all their hypertension medicine at night, and half to take it all in the morning.
Over an average of six years, 171 developed diabetes. After adjusting for fasting glucose, waist circumference, mean sleeping blood pressure and other factors, those who took their medicine before going to sleep had a 57 percent lower risk for diabetes. Taking medications at night also resulted in a greater relative decline in nighttime blood pressure.
We are recommending now that patients take the meds in the evening. Its a no-cost intervention, said the lead author, Ramn C. Hermida, a professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Vigo in Spain, adding that patients should not change their medication regimens without talking to their doctors.

Going to bed late may make people fat
A study has found a link between sleeping later during the working week and an increase in body mass index
Going to bed late could be making people fatter, according to a new study.
Going to sleep late in their teens and adulthood may be making people fatter
Research published in the American journal Sleep this month suggests that going to bed later during the working week, as a teenager through to adulthood, is linked to an increase in body mass index over time.
A summary of the report said: The aim of the current study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between bedtimes and body mass index (BMI) from adolescence to adulthood in a nationally representative sample.
The results highlight bedtimes as a potential target for weight management during adolescence and during the transition to adulthood.
Later average bedtime during the work week, in hours, from adolescence to adulthood, was associated with an increase in BMI over time.
These results remained significant after controlling for demographic characteristics and baseline BMI.
Although sleep duration, screen time and exercise frequency did not attenuate the relationship between work day bedtime and BMI over time, fast food consumption was recognised as a significant partial mediator of the relationship between bedtimes and BMI longitudinally.
The research was carried out by academics at the University of California Berkeley, Columbia University and the New York Psychiatric Institute, and assessed the bedtimes of 3,300 teenagers between 1994 and 2009.
Earlier this year, Public Health England encouraged people to sleep more in a government campaign to promote healthier lifestyles.
Lack of sleep is a growing problem, according to Lisa Artis, of the British Sleep Council.
Firstly people dont place enough importance on sleep and the health benefits being well-rested can have.
Secondly, unlike a lot of well understood life changes such as eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, sleep isnt really on the agenda.
Research has also suggested that routinely getting less than six hours sleep a night can impact attention, concentration and memory, and is linked to Alzheimers disease.

Herbal Medicine -:
The Power of Peppermint
Studies have shown peppermint oil to be fairly effective at relieving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a collection of symptoms that includes abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, constipation and diarrhea that affects 5 to 20 percent of the population.
At the mention of peppermint, candy canes and ice cream comes to mind. But did you know that peppermint is also an age-old herbal medicine that has been used to treat a wide range of abdominal woes The oil extracted from the peppermint plant contains a host of compounds, but the most abundant and perhaps the most pharmacologically important is menthol.
Studies have shown peppermint oil to be fairly effective at relieving irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a collection of symptoms that includes abdominal pain and cramping, bloating, constipation and diarrhea that affects 5 to 20 percent of the population. One explanation is that the oil-especially the menthol-blocks calcium channels, which has the effect of relaxing the smooth muscles in the walls of the intestines. Recently, Alex Ford, a McMaster University researcher, concluded that instead of popular over-the counter drugs, peppermint oil should be the first line of defense against IBS.
Peppermint can temporarily allay itching caused by insect bites, eczema and other lesions, including the rash of poison ivy. Peppermint tea can be used as a mouthwash for babies with thrush (yeast in the mouth) or for reducing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, especially for women who want to avoid stronger medications.

Some asthma inhalers could stunt growth in children
Children under two who use certain asthma medicine could be stunted in later life, a preliminary report suggests.
Doctor Antti Saari, from the University of Eastern Finland, said his team analysed data from 12,000 children to find those who used inhaled corticosteroids long-term showed signs of stunted growth, the BBC reports.
The researchers looked at information on the height of the children's parents and data on the children's weight and asthma medicine in order to calculate expected height and growth.
They found an association which, if permanent, could lead to around 3cm of decreased adult height.
Experts said they would likely still be affected in adulthood, The Mirror reports.
It is important that doctors think twice whether these steroids are needed or not in this age group, Doctor Saari said.
Corticosteroids are found in brown inhalers and are used to manage the wheezing symptoms of asthma.
Doctor Samantha Walker, from Asthma UK, said: The study confirms other research suggesting ICS used in infancy can interfere with bone growth, although the impact is relatively minor.
No parent should therefore stop their children taking these lifesaving medicines, because a slight reduction in growth is a small price to pay for medicines which may save your childs life.

Minister to get tough with drivers without route permits
The bus drivers operating buses without valid route permits will be punished severely in due course. Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva told the Daily News in Kurunegala.
The minister also said that he would increase the fine imposed on such drivers up to Rs. 100,000. They are presently fined up to Rs. 10,000. The present amount of penalty is not sufficient and hence the minister is planning to increase the fine by Rs. 90,000.
Amendments to the existing rules and regulations will be carried out in this regard to discourage the errant drivers.
However, 90 such drivers are reported from the Northern Province who drive without valid route permits.
The minister has instructed his top officials to arrest the errant drivers and their buses. These buses are reported to be belonging to high government officials and politicians, the minister said.

MR hits out at UPFA for hailing UNHRC "victory"
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa hit out at the UPFA yesterday for dubbing the outcome of the 30th session of the UNHRC as a "victory" for the country.
"Posters of the UPFA have appeared on the streets hailing the government for delivering the country from the 'imperialist death trap' in Geneva. Such statements sit oddly beside the operative paragraphs of the resolution mentioned above. The mismatch between the provisions of the resolution that was passed and the government's present mixed signals and rhetoric may be due to a belated realisation that nothing has been gained by Sri Lanka joining the USA as a co-sponsor of this resolution except to commit the government to a course of action which runs contrary to the interests of this country and is therefore politically unfeasible," Rajapaksa said issuing a statement on Sunday.
"Operative paragraph 6 of the resolution affirms the importance of the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators in the Sri Lankan judicial mechanism to be set up to investigate alleged human rights abuses during the war. Operative paragraph 8 encourages the Sri Lankan government to remove individuals in the armed forces suspected of human rights violations through an administrative vetting process even if there is insufficient evidence to charge them in a court of law. Operative paragraph 4 welcomes the government's willingness to allow the various judicial and other mechanisms it intends to establish to deal with the past, to obtain financial assistance from overseas, which means that these supposedly Sri Lankan mechanisms will be paid for and maintained by foreign powers," the former President said in his statement.
"It was also said that I had antagonised the Western nations by being photographed with my arm around Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. It is actually Gaddafi who has his arm on my shoulder in that much publicised photograph. In the last months of the war in 2009 when Sri Lanka was fast losing foreign reserves due to the severe global economic recession that year and the IMF under pressure from the Western nations was delaying the standby facility that we were entitled to, Muammar Gaddafi agreed to lend 500 million USD to Sri Lanka in response to a single phone call from me. If not for that pledge, the economy would have collapsed before the war could be won.
"It was also said that when foreign dignitaries came to Sri Lanka to persuade us to stop the war, I had deliberately insulted them by taking them to Embilipitiya and giving them manioc to eat, and that that resentment was motivating the Western countries to pass resolutions against us. I have no recollection what was on the menu when the British and French foreign ministers met me in the final days of the war demanding that I halt hostilities. But it is certainly true that I refused point blank to halt the war. It is because I did not buckle under foreign pressure that this country is free of terrorism today. Governments are elected by the people of Sri Lanka to do what is best for the country and not to agree to everything said by foreign powers," he added.

Myanmar to sign peace deal with 8 rebel groups on October 15
Myanmar: Myanmar's government will sign a long-negotiated ceasefire on October 15 but with only eight rebel forces, officials said Sunday, as several major insurgent groups declined to ink an agreement that excludes some factions.
More than two years of talks to end decades of civil war in the nation's rugged borderlands have gained momentum in recent weeks, with the government eager to reach a deal before November's general election.
But hopes for a nationwide ceasefire have crumbled after several rebel groups refused to sign an agreement without the inclusion of all insurgent forces -- notably some smaller organisations locked in conflict with the army.
"The NCA (Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement) will be signed on October 15 in Naypyidaw," Hla Maung Shwe, a senior member of the government's negotiating team, told AFP, adding that eight groups including the prominent Karen National Union were on board.
"We will keep inviting all ethnic armed groups to sign," he said, referring to the 15 rebel organisations the government has agreed to negotiate with.
Major groups including the Kachin Independence Army have refused to sign the agreement, and clashes between them and government troops have intensified in recent weeks as the negotiations reach a critical juncture.
On Saturday a confederation of ethnic armed groups urged the international community to support efforts for "genuine political dialogue and peace" in Myanmar.
"As the NCA is going to be signed by only some organisations, it cannot be a decisive and complete one," the United Nationalities Federal Council said in a statement.
Myanmar's government had agreed to allow 15 ethnic armed groups to sign the deal, but rejected some half a dozen organisations put forward by a consortium of ethnic minority armies seeking full inclusion in the ceasefire.
At a meeting between some ethnic armed groups and government officials at the Myanmar Peace Centre in Yangon earlier Sunday, chief government peace negotiator Aung Min said the army "had no intention to launch an offensive against these groups because they didn't sign the NCA".
"It wasn't an easy decision for our government to make to continue with the NCA because the northern groups are not ready to sign," he said, according to a transcript of his opening speech on the centre's Facebook page, referring to forces including the KIA.
Aung Min added that the government "accepts all-inclusiveness in principle" and would seek ways in which other groups could take part.
The ceasefire deal will be signed in the presence of local and international witnesses, according to Hla Maung Shwe. He said the government would also invite opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party is contesting its first general election in a quarter of a century on November 8.
Conflict in Myanmar's northernmost state of Kachin has left some 100,000 people displaced since a ceasefire deal collapsed soon after the end of junta rule in 2011.
Fighting between government troops and rebels also erupted this year in the Kokang region of the northern state of Shan, causing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many into China. Most have since returned. President Thein Sein's quasi-civilian government, which took power four years ago, sees a nationwide ceasefire as opening the way to more complex political dialogue and questions of federalism.
The army which ruled for almost half a century asserted its legitimacy by stamping its own concept of unity on the diverse nation, and was accused of widespread abuses across ethnic minority areas.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said so addressing the 12th International Science and Technology Forum in Kyoto, Japan yesterday.
The Forum was inaugurated by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Every Sri Lankan will share the dividends of the Governments transparent and accountability policies, the Prime Minister said.
Therefore, we need to achieve significant progress and development in the science and technology fields in order for the people to enjoy these dividends, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
During the next 60 months, the Government plans to develop infrastructure facilities, which are required to bring out the best of the peoples creative talents, he said.
Sri Lanka has the ability to face any local and international challenge, the PM said.
The Prime Minister pointed out that Sri Lankas policy is to maintain cordial and friendly ties with all countries.
I hope to introduce Technological Zones and megapolis concepts to the country, he said.
The Prime Minister noted that Sri Lanka has to have a technological collaboration with Japan to make those concepts a reality. While pointing out the ways to utilise the benefits of technological collaboration, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that developing countries are trying to achieve 17 development goals aiming to obtain sustainable development.
In this exercise, Japanese technology plays a pivotal role, he added.

Obama promises full probe into Afghan hospital airstrike
AFGHANISTAN: President Barack Obama has pledged a full investigation into an apparent US air strike on an Afghan hospital that killed 19 people, in a bombing the UN said could amount to a war crime.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said patients burned to death in their beds during a bombing raid that continued for half an hour after US and Afghan authorities were informed the hospital had been hit.
Twelve staff members and at least seven patients, including three children, were killed; 37 people were injured, the charity said. This attack constitutes a grave violation of international humanitarian law.
The air raid came days after Taliban fighters seized control of the strategic northern city of Kunduz, in their most spectacular victory since being booted from power by a US-led coalition in 2001. Afghan forces, backed up by their NATO allies, claimed to have wrestled back control of the city.
But the defence ministry in Kabul said a group of armed terrorists... were using the hospital building as a position to target Afghan forces and civilians.
MSF has denied any combatants were present in the hospital.
The charity said despite frantic calls to American and Afghan military officials in Kabul and Washington, the attack continued for another 30 minutes, with the main hospital building housing the intensive care unit and emergency rooms being targeted.
The bombs hit and then we heard the plane circle round, said Heman Nagarathnam, MSFs head of programmes in northern Afghanistan.

The Stories they never told
Why Darcy never did dive into that lake: 20 years after the BBC's Pride And Prejudice aired, cast and crew reveal their secrets from the set
Liz Hoggard for the Daily Mail
Can it really be 20 years since Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle gripped the nation as on-off lovers Elizabeth Bennet and Fitz-william Darcy in BBC1s mega mini-series Pride And Prejudice
The critically acclaimed six-parter was a huge success that made a sex symbol out of Colin, earned a Best Actress BAFTA for his co-star Jennifer and is credited with bringing period drama to a fresh generation of younger viewers. But when it first went out on BBC1 on 24 September 1995 no one guessed it would change the TV landscape.
It was the year of The Spice Girls and Robbie Williams. The battle of Britpop between Blur and Oasis even featured on News At Ten.
And yet an average of 10 million viewers sat on their sofas to watch a classic bonnet drama. The streets were empty on a Sunday night, recalls David Bamber, who played creepy clergyman Mr Collins.
Jane Austens 1813 book centres on Lizzy Bennet, her four sisters, and their mothers attempts to marry them off to well-to-do gentlemen, including Charles Bingley, whos just moved into the local Netherfield estate, and his friend Mr Darcy.
Best remembered
It will always be best remembered for the famous scene in which Mr Darcy emerges from the lake at Pemberley, his Derbyshire estate, in a wet shirt, but the dramas that went on behind the scenes as the series was being filmed were almost as compelling as those on screen.
Colin Firth wasnt actually allowed to dive into the lake himself for the wet shirt scene as the films insurers demanded a stuntman because of the fear he might contract Weils disease, spread by rats urine in the water and potentially fatal.
We made him look wet instead, director Simon Langton explains. Colin poured a bucket of water over his head, much to the consternation of the make-up and costume departments  and the rest is history. Although any thoughts about the transparent effects on a white voile shirt were never mentioned at the time!
Young and contemporary
The adaptation was the brainchild of producer Sue Birtwistle, who got screenwriter Andrew Davies on board by cleverly telling him the book was about sex, money and social climbing. Together they hatched a plot to make their version young and contemporary.
It was very innovative for its time, says Andrew, who wrote scenes set in the Bennet girls bedrooms or showing people getting dressed or taking a bath. There was very much a kind of young, physical, funny, sexy vibe to it. And maybe thats why people still love it.
Jane Austens world is very female, but Andrew wanted to put men at the heart of the drama. Thus the series opened with horseback scenes. Later Darcy was seen fencing with Bingley and, of course, swimming in the lake at Pemberley. Andrew still regrets that Darcy didnt dive in naked.
It was about Nature with a capital N. Darcy had been spending too much time being polite in London with a group of stuffy people. But at the centre of his essence he was just a man, almost like a wild creature, who saw his lake there and thought, Lets get into this different element where I dont have to be polite or worry about my tenants. I can just be a man.
Much to the writers disappointment, a white shirt was produced to preserve Darcys modesty as he emerged from the lake to encounter Elizabeth Bennet. But actually this just made the scene hotter for many female viewers. Even Andrew was astonished. What was intended to be a comic scene of social embarrassment  having to have a polite conversation while ignoring the fact that one of them was soaking wet  became something quite different. But Colin, then 33, brought something very special to the role. On set his fellow actors were mesmerised by the way he could convey so much by apparently doing so little.
Proposal scene
In fact the first scene Colin and Jennifer had to shoot was the proposal scene where Lizzy turns him down. They barely knew each other but Colin nailed it, says Adrian Lukis, who played dastardly Army officer Mr Wickham.
Even as a young man, Colin had a real strength to his personality, whereas most people in their youth are flying around like headless chickens trying to find out who they are, particularly actors.
Colin himself later explained that the stress of shooting the proposal scene brought an unexpected chemistry between himself and Jennifer Ehle.
Because its so inappropriate to do that early and its so nerve-racking, we gave it a tremendous amount of attention and got a degree of adrenaline working up to it, so it was invested with something it would never have had if wed done it later, when everyone had settled in. It was jumping in at the deep end, he said. Their subsequent real-life romance is testimony to that. With five Bennet girls to cast, director Simon Langton ended up seeing just about every actress between 15 and 28. It was quite a challenge to find people who had the wit and charisma to do the script justice, as well as the right period air.
Elizabeth Bennet had to have sex appeal because wed be watching her for a total of six hours, says Simon. It doesnt mean she had to look like a goddess, quite the opposite sometimes, but I knew Jennifer definitely had it. Though I had to convince the producer, casting director and script editor, who were all women!
A miraculous actress
Jennifer was only 24 but, says David Bamber, she was already a miraculous actress. She was so composed. She hit the bulls eye every time. I dont mean she was complacent. She was just fully formed. I was mesmerised by her, everybody was. And Colin was a hoot, very funny and adorable.
The drama enhanced the careers of a generation of young actresses, including Susannah Harker as Jane Bennet (her mother Polly Adams had played Jane in the 1967 BBC version), Julia Sawalha as Lydia, Jasper Carrotts daughter Lucy Davis as Maria Lucas (she went on to star in The Office), Richard Briers daughter Lucy as Mary, and Emilia Fox as Georgiana Darcy in her first TV role at the age of 19.
One of my great pleasures is that most of the 19th-century novels have really young heroines so its a chance to get people at an early stage of their careers and watch them develop after that, says Andrew Davies.
Today he has a soft spot for Julias fun-loving, officer-mad Lydia but he wasnt sure the actress known for playing straight-laced Saffy in Ab Fab could pull it off. I said to Sue, Isnt she a bit low-key and sweet and demure for Lydia And Sue said, You havent met her, have you And Julia was absolutely brilliant. In fact she was actually 25 playing 15. - Daily Mail
WE THOUGHT HE'D BROKEN HIS NOSE
Catastrophe occurred when Colin Firth had to shoot the underwater close-ups of him swimming in the lake in a large weed-filled tank at Ealing Studios some time after the outdoor scenes were filmed.
The tank was covered by four heavy, metal-reinforced wooden slabs, says director Simon Langton. On the day Colin was due to dive in, the plan was to remove all the slabs by crane. When I arrived the last slab was still in place but I was told there was no need to move it. Colin overheard this and intervened, saying nobly that he would take special care to avoid surfacing too late and hitting the slab.Against the directors better instincts filming commenced, but all too predictably the momentum of Colins initial dive took him further than hed calculated, so he rose to the surface beneath the slab, hitting the metal support crossbar with a sickening thud  right on the bridge of his nose. I quietly died, Simon admits with understatement.
A series of scenarios flashed through my head  the producer Sue Birtwistle would give me the sack, shut down filming, recast Darcy and reshoot while Colin had his nose reconstructed. In fact, by some miracle, the collision wasnt as bad as was feared. The swelling on Colins nose wasnt conspicuous enough to merit rescheduling. I was wary however of using any profile shots for some time, adds Simon dryly.

On threshold to change for Human Rights and Social Justice
The world is fully aware of Sri Lankas progress towards democracy and the necessity for reconciliation and understanding to ensure the best results of peace.
President Maithripala Sirisenas address to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, expressed the new vision of the country, for sustainable development and reconciliation.
The focus of his statement is the fundamental requirement to deal with the past honestly, and build a modern Sri Lankan nation, which requires the process of truth seeking, reparation and non-recurrence of the past events that led to the tragedy faced by this nation through nearly three decades. He emphasized Sri Lankas need to adopt a new social, economic, and political approach to rise up to the challenges of the 21st century, underlining that reconciliation requires priority in this context.
In understanding the background to the developments that brought about the situation the country is now determined to overcome, I recall what a current Cabinet Minister of the SLFP-UPFA, said at Rupavahinis Aththa-Neththa programme on Monday this week. The discussion was about the UNHRCs resolution that recommended a hybrid mechanism into the conflict and post-conflict situation in Sri Lanka. The Minister who was happy at the developments that have now taken place, emphasized that it was not the advise of any astrologer or the need to extend ones term of office, that made President Mahinda Rajapaksa to call for the January Presidential election. Instead, he was certain it was the prevailing fear in the government that come March 2015, the UNHRC Sessions in Geneva would certainly have framed charges against Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and many of the armed services personnel, engaged in the battle to defeat the LTTE. He had no word about any charges against the then Army Commander Gen. Sarath Fonseka, possibly because he thought Gen. Fonseka had been already punished by Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his quest for internal political revenge.
UPFA campaign
What is strange is that none of this was the highlight of the UPFAs election campaign, where mainly spoke of the dangers to the Sinhala majority due to a rise of the LTTE, the danger of the Tamil Diaspora, with Tamil separatism and terrorism, and the great development work done by the MR regime. We do know that MR, his key supporters Weerawansa and Gammanpila, and other catchers in the campaign did talk of the electric chair that awaited MR, but if the message that this minister said on TV was told to the public, with as much effect as he did, the result on January 8 may have been different.
However, the minister is now most satisfied that with the new resolution at the UNHRC all those dangers are gone, and Sri Lanka is on the correct path to progress and reconciliation, with all the opportunities for development in the years ahead. One hopes such thinking will trickle to others in the UPFA, too.
Yet, what is left of the UPFA Opposition  within quotes because the main part of the UPFA is in government -- has not given up its opposition to the Governments position of working in cooperation with the United Nations, and the revised Geneva resolution, where hybrid is no more, and a fully domestic mechanism has been accepted. This section of the UPFA sees this as part of American and Western imperialism, targeting Sri Lanka, in the strategy for Western hegemony in the world. UPFA MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara made this clear at a media briefing earlier this week. I refer to these two names only, because they have the seniority, and a strong leftist background, to know better about the current developments; and with due diligence and proper political analysis, be able to move away from hackneyed thinking about imperialism, when the country is moving forward in a era of new democracy. This does not rule out the machinations of capitalist and neo-liberal thinking and forces of the West, but it is certainly not sensible to look at every issue with such tinted glasses.
Journey to the future
What President Sirisena told the UN and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been conveying to the people of this country, with much commitment, is the need for us to take a new turn in our journey to the future. This needs a clear acknowledgment of the past mistakes by all governments, the worst aspects of it being in the near decade of the Rajapaksa regime.
What the Prime Minister has been emphasizing is the need to work in cooperation with the world as represented by the UN and its institutions, as well as, other organizations such as the Commonwealth, and go ahead with much effort and even difficulty, towards reconciliation and understanding. This is seen as the only way forward for a country lagging behind, despite very costly highways, displaying the extent of fraud and corruption that has prevailed, which needs rooting out through every means possible.
The progress made in Geneva would mean, as the PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has shown, that we are moving into a new era of Commissions, which are necessary to guide the country in the search for the truth as to how our crises began and were allowed to grow until the county and people were smothered by a crisis that caused so much bloodshed from 1971 to 2005. In addition to knowing the truth, these are necessary for the process of reconciliation, which is so vital for proper island wide development of the sustainable type; development that is not directed by a family tree of political power, and racist or majoritarian thinking, but a wider holistic thinking of the entire nation.
It is useful to recall that after the JVP insurrection in 1971, there was a commission appointed to study the needs of youth. It did make many valuable recommendations, but most of them remain unimplemented, which as part of what led to the next uprising of youth in the North, going on to become a terrorist war for separation.
Shoulders to the wheel
What is required by all political forces, those who speak for progress for the country, and not for special families or interest groups, is putting their shoulders to the wheels that will drive us towards a new age of modern and constructive development. The idea of consensual government must be effective, by proceeding with no hesitation against the forces of corruption that have prevailed over the past decades. This will mean, showing more to our own people, than to the world, that we can be a democratic society, with a truly independent judiciary, an independent and properly functional administrative machinery, a proper audit authority, and very importantly a police that truly serves the needs of society, and not the narrow interests or the false image building of its efficiency.
As stated last week, we cannot blame the world or the UNHRC for having doubts about the quality and capacity of our judiciary, when we look at what has happened to it through continued political interference and manipulation over the years. The record is one that is contemptible and we have much to do give our judiciary the shining image it had and deserves.
Those who gathered information to prepare the UNHRCs latest report on Sri Lanka would not have been unaware of the problems we have in the police, seen to this day, and the problems regarding the office of the Attorney General, which is again up for much criticism, and even areas such as legal education and the wider area of higher education.
The sum and substance of what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been telling us in the past weeks, in his many statements on the Geneva process and the necessity for political change, is that the country needs to change in every area of national importance. It is a revolution of very wide proportions; with the necessity to suspend disbelief that proper change can be achieved.
We cannot let the old hacks and new catchers of what is called the left, who made a disgrace of Parliament, mislead us into thinking that is neither leftist nor progressive, in the context of todays needs.
We must look at the broader picture of progress that holds promise through the Commissions on Truth, Reconciliation and Compassion and other aspects of good governance. We must also look with speed at the changes the system and content of education, and the patterns of cultural thinking, that are demanded, by the increased violence in society and the growing call to take a step backwards in civilization to the death penalty. Let us look at Human Rights as the issue of major importance that can positively impact on progress in all aspects of society.
The country is on a threshold of change, calling to strengthen Human Rights and Social Justice. It is worth looking at what the old leaders of the left called for, and not the voices of those left behind.

Tragic phenomenon of LTTEs forcible recruitment of Tamil civilians
The Human Rights Investigation report on Sri Lanka compiled by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights released last month has revealed much information about the alleged activities of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and state affiliated para-military outfits such as the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) and Tamil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP) during the final phase of South Asias longest war. While overseas members of the LTTE demonstrate in Geneva with Tiger flags and portraits of LTTE supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran, those who read the UN report are appalled and horrified by the acts of cruelty perpetrated by the LTTE on its own people. Among the many aspects focused upon by the UN investigation report on Sri Lanka  abbreviated as OISL report  is the tragic phenomenon of forcible recruitment of Tamil civilians by the LTTE.
In earlier times the LTTE had not engaged in the exercise of forcible recruitment or conscription. It was in fact organizations such as the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) and Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF) who pioneered forcible recruitment during the days of the Indian army deployment in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. The LTTE campaign of forced recruitment on a massive scale began in June 2006 and accelerated from October onwards. One of the factors contributing to this was the split caused in the LTTE by the revolt of its former eastern regional commander.
The LTTE breakaway faction led by former Tiger Eastern Region Commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Col Karuna was actively engaged in child conscription and forced recruitment in the East after his defection. Security Forces were allegedly complicit in this campaign undertaken by the Karuna faction known as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP). The Eastern Province thus became the focus of attention in the sphere of abductions, conscription and forced recruitment in those days.
Apart from the TMVP involvement and complicity by the Security Forces the mainstream LTTE was also engaged in abductions and conscriptions. The Eastern province saw much activity in this regard after the split in the LTTE in 2004. Thousands of cadres who dropped out or escaped from the LTTE after the split were targetted again by both parties. Also both the LTTE and TMVP began abducting and forcibly recruiting new persons into their respective organizations. Some instances were reported in the media.
While the focus was on the volatile east, the actions of the LTTE in the north did not receive the same glare of publicity. Lack of access to the LTTE dominated regions in the Northern mainland was the chief contributory factor to this state of affairs then. The unwillingness of many Tamil people to publicly articulate their grievances against the LTTE was another reason for the situation. The Tamil community grapevine was humming with tales of Tiger abductions but few Tamils were willing to come forward and say so openly.
Fear of repercussions
The main reason was fear of repercussions at the hands of the LTTE and its minions. Another reason was the feeling that the Tamil cause would be weakened if accusations were levelled against the LTTE. Family members of those conscripted were also afraid to speak out because the lives of those abducted may have been in jeopardy. Families were explicitly warned of such consequences if details of abductions leaked out.
Besides many families concerned were also residing in LTTE controlled areas and themselves were in danger. The prevailing totalitarian control of society by the LTTE prevented people speaking out except for communicating their distress to trusted persons. All these reasons helped the LTTE to get away with continuous abductions and forced recruitment in those years.
The scale and intensity of forced recruitment increased in 2006 as the fighting escalated. It was always the LTTE position that the movement faced a shortage of personnel because enough people were not volunteering. If enough numbers were forthcoming the elusive goal of Tamil Eelam would be a reality they used to say then. There was also much talk of a massive counter-strike against the armed forces by the LTTE. Additional cadres were necessary for this, it was argued by the LTTE then.
While the military priorities and objectives were given pride of place the human dimension was once again lost sight of by the LTTE. The sad irony was that the war was being supposedly fought for the liberation and upliftment of the Tamil people! What was happening however was that of the position of the Tamil civilians worsening day-by-day.
The LTTE may have wanted more and more people to join up and fight but the ordinary Tamils were in no mood to oblige. They simply wanted to be left alone to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives and get on with living. This war was not their war any more. The Tigers may have celebrated death but the ordinary Tamil people wanted life no matter how miserable it may have been under prevailing conditions. They did not want their children to die as cannon fodder in what was clearly an unwinnable war. Which parent would want that
Civilian arms training
The LTTE had earlier started the process of civilian arms training. All able bodied persons from 16 to 45 were required to undergo some physical training and learn techniques of self-defence. Those willing to go the extra-mile were given more intensive training and forged into an auxiliary outfit known as Ellai Padai or border force. They functioned mainly as helpers to the LTTE cadres in border areas.
Another category of persons was selected out of the original batches of trainees and given further training. They were supposedly reservists and called Makkal Padai or peoples force. These people were allowed to get on with normal civilian life but were required to show up whenever necessary or required. Most members of these civilian militias were not willing to fight or die. But they had no choice and were reluctantly compelled to go along with Tiger diktat.
These enlistment practices were overshadowed by a new direct campaign of forced recruitment that began in 2006. The intensification and acceleration of the LTTE campaign to forcibly recruit Tamil civilians directly into their ranks caused much resentment amid the Tamil people then. However they had no way to resist or protest. Some went into hiding. Others found ways to leave or escape from those areas. Those detected of trying to escape were punished. The LTTE also infiltrated the government controlled areas of Mannar, Vavuniya and even Jaffna districts and abducted people. However the full force of Tiger conscriptions was faced by the people of Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu districts.
The LTTE which was running a parallel administration then set up its monitoring apparatus in the areas it controlled. There were two or more LTTE operatives functioning as grama sevakhas in each village. They were in possession of all family details in every household in their areas of authority. LTTE operatives armed with such particulars visited each home and press ganged the reluctant young men and women into joining them. If unsuccessful at day-time the Tigers returned at night. Nocturnal raids were a regular feature.
Pathetic predicament
All students in the Advanced Level classes were compelled to undergo training in self -defence and first-aid. The training period was between two to four weeks. The bright ones were identified and brainwashed or forcibly recruited as permanent cadres. Initially the families of fallen Tigers or great heroes and serving LTTE members were exempted. Later they too were targeted. Many of the parents stopped sending children to schools. Young people seldom moved around publicly. If they were seen the chances of being taken away were very high. Some parents avoided going out to work and stayed home under the impression that they could prevent their children being taken.
An incident in Kilinochchi illustrates the pathetic predicament of ordinary people then. A family of five in Aanandapuram in Kilinochchi was killed in bombing by the Air Force. Two of those killed were boys aged 18 and 20 respectively. The boys were kept at home to avoid being conscripted by the LTTE at school. Tragically Yaman came for them at home via an Israeli K-fir. Students of that particular school were afraid to attend classes because the principal of that institution was allegedly helping the LTTE to identify and abduct students. The principal who was a close relative of a top Tiger commander is today holding high political office as an elected representative of the people.
One way of avoiding conscription was to resort to matrimony since married persons were not forcibly recruited when the conscription campaign commenced. So many people in Tiger controlled areas began marrying early. With the recruitment drive being launched in June 2006 the rate of marriages shot up among young people. The LTTE then declared that all marriages after August 2006 were null and void. Regardless of marital status the new grooms and brides were conscripted. The LTTE also went to the extent of declaring a moratorium on marriages till a particular age was reached. Males could not marry till they were 40 and females till 35 was the new commandment. This was only a temporary measure assured the LTTE then.
An incident of suicide that occurred then was pathetic. On January 22nd 2007 a school master from Uruthirapuram married an employee at the Mallavi hospital. Both were in their mid-twenties. Two days later on the 24th, LTTE operatives came to the newly married couple and insisted that the groom give up marital bliss and join up with them. The wedding was not valid they pointed out because the legal marriage ages were 40 and 35. The distressed couple pleaded with the Tigers and obtained a few days grace to complete wedding rituals. The Tigers agreed and went away.
The groom and bride escaped and hid themselves elsewhere. The Tigers returned and were infuriated at this defiance. They abducted the grooms sister and the brides brother and took them away. The groom was asked to present himself within a week. Otherwise the siblings would not return, warned the LTTE. The groom was extremely agitated and worried. After pondering the situation for days in a frustrated and confused mental state the man committed suicide by hanging on February 5th 2007. He died exactly two weeks after his marriage.
This woeful tale was talked about widely in the LTTE areas and elsewhere. Many people were highly critical of the LTTE for this act which encapsuled the predicament faced by ordinary Tamils under the jackboots of the LTTE. In a bid to counter this resentment the LTTE put a counter spin by spreading the rumour that the man was diagnosed with terminal cancer and therefore had taken his own life.
Detained and punished
The LTTE also banned the movement of people to government controlled areas. People were allowed out only for specific reasons on a very strict basis. In most instances someone living in the Wanni had to stand surety. If the person who exited did not return on time the person who stood surety would be detained and punished. The LTTE was very strict in disallowing people between 12 and 17 from leaving the Wanni in those days.
The people particularly the mothers resisted as much as they could. But most efforts were futile. Some of the stories related about those dark days are pathetic. One mother fell on the ground in front of a Tiger vehicle in a desperate attempt to block it from driving away with her son. The LTTE driver callously drove over the womans leg crushing the bone. In another incident the frantic mother tried to cling on to her son but was pushed away roughly. She fell down and hit her forehead on a stone. Seeing the wife bleed the elderly husband/ father got angry and slapped the Tiger cadre. The Tigers were enraged. Engalukku Kai Neetta thuninjitiyo (Are you brave enough to raise your hand against us) they shouted. Thereafter the old man was given a merciless thrashing and was hospitalised.
In one case the 21-year-old brother was given permission to go to Colombo to welcome an uncle who was visiting from abroad. His family guaranteed his return in three months. While he was in Colombo the LTTE recruitment drive escalated. Family members urged the son not to return but stay in Colombo and try to go abroad. When the LTTE went to the house the family said that the young man was sick and needed medical treatment in Colombo.
The Tigers took away the 16-year-old sister and said she would be released if proof of the brothers medical condition was supplied. The brother got himself admitted to a private hospital and after some doctoring with some sympathetic help by those concerned sent the the necessary paperwork to convince the LTTE of his medical condition. The LTTE rejected the documents and wanted the family to give them medical records from a government hospital! The sister was under Tiger custody for many months and finally co-opted into LTTE ranks. She was killed in the fighting.
The LTTE slogan for recruitment was Veetukku Oru Veeran Allathu Veeranganai (One hero or heroine from each house). The Tigers began strictly enforcing this. All households were forced to send one member. If those eligible escaped or avoided being recruited another was taken away as hostage. Those protesting or objecting were assaulted severely. Some were detained for indefinite periods.
Face consequences
Some of the persons taken by the Tigers managed to escape and went into hiding. The LTTE sent letters to the families saying the escapees must surrender themselves before a particular date. Otherwise family members would have to face consequences the Tigers warned. In another incident on February 9th 2007 in Vattakachchi an elder sister was taken in place of a younger sister who went into hiding. The protesting parents were kicked and pushed aside.
An LTTE member had absconded from the Tigers after being sent to Vavuniya to do political work after the ceasefire. He came to Colombo and then went abroad. This was in 2003. After making inquiries from the family the LTTE did not do anything. But in 2006 the LTTE came to the house and wanted the escapee to return to the LTTE again. When told that he was now abroad the Tigers took away his younger sister aged 15. The family was told that the girl would be sent home if the brother returned to the country and the movement.
Some people sent their children or even moved out of the LTTE controlled areas through circuitous jungle routes. There was much hardship and danger but people risked it rather than see children being conscripted. The LTTEs elite leopard commando unit also prowled these jungle routes keeping up vigil. While some people managed to escape many were caught and punished. One family had twin sons in their twenties. The LTTE wanted one to join up. The family tried to escape through a jungle route and was caught. As punishment both sons were taken away.
One particularly sad incident was about a young girl in Puthukudiyiruppu. She was the only daughter in the family and very clever in studies. Her elder brothers had either died as LTTE Maaveerar or gone abroad. The family was however worried because the girl did not attain age for many years. Finally she became a periya pillai (Loku Lamaiya) at the age of 18. The parents were so happy that they had a comparatively grand celebration on the day of pouring water. (thanni vaarkum naal). Two days later the Tigers came and took her away leaving the parents devastated.
Fences devoured crops
Some families from Allaipiddy and Mankumban had relocated to the Wanni after the spate of killings by the Navy and EPDP in May 2006. They felt the LTTE controlled Wanni was safer than their own villages. In 2007 some youngsters from these displaced families went missing. Family members rushed to the LTTE Kaavalthurai (Police) run by Nadesan. The Eelam cops promised to inquire into the matter. It was only some days later that enlightenment dawned on the families that the fences had devoured the crops.Among those taken away by the LTTE were some girl students staying with Catholic sisters at a nunnery and attending a Convent. The Tigers took those over 17 years of age forcibly. Church leaders appealed to the LTTE hierarchy but did not publicise the incident for obvious reasons.
The LTTE also abducted young persons in the government controlled areas of Mannar, Vavuniya and even Jaffna. Age or marital status was not a bar when it came to abducting those in government controlled areas. They were taken to LTTE controlled areas clandestinely and forcibly inducted as Tiger cadres. It was alleged then that most incidents of youths abducted in Jaffna during daytime and then going missing were perpetrated by the LTTE. As the conflict intensified the use of mobile phones by members of the public was banned by the LTTE in the Wanni. Anyone found using one was penalised. All foreign calls could be taken only from LTTE run communication centres. The numbers had to be registered in the mornings. The calls limited to five minutes per call were allowed in the evenings. The time in between is used by the LTTE to verify details about those being called.
There were however many who managed to come out of the Wanni in that period. This was mainly due to nepotism and/or corruption. High ranking Tiger leaders who had sent their own children abroad for higher studies were known to have intervened in some instances and ensured the sending away of close relatives. In other cases massive donations were paid officially to the LTTE and unofficially to Tiger officials for people to get away. The sad irony was that some of these escapees were treated as LTTE suspects when they came to the government controlled areas.
Grim gloomy scenario
This then was the grim, gloomy scenario that unfolded in the LTTE dominated north during the days of war. The so-called liberators of the Tamil people were intensely recruiting people forcibly to be conscripted into Tiger ranks. The rationale being manpower requirement was necessary to continue the Por (war). All oppression was justified as being necessitated by the Tamil cause.
Ordinary Tamil civilians however wanted no part of this war being fought in their name. They only wanted to be left alone so that they could get along with their life. Sadly that was being denied to them. That was the Tamil tragedy! After some more years of terrible suffering the war was finally over in May 2009.

UN should hold referendum on Tamil Eelam - Ramadoss
PMK leader S. Ramadoss on Saturday said that if Sri Lanka was ready for an international inquiry into the war crimes and human rights violations, the United Nations should hold a referendum among the Sri Lankan Tamils across the world for the creation of a separate Tamil Eelam.
Tamils cannot live in peace and with dignity in a country that refuses to change its attitude and is not allowing an international inquiry, he said in a statement.
India and the US should take steps to conduct an international inquiry as Sri Lanka, in the last half a century, had not fulfilled any of the promises made to the Tamils.
The international community should not allow itself to be short-changed by the Sri Lankan government, he said, recalling Sri Lankan President Maithripala Srisenas statement that he would consult Buddhist monks before taking any decision.
His statement is clear proof to the fact that the administration in Sri Lanka is controlled by religious leaders, Dr. Ramadoss said.

Undying memories of Princess Di
Fourteen previously unseen photos of Charles and Dianas wedding reception have auctioned for $12,500.
The official photographer Lord Patrick Lichfield took the never-before-seen snaps, which failed to make it into the final album. Instead, Lord Lichfields assistant kept hold of the photos - until now, as he explains in a letter of authenticity that accompanied the single lot to the September 27 auction.
I was the photographic assistant to Lord Patrick Lichfield...the only photographer allowed to take informal photographs of the royal family and their guests when they returned to Buckingham Palace...for the wedding reception.
Lord Lichfield had me make up an album of black and white and colour photographs, which he presented to Prince Charles and Princess Diana to commemorate the day of their wedding. These are photos that did not go into that album [and were given to Litchfields assistant in recognition of the work done on the wedding photographs]. To my knowledge, none have ever been published. Very few people have ever laid eyes on them.
The photographs reveal few smiles behind the scenes on that July day in 1981 - although perhaps that is just the royal way. Yet that didnt deter bidders. Memorabilia connected with Princess Diana always attracts interest, and the unusual nature of these photos ensured a strong price.
The dress Diana wore when she danced with John Travolta at the White House made 240,000 ($363,200) in 2013.
