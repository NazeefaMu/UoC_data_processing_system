US Afghanistan: Tillerson ups pressure on Pakistan

American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has increased pressure on Pakistan over its perceived backing for the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Pakistan denies sheltering the Taliban, but Tillerson suggested it could lose US privileges if the government failed "to change their posture".
He was speaking a day after President Donald Trump unveiled a new strategy, vowing to commit US forces to back Afghan forces fighting the insurgents.
The US is a key ally of Pakistan.
The country enjoys a special status as a non-Nato alliance partner and receives billions of dollars in aid.
But Tillerson said these "could be on the table for discussion if in fact they are unwilling to change their posture or change their approach to how they are dealing with the numerous terrorist organisations that find safe haven in Pakistan.
"It is in Pakistan's interest to take those actions."
Nuclear power
Tillerson also stressed that having a stable Pakistan was in US and other countries' interests.
"They are a nuclear power and we have concerns about the security of their weapons. This is not a situation where the US is saying 'this is us and you'."
Tillerson said the Taliban must be made to understand that they could not win a battlefield victory in Afghanistan. But he suggested the US might not either.
"We may not win one but neither will you," as he put it, adding that negotiation was the way to bring the conflict to an end.
Pakistan has for years deflected US criticism over the issue of safe havens for Taliban and other militants active in Afghanistan.
That's partly because Islamabad sees the groups as leverage to prevent its arch-rival India from gaining influence there. It's unlikely that the Trump administration will be able to change Islamabad's strategic calculations, especially as the president has now encouraged India to play a greater role in Afghanistan.
Rex Tillerson did mention ways that Washington could press Pakistan, such as withholding military aid and reassessing its status as a major non-Nato US ally.
But he also acknowledged concern that too much pressure could destabilise Islamabad.
He offered US help to deal with any blowback from a crackdown on the militants. And he suggested that India take some "steps of rapprochement" to ease Pakistan's concerns.
On Monday night, Trump unveiled a new Afghan strategy, committing the US Army to the open-ended conflict, despite previously advocating its withdrawal.
President Trump warned a hasty US withdrawal from Afghanistan would leave a vacuum for terrorists to fill and said he had decided to keep troops there to "fight to win" to avoid the mistakes made in Iraq.
He said his new approach would be more pragmatic and based on conditions on the ground rather than idealistic and time-based, and would switch from nation building to "killing terrorists".
But Trump refused to be drawn on how many extra troops, if any, would be deployed and gave no timeline for ending the US presence in the country.
Washington is thought to be ready to send up to 4,000 additional troops.
Trump also, for the first time, left the door open for an eventual peace deal with the Taliban, saying: "Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan."
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani thanked the US for supporting "the joint struggle against the threat of terrorism" in Afghanistan.
The Taliban promised to make Afghanistan a "graveyard" for US forces.
India's foreign ministry said it shared Trump's concerns over safe havens and "other forms of cross-border support enjoyed by terrorists".
US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but more than 8,000 special forces continue to provide support to Afghan troops.
The Afghan government continues to battle insurgency groups and controls just half of the country.

US-led strikes on Raqa leave 42 civilians dead
LEBANON: At least 42 civilians were killed Monday in a barrage of US-led air strikes on Islamic State group territory in the Syrian city of Raqa, a monitor said.
Nineteen children and 12 women were among those killed in the raids, which hit several neighbourhoods in the northern city, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP on Tuesday.
The toll marked the second consecutive day of ferocious bombardment on Raqa, more than half of which has been captured by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces battling IS.
The latest figures for Mondays raids take to 167 the number of civilians killed in coalition strikes since August 14, after the Observatory said at least 27 were killed on Sunday.
The tolls are high because the air strikes are hitting neighbourhoods in the city centre that are densely packed with civilians, said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.
There are buildings full of civilians that are trying to get away from the front lines.
Coalition air strikes are targeting any building where any kind of Daesh movements are being detected, he told AFP, using an Arabic acronym for IS.
The United Nations estimates there are up to 25,000 civilians trapped inside the city, with food and fuel supplies short and prohibitively expensive.
The UNs humanitarian pointman for Syria, Jan Egeland, has said IS-held territory in Raqa city is now the worst place in the war-torn country. - AFP

Wijeyadasas dilemma
At the time of writing these lines the fate of Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is yet unknown. It is reported that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had requested the President to remove the embattled minister after the latter had failed to respond to a three member committee appointed by the party over his expressing contrary views to that held by the UNP led government on the Hambantota Port leasing and thus breaching collective Cabinet responsibility. The PMs decision followed a stormy UNP parliamentary group meeting at Temple Trees on Monday evening where member after member had voiced their indignation, calling for the ouster of Rajapakshe. What the President will decide on the issue will be known soon. Rajapakshe had already stated that it is only the President who has the authority to remove him while denying any wrong doing, claiming that he had been quoted out of context in the media on the Hambantota affair.
However, it is clear that more than the Hambantota matter, it is Rajapkshes failure in getting corruption cases against members of the former regime fast tracked that has caused the UNP membership to take issue with him and led to the current ruckus. We say this because there have been other ministers, notably Minister Susil Premajayantha who had not only spoken against the Hambantota deal but also against other so-called sale of national assets but has continued to go unscathed. Even Minister Arjuna Ranatunga had murmurings to make against Hambantota, with the result that he had the Ports Ministry taken away from him and entrusted with Petroleum Resources. It appears that it is only UNP ministers in the Unity Government who are being penalized for their alleged infractions, with Ravi Karunanayake leading the way, while ministers of the SLFP are getting away with anything they say and do.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, it must be said, did not merely breach collective Cabinet responsibility but went further afield and was making statements contradicting government policy and clearly throwing a spanner in the works in the governments efforts to bring the big time crooks to justice which was the main plank of the election platform of the Yahapalanaya government. The contrary views he often expressed to that made by other government ministers for establishing a more potent legal mechanism to rope in the corrupt, no doubt, sowed the seeds of suspicion among the UNP membership as to the direction their Justice Minister was traversing. Eyebrows were raised when Rajapakshe once declared in parliament that he would never allow Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to be thrown behind bars and had a slanging match with Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka over his (Rajapakshes) soft pedaling of the Avant Garde matter. Fonseka later exposed Rajapakshes personal links with the Avant Garde boss, with photographic evidence.
Rajapakshe was also looked at askance by the UNP membership over his hardline nationalist stance and the not so subtle views expressed with regard to the so-called privileged position enjoyed by the minority communities and religions in this country at the expense of the Buddhists.
It was as if Rajapakshe was working in league with the strident nationalist elements in the Joint Opposition such as Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila. Needless to say, all members of the JO in parliament were set to oppose the No Confidence motion that was mooted against Rajapakshe, with Mahinda Rajapaksa saying he could not vote against apey gamey miniha. Rajapakshe, in the view of the UNPers, was gravitating towards the Joint Opposition, and, what is more, was making no bones about it, given the sentiments already expressed vis-a-vis Gota.
The way members of Sangha community rallied to express their solidarity with Rajapakshe also created the impression that the Justice and Buddhasasana Minister had embarked on a mission of his own, the contours of which will be known in the coming days. True, as Buddhasasana Minister he has to protect the interests of the Sangha and voice his concerns when the members of the Sangha are belittled in any manner. It is also well within his remit to speak out against alleged destruction and vandalism of Buddhist monuments and artifacts, said to be occurring in the North and East.
However, his dalliance with such personages as the Ven Galagodatte Gnanasara, after the latters antics were in full public display, especially in court houses, gave the inescapable feeling to many UNPers that Rajapakshe was out of synch with the policies and precepts of Greens and was working to a different political agenda altogether.
Be that as it may, if Rajapakshe desires to embark on a different political journey the UNP cannot stop him. It appears that he has already burnt his bridge with the Greens. Things are certainly not going to be the same, even in the event of a patch up. The Justice Minister has already shown his hand in ample measure, for the UNP leadership to now entertain any misgivings. Rajapakshe has obviously taken an irrevocable step, as far as his position in the UNP is concerned.

A total of 1,728 still births were reported in Sri Lanka in 2015 and another 1,555 infants had died during the first week of their life. But 99.9 percent of births in Sri Lanka take place in hospitals whereas this number is only 40 percent in India and other countries in the region,Consultant Community Physician Dr.Kapila Jayaratne (MBBS,MSc, MD (Com.Med) said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that no one knows what happens to 60 percent of births that take place in India and other countries in the region. In Sri Lanka, 82 percent of mothers get themselves registered with health authorities before the 12th week of their pregnancy.
According to Dr.Jayaratne, only one percent (700 to 750) births in Sri Lanka take place outside hospitals and they are unplanned deliveries taking place in vehicles etc.
Five percent of deliveries take place at private hospitals and 20,000 to 25,000 infants are born in private hospitals annually. There were 112 maternal deaths reported in Sri Lanka in 2016 last year and most of them were due to seeking late medical treatment/assistance from a hospital, he added.

Swedish investor to bail out CIFL depositors
A Swedish investor has finally come forward to bail out the Central Investment and Finance Co Ltd (CIFL) depositors.
CIFL Depositors Association (CIFLDA) President Wijaya Gunawardane said that a representative of the Swedish company attended the annual general meeting (AGM) last Saturday at the Public Library. He then informed depositors of the details of the payment. This will be capital plus interest which would be paid in full within four years.

Bill to allow aborting foetus on two counts
A Bill will be brought to Parliament to allow termination of pregnancy for two specific reasons.
These are, when the mother carries a foetus with Lethal Congenital Malformation and when a woman becomes a rape victim, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday he said Cabinet approval has been received for this proposal.
Once the law is enacted, mothers will have the opportunity to decide whether to abort the foetus or go ahead with the pregnancy.It will be up to the mother.
But the recommendation will be made by two consultants and it will be done only at a state hospital.
Dr. Jayaratne said doctors can detect a baby with Lethal Congenital Malformation by the 20th week into pregnancy. Mothers undergo hardships with a foetus with birth defects and face a still birth or end up with life long suffering with a child not having basic organs to live.The suffering of the mother and her baby can be prevented, Dr Jayaratne said.
Consultant Gynaecologist Dr U.D.P. Rathnasiri said the bill was not passed before due to political, religious, cultural and social pressure.
But this law is essential to end the suffering of many mothers. All mothers have the right to be free from pain and agony, Dr Rathnasiri said.

Bollywood comes to Yorkshire - and helps the UK film industry strike Gold

Bradford, Doncaster and Rotherham are providing the backdrop for a major Bollywood film starring one of India's biggest names - just one of the foreign productions contributing to Britain's film-making boom.
Anyone who happened to peer through the railings of Doncaster Racecourse last week would have been met with a surreal sight.
India's 1936 Olympic hockey team were greeted by a cheering crowd as they climbed off a vintage coach, before Nazi officers viciously beat a couple of their overenthusiastic fans.
Behind them, giant swastika banners were draped from the racecourse's historic Clock Tower Stand.
But this was just a film set, and Doncaster Racecourse was doubling as Berlin's 1936 Olympic Stadium. It will appear in Gold, an epic new Bollywood movie that tells the story of India's Olympic hockey players in 1936 and 1948.
One of the actors in Doncaster was Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, who is above the likes of Tom Hanks, Ryan Gosling and Ryan Reynolds onForbes magazine's latest listof the world's best-paid actors.
"I rank him in the top five actors in Bollywood," says Suhail Al Belushi, from Leeds, who is one of more than 5,000 local extras in the film.
Al Belushi has taken time out of his day job as a freelance interpreter to appear in the film after seeing Akshay Kumar walk into a hotel in Leeds.
"When I saw him I was shocked," he says. "I thought maybe there's a guy who looks like him. If it was India there would be crowds everywhere, heckling him, following him, wanting photos."
Among the other locations being used, Bradford's Midland Hotel, Harrogate's Old Swan Hotel and Leicester's Grand Hotel are all standing in for different parts of the Bombay Club in colonial Mumbai.
Rotherham FC's old Millmoor stadium doubles as an Indian hockey pitch. Dalton Mills in Keighley is a German army camp. The homes of Bradford Bulls, Leeds Rhinos and York City FC have all had a sprinkle of Bollywood stardust.
"I came here because I liked the locations," director Reema Kagti says.
"For this film, because it's a period film, I needed architecture that's been maintained. Architecture that existed before the '30s and has been maintained till date, and Yorkshire seems to have a lot of that. They really seem to respect their heritage and look after it."
The UK has become the destination of choice for many global film-makers, with talent from both Hollywood and Bollywood making it their home from home.
Movie production in the UK has grown 72% since 2014, the Office for National Statistics has reported.
Last year, 1.3bn was spent by foreign film-makers in Britain, according to the British Film Institute (BFI) - double the figure in 2012.
Most of that came from Hollywood blockbusters like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Transformers: The Last Knight and The Mummy.
But there's a growing trend for Bollywood films to be shot in the UK too.
There are a few reasons behind Britain's allure for overseas film-makers - tax breaks, the weak pound making it cheaper to film here, a readily available pool of skilled crew, plus the historic locations.
There are other attractions, too, for Reema Kagti. She has developed a tasted for local beers. "If I do get any time out, I do go to a pub and drink some ale," she smiles.
Sue Bellarby has worked on 26 Bollywood film sets in the UK, including Gold, where she is unit manager.
"When I started in 2005 there was maybe one a year," she says. "Now we're getting five or six.
"There are three shooting in the north at the moment. There are another two coming in September/October."
In the past, Bollywood film-makers might have recreated British castles or stately homes in state-of-the-art studios in India - but now they are increasingly using the real thing, she says.
"They love the authenticity of shooting here. And I know they get some form of tax incentive. My experience of them is it's as cheap to film here as it is in India now, and they can actually film the locations for real."
And they are increasingly going outside London. Yorkshire and Humber had the fastest-growing film and TV industries in the country between 2009-15,according to Screen Yorkshire, an agency that has been crucial to the area's success.
Gold's location manager Martin Walker says it is becoming more difficult and expensive to film in London. "The costs are becoming prohibitive," he says.
"Unit bases - spaces big enough to get all your big facilities and trucks in - are becoming fewer and fewer as they get developed on or sold out from underneath us, and some of us London-based location managers do worry about how viable London will be in the future as a place to shoot if you cannot physically service your shoot by having your vehicles close by."
Getting out of London has other advantages. "You've got your hotel costs which are half price, you've got great transport links, and you've actually got a population who still finds filming interesting and fun and fascinating and are helpful," he explains.
"Unfortunately London has gone the other way. 'Oh, filming again Right, 50 before I move my car.'"
Kate Smith, a Manchester-based hair and make-up artist, adds: "It is definitely becoming a lot busier up north - the north west, Wales, Yorkshire.
"It used to be at one time that you'd have to live in London to be able to get the work, and you'd move the crew to wherever it was going. But now, the Isle of Man, Ireland, Scotland - it's all booming everywhere."
Bradford - which became the first Unesco City of Film in 2009 - has been the Gold production team's base as well as providing a number of filming locations.
David Wilson, director of Bradford City of Film, says more than 100 films and TV shows have been shot in the city in the last 12 months. That's double the number in 2012, when he reopened the city's film office.
"It's given the city a renewed confidence," he says. "The phone in the film office rings off the walls some days. Every week there's a significant enquiry.
"Sometimes they don't come to fruition but more often than not they do, and we've now gained a reputation as a film-friendly city, and we're reaping the rewards of that."
The money spent on crew and suppliers - from trucks to catering - all makes its way into the local and national economy. And after release, locations often see an increase in tourism, Wilson says.
"You've got the initial production phase, but that also leads to people thinking, do you know what, we might go there. We might go to Yorkshire. It looked brilliant in that film. And so it does dovetail very much into that whole tourism offer."
So perhaps, a year from now, when Gold is released, there could be another surreal sight at Doncaster Racecourse if Indian movie fans are climbing off coaches to see where the movie was shot.
Gold will be released on 15 August 2018.

The Grama Niladhari Association affiliated to the Joint Opposition(JO) says they will not support election related activities at the upcoming Provincial Council polls if the government does not fulfill several demands.
Grama Niladhari Association's Chairman Sumith Kodikara speaking to the media at the N.M.Perera memorial hall in Borella said the Government should first assure the job security of Grama Niladharis because in Sri Lanka there was no such security.
He also urged government to set minimum qualification standards when recruiting Grama Niladhairs, a provision which is absent at present.
He said the current practice of having only a written test and an interview to recruit Grama Niladharis has led to malpractices.
He also urged the government to introduce a proper salary scale for Grama Niladharis and a performance based promotion system.
Kodikara added that the recruitment of retired Grama Niladharis should stop forthwith.
He said that if authorities does not address the above members of his organisation will abstain from election related work.

The other reason is that the Commission is in league with the CID and FCID currently investigating 117 public petitions it had received, regarding mass scale corruption and misappropriation of state funds and assets during the Rajapaksa regime.

Northern Provincial Council Minister Deneeswaran was removed from the Cabinet by Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran, who has informed the Governor.
He had further informed that some of the responsibilities of the Ministry had been given to Ananthy Sasitharan and the balance will be taken over by him.
However, Deneeswaran had earlier written to the Governor that he is continuing as the Minister.
Confused by the current position, the Governor has sought advice from the Attorney Generals Department.
In a context where Ministers Kurukularajah and Ainkaranesan had resigned from the Cabinet, Deneeswaran was hindering the reorganization of the Cabinet. His party TELO had taken a decision to suspend him for six months. Following this, the Chief Minister had informed the Governor that some of the responsibilities will be handed over to Mrs Ananthy Sasitharan and he is taking over the balance.
In a context where the minister had not resigned on his own will and as he was not expelled by a no-confidence motion, a legal problem had cropped up.
This had paved the way for the Governor to seek expert opinion from the Attorney Generals Department.
Meanwhile, the resignation letter of P. Sathiyalingam which was given to the Chief Minister had not been given to the Governor and this had caused delay in Minister designate Kunaseelan taking over the Ministry, it is learnt.

The Exporters Association of Sri Lanka (EASL) records its deep appreciation of the recent announcement made by Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera that the current system of Suspended Value Added Tax (SVAT) will remain unchanged. Prior to the implementation of the SVAT system, exporters experienced serious difficulties including cash flow issues, which constrained in multiple ways, their capacity to trade and compromised their ability to perform
Since 2016, when the sudden proposal to abolish SVAT was announced, the EASL, along with other export industry stakeholders, made collective representation to the government at the highest level, to articulate the importance to continue with the SVAT system.
Exporters are convinced that the current SVAT scheme works seamlessly, efficiently and contributes to significantly reduce the cost of doing business for both direct and indirect exporters.

FAO conducts training on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
In 2016 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Government of Sri Lanka agreed to a project focused on capacity building to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU fishing).
IUU fishing contributes to overfishing and the depletion of fish stocks, undermines sustainable fisheries management, distorts market competition and is frequently associated with national and transnational organized criminal activities.
Estimates of the global cost of IUU fishing are between US$10-US$23.5 billion annually, with developing states being the most susceptible.
The FAO has been engaged in combatting IUU fishing at all levels. In fact, it was through an FAO instrument that the term 'IUU fishing' was coined.
At the international level, the FAO is the main UN organisation through which states have worked to adopt various instruments to combat IUU fishing, including the Compliance Agreement, the International Plan of Action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing, the Voluntary Guidelines on Flag State performance, the recently approved Guidelines on Catch Documentation Schemes and the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU Fishing (commonly referred to as the PSMA).
In order to enhance the awareness of authorised officers on the above, training was arranged by the FAO and the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR) which is being held from the August 21-25 in Wattala.
Assistant FAO Representative (Programme) Dr Dharmassree Wijeratne addressed the gathering said, In all jurisdictions, authorised officers are at the forefront of the fight against IUU fishing. Therefore they must be conversant with the law and the pathways available to effectively deter IUU fishers. I encourage you to participate actively in this training and to make good use of the resource persons, the information provided and the various activities planned this week.
Acting Director (Management), DFAR, Marcus also conveyed the DFAR Director Generals support and encouragement for this training. Pio Manoa, a legal officer from FAO Headquarters (Rome) is taking this weeks training on issues and concepts of IUU fishing, along with the assistance of Broussard from the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime and Vikum Abrew, a senior member of the Bar, who will also lead participants through the national laws and procedures and will preside over a moot court session on Friday.
A total of 32 participants are attending this training which consist of fisheries experts in the DFAR, Commanders and Lieutenants from the Coast Guard and the Sri Lanka Navy.
By the end of this weeks training the FAO and the DFAR hope to have enhanced the participants knowledge and understanding on the framework under international law to combat IUU fishing, national laws and procedures, and gain the necessary skills to achieve successful prosecution.

Winning the Number One corporate citizen of Sri Lanka, for the fifth time, we were conferred the Grand Slam Award, which definitely gave us the greatest source of joy, De Chickera said.
Creating a strong business and building a better world are not conflicting goals  they are both essential ingredients for long-term success," Chickera said while talking about the companys rollercoaster journey in the competition.
Hayleys believes the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award, which is held for the 14th consecutive year, has helped transform the sustainability agendas of the Sri Lankan corporate firms.

The company also produces activated carbon out of coconut shell waste, which De Chikera says is a magical, sustainable product with myriad purposes - such as air and water purification and is also an effective poison antidote and detoxifier".
She also advised the potential competitors of the BCCS 2017 to ensure that they account and report every small step taken towards creating a sustainable business environment, and points out that all matters in the final count.

Make correct statement on Treasury Bond issuance
UNP backbencher Nalin Bandara yesterday insisted that State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena correct his statement on the issuance of Treasury Bonds on February 27,2015 to have caused a loss of Rs. 1 Trillion over the cause of 30 years.
MP Bandara was addressing the media at Sirikotha last morning.
MP Bandara further said it is but simple Mathematics to realise that the loss calculation is erroneous. He also said State Minister Abeywardena who claims himself a former banker, should realise that according to his loss calculation, the annual interest rate for the said Rs.10 billion Treasury bonds maturing in 30 years would be approximately 333%.
MP Bandara also leveled criticism against State Minister Lakshman Yapa for questioning the subcommittee on Economic Affairs headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
This subcommittee includes SLFP ministers such as Nimal Siripala de Silva and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa. I wonder if State Minister Lakshman Yapa does not know about their presence in the subcommittee, MP Bandara said.
MP Bandara pointed out that State Minister Lakshman Yapa laid low when he was a minister in the previous regime and kept silent when former President Mahinda Mahinda Rajapaksa took crucial decisions regarding the countrys economy while allegedly having tea with his family at Temple Trees.
MP Bandara demanded that State Minister Yapa stop brewing conflicts between various people in the Yahapalana government.
Commenting on the manner in which former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa appeared to testify before the CID in connection with the Thajudeen murder case, MP Bandara alleged that she has adapted the scenes from a South-Indian movie over the imprisonment of Jayalalitha Jayram.
MP Bandara wondered if the former First Lady wants to establish south-Indian political stature in Sri Lanka as well. She allegedly brings people from different parts of the country and makes a scene at the CID. We would like to request everyone who will be testifying before the CID to do it in a respectable manner without all the drama, MP Bandara said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the present status of Sri Lanka Cricket, MP Bandara observed that the removal of responsible parties should reach the higher levels.
First they removed the captain. Then they removed the head coach and then the team manager. All attempts failed.
It is high time the President of the Cricket Board and the Minister of Sports should also shoulder the responsibility, MP Bandara pointed out.

March 12 Movement urges Govt. to hold LG polls
The March 12 Movement yesterday urged the government to hold the Local Government election without further delay to preserve the voting rights of the people respecting the public consensus vested upon them on January 8, 2015.
We express our displeasure regarding the continuous postponement of Local Government electionS, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
It has been two years since the dissolution of the Local Government institutions in Sri Lanka. This means the people have been denied of representation at the most basic, grassroots level, which impacts their day-to-day life, health and welfare. Depriving voters of their representation in any of these tiers is a violation of the democratic rights of the people, he added.
The amendment bill with regard to the Local Government elections will be presented in Parliament on August 24. It will be amended to 60 percent under the first-pass-post system and 40 percent under the preferential system. This is a good move. But, this amendment should not lead to the further postponement of elections, he added.
All political parties will be vested with the responsibility to allocate 25 percent quota for women under the preferential voting system. We urge the government to not to reduce the 25 percent quota for women representatives.
Under the new system, political parties are vested with the powers to select their candidates.Therefore, we urge the all political parties to reveal their candidate selection process to the people before the election, Hettiarachchi said.
We request the relevant political parties to submit nominations only for suitable candidates, having taken the relevant points above into consideration. It is also necessary to retain transparency during the entire process of selecting candidates, the PAFFREL Executive Director said.
Creating a clean political culture is a collective responsibility that should be shouldered by the entire citizenry. This responsibility is unavoidable for the Members of Parliament as the representatives of the people respecting the public consensus vested upon them, he added.
The March 12 movement is of the view that it is not too late to bring about a political culture that honours the public consensus having properly comprehended the socio-political needs. The political parties and their leaders should also take prompt action in fostering such a political culture.
Shashi de Mel from Transparency International Sri Lanka, Manjula Gajanayake from the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV),Chaminda Rajakaruna from Sarvodaya and Naveendra Liyanaarchchi from the Sanasa Movement were also spoke.

Mastercard, Educate Lanka make education more accessible to underprivileged women in sl
Mastercard has joined hands with Educate Lanka to empower Sri Lankas young women as part of its 'Doing Well, Doing Good' initiative.
As part of the collaboration, Mastercard will fund a scholarship programme as well as a skills development and mentorship platform, supported by the company.
The initiative seeks to build a more inclusive future for these women, in line with Mastercards global commitment to advancing social and sustainability causes within the communities they operate in.
Commenting on this partnership, Manjula Dissanayake, Founder and President of Educate Lanka, said, For over 10 years, Educate Lanka has been committed to and driven by its paramount mission: to empower every young person from marginalized backgrounds in Sri Lanka with relevant competencies and skills demanded by an ever changing world. By preparing our youth to meet the dynamic demands of the 21st century global citizenry, we are contributing to a stronger, skilled, and inclusive workforce and leadership that would lead Sri Lanka towards its socioeconomic advancement and global competitiveness.
We are thrilled to partner with Mastercard, a pioneer that has demonstrated its leadership and commitment in this space globally, to empower the young women of Sri Lanka. By sharing our collective vision of creating a platform to engage Sri Lankas corporate sector to directly invest their social capital in providing better opportunities for the marginalized, we lay the foundation for long term, large scale change that will impact all future generations and redefine Sri Lankas stature globally.
The Mastercard scholarship programme will provide 50 women from underprivileged backgrounds with mentorship, skills training, as well as employment opportunities through Educate Lankas programmes. Scholarship recipients will be identified by Educate Lanka, who will then monitor their long-term progress with semi-annual feedback and evaluation.
In addition, the mentorship and skills development platform aims to empower approximately 200 female students in its first year through Educate Lankas various programmes. Along with sessions on career and workforce advancement, the initiative will also engage members of Sri Lankas business community to mentor students on leadership development. Leveraging stakeholders expertise and material resources, the programme seeks to enhance participants employability, as well as economic and civic contributions.
Mastercard has always believed that doing well as a company means doing good for society.

We are proud to be working with Educate Lanka and do our part in ensuring a brighter future for not only the youth of the country but for the whole nation, said R. B.

Educate Lanka is the brainchild of Manjula Dissanayake, who developed the educational programme following a series of personal incidents and circumstances that made him reassess his lifes priorities and purpose. He then identified that despite Sri Lanka having a universal education system, poverty was a great barrier between Sri Lankan youth and the opportunities they deserve.
Seeking to empower marginalized youth through education, he founded Educate Lanka, which provided funding from secondary through higher education for more than 1,000 students since 2007.

MR removed by his own amendment: Minister Vijayamuni Soysa
The amendment former President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought to remove former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from the Chairmanship of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has resulted in himself being removed. He now pretends to have forgotten all of this,Irrigation and Water Resource Management Management Minister Gamini Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa said.
The Minister stressed that no matter the opinion, it was President Maithripala Sirisena who is the chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
He mentioned this at a special media briefing at the Department of Irrigation yesterday (22).
I too functioned as a Cabinet Minister in the Rajapaksa government. But, we also witnessed the former President handing over power to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the early hours of January 9 and exiting Temple Trees, Minister Vijayamuni Soysa.
He said, I have lost and I bow my head to the peoples mandate. Basil Rajapaksa left for America soon after, explained Soysa.
According to Section 12 (2) of the Party Constitution, the Chairmanship of the party goes to President Sirisena without contest. This section was amended by former President Rajapaksa so that he can remove former President Kumaratunga from the post of Chairman. At the time, I too raised my hand in favour of the amendment. According to this section, a member of the party, when elected as President automatically inherits the post of Chairman of the party, he said.
Minister Soysa added further that Mahinda Rajapaksa was now speaking in a manner in which he has forgotten all this.
When President Sirisena took office and many party supporters went to his side, along with the central committee, Rajapaksa called President Maithripala Sirisena to the then Speakers house and handed over the Chairmanship over to him without anyone being consulted,the Minister added.
Thereafter, the incumbent President as a show of respect to all party seniors, amended Section 12 (1) of the Constitution. Accordingly, any member who has held the office of President or Prime Minister would be made a Patron of the party and it also allows the Party Chairman to appoint any senior member to the position of Patron. Thus former President Rajapaksa accepted the post of patron, he explained.
Now we need to see why he is talking about the chairmanship. He wants to promote his Podujana Peramuna. This indicates signs of memory loss or perhaps he is forgetting this on purpose. Either way he does not seem to be aware of the difference between Chairman and Patron of the party,the minister.

Nigeria's Boko Haram conflict: Huge rise in child 'human bombs'

There has been a significant increase in the number of children used as human bombs by Boko Haram militants in north-east Nigeria, the United Nations says.
Unicefreports there have been 83 cases so far this year - four times as many as in the whole of last year.
55 were girls under the age of 15 and in one case the bomb was strapped to a baby being carried by a young girl.
Unicef says this tactic is an atrocity causing fear and suspicion of children released by the militants.
According to the UN children's agency, 127 children have been used as bombers in north-east Nigeria since 2014.
The Islamist militants Boko Haram have regularly used children in its insurgency, abducting hundreds of schoolgirls, and forcibly recruiting boys as child soldiers.

Amendments to the Local Government Election Bill which are inconsistent with its nature will be removed during the committee stage of the debate to be taken up in Parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister said the proposed election system could be tested at the Local Government election. He invited all the members to establish an election system that could be accepted by all. The government need not postpone elections, he said. Lets finish everything and hold elections without delay. All should help this endeavour, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the there was a long debate in the country over a new election system.
But as there was an opposition against the proposed system, the formulation of the new system delayed. We have been able to include 55 amendments to the Bill proposed by the Election Commission, he said.
He said women Parliamentarians also have made a suggestion of increasing the women representation to 30 percent.
The Prime Minister made these observations in response to a query made on the amendments to the Bill by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
MP Dissanayake inquired into what the government intends to do with amendments which are not consistent with the nature of the Local Government Election Bill.
You are saying you will bring new amendments to the Bill, but there are many amendments which are inconsistent with the nature of the Bill, MP Dissanayake said.
The Speaker said the government assured that the amendments would be provided to the members by noon today.

The vote would be taken on the same day. He said amendments could be made even after passing the Bill.
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the members should know as to what are the amendments before the debate.

But we dont do so. We have given enough time to propose amendments, Minister Kiriella said.

Two phases of expressway projects to becompleted by 2020
Work on the Godagama-Hambantota section of the Southern Expressway and the third phase of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway would be completed by the end of 2019, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister was moving a supplementary estimate of Rs. 53 billion for debate in Parliament yesterday to finance six large scale road construction projects.

We have spent Rs. 104 billion by the end of July. We need additional money to continue work on these projects uninterruptedly. The supplementary estimate is to meet that shortfall, he said.
Commenting on the Godagama-Hambantota section of the Southern Expressway extending to 96 kilometres, the minister said 35 percent of construction work has been completed, adding that 40 percent of the project would be completed by the year end.
Constructions are being carried out in four phases. We offered the contracts in 2015. The total cost has been estimated at Rs. 265 billion. The Chinese Government provides loan facilities for the project, the minister said.
Minister Kiriella said work on the Kadawatha-Kerawalapitiya section of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway extending to 9.3 kilometres has been expedited.
A half of the constructions of the road would be completed by the year end. It will link the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway with the Southern Expressway, he said.
Kiriella said 142 km of roads were constructed under the Priority Roads Project 3 - Phase I carried out with loans facilitated by the China Development Bank.
The construction of 12 roads is nearing completion. The phase I of the project would be completed within this year. The project would be completed by 2018, he said.
Under the Integrated Road Investment Programme (iRoad), provincial and rural roads extending to 3,130 km and national roads extending to 400 km will be renovated under the ADB funds, he said.
The minister said the new Kelani Bridge Construction Project would get off the ground in October and be completed by March 2020, adding that it would help ease traffic congestion in Peliyagoda and Orugodawatte. The bridge will connect the Colombo commercial capital to the countrys expressway network. The JICA is providing loan facilities for the initiative, Minister Kiriella said.

Pooja cancelled over dispute
A tense situation erupted at the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya yesterday since the 4.30 am pooja could not be held as scheduled despite the presence of a large number of pilgrims.
The reason was a dispute between the Devalaya Kapu Mahattayas, officiating priests and Basnayake Nilame D P Kumarage who is alleged to have taken away the Devalaya key from them after locking the Devalaya.
Basnayake Nilame D P Kumarage when contacted said that when he went to open the Devalaya in the morning the key was not there. Thereafter, he went with a duplicate key to open the Devalaya and a Priest named Lal abused him and asked what authority he had to open the Devalaya. Thereafter, all other priests arrived and closed the main doors of the Devalaya and he returned to his official residence. But Priest Lal had a different story. He alleged that when he arrived with Priest Somipala T Ratnayake to open the Devalaya for the 4.30am pooja, the Basnayake Nilame accompanied by his son and a group and snatched the key and took it away. This was the first time the 4.30am pooja had to be cancelled and it was a bad omen for the country.
Some of the devotees present were seen kicking their heels venting their anger for the cancellation of the scheduled pooja they were longing to participate. Later the 6.30 pooja was held as scheduled since the Basnayake Nilame had returned the key to the Priests.

Present Government established democracy: Kiriella
"Democracy, media freedom, independence of the judiciary and the public service were established by the present Government. Full freedom was established in the university system, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella was participating in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Jaffna University, Vavuniya Campus recently.
He said Vice Chancellors were granted freedom to manage universities as independent institutions and steps were taken to develop the sector in keeping with modern standards by providing material and other resources.
"Everyone should dedicate towards maintaining the education of children since they have to take charge of the country's future. University academics should provide the leadership to students in this endeavour," he said.
The Minister said the irony was that even though university academics - professors, lecturers and deans - ought to give leadership towards resolving problems and issues at universities. But some of them maintained stoic silence, the minister said.
Minister Kirella said the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital was taken over by the Government. The SAITM had been in existence since 2011. Students received education in it for the past five years. The Government was not in a position to take it over even though it wanted to do it.
The reality should be understood by all. No one objected when SAITM was started. Did the doctors parading the streets today protest against it then he asked.
The previous regime granted Rs. 600 million to launch the SAITM. Now five years had passed since it was launched. After the present government assumed office, there were demands to close it down. This proved that a political agenda was behind the demand. It was not about education at all. Those conducting protest campaigns worked for the defeated party at the last elections. This proved that a political hand was behind all these protest campaigns, he said.
He said a big dialogue was in developed countries such as Britain regarding free education. The governing party demanded increasing charges for education while the Labour Party campaigned for free education.
Each student in Britain is given 50,000 sterling pounds to complete their University education. They have to repay it to the university after completing the degree and obtaining employment. While this was the situation in a developed country, we as a developing nation should take pride in our ability to provide free education to our students, the Minister said.
Jaffna district parliamentarians, University Grants Commission Chairman and Dean of the Vavuniya Campus and staff were present.

Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is also alleged to have not moved fast enough of certain of the cases brought against the previous regime.

President highlights need for creating a healthy nation
President Maithripala Sirisena highlighted that everyone is duty bound to create a healthy nation which can take the country forward by preventing people from falling ill.
The President was speaking at the 82nd Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors Union at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre, Colombo yesterday.
We all are duty bound to create a healthy nation. Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) are to play a more responsible role in this endeavour.
It is important to identify the present and future challenges in the health sector for creating a healthy nation, President Sirisena said.
The President pointed out that the country has achieved significant progress in the health sector including disaster mitigation and prevention.
We can be satisfied with the National Health Indicators. The progress of the health sector is a result of a joint effort of public services including Medical Officers of Health (MOH), PHIs and midwives, he added. The President pointed out the importance of utilising modern in our quest for creating a healthy nation.
You have to work towards achieving goals with utilising modern and advanced technology, the President said.

He added that PHIs are rendering a significant service in the process of garbage management and dengue eradication.
President Sirisena further said, it is praiseworthy that PHIs are providing a tremendous service in the dengue eradication drive.Even amidst certain obstacles, PHIs are rendering a magnanimous service to the people and nation.
The government is strengthening the National Health Service as it is a national policy of the country.
Not only the physical and infrastructure development of the health service, it is important to introduce a mechanism to create a healthy nation, the President said.
There should be a methodological approach to minimise patients calling over at hospitals. It can be done by creating a healthy nation.
It is of paramount importance to prevent people from diseases, the President added.
More funds will be allocated to the process of preventing diseases in line with allocating funds for increasing health facilities including infrastructure development, the President said.

Prof Uditha Liyanage commemorated
Postgraduate Institute of Management Alumni Association (PIMA) collaborated with Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) to commemorate and appreciate the late Prof Uditha Liyanage's contribution to the marketing fraternity in the country and beyond.
The PIM library was re-named as the Prof Uditha Liyanage Momorial Library on the occasion.
A review on Prof Liyanage's book Consumer Strategy was made by the keynote speaker Deepal Sooriyaarachchi who is a Chartered Marketer, advertising professional, management consultant, trainer and author.
Sooriyaarachchi said Prof Uditha Liyanage as a mentor elevated the standards of management and marketing to higher levels and walked the talk by practising what he preached.
Prof Liyanage had always advised his students to be brilliant in basics'. Following the footsteps of the legacy he left, we abide by his philosophical and experiential concepts and his teachings.
"I met Uditha in the corporate world. Our discussions mainly revolved around Buddhism and marketing. I see him as a strategist and sociologist who also had a sense for the market as an academic and a philosopher.
"An essential ability of a strategist is his ability to forecast the future. In the chapter on CSR in his book he re-defines how a business should be and invites corporates to re-think the approach towards CSR.
"He wanted students to understand that strategy development is not planning.
"A marketer is essentially a sociologist and Uditha was a fine example. He emphasized looking after the consumer constantly. He has researched the evolving Sri Lankan consumer in his book and his understanding on the local consumer is profound."
"I invite SLIM and CIM to continue this research work as the Sri Lankan consumer is evolving and Uditha has formed a healthy base to build on.
"He once said, If you do not know who Gunadasa Kapuge is, Mr Marketer...you have lost your plot, since Colombo is not Sri Lanka.
"In the Sri Lankan context, while on one side we want to be modern, at the same time we are deeply rooted in tradition. This deep rooted reality is unique to us thus marketers and social changers should understand that.
"Tangibalizing the intangible is commonly taught in marketing. Uditha went beyond that and got insights for these facts from the deep Buddhist teachings to opine that there are different levels of tangibility to determine pitching an offer appropriately.
"Uditha said there can be more than functional and emotional values for a consumer on a product or service. He shed light on a five-fold value package, that is, functional, experiential, relational, social and psychological as different value propositions.
"Uditha came up with these concepts after having done significant research.
"I invite SLIM to put some of Uditha's work into the syllabus and allow Sri Lankan marketers to benefit from these theories or else they will remain only in the domain of textbooks. CIM too could treat these as valuable stuff to add value to Kotler's marketing," said Sooriyaarachchi.
Dr Wickrema Weerasooria said, People regarded PIM and Uditha as one. Uditha was not the traditional academic. He came to academia via business. What propelled him to the high pedestal that he ultimately attained was his ability as an eloquent speaker, communicator and a lucid thinker.
"Being tall, slim and handsome and fit and sporting his well groomed Gallic mustache, he stood out in any gathering. That was his signature look. He had a wonderful sense of humour. He always had the genuine passion for the subject at hand.
"He told us at PIM to go back to basics and teach the elementary stuff which became the theme of every seminar of ours.
Many people jump the basics and try to be very eloquent and important, which people do not understand, said Dr Weerasooriya.
A panel discussion took place moderated by PIM Director and Chairman of the Board of Management, Prof Ajantha Dharmasiri with Founder of CIM Sri Lanka, Eardley Perera and CIM Sri Lanka President, Asanga Ranasinghe. Prof Dharmasiri defined late Prof Liyanage as a legend and Sage of our Age'.
Eardly Perera who had been a teacher of Prof Uditha Liyanage said, Uditha commenced teaching with the very consumer centric subject: the behavioural aspects of marketing. He was consumer centric, strategy driven and research oriented.
Thus Uditha blossomed to be one of Sri Lanka's most sought-after lecturers in management and marketing.
Sriyani Liyanage and Chathuri Liyanage, beloved wife and daughter of the late Prof Liyanage attended the commemoration along with a gamut of marketers and past and present PIM students.

Rajapaksa terms new Inland Revenue Act, unacceptable
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday, said the Bill to replace the Inland Revenue Act No: 10 of 2006 was unacceptable.
The Bill is to be taken up in Parliament on Friday (25). "We oppose this Inland Revenue Bill for several reasons," Rajapaksa said in a media statement.
Citing reasons he said, under Clause 5(2)(f) of the Bill, the employers contribution to a provident fund will be considered a part of an employees taxable income and it will make EPF payments a burden to employees.
Under Item 8 of its first schedule, the tax on income generated by provident funds through their investments will increase from the present 10 percent to 14 percent, thus reducing the income available to fund members, he added.
He also criticized the clauses which refers to the amendments regarding the tax imposed on places of worship .
Furthermore, the existing 2006 Inland Revenue Act provides concessions through Chapter III on tax exemptions to various fields deemed worthy of preservation such as local handicraft industries, film and drama producers etc. This Chapter also has concessions for various economic activities such as new undertakings in pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, production for import substitution etc. There are over 200 such exemptions in the present law. All those concessions are to be removed by the proposed new law, he added..
Rajapaksa noted, Independent professionals are at present taxed at flat rates for incomes above the tax free threshold of Rs. 500,000, at 12 percent for up to Rs. 25 million a year, going up to 16 percent for anything above 35 million. Under the proposed law, professionals will be taxed at the rates applicable to individuals, tax free for the first Rs. 600,000 and for each succeeding Rs. 600,000 at rates starting at 4 percent and increasing gradually to 8 percent, 12 percent, 16 percent, 20 percent with the maximum rate of 24 percent applying to any income above Rs.3 million a year. The income tax for professionals had been kept low so as to encourage them to remain in Sri Lanka without moving overseas.
He also found fault with rental income being subjected to a 10percent withholding tax.
Rajapaksa also criticized giving more power to the Commissioner General in the new Bill.
He said the policy on which the proposed new Inland revenue law is based, is in keeping with the ideology of the UNP but is contrary to that of the SLFP.
He urged all MPs of the SLFP to vote against the Bill when it comes up in Parliament.

Remove Rajapakshe : UNP informs President
The United National Party has officially informed President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Justice and Buddasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, from his post.
The UNP leadership has informed President Maithripala Sirisena to take necessary action to remove Dr. Wjeyadasa Rajapakshe from all his Ministry posts. This follows a UNP working committee decision that Rajapakshe had failed to abide by working committee decisions and continued to criticise government ministers and its policies, UNP General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
Hashim said in a press release that during the working committee meeting held on August 17, allegations were made against Minister Rajapakshe saying he was breaching collective responsibility of the Cabinet and the party.
The committee unanimously decided that he should be given time till August 21 to correct his statements failing which he should be removed from all ministry posts if he failed to do so before that date. Accordingly the working committee held discussions with party President Malik Samarawickreme and notified Minister Rajapakshe who agreed to it.
However he had later breached that agreement by failing to retract his previous statements and again breached collective responsibility last weekend by continuing to criticise Ministers of the party and government policy.
Given Rajapakshes failure to abide by the working committee, it unanimously decided that he (Rajapakshe) should be removed from all his ministry posts.
Meanwhile, UNP MP Nalin Bandara briefing media at Sirikotha yesterday morning said the call for removal of Minister Rajapakshe does not extend to party level. The demand is only restricted to his position as a cabinet minister. There is no demand as yet to remove Rajapaksa from the UNP, he said.
MP Bandara said they have forwarded the request to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding the matter and expressed his confidence over the possible removal of Minister Rajapakshe from his position as a Cabinet minister. To my understanding, the President will agree with a request made by the Prime Minister in this matters. We are awaiting a final decision with much confidence MP Bandara said.
MP Nalin Bandara rhetorically speaking said if there is friend who is an enemy in disguise or if a person is in our house who is a friend of our enemy, that person should be expelled from our house.
The reasons to call for removal of Wijayedasa Rajapakshe from his position as a Cabinet Minister were twofold, MP Bandara pointed out.
He said the dominant reason was Wijayedasa Rajapakshes failure to accomplish his functions as the Minister of Justice in the Yahapalana government. MP Bandara pointed out establishing a solid legal and administrative structure against corruption was one of the main campaign promises made by the Yahapalana government.
The Yahapalana government was elected in 2015 with 6.2 million votes, as a result of a rallying call against corruption. People urged us to enforce law correctly and fairly. To achieve this goal, the administrative structure of the legal entities must undergo a change, which did not happen as yet. Or we need to expedite the fight against corruption using the current legal framework. Minister of Justice didnt opt for either, UNP MP Nalin Bandara said.
MP Bandara explained the other reason which compelled them to demand the removal of Rajapakshe from his position to be his irresponsible comment over the Hambantota port agreement.
Secondly, Wijayedasa Rajapakshe failed to abide by the collective responsibility that every Cabinet minister holds. His comment on the Hambantota Port agreement was irresponsible coming from a Cabinet minister. The Cabinet takes collective decisions and it is unbecoming for a Cabinet minister to go outside and criticize a decision the Cabinet collectively took, MP Nalin Bandara explained.
MP Bandara further pointed out that the demand to expedite legal action against the corruption in previous regime will not take the shape of what happened with former chief justice Shiranti Bandaranayake. Our demand is to expedite not to interfere with the legal system. MP Bandara pointed out how the case against Filed Marshal Sarath Fonseka was taken up by a three member committee which conducted its hearing on a daily basis. We have examples and provisions to expedite hearing of these cases. There is no use of the Attorney General if it is acting in the same manner it did under the previous regime. Bandara added.
MP Bandara also pointed out the Joint Opposition has lured Wijayedasa Rajapakshe into a trap where they have fed him with dreams of running for presidency as the common candidate in the next coming 2020 presidential election. The largest group of thieves is with the Joint Opposition. They are trying to manipulate Wijayedasa Rajapakshe to slow down the legal procedure against them. Now, one JO member said he was bitten by a viper, when he was summoned to testify on corruption allegations. Even this lady skipped testifying before the CID over the Thajudeen murder case four or five times. Bandara said.
MP Bandara expressed his confidence over expedite legal process against crime and corruption allegations when barricades in its way be lifted in near future.

Rishad calls for UN support for industrial waste management, green manufacturing, SMEs
The Sri Lankan industry sector has called for an enhanced role of the UN in its development while the UN praised Sri Lankas commitment to sustainable and inclusive industrialization in line with Target 9.2 of the global Sustainable Development Framework.
Its great that the Ministry of Industry is committed to the Sustainable Development Framework, said UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Una McCauley at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
UN Resident Coordinator McCauley was making a courtesy call on the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen recently at the Ministry.
At the discussion, Minister Bathiudeen was joined by his Senior Advisor Himali Jinadasa.
We thank the UN for its ongoing support to our industry development. Specially, UNIDOs interest in ushering inclusive and sustainable industrialization framework to Sri Lanka will be a great opening for our industries, said Minister Bathiudeen.
It is time that Sri Lanka starts integrating with the United Nations Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF) closely. We call for enhanced support from UN for sustainable industry development, industrial waste management, green industries, and SME development.
We have finalised our National SME Policy and are now preparing to submit it to Parliament and we thank the ILO in Colombo for the support given to finalise it. As the Resident Coordinator, we also call for your support and intervention to link UNIDO with the Ministrys efforts more closely. The industry reform vision of our Unity Government aims at taking our industries to next level such as robotics and high value addition manufacturing, where UNIDO could help us greatly.
SDG 9.2 (referred to as Target 9.2) the sub-category of Sustainable Development Goals of UN that relates to industries promotes sustainable industrialization and raises industrys share of employment and gross domestic product and in least developed countries, doubles industry share.
Resident Coordinator McCauley praised Minister Bathiudeen for his interest in the Target 9.2 Framework. Its great that the Ministry of Industry is focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals, especially at a time when the UN is trying to directly partner with the Government and Ministries in their projects. If the Ministry can identify the areas you would like technical support on, we as the UN can support in sourcing the necessary expertise.
We believe that Sri Lanka can utilize success stories from other countries in its industrialization efforts.
It is believed that SDG 9 shall also be utilised in major industrial reforms proposed by the Unity Government of Sri Lanka.
