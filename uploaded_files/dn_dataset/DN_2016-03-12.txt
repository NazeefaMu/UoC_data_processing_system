Chandimal stole the limelight, now the spotlight
The 2015/16 inter-school cricket season has reached its peak with the annual big matches. Following the Ananda-Nalanda and Josephian-Peterite encounters this weekend, the oldest inter-school match - the Battle of the Blues three-day encounter between Royal and S.Thomas is due to commence at the SSC ground on Thursday.
Simultaneously, the 38th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year most popular contest too is reaching its peak with more votes pouring in for the leading schoolboy cricketers. The contest is sponsored by Sri Lanka's national mobile service provider - SLT Mobitel, which has taken the four-decade-old contest towards new heights.
With the ICC World T20 tournament about to get underway with Sri Lanka as the defending champions, it would be interesting to have a look at the former Observer Schoolboy Cricketers who had actively contributed towards Sri Lanka's World Cup triumph in 1996 in the ODI format. Leading the 1996 champion Sri Lanka side was Arjuna Ranatunga who had the honour of winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice in 1980 and 1982.
Besides Ranatunga, there had been several other past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title winners in that champion outfit which opened a new chapter in Sri Lanka sport by conquering the Mount Everest in cricket. They are Asanka Gurusinha (1985), Roshan Mahanama (1983 and 1984), Muttiah Muralitharan (1991), Kumara Dharmasena (1989) and Marvan Atapattu (1990).
Sanath Jayasuriya, who was a member of that champion team and adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 World Cup tournament, too had been a recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year outstation title. Those credentials are ample testimony to prove that the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer has always produced future champions of the international arena.
It was the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show which first brought celebrated spinner Muttiah Muralitharan to a major cricket awards platform when he was adjudged the recipient of the glamorous award in 1991. Having captured over 100 wickets each in two successive school seasons for St. Anthony's College, Katugastota, the spin wizard was the unanimous choice for the top award exactly 25 years ago.
In one of his past interviews, Muralitharan recalled those humble beginnings which ultimately elevated him to become the world record holder for the most number of Test wickets. A contest of this nature means a lot to young cricketers. When I was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1991, it gave me tremendous satisfaction and spurred me on. It was due to inter-school cricket and the encouragement it gave me that I have been able to go places, he was quoted as saying.
In addition to those champions of yesteryear, former T20 captain Dinesh Chandimal who is in cracking form in Sri Lanka's lead up to the ICC T20 World Cup, too had been a proud recipient of the coveted Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2009.
It would be interesting to see how the 2009 Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy cricketer fares in the World T20 tournament which begins in a few days time. The decision to play Chandimal as an opening batsman has turned out to be a wise decision. He has scored two half centuries in the four innings he has played as an opening batsman in T20 Internationals. In contrast, he scored just one half century in 28 previous innings he had played in while batting in other positions in T20 Internationals.
Chandimal's quick-fire 58 off 49 balls with one six and seven fours in Sri Lanka's last Asia Cup T20 International against Pakistan on Friday was a treat to watch. Chandimal also made a run-a-ball 37 in Sri Lanka's previous T20 match against the hosts Bangladesh.
We could hear greater feats from this past Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer award winner during the ICC T20 World Cup which starts on Tuesday.

Dilshan's to-do list for World T20: Play good cricket, upset plans and a bit of Dilscoop
"My kids have already started playing the Dilscoop. My son is playing it better than me," Tillakaratne Dilshan, the Sri Lankan batsman after whom the scoop shot over the wicketkeeper is named, quipped.
One of the innovations in modern batting, Dilscoop is a shot that has not only got him a lot of runsbut also helped him bag the Man of the Tournament award in the 2009 edition of the ICC World T20, where Sri Lanka finished as runners-up.
Narrating the necessity for the innovation, he said, "In the 2009 edition of the IPL (Indian Premier League), everyone played paddle sweep. But they could place a fielder to stop that. I wanted to put a little bit more behind the wicketkeeper, that's why I played one shot against Deccan Chargers. (Adam) Gilchrist was behind the stumps. After I played that shot, he was upset and went back.Following that, I felt more easy to go down the track and hit."
"I went to Sri Lanka and practiced for one month from tennis ball just before the World Cup. After I practiced, I became more confident. In the first game of the tournament, I tried the shot against Shane Watson and it went for a six," he added at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday (March 10).
Having lived under the shadows of the achievements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara for nearly a decade, Dilshan has now the onus of helping an inexperienced Sri Lankan side defend the ICC World T20 title in the most unlikeliest of circumstances.
Not only have Sri Lanka lost two of its most successful and experienced batsmen to retirement, but the injury to Lasith Malinga has dented their chances going into the tournament furthermore. A poor run of form, a new captain and changes in the selection panel has made their plans all the more unstable. However, the opening batsman doesn't think there will be additional responsibility on him.
"(My role remains the) Same. I have been opening since 2009 and I am going to continue doing the same thing, no change. If I play that shot - Dilscoop and some reverse sweeps, I can make the bowlers think twice. I am not going to change anything, since 2009 I've played (like that) and found success."
Despite the lack of experience in the Sri Lankan ranks, the 39-year old sounded optimistic about the team's chances to punch above their weight yet again in a World Cup.
"We came here to win the World Cup, no doubt about that. We've come to play good cricket starting from tomorrow (when Sri Lanka take on New Zealand in a warm-up match). We have a lot of experience (playing in India), playing IPL, other tournaments as well."
"Just before the World Cup we played three T20s against India. This is good for the youngsters. As few senior guys are touring, we know how to adjust to wickets and conditions." CRICBUZZ

HONOURING OUR SAG
The Daily News continues its feature of the 25 sports athletes who won gold medals at the recently concluded South Asian Games in Guwahati.
Himasha Eshan: Men's 100m
Himasha Eshan who won the Gold medal in the men's 100m to become the fastest man in South Asia at the South Asian Games (SAG) which held at Guwahati, India. He broke Chinthaka Soysa's 17-year- old record of 10:29 in 1999 by clocking 10:28 and renewed the South Asian 100m record too. When he was in Grade 4 in Dodangoda Miriswatta National School, he got the opportunity to move to Kalutara Vidyalaya and that was the turning point in his sporting career.
Himasha Eshan
The experience of finishing fifth place in the 100m event at the Asian Junior Sports Festival in 2012 was a motivation to go for the gold medal in the Asian Athletic Games Championship in 2013. He won the 100x4m relay and followed it up with a win in the Lucifornia Sports Festival's in the 100x4 and 100m silver medal in 2014 Asian Junior Sports Festival. He also participated at the World Junior Athletic Championship in America. He made a strong bid to break the 100x4m Sri Lankan Record at the Asian Athletic Championship last year but failed narrowly.
"Once an allegation of taking a banned steroid (drugs) was leveled against me and I was banned from participating. But my coach Chaminda Perera, teachers and relatives were behind me and I got a chance to free myself from blame," medalist Himasha said.
Prof Arjuna de Silva of the Ministry of Sports forecast that according to his genetic strength, Himasha would surely participate at the Olympics.
Himasha is from a middle class family, his father is a minor businessman and mother who is a housewife. He has an elder brother and a sister.
Suranjaya de Silva: Men's 200m
Suranjaya de Silva won the 200m at the SAG Games at Guwahati, India and by doing so fulfilled a dream. Suranjaya was born in Brahmanawatte, an urban village off Balapitiya and studied at Revatha Vidyalaya and Ambalangoda Devananda Vidyalaya. He was not an outstanding athlete in school but he showed his colours at the last National Sports Festival breaking the 100m and 200m event records.Suranjaya said that he was unable to break the Sri Lanka record because of the cool climate in Guwahati and the lack of synthetic tracks in Sri Lanka which is hindering his progress.
"I won the Bronze in the 100x4m relay at the Army Athletic Championship in Korea and I broke a Sri Lankan record in the 100x4m event at the Woohan Asian Athletic Championship. I have no big experience about international games but I have self confidence to go a long journey," said Suranjaya.
Suranjaya paid a glowing tribute to his coach Chaminda Perera, Maj. Gen. Palitha Fernando (SL Army), Maj. Muthumala and Tharushi for the support extended to him to reach this standard.
Suranjaya's father is a mason and his mother is a housewife who supports him. He is a Corporal of the SL Army Electric and Mechanical Engineering regiment.

ICC World T20 warm-up matches
[Sri Lanka men lose, women win]
Sri Lanka once again suffered at the hands of Colin Munro who already hit the second fastest fifty in Twenty20 against them when he clobbered a 21-ball fifty (inclusive of six sixes) as New Zealand won their ICC World T20 warm-up match by 74 runs at Mumbai.
New Zealand batting first rattled up 226-4 and Sri Lanka replied with 152-7.
Tim Southee and Anderson displayed seam and swing at good pace to make the opening combination of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal more circumspect.
Dilshan had his leg stump pushed back after he was trumped by a perfect late and quick inswinger from Anderson.
Chandimal, who admitted he takes his time to get settled, was beaten by the extreme pace and movement of Adam Milne, who replaced Southee in the fourth over. The rest of the Sri Lankan batsmen, too, failed to make any impact.
Scores: New Zealand 226-4 in 20 overs (M Guptill 41, C Munro 67, C Anderson 60 rtd out, G Elliott 36 n.o., D Shanaka 2/48)
Sri Lanka 152-7 in 20 overs (L Thirimanne 41, C Kapugedera 38, A Mathews 25 n.o., A Milne 3/26, I Sodhi 2/19)
[Womens match]
In Bengaluru, Sri Lanka skittled Bangladesh for 95 with one ball to spare after electing to field and then surpassed the modest target in 18.1 overs.
Nigar Sultana played a lone hand for Bangladesh with 33 as seamer Oshadi Ranasinghe claimed three wickets for 14 runs and Eshani Lokusuriyage took two for 17.
Sri Lanka was coasting at 49 for one when Bangladesh fought back with three wickets in the space of eight runs, but Ranasinghe and Lokusuriyage teamed up again to steer their side home.
Ranasinghe returned unbeaten on 18 and Lokusuriyage made 16 not out after leg-spinner Rumana Ahmed claimed three wickets for nine runs in four overs.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP: Now it's time for schools rugby
As the inter-school cricket season draws to a close and the last few overs are being bowled, there are those who are looking forward to a more vigorous game - rugby. In Kandy sports has always played a large part in the life of school children. Rugby in Kandy is now the number one glamour sport. Its popularity is such that crowds from anything between 5,000 and 10,000 are almost commonplace at most of the matches. Whatever the secret Kandy schools keep producing some of the top class ruggerites. Sports like rugby is one of the most popular leisure-time activities among youngsters, and is often organized in the form of extra-curricular activities at schools because of the increasing number of children participating in rugby from all over.
The main rugby playing schools from Kandy are Trinity, Dharmaraja, Kingwood, St Anthony's, St Sylvester's, Sri Sumangala and Sri Rahula.
Nushan Weerasinghe 1000 runs
Nushan Weerasinghe becomes the second Trinitian this season to pass the 1000-run mark. A stylish opening batsman he is also a fine right-arm off-break bowler who is the acting captain of the side. He first played for the school in 2013, where he played only a few games, then in 2014 he went as a middle order batsman and scored 580, in 2015 he made 560 runs and this year he was doing duty for the Sri Lanka under 19 team and had to miss many games. But despite that he managed to complete 1000 runs (1020 runs). He hails from a famous sporting family. His grandfather William Weerasinghe was a well known sportsman and promoter from Dharmaraja College. His father Mahesh too was a good sportsman for the same school and at present is the senior vice- president of Kandy Sports Club
KDCA to have the AGM after 4 years
The talk of the town is about two rivals who supported two different factions at the Sri Lanka Cricket AGM, have now got together and are being forced to hold the AGM. The last AGM was held in February 2013. According to the KDCA Secretary the former Sports Minister had brought in a ruling that there was no need to have AGMs every year. Normally the District AGM's are held before the controlling body's AGM. At present there are no domestic tournaments for clubs in Kandy. The game is not promoted in a proper manner. It seems that KDCA wakes up only when there is an international cricket match at Pallekelle Stadium.

Ryde Gold Medal winner Rayan Weerakoon
The highest award at Trinity College the Ryde Gold Medal which is presented to the best all-round student of the school, was awarded to Boxing Lion and Rugby coloursman Rayan Weerakoon.
The award was presented at the school prize giving by chief guest Minister Faizal Mustapha. The Ryde Gold Medal is awarded each year to the best all-round senior student at Trinity College, Kandy. The Ryde Gold Medal is the highest honor that the School can bestow. It is awarded on the result of a secret ballot conducted among the senior boys (Grade 11-14) and the staff whose votes, together with that of the Principal, each count as one.
While this system makes deadlock possible, it is only on four occasions that the Medal has not been awarded as a result of the three votes going to three different people. The Medal cannot be won more than once. The Ryde Gold Medal was first presented in 1908 to John Andrew, but he was not the first boy in the history of the school to be adjudged the best all-rounder. Historical records show that such a prize has been awarded as early as 1894. The Ryde Gold Medal is named after Rev. R. W. Ryde, a former principal of Trinity (1900-1902).

Leadership, at times, is a lonely place: Kumar Sangakkara
Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. Ask Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan great, who has not just done things right, but has also done the right things for over 15 years of being involved in the sport.
Known as one of the most influential personalities of the generation, to having achieved legendary status as a batsman and reaffirming claims that he wasn't just cut out for commonplace stardom, Sangakkkara can boast of possessing a rather ornate cap. That, however, didn't take him too far away from the person he wanted to be, admitting that the test to truly find oneself could only be realised once curtains were drawn on the game.
Self-effacing, forthright, sophisticated and refined, Sangakkara opens up about the nuances of leadership, learnings, his approach to the game and the importance of setting an example, in an exclusive chat.
Excerpts:
Given your success I'm sure there were times you felt pressure. How did you deal with it
Pressure is part and parcel of the sport. The more success you have, the more pressure you're put under because of the expectations - not just from spectators, but those of yourself and also of the team. It's like a double-edged sword or a Catch 22 situation where you understand what pressure is and keep battling through that and find new ways of dealing with it. But that's also the beauty of playing the sport at this level; that's what really tests you. Your skill level can always be at a high but how you deal with situations, how you play in accordance to the situation and how you deal with pressure and challenges in the middle is what finally gets you through and that skill converts talent into ability and winning performances.
As a captain, there are naturally different kinds of challenges... did you find the expectations of yourself change too much
Sometimes, you fall into that trap where you think, I'm the captain and I've got to do a lot more than I was doing before'. But it's very important to compartmentalise leadership. When you're batting, you bat as a batsman and find ways to score runs. To be effective for your side, you don't have to have the captain's cap on all the time because it's just of no use, as if you do get out and are sitting in the dressing room, there's not much captaining left for you to do.
It's important to understand that when you're fielding is when you're essentially marshalling your troops, strategising and making the hard decisions. That's when you're really captaining. If you can break that down and come to grips with it, it becomes a bit easier.
A captain is as good as his team - thoughts
Being a good captain is about pulling your own weight in the side and making sure you perform. The better you perform, the easier captaincy becomes. It's a nice interesting balance about your own performance and also surrounding yourself with players of quality which makes captaincy the easiest job because you know you have match-winners in your side. You know people can execute whatever's asked of them. So decision-making becomes very easy. Take Ricky Ponting and the Aussie side that he had under him for a few years. Hard decisions were very rare because you just had to look at your team and knew exactly what they were capable of.
How important is it for a captain to be a people's person
It's very important be a good man manager. You need to be able to understand the capabilities of the players. Once you strategise, you need to be able to pick the players to execute them. You also need to ensure people are thinking for themselves because in tough situations, leadership becomes situational where certain players step up to lead the side with their performance or with a little spark of brilliance. That sometimes makes a captain look good even though that was beyond his control.
What is the basic prerequisite to be a good leader
Communication, and also, being able to gain respect by ensuring that you are setting an example. It's important to understand, to talk to different players in different ways to which they can relate and understand what is required. Knowing the players on a more personal, intimate level, knowing what their background is, how they think, what their emotional state is at the time, whether they have issues that need to be dealt with, various things like that help, and that comes as you keep playing and you interact more and more. It's important to understand people and be able to motivate them in customised, individual ways that gets the best out of them. That's ultimately your job - to get the best out of your players and hope that that best is good enough to win. When winning, the team is given credit, when losing, the captain comes in the firing line...
That's just the nature of the job. When you win, you always say we, when you lose, you say I'. It's not too much to take to heart. You need to understand that at the end of the day, the responsibility lies solely with you and your test is mainly at the time of a loss. But sometimes, you're tested when you win as well and understand that it is important to know that it's a collective that finally stands out and gets the credit and the applause. But leadership, at times, is a lonely place. If you can't do it, it's best not to take it up in the first place.
What kind of a challenge does adapting to different formats as a captain pose
It's about decision-making processes and strategising really, and also being able to understand that T20 cricket requires you to make decisions very, very quickly. There's just no time for catch up, whereas, in one-day cricket you have more time, and in Tests you have even more time. But also to enjoy the challenge, relish the changing formats and adapt your mental side of the game. It also requires you to be able to be quick on your feet and be situational in your thinking, and at times to be able to adapt throughout.
There's also the aspect of being able to recognise what's happening with your players. You need to know whether a decision you make regarding a player is apt for that time. Sometimes you make decisions on hope, sometimes on gut and sometimes based on reading the game and where you are - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If you don't enjoy those situations, it's really tough to do well.
Did you have a set formula to approach your game
I had a pretty set method of preparation, but the longer I played I realised that you prepare very hard and well and you have a foundation that you trust and fall back on, but when you go into bat, you always bat with an open mind because you don't know what's going to happen on that wicket or how the bowlers will bowl on the day. So you allow yourself to be flexible and fluid for a while and once you understand what's happening, then you can formulate a method of trying to dominate.
What was your set method of preparation
My approach to batting is very simple: just to play the ball on merit when I start with, while assessing conditions and bowlers.
Then look for ways to score because I believe batting is about scoring runs. In Test cricket situations where you sometimes score slowly, sometimes quicker, in ODI cricket, you can set your own tempo, but sometimes, the tempo is set for you. And in T20 cricket it's about ensuring that you're open enough to take risks right from the start. So my formula was basically to adapt to situations in the two longer formats and take my time to ensure that I have a good enough base from where I can launch and in T20 cricket, just smile and enjoy myself.
Do you think budding T20 leagues will prompt premature retirements
If you are your country's best player, you're firmly able to play Test matches. At the end of the day, I think it's the finances that drive decisions at certain times in your career. But I know for a fact that all players take the greatest pride in playing Test cricket for their country. T20 cricket has given cricketers who can't make it in Tests the opportunity, or those who had careers, to go beyond that and play franchise cricket.There have been moments of friction between players and boards that has led to some fantastic players not playing for their country. But those are situations that can be worked on in the future and prevented by having a better understanding, rapport and communication between players and administrators as to how best to approach this relationship between international cricket and franchise cricket.
Players will themselves have to understand that they can't have the whole cake and eat it too. They'll have to prioritise commitments and also be given the opportunity to maximise their earning capabilities in franchise cricket.
Your advice to youngsters who want to take up the sport
It's a great sport to play. It's a very special sport because it's one that's got a certain character to it that is not present in other sports. But there's also an expectation of a cricketer that is to be much more than in any other sport. So it's a great test of character for a young kid, but at the same time, it's a great skilful athletic sport that's a viable profession that gives great opportunities as long as you understand that playing this game to the best of your abilities in the most honest manner possible is what will open those doors for you. So if you're taking up the sport, take it up seriously. Have fun, enjoy it, otherwise you won't do well, but when you do get those opportunities, ensure that you leave a mark.
Looking back, what have you learnt from the game
It has made me realise how lucky I've been. To be able to play the sport for such a long time, and to have the career I've had, has given me a lot of good things, but at the same time it has made me understand that it's just a game and a sport; it's not real life.
As much as we want it to be, it's not and that there's a lot of life to be lived beyond the game as well. It doesn't matter how many runs you've scored or what you've achieved in cricket, the real test comes once you've gone away from the sport and face real life without the glitz and the glamour. That's where you actually find yourself. - CRICBUZZ

One horse race for Kandy SC
It is going to be a one horse race when the defending champions Kandy Sports Club takes on CH and FC in the quarter finals of the Clifford Cup knock out rugby tournament match to be played a the Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy today Secretary at 4.30 pm.
Kandy Sports Club who were unbeaten in the Dialog League will continue to carry on from where they left. They should have no difficulty in overcoming CH and FC playing in their home terrain and before their home crowd.
Last year Kandy Sports Club won both the League and the knock out tournaments after a lapse of three years. This year they will make a determined efforts to give a report performance.
Early this week there some doubts about the match and also the venue. It has been now confirmed that this match will be played today (Saturday) and the venue will be Nittawela.
In the name of neutral venue there is no point in playing this match at a venue outside Kandy as it will, deprive the spectators of witnessing club rugby as the expenses involved in travelling out of Kandy and the lack of public transport for the after the match could make the spectators thing twice before going for the match. If this takes place then the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union will be deprived of a good gate collection and the rugby fans of their entertainment and the match will be played before a deserted stands.
At its most there will be only two more club rugby matches in the hill capital and the officials should seriously think of playing these two matches in the city of Kandy and Nittawela be not necessarily the venue though it is an ideal one as the matches could be witnessed from close range and the security fence prevents the spectators from invading the playing area.
In the past the problem at Nittawela were a creation of armed combatants who pounced on unarmed and innocent spectators. Sine last yea this trend has been stopped and the matches are played peacefully.

Sooriyabandara and Kariyawasam shatter Thomian hopes
One drop bat Pasindu Sooriyabandara (97 n.o) and No.7 Malith Kariyawasam (78) shattered S.Thomas' hopes of enforcing Royal to follow on with a steady 139-run partnership for the sixth wicket on day two of their 137th Battle of the Blues three-day cricket encounter continued at SSC grounds, Colombo yesterday. Dialog Axiata is the proud sponsor of the world's second oldest cricket encounter.
Royals Malith Kariyawasam who madea fine knock of 78 and put on 139 runs
for the sixth wicket with PasinduSooriyabandara plays a shot.
Their fighting partnership enabled Royal to bat the entire day to make 280 for 7 at close, still trailing by 70 runs on the first innings with three first innings wickets in hand.
Royal, in reply to the commanding Thomian first innings total of 350 for 5 declared, were reeling at 122 for 5 when Kariyawasam joined Sooriyabandara in the post-lunch session after the Reid Avenue boys had lost four wickets, including in-form captain Geeshath Panditharatne, in the first session last morning.
Expectations of the Thomain supporters were high when Royal lost its fifth wicket after lunch, as Thiran Dhanapala was caught behind by Dilendra Gunathillake off medium paceman Hansaka Liyanaarachchi for nine runs in the 50th over. Royal, known to have a weak set of tail-enders, were in deep trouble after the loss of Dhanapala's wicket, still needing 78 runs to avert follow on with only five wickets in hand.
But Sooriyabandara and Kariyawasam took the challenge bravely and embarked on a great mission to put Royal out of trouble. They shattered whatever the hopes S.Thomas' had of enforcing a follow on with a fighting performance. Initially, the duo put their heads down and picked the occasional bad deliveries to score their runs. But once they had a good taste of the Thomian attack, they came on top, slowly but steadily, as S.Thomas' captain Sachitha Jayathilake used as many as eight bowlers to break the partnership.
Kariyawasam was more aggressive of the two while Sooriyabandara played that much-needed anchor role to keep the Royal innings together. Sooriyabandara faced 167 balls to compete his half century. In contrast, Kariyawasam: needed just 87 balls to score his fifty.
After sweating for 45 overs in hot and humid conditions, the Thomian bowlers were finally able to separate the two shortly before the close when Kariyawasam was trapped leg before by Jayathileka for 78, made off 140 balls with 12 boundaries. But by then, Royal had sailed out of troubled waters as they had narrowed the gap to 87 runs with four wickets in hand.
Inspired by the exit of Kariyawasam, S.Thomas came back strongly to capture another wicket as Ganith Sandeepa departed without disturbing the scorers after facing only nine balls. But Sooriyabandara continued his good work with the willow till the end and is on the verge of completing a well-deserved century. He was unbeaten on 97, facing 281 balls and hitting 13 fours.
Earlier in the day, the Thomian bowlers tightened the grip, given by their batsmen on day one, to capture the top four wickets of the Royalists in the pre-lunch session. Resuming at their overnight total of one for no loss, Royal added 36 runs more exactly 12 overs before losing opener Naveen Withanapathirana, caught by Ravindu Kodittuwakku off Yohan Perera for 24. Jayawardene was then joined by Sooriyabandara and they brought the total up to 65 before the opener departed, caught Senal de Silva off left-arm medium peceman Danush Peiris for 25. Every time Royal batsmen attempted to build a partnership before the arrival of Kariyawasam, the Thomian bowlers struck at regular intervals. When the Reid Avenue boys appeared to be marching steadily at 96 for two, they lost the key wicket of skipper Panditharatne (26), who had aggregated over 1,000 runs this season
S.Thomas' inflicted a double blow to Royal's batting line up with the total on 96 in the 39th over when Perera followed the wicket of Panditharatne by removing Lasith Embuldeniya for a five-ball 'duck'. Following the top five unhealthy partnerships of 37, 28, 31, 0, 26 runs and several anxious moments, it was Sooriyabandara-Kariyawasam alliance that enabled Royal to make a bold reply. Despite that brave effort, Royal must still be regretting for inviting S.Thomas' to take the first lease of a perfect batting strip, as the wicket still looks good even after two days' of play. With Royal coming closer to to the Thomian first innings total, a decision is highly unlikely on the third and final day's play today, unless the glorious uncertainties of cricket takes place.

World Cup winning team to raise funds for past cricketers
The 1996 World Cup Champion team will be back in action when they clash with an All Stars XI in an exhibition cricket match which is scheduled to take place on March 19 (Saturday) at the CCC grounds, Maitland Crescent.
The main aim of organizing this match is to build a trust fund for the welfare of past cricketers who need financial support and to launch a water purification project.
The event is organized by the members of the 1996 World Cup winning team along with the official sponsor of the victorious Lankan team, Singer Sri Lanka PLC.
"The Sri Lankan Cricketers Association will also join in as well as our principal sponsors Singer. Singer was the sponsor in 1996. The match is also being used to promote a water purification project in Anuradhapura. If we can raise funds the proceeds of that we are going to channel it through a water purification project in Anuradhapura," said Roshan Mahanama.
"We will also set up a fund for past cricketers. No sooner I say that or no sooner I briefed them at a group, people were wondering why a fund for past cricketers. They were laughing as well. But, what people don't realize is say, in any era, over a period of 10 years it will be only 60-70 cricketers who will end up playing for Sri Lanka. For us to get the 60- 70 cricketers, what we don't realize is that there are another three to four hundred cricketers and they don't get benefited to that extent," he said.
"Without them obviously you can't get the cream or the best of cricket and sadly in the country, I know individually almost everyone from previous era's upto the current era, they have helped one another. But there's no organization and the only person who thought about a benevolent fund for cricketers was Minister Gamini Dissanayake. I don't know which year. But I remember him saying that we want to setup a benevolent fund for past cricketers. But it never got if off the ground.
"So, we need to start somewhere as a stepping stone. And it will be done jointly. What we intend to do is to setup a trust fund through the Sri Lanka Cricket Association together with the members of the '96 World Cup winning squad," the '96 World Cup team member and ICC Match Referee Mahanama, who is an organizer of the event told the Daily News.
Speaking further about the water purification project, Mahanama said, "This is a project that has been identified by the Singer team as well. Singer has been doing a lot of projects. We thought we will go with a project that has been identified rather than go in search of new projects.
"In other countries, the Player Associations are fully involved in promoting and looking after the cricketers after they retire. This is also one of the reasons the Association is involved. The current players are well-established. What we have done in the past is promoting and looking after the welfare of the past cricketers. But we must also find out how we get the resources for it. The resources are from the current cricketers. Current cricketers used to contribute a few percentages from their salary into the fund. That is here.
"In other countries they do make a contribution through the Cricket Board. The Cricket Boards of the other countries give a percentage of their revenue to the Players Association. The Players' Association looks after the interest of the players. There are cricketers who don't have job opportunities after they retire.
A classic example is in Sri Lanka we have cricketers like Roy Dias and other big names who were top cricketers. But sad to say, financially whether they are stable is the question. They are almost 65-70 years old and still coaching," commented former cricketer and cricket administrator Ken de Alwis, who also joined the conversation.
The Sri Lankan cricketing legends likes of first Test captain Bandula Warnapura, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene who dominated Sri Lanka cricket in the last three decades since 1980 are due to represent the 'All Stars XI'.
After the cricket match at the same venue, arrangements have been made to stage a musical evening featuring well known Sri Lankan artists. Whilst enjoying music Sri Lankan cricket fans will get a great opportunity to meet their cricketing heroes of yesteryear who will be there to grace this wonderful occasion.
