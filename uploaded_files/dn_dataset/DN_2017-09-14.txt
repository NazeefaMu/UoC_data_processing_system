Govt pursuing ambitious programme to enhance digital infrastructure
Sri Lankan government is pursuing ambitious programme to enhance digital infrastructure by facilitating the enhancement of the digital eco-system, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He was speaking at the Second Broadband forum organized by the Ministry of Telecommunication and Infrastructure in collaboration with global leader in ICT Solutions, Huawei, in Colombo.
Noting that digital infrastructure sharing would reduce civil work of telecom operators and avoid duplication of infrastructure, the Minister said that the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure is currently in the process of forming an infrastructure sharing company to enable digitization and to realise set targets of the telecommunication sector.
The company is to be brought under the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry.
Sri Lankan mobile penetration has risen from 96% in 2012 to 126% in 2017. Also, Sri Lanka has witnessed significant growth in mobile broadband penetration over the past five years, with market penetration increasing from 8% from 2012 to 21% in 2017.
The Minister further added that the internet has transformed nearly every sector of society including education, employment, commerce, etc.
However, more than 60% of the global population still remains offline. If nothing is done to remove deterrents, more than four billion may be left behind as the pace of change in the knowledge economy continues to accelerate.
Furthermore, the development of ICT technologies and increased spread of broadband infrastructure have become the core of economic competencies.
In a bid to boost broadband penetration, 10% telecommunications levy imposed on data was removed in September 2017.
Furthermore, in an effort to develop the digitization initiatives in Sri Lanka, a roadmap for the period 2015-2020 was launched to improve the digital infrastructure facilitating the enhancement of digital eco-system.
This would also include enhancing ICT policies, regulations, standards, the use of ICT applications in key sectors, citizen engagement and participation in ICT enabled societies, facilitating ICT industry development, trade and business sector activities.
Meanwhile, founding Chair of LIRNEasia, Professor Rohan Samarajeewa, speaking at the event, stressed that Sri Lanka needs to form a new ICT legislation to create a modern regulatory environment.
Sri Lanka is working under a 26-year law.
Prof. Samarajeewa further added that the Sri Lankan government needs to reform the telecommunication sector and existing laws while restoring the credibility and independence of the regulator.

Nearly four million people on medication for NCDs
Out of the 20 million people in Sri Lanka, around four million people need to take various medicines for a long time, sometimes for a lifetime, for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) President Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne said.
Addressing a media seminar held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, she said NCDs has become an epidemic and some people have a misconception on some medications such as Metformin which is not prescribed for diabetes patients with kidney problems. People mistakenly believe that Metformin causes kidney problems.
Prof. Gita Fernando said under the current law, no pharmacist can issue antibiotics to a patient without a prescription but it happens often all over the country. Sometimes pharmacists issue the wrong antibiotic for the sickness. Some doctors prescribe antibiotics even for viruses which is wrong. This creates antibiotic resistance in people. Doctors should not get agitated when patients question about the drugs they prescribe and the doctors need to educate their patients on the drugs, Prof. Fernando said.
Prof. Priyadharshani Galappatty said the medication literacy of Sri Lankan people is less than 50 percent and due to this and many other reasons, a large number of people become victims of medical errors.
Overcrowded hospitals and clinics, lack of electronic prescribing and the possibility of having unqualified pharmacists in the private sector are some of the reasons that lead to medical errors.

No drug shortages in State hospitals
There is no drug shortage whatsoever in the Colombo National Hospital or any other State hospital in the country at the moment. The media reports published in certain Sinhala newspapers are completely fabricated, the Health Ministry said in a statement.
According to the statement issued by the Health Ministry, there is no danger of closing down any State hospital in the North Central Province as stated in certain media reports. There are plenty of drugs in all varieties available freely at all State hospitals.
The statement says that Colombo National Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasinghe has also issued a special statement in connection with the same issue and assured that there is no drug shortage whatsoever at his hospital and all drugs are freely available for both in-house and OPD patients.
North Central Province Health Services Director General Dr. W. M. Palitha Bandara has assured that there is no threat of closing down Welikanda, Kahatagasdigiliya, Galenbindunuwewa, Kebithigollewa etc. due to any drug shortage. The entire State hospital system in the Province works smoothly without any issue.
A new software has been introduced for the State hospitals to prevent any drug shortage. The Health Ministry requests the public to not to be misled by fabricated information.

Sonduru Sarisara  Sakwala Piyasa Dige by Saman Athaudahetti launched
Since Sri Lankan readers had to read accounts written from a western angle in the past, the book 'Sonduru Sarisara  Sakwala Piyasa Dige,' written by Saman Athaudahetti enables them to form a correct picture about the social, cultural, religious and political tendencies in China, said Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke.
Sri Lankan people can also derive a clear understanding of the anti-corruption programme launched by Chinese President Shi Jing Pin, he said.
Minister Karunatilleke was speaking as chief guest at the launching of Saman Athaudahetti's book 'Sonduru Sarisara, Sakwala Piyasa Dige' held at the multi-purpose hall of Wangshu Hotel, in Beijing, China on September 12.
The launching ceremony organised by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee International Affairs Department was attended by diplomats, communist party officials and representatives of publication and media institutions among others.
Director General of the Chinese Community Party Central Committee International Department Yuan Sha Bin said Athaudahetti is rendering a great service as a cultural emissary between China and Sri Lanka and he could be described as a true and sincere friend.
Sri Lankan Ambassador in China Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku read out President Maithripala Sirisena's message of greetings to the event. Dr. Kodituwakku addressing the gathering said political and economic opportunities are provided to people living in the Tibet zone, ensuring their language, religious and cultural identity while integrating them into the Chinese political mainstream. It was a fine example to countries such as Sri Lanka searching avenues to establish communal unity and reconciliation.
He said Tibet had the same level of economic development seen in Chinese provinces. The Chinese political mechanism was instrumental in punishing small groups bent on bribery and corruption for personal gain and this process had been clearly elucidated in Athudahetti's book.
Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne who delivered the main lecture said Saman Athaudahetti was a professional engaged in the political sector.
Although it was usual for some engaged in the field of politics to decline in stature quickly, Athaudahetti had always kept his head above and maintained his status despite holding several posts such as Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister, Chairman of Public Performance Board and ITN.
Despite holding several crowns on his head Athaudahetti had always kept his feet firmly on the ground.
Deputy Director General of the Tibet Communist Party Publicity Department Tang Shien Wen and several others also spoke.
Sandani Wijetunge presented a song recital.
A video presentation about the other books written by Athaudahetti followed. Nisansala Ratnayake and Wang Ying compered.

Sri Lankan service sector brings 62% GDP
The importance of strengthening the Sri Lankan service sector that contributes 62% to the countrys GDP was highlighted by the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry's Senior Advisor Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawaratne.
Dr. Nawaratne made these remarks at the launching of the book titled 'Service Management: Concepts, Principles and Applications for Sri Lanka', written by Professor Gamini Gunawardane.
Prof. Gunawardane has a wide knowledge in operations management, service management, strategic management and health care services management, which he received from California State University at Fullerton and Los Angeles in USA. He also worked closely with the University of Colombo's Institute of Human Resource Advancement, Service Management Unit.
While thanking Professor Gunawardane for publishing a book that gives a comprehensive description about the importance of strengthening the Sri Lankan service sector, Dr. Nawaratne said this is the first time a Sri Lankan produced a book on service management.
The book has given wide coverage to the development of service sectors around the world, especially in Asian countries including Sri Lanka, he said.
Dr. Nawaratne also emphasized the need for expanding service management education and training for the younger generation.
He said the younger generation should carry out more research on service management as this is one of the main sectors focusing on the countrys future economy development targets.
Making a brief speech on the speedy development of the Sri Lankan service sector, Prof. Gunawardane said alleconomies are service economies.
He said goods are the distribution mechanism for service provision and goods derive their value through use.
He said marketing services is different from marketing goods and managing service operations has different challenges.
Although our young students are most likely to be employed in the service sector, their MBA or business degree programmes will not teach them special concepts, principles or methods to manage services. Prof. Gunawradane further said students should focus attention towards hospitality and tourism, business visitors, exporting services and selling higher education globally in order to increase the service sector further.
He also highlighted about fragmented service management education (FSME) and training and said the Sri Lankan private sector has lots of employees training in customer service.
He said the University of Sri Jayawardanapura (USJP) conducts one course for 12 degree programmes and the University of Colombo has formal degree and diploma programmes for service management.
Meanwhile SLIDA uses one customer service module for its training programmes and CMA has no service management course in its four level structure.
He further said in our country there is no motivation and no structure to methodically promote the awareness and improvement of service management.
Also we have no mechanisms to form a body of knowledge of best practices, studies, seminars and research in service management, he said.
He said in addition there are no books and collections of studies in service management (SM) for students, practitioners and researchers. Prof. Gunawardane also said service sector personnel should consult customers to identify their needs, deliver consistent level of service, inform service delivery expectations, solicit feedback from customers, establish a complaints procedure, treat customers fairly and consistently, recognize customer rights and deal with customers in a polite, helpful, open and a professional manner.
Quoting recent research, Prof Gunawardanae said the largest subsectors within the service sector are wholesale and retail trade, transportation, public services, health services, educational services and tourism and hospitality services.
He said there are many reasons to improve service management in Sri Lank as the island is seeking to become a partner with foreign investors and businesses globally. Such firms need highly efficient financial, communication, IT and other business services.

COUNSEL GAMINI MARAPANAS APPLICATION UPHELD:
ASG de Livera to seek AGs opinion regarding order:
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday issued an order directing Perpetual Treasuries beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius to appear before the commission and to give evidence on a given date.
However, the commission observed that if Aloysius is unwilling or refuses to give evidence; his counsel is entitled to make an application to the commission to the effect that an accused cannot be compelled to give evidence.
...therefore, on an application, mutatis mutandis, of the rule of the Law that an accused cannot be compelled to give evidence, which Mr. Marapana PC has relied on when he took that same objection, Mr. Aloysius must not be compelled to give evidence. In the event, Counsel for Mr. Aloysius chooses to make such an application, we will be duty bound to act in terms of that rule of the Law and refrain from compelling Mr. Aloysius to give evidence, the judges said in their order yesterday. Following the order, Aloysiuss counsel Gamini Marapana PC said his client is unwilling to give evidence before the commission and informed that a submission in this regard will be done on Thursday (14). The Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena requested Marapana PC to carefully consider the order before making the submission.
In the same note, Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said he will seek the Attorney Generals opinion regarding the order.
Aloysius appeared before the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday morning complying with the notice of summons which was served to him on September 11,2017.
Aloysius appeared with his legal representative Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana who on the date of summoning notice issuance, objected his client being compelled to testify before the commission on the basis of self incrimination and his right for a fair trial.
Accordingly the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday (13) made the order on the notice of summoning Aloysius to testify before the commission.
According to the order, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue is of the view that Aloysius is required to give evidence before the commission. The commission states that Aloysiuss evidence is relevant and material. It also believes that Aloysius should be given the opportunity to explain himself regarding the matter under probe.
The commission observes that if Aloysius is unwilling or refuses to give evidence, it will be duty bound to act in terms of the rule of the Law and refrain from compelling Aloysius to give evidence.
The PCoIs order states that it requires Aloysius to give evidence with regards to matters including, reasons for PTL bidding for large amounts of Treasury Bonds at some Treasury bond auctions, Transactions on the secondary market of Treasury bonds which PTL obtained by successful bids, the dealings and relationship which existed between PTL-Central Bank, Employees Provident Fund, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC and some other Primary Dealers. The matters also include, the profits/capital gains received by PTL as a result of the said Treasury bond transactions, the disposal of these profits/capital gains by way of dividends, fund transfers and transfers of profit and investment.
The Commission also requires Aloysius to give evidence on several matters which are directly within his personal knowledge. The Commission listed out 15 matters on which Aloysius seem to obtain personal knowledge. The said matters pointed out by the commission include, the ownership, control and the structure of group of companies of which PTL is a member, the role played by Aloysius in applying for and obtaining a Primary Dealer license from the Central Bank, Aloysiuss day to day operations of the PTL when he was its CEO, his decision to resign from the said CEO post and his involvement in PTL daily activities after his resignation.
The Commission also seeks Aloysiuss personal knowledge on certain telephone call conversations between him and PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, with regards to Treasury bond auctions held on March 2016 where Aloysius claims that he has information on, the role played by Aloysius with regards to the fine imposed by the Central Bank on PTL, the nature of relationship between Aloysius and Arjun Mahendran, the nature of relationship between EPF officers including Indika Saman Kumara, NSB officer Navin Anuradha and PABC former Chairman Nimal Perera.
The Commission wants Aloysius to give evidence on the reasons for him telephoning Richie Dias of PABC during the period when Dias was making his statement to the PCoI and the reasons for Aloysius leasing an apartment which was occupied by former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his family.
Meanwhile the commission stresses that it is mindful, from its commencement, to act fairly and with the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.

Amla, Perera lead World XI to T20 win
Lahore: Sri Lanka all-rounder Thisara Perera hit a towering six off the penultimate ball to steer the World XI to a thrilling seven-wicket win over Pakistan in the second Twenty20 Wednesday.
Perera made a whirlwind 19-ball 47 not out with five sixes, while Hashim Amla finished not out 72 off 55 balls to help the World XI overhaul a 175-run target and level the three-match series 1-1 before a packed Gaddafi stadium in Lahore.
Pakistan had registered a 20-run win in Tuesday's first match, which marked the return of international cricket to Pakistan.
Left-hander Perera went on a rampage as the visitors needed 33 off the last two overs, smashing two sixes off the 19th over bowled by Sohail Khan before sealing the match in the last over.
Amla, who scored his seventh international Twenty20 half-century, was the steadier of the two, with two sixes and five fours as he helped Perera add 69 runs for the fourth wicket off just 35 balls.
That partnership lifted the World XI after they lost Tamim Iqbal (23), Tim Paine (10) and skipper Faf du Plessis (20).
Pakistan had scored 174-6 in their 20 overs.
Babar Azam (45), Ahmed Shehzad (43) and Shoaib Malik (39) had good starts but none of them went on to score big, as Pakistan found it tough going on a slow and low pitch after winning the toss.
Opener Fakhar Zaman fell for 21 in the fifth over before Shehzad and Azam steadied the innings with a 59-run stand for the second wicket.
Malik hit two sixes in the last over before holing out off the last delivery of the innings.
During his 23-ball knock Malik became the leading run scorer for Pakistan in Twenty20 international cricket, overhauling Umar Akmal's aggregate of 1,690 runs in 88 matches by two runs.
He now has 1,692 in 88 matches.
Perera (2-23) and West Indian spinner Badree (2-31) were the main wicket takers for the visitors. AFP

Balraj Arunasalam takes over as President of Toastmasters International
Creating a landmark is the Toastmasters history, Toastmaster Arunasalam Balraj was elected International President, becoming the first Sri Lankan residing in Sri Lanka and the first South Asian to lead this organization. He was elected at the recently concluded International Convention held in Vancouver, Canada.
International (TMI) is a world leader in communication and leadership development. The organization has a membership of 360,000 across 16,500 clubs in 142 countries that make up a global network of meeting locations.
District 82 of Toastmasters International comprises 240 Toastmasters Clubs, with 6,500 members spread across Tamil Nadu, India and Sri Lanka. The Toastmasters movement in Sri Lanka, which commenced its journey in 1983 with one club, has made significant strides locally and internationally.
A dedicated Toastmaster for 28 years, Balraj is a product of Trinity College, Kandy. He has held numerous offices from club level to International level.
The roles he has served in include International Director 2011-2013, Second Vice President 2014-2015, First Vice-President 2015-2016 and President Elect 2016-2017.
Balraj is considered the architect of the first District between India and Sri Lanka. Working selflessly towards growing this movement exponentially, his efforts have provided people from all walks of life an opportunity to ignite their confidence to face this world and its challenges.
Balraj firmly believes in the 'People First' attitude. He explains, Toastmaster is a tool that helped corporate sector employees gain confidence and move up in the ladder. For administrators too its a tool to gain confidence to execute their work.
Toastmasters is not just an organization or a movement, it is a learning laboratory and it provides members a platform for self-discovery. With the help of a continuous, structured program, members discover their strengths by learning at their own pace.
Toastmasters International has a proven track record of helping members eliminate their fear of public speaking. The program is specially designed to groom individuals into effective leaders.
The growth of the Toastmasters movement is very evident in Sri Lankas corporate world.
Many top companies across the island - realizing the need for employees to express themselves with clarity - have encouraged in-house corporate Toastmasters Clubs.
We are proud that le41ading organizations have embraced our program as a platform for learning and development. Several Heads of HR also view participation in the program as a Key Performance Indicator of an employees success.
Balraj is a strong advocate of the belief that leadership training for individuals should start at the grassroots level - in our schools.
"Students will influence the direction of this country. I am proud to state that, in my tenure as International President, we have launched a Youth Leadership Program targeting 1000 school children. This is a 10-week course, aimed at grooming confident young communicators and leaders, from various parts of Sri Lanka. We hope to introduce the same model in other countries, as well.
To felicitate Balraj Arunasalams appointment as the International President of Toastmasters, District 82 - along with his home clubs of Colombo Toastmasters, Ralph Toastmasters, Smedley Toastmasters and Pinnacle Advanced Toastmasters - have organized a felicitation ceremony on September 16 at Hotel Galadari.
The event will be graced by over 500 Toastmasters of Sri Lanka, as well as International Toastmasters, in addition to respected Government officials, Diplomats and Senior Corporate representatives.
He was felicitated at a reception last Friday and some highlights of the event.

Banning Plastic
How effectiveis thepolythene ban
It has been over 10 days since the use of polythene and plastic bags was banned, but there have been no visible alternatives available in the market for daily use. Many of the alternatives are manufactured on a very small scale and they have not received enough support to scale up production.
People who use lunch sheets and polythene bags for their daily use do have an option, they can start using lunch boxes and cloth bags, but small scale hotel and shop owners are finding it hard to switch to an alternative. They emphasized that bio degradable bags and lunch sheets should have been made available before the government imposed a ban on polythene bags.
Cabinet approval has been granted for the implementation of the long term, medium term and short term programme presented by the Experts Committee appointed for the preparation of a national policy and action plan for the proper management of polythene and plastics. The Committee also proposed to ban the use of polythene for all decorations including national, religious, social, cultural and political festivals.
No distributors to cater to the local market
Since the ban however, biodegradable plastic manufacturers such as Plastic Packaging Pvt Ltd have had more inquiries coming their way said its Chairman Mervyn Dias. He said most inquiries were on bio degradable lunch sheets and bags but the buyers ordered it for their own use and it was yet to reach the local market.
Dias has been exporting bio degradable polythene lunch sheets and bags for the past 10 years and he affirmed that it has not reached the local people as yet.
People who place the order buy it for their personal or company usage. We do not have a chain of distributors to cater to island wide demand. But, some supermarkets have begun to use our products after the ban, he said.
Dias said that people will start using them very soon and added that they are also looking for prospects to deliver it to the local market.
Our products are certified by the Belgium Biodegradable Products Institute and we print their compostable logo in all our biodegradable and compostable products. This certification is awarded only if the product conforms to International Standards. The certification is given after carrying out several lab tests and the buyers should always look for the logo to assure the products they buy are truly biodegradable and compostable. Our products do not have polyethylene in them and it is 100 percent environmentally friendly and does not have any additive to stimulate decomposition. These bags biodegrade in 90-180 days depending on the composting method used, he explained.
According to Dias, these products are not available in places like Pettah and other local markets. Common people and small scale hotel owners continue to complain that there are no alternatives for lunch sheets and polythene bags. They claim that even though the government has banned the usage they have not taken measures to provide alternatives.
Dias meanwhile said they use international standards to sell the products to the local market as well.
Compostable and biodegradable papers are manufactured with a globally certified compostable and biodegradable bio- resin. Dias also said that they are tested and certified at the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) in Sri Lanka and certified that there is no polythene in compostable bags and sheets.
He said that we should encourage whole sale distributors to cater to the whole island in order to increase the demand.
Hotel owners complain of having no option
Soon after the polythene ban was imposed, the government requested full support of the public to successfully confront the difficulties that may crop up during the transition period, but they have failed in their initiatives to provide alternatives for the banned items.
The government officials continue to make statements that during the next few months they would make sure that the alternatives to replace the banned items will be in the market, but the public are yet to see results, despite the never ending meetings that are being held with all stake holders.
R. Thilakaratne, a hotel owner from Maradana said he does not have an alternative but to use lunch sheets.
Some customers refuse to eat on the plate without the lunch sheet. We would not mind using bio degradable lunch sheets, but one of my friends told me that it is very expensive. It costs double the price of normal lunch sheets. I cannot afford that. I can understand the issues pointed out by the government, on why we need to reduce the use of polythene and plastic. But we are so used to it and how can they simply ask us to stop using them he questioned.
Thilakaratne fears that if he stops using them without a proper alternative, he would lose his business.
Rangika Amaraweera, a hotel owner from Pettah said there are many issues that law makers do not understand, such as having to serve curries for takeaway orders.
How are we going to deal with all these practical issues If thats the case, we will have to ask the customers to come with a lunch box to take away the food or bring their own plates to the restaurant if they do not like to use ours. Politicians will never understand the suffering of normal people, he said.
M. N. Jayasekara, a mini super market owner from Wellawatte still uses polythene bags to give the goods customers purchase.
Customers do not come here with cloth or paper bags. And my customers come to buy one or two items from the shop. There are only very few customers who buy things in bulk from me and I can ask them to bring a cloth bag, but how can I handle random people who come to my shop he asked.
Even though the government and the relevant officials claim that the polythene ban is in effect, no matter what, people still continue to use them.

Cartier hosted a special evening in collaboration with the Maisons partner, Chatham Luxury. An exclusive watches selection were presented for the first time in Sri Lanka to showcase stunning works of know-how, innovation and complications.
The pioneer spirit of Maison Cartier has defined style and precision in watchmaking throughout the last two centuries. Established in 1847 in Paris, the Maison has been patronized by royalty, world leaders, and personalities with a distinctive sense of classic style.
The guests also had the opportunity of conversing with Guillaume Alix, Regional Managing Director at Cartier for Middle East, India & Africa, ambassador of the collection in Sri Lanka.
Guillaume Alix, Regional Managing Director at Cartier for Middle East, India & Africa noted, The pioneer spirit of the Maison has set the tone for watchmaking for almost 200 years and it is our privilege to bring this collection to Sri Lanka for the first time. This event is the perfect occasion to share with our clients the richness of our history and the beauty of the latest novelties, including very limited editions and exceptional creations.
Cartier creations are among the most distinctive in the watchmaking industry. Highly recognizable display elements and unique shapes are the hallmark of the Maison ever since the creation of the Santos-Dumont watch in 1904. This was when pioneer Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont told his friend Louis Cartier of the impracticality of pocket watches when it came to flying; Cartier created the flat wristwatch with a distinctive square bezel for his friend. The rest is, of course, history. The Tank watch, created in 1917, also set the course for watchmaking for a century afterwards and continues to do so.
The rounded curves of the Tonneau, Tortue and the Baignoire set off the precise lines of the Tank Skeleton Watch, and the beauty of the various complications. All of which reflect the pursuit of perfection, and the timeless watchmaking philosophy of Maison Cartier.

CEB employees leave have been cancelled from yesterday, 13, until September 20, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said.
The decision was taken after the CEB Workers Union announced that they would launch an indefinite strike from yesterday over several demands including the revision of their salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
The CEB Workers Union said that they would continue the strike if they do not receive a favourable response by September 15.
They warned that no repair work will be carried in the case of a breakdown or power failure except at government hospitals during the strike.
CEB Engineers Association President Saumya Kumarawadu said the strike launched by the CEB Workers Union was baseless as the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry had given solutions to their demands.
He said that it was unfair for them to demand a salary equivalent to Executive Directors.

China to shut bitcoin exchanges
Chinese authorities plan to shut down domestic bitcoin exchanges, delivering a final blow to a once-thriving industry of commercial trading for virtual currencies, which took off inside the mainland four years ago.
The country's central bank has led a draft of instructions that would ban Chinese platforms from providing virtual currency trading services, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes after months of scrutiny by Beijing, including a ban last week in China on initial coin offerings, a kind of fundraising via virtual currencies.
Regulators in China have been investigating the domestic market for bitcoin and other virtual currencies since the beginning of the year. For a while, officials considered enacting antimoney-laundering rules on exchanges, even circulating a draft of such rules for them to follow.
But the stakes for Beijing grew as prices of virtual currencies like bitcoin soared, adding to the risk of further speculation by domestic investors. Analysts and investors say one reason bitcoin prices rose last year was that Chinese people began using the asset as a way to bet that the value of the yuan would fall. Virtual currencies in theory can allow holders to bypass the traditional banking system to move money outside of China's capital-controlled borders.
The People's Bank of China didn't respond to a request for comment.
Officials from the central bank, cyberspace administration and banking, securities and other regulatory bodies considered various options for months but ultimately came to a consensus to shut down virtual currency exchanges, said the people.
Too much disorder was naturally a basic reason for the ban, said one of the people. The price of one bitcoin traded at around $UA4,279 Monday morning in Beijing, down 16 per cent from its record on September 1.
Trading volumes have already plummeted in China, with authorities stepping up efforts to rein in exchanges. Analysts say more activity is moving underground, where individuals can send virtual currencies to each other using private addresses, which serve like safe-deposit boxes.
The people said that regulators will likely to have to tolerate non-commercial trading of virtual currencies. The government also doesn't have the power to control that, said one person.
Two of the China's largest domestic bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and BTCC, said over the weekend that regulators haven't asked them to shut down, even as speculation grows. We're still awaiting formal notification from regulators, said BTCC Chief Executive Bobby Lee. It's obviously a sensitive time period.
A Huobi spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the firm's press release. Another domestic exchange, OKCoin, didn't respond to request for comment. China Business News

CIM Sri Lanka networking event concludes on a high note
The Chartered Institute of Marketing Sri Lanka hosted its second Networking Event for the year with key cricket icons - Cricket Superstar Aravinda De Silva, Ranjit Fernando, Cricket Commentator Roshan Abeysinghe and Cricket Administrator Mohan De Silva.
The event focused on sportsmanship and fair play associated with cricket and was followed by fellowship. The networking event was organized exclusively for CIM Members.
Expressing their informal views on what currently ails the nations much loved game, Ranjit Fernando stated that the present team of very young cricketers is not exposed to the extent their predecessors have been exposed and therefore the young players have to be nurtured and given more time.
Adding to the same thought, Aravinda De Silva stated that it is important to understand how to build a good team as well as good leaders and just like in a corporate business, the concepts in cricket also have changed. Therefore it is important to give the young players time to understand each others strengths and learn from their mistakes.
Furthermore Mohan De Silva commented, We are going through a period of transition but there are other contradictory factors as well. Our key players had a spate of injuries. Theres a gamut of things to be considered and we have the system in place now and are confident of what were doing.
An animated Q&A session moderated by Roshan Abeysinghe followed with eager queries and observations from the audience about the current style and status of the current pool of cricketers in the national team. The consensus that emerged was that the performance of our young team can be streamlined using tried and tested strategies that have worked for the Sri Lankan teams in the past.
The event concluded on a high note and the fellowship and camaraderie after the event facilitated further networking among CIM members.
CIM is the largest community of professional marketers in the world with 100 years of heritage delivering education, membership and insight offerings to the marketing and sales profession. CIM Sri Lanka is the first international branch of CIM UK comprising the largest number of members, both students and professional members.
As the leading professional body for Marketing, CIM places great emphasis in bringing together programmes that are topical and relevant targeting members and the entire business community.

End this farce
I read with interest the punishing Editorial under the above caption in the Daily News which hopefully will put some sense into the criminal justice system in this country which today is taken for a ride by the high class villain.
Just the other day, a Bogeyman in a red colour BMW sports, driven at high speed over took us from the wrong side, while we were travelling leisurely to a nearby vegetarian restaurant to enjoy a few thosai for lunch. Given the cost of the vehicle which I understand is in the region of Rs 50 million, it is reasonable to assume the driver of the vehicle was some panjandrum who has suddenly accumulated wealth, which according to Kenneth Galbraith, the much celebrated economist of Harvard, is theft. Now if the flying Bogeyman is convicted for theft and sentenced to a term behind bars he suddenly discovers his pancreas has stopped producing insulin and finds himself in the comfort of a bed in the prison hospital. Now the authorities have woken up to the racket and it is now compulsory for a team of doctors to report before a convicted felon enters the hospital, whether it be the prison hospital or the Merchants Ward of the General.
The other racket is this business of those on bail approaching the courts seeking permission to travel abroad for stupendously costly, medical treatment. If this is not a scandalous joke then what is it These villains are out on bail for committing serious crimes like murder, kidnapping for ransom and robbery of state property. Is this a ruse to enjoy wealth illegally stacked overseas End this farce also, that cries to the high heavens for vengeance. It is a public secret that hospitals abroad in the US or EU are costly and extravagant than top class hotels.

Colombos solid waste to be moved to Aruwakkalu
Cabinet approves proposal:
Cabinet approved the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Developments plan to move solid waste in Colombo to a final disposal facility in Aruwakkalu, Puttlam, this week.
The project, known as the Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Project, has; working together with the Department of Wildlife, identified 85 acres near the Quarry site Railway station and the Operational Block of Siam City Cement (Lankan) Ltd in Aruwakkalu. This, the proposal stated, was more than 3km away from the Buffer Zone of the Wilpattu National Park.
The venture is estimated to cost Rs. 17.705 billion in total.
In addition, the Ministry has also chosen 25 acres of land belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) to build a waste transfer station for the loading of municipal waste.
The South Korean company Dohwa Engineering, who was previously engaged in a feasibility study, has been asked to carry out a fresh consultancy for the project. The Ministry will also conduct a fresh EIA with the participation of all stakeholders concerned.
The project, initially planned for three years, has now been fast-tracked to 18 months given the current garbage crisis. Keeping in line with the motivate to clear up the garbage issue in the Capital, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka also received Cabinet approval to spend to Rs. 1,848 million to rehabilitate Meethotamulla and Rs. 924 million to support the composting equipment on SLLRDC land in Kerawalapitiya.

Colombo venue for Indian Tour Operators convention
In a major breakthrough for Sri Lanka Tourism, the first Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) Outbound Convention is to be held in Colombo from October 2-4.
IATO is Indias national apex body of tour operators with a membership of over 1,600 from across the country.
The membership consists of the nations inbound tour operators, travel agents, hotel chains, airlines, media and other stakeholders in the tourism and hospitality industries.
"The arrival of Indian tour operators for their convention next month in Colombo was important to Sri Lanka as it would mean more MICE events being attracted to the country," said Tourism Minister John Amaratunga. This is the first time that Sri Lanka Tourism has been able to attract the Indian Association of Tour Operators Outbound Convention and it once again proved that Sri Lanka is a well positioned MICE destination, he said.
He said that Sri Lanka has hosted several events of this magnitude including the World Tourism Conference in Arugam Bay and Negombo.
He also said that hosting events of this nature would help to woo more Indian tourists to Sri Lanka.
This convention which is being handled by the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau (SLCB) is expected to have around 300 to 400 participants.

Combatting international  traffic in wildlife
Wildlife and Nature Protection Society will address the role of international conventions, domestic conservation impacts and the need for vigilant enforcement networks to combat international trafficking in wildlife at its monthly lecture which will be held on September 14, 6 pm at the Cinema Hall, BMICH, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7. The lecture will be delivered by Gabriel Fava,an Associate Director of the Born Free Foundation. His geographical focus is Asia and Oceania and he specializes in global wildlife trafficking, trade and the CITES, and on field conservation as it pertains to tigers, Asian elephants and pangolins. Every year millions of animals are taken from the wild and sold around the world by dangerous international networks. Poaching of elephants for ivory and tigers for their skins and bones are the well known in illegal trade. It is almost impossible to obtain reliable figures for the value of the illegal wildlife trade. However, countless other species are similarly overexploited, from tortoises to botanicals. Increasing numbers are sold online for the Exotic Pet Trade, where species are often misidentified or described as captive bred, even if their true origin is wild.
Wildlife trade escalates into a crisis when an increasing proportion is illegal and unsustainable and directly threatens the survival of many species in the wild. To better address the challenges posed by the international wildlife trade, better global regulatory systems are necessary. While the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) addresses the trade in endangered species, gaps in legislation, law enforcement and criminal justice systems present serious issues at country level. The lecture is open to all members and non-members, admission free.

Commuting uncalled for
The failure of successive governments over the last several decades to develop and modernize the railway in this country has been a major factor contributing to the rapid expansion of private modes of transport. Today, traffic congestion in urban areas has reached a critical point where people of all walks of life are engaged in a massive struggle to move around for diverse purposes. Poor public transport services have encouraged people to use private transport, making the above situation worse by the day.
Recently, I went to a railway station near Kandy to book a seat on a Colombo bound train. On that day, all the seats were sold out so I booked a seat on the same train for the following day. I was given a print out of my ticket and I could not read it because computer typing on the standard form was scattered all over the place. In other words, while a computerized system has been introduced, it does not seem to function properly, either because the system is faulty or the people working behind the counter are not well trained to do it.
The distance from Kandy to Colombo is less than 120 km but the time taken to reach Colombo is over 3 and a half hours. So, the average speed is just over 30 km an hour. If there are delays due to various circumstances, the journey can take much longer. But the time taken can be reduced substantially if the service is improved with greater investment in infrastructure and rolling stock.
The purpose of this article is to highlight a larger issue, namely, the gross neglect of public transport over the last four decades in spite of its enormous potential not only to meet the growing need for goods and passenger transport but also to protect the environment, reduce public health hazards and save much needed foreign exchange. The problem became chronic over the last decade when the obvious government policy has been to encourage private transport, either by design or by default.
Increasing vehicular traffic
The distribution of generous government vehicle permits among senior public servants, politicians at all levels, and even leading Buddhist monks, sent a clear message to the middle class and even to lower middle class to shun public transport altogether. It also promoted corruption across the social spectrum, not just by allowing permit holders to sell their permits to the highest bidder but also by encouraging public servants to engage in rent seeking activities to earn additional income. When you look at the income distribution in the country, the vast majority of the people including public servants cannot afford imported motor cars. It forces people to live beyond their means and encourages people in authority to abuse their power. It is common knowledge that many permit holders sell their permits to businessmen and others who in turn use these permits to import fuel guzzling luxury vehicles.
Southern Expressway was built with borrowed money because the Galle road which was then mostly a two lane road from Colombo to Matara was too narrow to accommodate increasing vehicular traffic.
The best option at the time was to modernize the railway line from Colombo to Matara to increase capacity and speed, combined with a widened Galle road to accommodate more vehicles and facilitate efficient flow of traffic. But, the government decided on the Southern Expressway which not only absorbed a colossal amount of borrowed funds but also led to loss of valuable land and habitats for local communities.
Funds devoted to build the expressway most probably would have been adequate to modernize the railway and improve the Galle road. If a good train service attracted most of the passengers travelling between Colombo and southern cities and an improved Galle road accommodated increasing vehicular traffic, much of the direct and indirect costs of the expressway would have been saved. But the political and business elites who now have high speed luxury cars at their disposal naturally enjoy their journeys on an expressway!
When public transport services are not satisfactory, it is natural for people to find other ways. Increasing motor bikes, three wheelers, cars and vans have filled the void. The result is increasing congestion on our roads, particularly in urban areas. The adverse consequences of this development is obvious today. Over three thousand people die on our roads annually, with many times more injuries.
Vested interests on policymakers
Increasing air pollution due to emissions from all kinds of vehicles is a grave threat to public health. The cost of fuel imported to the country accounts for over 50 percent of our export earnings. The foreign debts incurred by the government to meet the cost of road development projects account for a large part of the overall debt burden of the country. The development of an integrated and efficient network of public transport covering the whole country including the hinterland would have not only spared the country and the people from the above troubles but also improved the quality of life of the masses, reducing not only the gap between the rich and the poor but also the disparities between rural and urban areas. The other benefits of such a system, both economically and socially would have been substantial as well.
As is well known, the country is heavily indebted today and can hardly afford large public investments in a single sector like transport. In spite of the experiences outlined above, leaders talk about building more roads with more borrowed money, not integrated public transport systems. While more road development projects would encourage more private transport, the chances of improving public transport will be slim. In other words, not only that the present situation will persist in the years to come but can even get much worse. So, we will have to brace for more congestion on our roads, more deaths and injuries from traffic accidents, more air pollution leading to all kinds of ailments, great burden on people on account of increasing transport costs, increasing cost of fuel and vehicle imports, etc. All this is due to the persisting influence of vested interests on policymakers and the inability of the democratic system of government in the country to formulate and implement people and environmental friendly public policies.
What is noteworthy is that the ill effects of increasing private transport at the expense of public transport are spilling over from our highways into residential neighbourhoods, adversely affecting the health and safety of residents living in many parts of the country. In many areas, it is not possible for pedestrians to cross the streets running through densely populated areas without risking their lives, not to mention the continuous exposure of people to toxic fumes and inability of vulnerable groups to move around in their neighbourhoods with a sense of safety and security.
No doubt, in some distant future, when we have suffered enough and realize that what we have done over the years has been wrong, we are likely to look for alternatives. But, if our leaders can liberate ourselves today from their ignorance and the influence of vested interests that guide their decision making, we would not have to sacrifice so much before the country adopts an environmentally sound and people friendly transport policy. But, given the fact that, unlike their predecessors several decades back, our political leaders have shunned public transport completely, they are unlikely to give high priority to public transport anytime soon.

Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee approves Interim Report on Constitutional Reform

After months of deliberations and contentious arguments in closed door meetings, the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly last week approved the final copy of its Interim Report on Constitutional Reforms.
 A member of the Steering Committee confirming that the report is ready for submission said the Constitutional Assembly has been summoned to meet on September 21 morning.
A copy of the report will be handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena.
 The interim report, which deals with the vital aspects of Constitutional reforms including the electoral reforms, devolution of power and nature of the State, spells out the contours of Constitutional Bill.
 The Interim Report will be tabled along with the observations made by various parties. Accordingly, the observations of the Joint Opposition, SLFP, TNA, JHU and JVP have been included into the report as annexes.
The report also consists of a separate collective document submitted by the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) and Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP).
Constitutional Lawyer Dr Jayampathy Wickramaratne has submitted his own report.
The UNP has not made a separate submission as the party agrees with the report in its entirety.
 It was deduced that the observations made by various parties indicates contradictions and clashing views on core issues related to the Constitution.
While the SLFP has sought to retain the Executive Presidency, the JVP insists on its abolition. While the TNA is bent on a federal solution within an undivided and indivisible country, the JO is adamant on preserving the clause on unitary state.
 It is now time for hard bargaining. These views are not fixed positions. Nothing is cast in stone. The challenge is to hammer out an agreement cutting across all parties through compromise and negotiation, the Steering Committee member said.
 Sources said a date for the debate on interim report would be fixed after its submission and the Steering Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would go ahead with drafting the Constitutional Bill based on the proposals and suggestions to be made at the debate.
 The Steering Committee which conducted its first meeting on April 5, 2016 has so far conducted over 70 meetings. The Constitutional Assembly formed following a resolution passed unanimously in Parliament in March last year has so far conducted four sittings.
 In the meantime, the reports of six sub-committees on Fundamental Rights, Judiciary, Finance, Public Service, Law and Order, Centre-Periphery were presented to the Constitutional Assembly by the Prime Minister on November 19.
A three-day debate on Constitutional reforms initially scheduled to commence from January 9 was postponed indefinitely as there was no consensus among the political parties.

CSE, SEC to host next Invest Sri Lanka Forum in New York
The Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forum organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) in association with CSE Member Firms and leading Listed Companies will be held on October 16, 2017 at the Sofitel New York.
The Forum is organized with the objective of promoting investment in the Sri Lankan capital market among US based institutional investors and a strong interest among the investor community in the US is expected.
The Invest SL Forum hosted in New York in 2014 drew the participation of over 200 investment professionals and contributed to the year 2014 recording the highest annual purchases in the Sri Lankan stock market from the US.
The Forum will feature a keynote address by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy while SEC Director General Vajira Wijegunawardene and CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike will present on capital market regulation and the opportunities in the capital market respectively.
The event will also feature a speech by CSE Chairman M Ray Abeywardena and a presentation on the experience of investing in Sri Lankan equities by Senior Portfolio Manager at Times Square Capital Management Caglar Somek.
The presentations will be followed by a panel discussion moderated by NASDAQ OMX Group Vice Chairman Meyer Sandy Frucher and a series of pre-scheduled one-on-one-group discussions between fund managers and Sri Lankan listed companies on October 16-187, 2017. John Keells Holdings PLC, Commercial Bank PLC, Sampath Bank PLC, Tokyo Cement (Lanka) PLC, Teejay Lanka PLC, Dialog PLC, Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC, MTD Walkers PLC and Sunshine Holdings PLC will attend the Forum.
The decision to host the Invest SL event in New York, comes on the back of a considerable level of foreign activity in the stock market in 2017, where a net foreign inflow of Rs 40 billion has been recorded year-to-date in the primary and secondary markets.
Foreign purchases during the first half of 2017 also established a record for the highest foreign purchases recorded in the first half of a calendar year. The year-to-date figure amounts to over Rs. 80 billion. Investors from the UShave consistently been the leading contributors to foreign turnover in the Sri Lankan stock market, and have contributed to 40% of the total foreign turnover since the year 2013.
Commenting on the initiative, Chairman of the SEC Thilak Karunaratne said Every countrys stock market has its own mix of investors. This mix will have an impact on the efficiency of the stock market.
This year in particular it is the foreign investors who have driven the stock market and to date there is a net foreign inflow of Rs. 28 billion to the CSE. This is the second highest yearly net foreign inflow on record. The US is ranked as the number one contributor to this record figure and we are confident that this Road Show will further strengthen the inflow of funds from the US to our stock market.
The Chairman of CSE Ray Abeywardena commenting stated Numbers related to foreign activity indicate that foreign investors have identified an opportunity in the Sri Lankan stock market.
Considering such interest and activity, a forum of this nature in what is largely regarded as the largest Fund Hub in the world would help make a strong case for the Sri Lankan capital market, at a time when we have the attention of foreign investors.
I invite Stockbroker firms, Unit Trust Companies, Listed Companies and other stakeholders to join in this effort to make a collective case for the Sri Lankan capital market as an investment destination, Abeywardena added.
The forum follows successful Invest SL forums conducted in Australia this year, which have contributed to 2017 establishing an all-time high in foreign purchases originating from Australiain a calendar year.

Emery warns five-star PSG can only get better
Glasgow: Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) coach Unai Emery says his side have learned lessons from the past after they started their Champions League Group B campaign with a 5-0 thrashing of Celtic.
Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavanis double and a Mikel Lustig own goal consigned Celtic to their record home European defeat and propelled PSG to the top of the table on goal difference from Bayern Munich, who they host on match day two.
It was a real statement of intent from this summers big spenders who signed Brazilian Neymar and teenage sensation Mbappe in a bid to make a real impression on the competition.
After four consecutive seasons of reaching the quarter-finals, PSG fell at the round of 16 last season when they capitulated against Barcelona after winning the first leg 4-0.
It was a result that convinced their Qatari owners to break the world transfer record to bring Neymar to the French capital.
The 6-1 defeat to the Catalan giants in the second leg was a humbling for PSG but Emery says they are approaching this seasons campaign with a renewed confidence.
We did learn from the past and what happened last year. We have worked really hard to improve things within the team, the Spanish coach said.
I think my team showed a lot of character. What I was really pleased with was the fact we were in control with the ball and without the ball.
Of course we have added to the team but it is more about all the people working together. As far as this is concerned I am really, really happy.
The French sides formidable front line terrorised the Celtic defence and Emery warned they would only get better.
The PSG coach singled out Mbappe, who PSG have an option to buy from Monaco for a fee that could reach 180 million Euros, for praise.
This is what he needs at the moment. He wants to be a great player and he is going to grow up into that role, Emery said of the 18-year-old who scored his second goal in two games.
They have only played a few games together... but the key is that the team is going to improve more and more.
Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said his side, who conceded five at home for the first time since Rangers beat them 5-1 in September 1960, said his side werent at the same level of the French superstars.
You have to give credit to them. They are a really special team and they are going to be close to winning it for sure, the Northern Irishman said.
This is a level where you have to look after the ball, and you have to make the ball work for you, and in the first half we didnt do that. AFP

Game of Thrones to shoot multiple endings of final season to stop story leaks

Multiple endings will be filmed for the final episode of Game of Thrones to stop the storyline leaking.
HBO's President of Programming Casey Bloys says even the stars of the show won't know how it ends.
"I know in Game of Thrones, the ending, they're going to shoot multiple versions so that nobody really knows what happens.
"You have to do that on a long show. When you're shooting, people know," hetold an audience at a US college.
"So they're going to shoot multiple versions so that there's no real definitive answer until the end."
The seventh season of Game of Thrones was hit by several high-profile leaks.
Hackersreleased scripts, HBO documents and unbroadcast episodes from other TV shows.
Four people werearrested in Indiaafter a pirated episode was uploaded from an online streaming service in Mumbai.
Another instalment was mistakenlyreleased early in Europe, copied and shared online.
The seventh season of Game of Thrones was illegally downloaded "more than a billion times" according to data seen bypiracy tracking firm Muso.
Casey Bloys says that as well as keeping the storyline secret, it'll be incredibly hard to keep everyone happy with the ending.
"Finales are tough," he told students at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
"If you think about Six Feet Under, well that was a pretty good finale. But if you think about Seinfeld, if you think about The Sopranos, if you think about Breaking Bad - everybody has an opinion about how a show should end.
"The thing that was interesting about The Sopranos was it did make you think.
"In a way everybody got their own version of it. I think he was probably shot, but I don't think David [Chase] has really told anybody what really happened in his mind.
"But I think that's his point. It can be whatever you think it should be as a fan."
It's unclear when the final series of Game of Thrones will air.
The Hollywood Reportersays production on the final six episodes of the show will start in October and will carry on until the middle of 2018.
"Our production people are trying to figure out a timeline for the shoot and how much time the special effects take," says Casey Bloys.
That could mean fans have to wait until 2019 to see the final instalment.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch their token strike series today. Five more districts will be affected by the strikes today, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press briefing held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo on Tuesday, 12, he said that the five districts (and all State hospitals located within them) which will be affected by the token strike to be launched from 8.00 am today to 8.00 am tomorrow are Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Ratnapura and Galle districts.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the vehicle parade which commenced on September 12 will reach Colombo on September 15 and the entire Colombo city will be blocked. There will be a giant protest rally against SAITM on the same day. The GMOA warns the public not to travel to Colombo on 15 except for an essential requirement. The Government should take the responsibility for all the hardships to be faced by the public.
The GMOA will give a hard practical reply if the Government establishes an 'Accreditation Council' overpowering the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) which is an independent body established by Act number 40 of 1988 and the Ceylon Medical Council (CMC) which was established by the Medical Council ordinance number 24 of 1924, he said.

Grand Kandyan celebrates third anniversary
The Grand Kandyan in Kandy, one of the heavily invested single owner hotel projects in the region, will celebrate its third anniversary on October 9. The hotel owned by the diversified Devon Group Kandy, known for their restaurant and catering business, has invested nearly Rs. 2 million for the hotel project.
The idea to build a five star hotel was first spelled out and initial touches were laid down by the founder of the group, Dharmdasa Weerarathne.
The present Chairman, Gamini Weerarathne, who took over the reins then completed the project making it one of its unique properties in Sri Lanka, packed with unmatched features.
Firstly, he hired a Thai architect to design the hotel. Due to the Thai influence, one could see a lot of gold colouring and architecture used for the hotel. In addition, very spacious rooms and corridors are laid out with ample walking space for guests to freely move around.
Today almost 90% of the hotels have the Bevis Bawa architecture and the Grand Kandyan offers a completely different theme which makes the property unique, said its General Manager Thusith Samaraweera.
The theme of the hotel is based on the 'peacock' which is also influenced by Thai architecture. The hotel also offers one of the largest hotel corridors in Sri Lanka.

How Pooh  went from  fierce to friendly
A new book reveals that AA Milne's honey-loving bear wasn't always so cuddly ::: strapline
Like most of us, Winnie-the-Pooh has many faults. He is unashamedly greedy  particularly when it comes to honey, or hunny as he likes to call it.
We are, after all, talking about a bear who can polish off an entire pot in one sitting and enjoys elevenses at any, perhaps every, hour.
As a Bear of Very Little Brain he can also be naive and slow-witted and his spelling is appalling. But he is also friendly, thoughtful, kind-hearted and, above all, steadfast.
He writes poetry  albeit incorporating a lot of hums  organises endless parties and invented the famous game of Poohsticks.
Never one for false modesty, hell be beside himself to know his adventures in Hundred Acre Wood have been translated into 46 languages, including Frisian, Mongolian, Esperanto and Latin (Winnie ille Pu) and that hes inspired societies worldwide.
But angular and grumpy looking Never! Could you even imagine it, just for a second No.
Yet he was, briefly, once upon a time in the early Twenties, when author AA Milne and illustrator EH Shepard were co-creating a character of a bear for a poem to be published in the satirical magazine, Punch. And try as they did, they couldnt get him quite right.
According to James Campbell, author of The Art Of Winnie-the-Pooh, who is married to Shepards great-granddaughter, the first sketches of Pooh  inspired by Milnes son Christopher Robins toy bear  were far too fearsome.
He was far too gruff-looking  not very cuddly! says Campbell. And with rather a strong jaw.
In short, a bit too, well, beary. Not at all the sort of creature who might hide from bees hanging off a red balloon. Or set a cunning trap to catch a Hefalump or sing 'tiddly om-pom', over and over again.
It didnt help that Milne hadnt wanted to work with Shepard at first. When F H Townsend, Punchs art editor, showed him some of Shepards drawings, Milne huffed: What on earth do you see in this man, hes perfectly hopeless.
You wait, said Townsend. And when Shepard got home after drawing that first bear, he remembered his own son Graham once had a teddy, too. But a bear far less threatening, more cuddly and with a twinkle in his eye, called Growler. (Yes, Growler!)
He drew him, complete with fat tummy, upturned nose and pleasingly comforting physique, sent it to Milne  and that was that.
This first depiction of Growler found in one of Shepards recently unearthed sketchbooks, hidden for nearly a century and revealed for the first time in Campbells wonderful book  shows how simple and economical his style is. Just a few soft pencil lines but, unmistakably, it is Pooh Bear.
In a second early effort, we see him clutching what Campbell says looks like a barrel, but was sure to become a jar of honey.
Milne was happy, Winnie-the-Pooh was born in that poem for Punch and, over the next 90 years, his adventures inspired films, philosophy books, a multi-million pound Disney franchise, an Estonian punk band called Winny Puhh and a court case over rights involving Disney.
Milne and Shepard even became firm friends. They had plenty in common  they were both officers in World War I, were both married with young children, lived in the same part of London and worked for Punch.
But their working style was revolutionary. Instead of Milne writing the words and Shepards pictures added later as if an afterthought, they collaborated, with neither in charge.
So Milne based Christopher Robin on his son and Pooh on the character (if not the unappealing looks) of his sons teddy Winnie-the-Pooh. Who, to confuse matters further still, started life as Edward Bear, but was renamed in honour of Winnie, a black bear originally from Winnipeg, Canada, with whom Christopher Robin Milne fell in love on trips to London Zoo. Pooh was the name of his pet swan.
The two men met most weeks at Milnes London house, where Milne would sit on the sofa reading the poem or story, young Christopher would sit on the floor playing with the characters and, by his side, EH Shepard sat making sketches.
Crucially, Shepard relied not just on his son Grahams portly teddy, but also on memories of Graham himself. According to Campbell, the fictional Christopher Robin is a sort of amalgam of the two boys and their lives.
Sometimes the Shepards would visit the Milnes country home, Cotchford Farm in Ashdown Forest, near Hartfield, Sussex  the inspiration for Hundred Acre Wood  so he could get the topography right. Many Shepard illustrations can be matched to real views and all were inspired by the open heathlands of gorse, silver birch, bracken and pine trees.
Even the game of Poohsticks was originally played by AA Milnes son Christopher on a footbridge across a tributary of the River Medway, close to their cottage.
The wooden bridge is now a tourist attraction and when it needed replacing, the design was based on drawings of the bridge by Shepard, which differed from the original structure.
Chapter by chapter, other characters  such as Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga and Roo  emerged. Most were toys from Christophers nursery bought as birthday and Christmas presents from Harrods. However, Owl and Rabbit, and Rabbits extensive network of friends and family, sprung from Milnes imagination, so Shepard just had to guess.
The books revolutionised the world of illustrated childrens books, as for the first time, illustrations were embedded in the text, not added later. Bees buzzed across the page and balloons floated skywards or sagged as Eeyore looked in dolefully from the side.
The readers reaction was overwhelming. The first book of illustrated poems, When We Were Very Young, was published on November 6, 1924. With a print run of 5,000, it sold out on publication day. Success overwhelmed them. They werent expecting it at all.
Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926. It was an instant sensation. In the U.S. it sold 150,000 copies by the end of the year and has never been out of print. Next came Now We Are Six, the second collection of poems, followed by The House At Pooh Corner, the fourth and final book, published in 1928.
AA Milne wrote no more childrens literature  perhaps because Christopher Robin had grown too old to read them.
But Shepard continued to illustrate later editions of the Pooh books and brought to life Mole and Ratty and co in Kenneth Grahames The Wind In The Willows.
Shepard and Milne never worked together again but remained close friends until Milne died in 1956, aged 74, having suffered from a stroke years earlier.
When Christopher Milne wrote his 1974 memoir, The Enchanted Places, he gave a copy to Shepard, inscribed, For Ernest Shepard who added so much of his own very special magic to that of the Enchanted Places. Shepard died in 1976, aged 96.
Now, more than 90 years after he ate his first jar of honey, Pooh and his friends are to be honoured with an exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London.
Original drawings will be displayed for the first time in nearly 40 years, alongside video and audio clips, including a 1929 recording of Milne reading Winnie-the-Pooh, as part of the UKs largest ever exhibition on the bear.
Will Growler be there, too Oh, please dont ask. His life took a rather unfortunate turn. After the outbreak of World War II, he voyaged to Canada, where he was dearly loved by Shepards granddaughter Minette Hunt  only to be savaged by a neighbours dog.
A similar fate, it transpires, befell Piglet  Christopher Milnes toy pig was ripped to pieces by dogs. -dailymail.co.uk

An icon hardly like any other
Ivan Corea recollects life with his father Vernon Corea, sharing 7 important life lessons his father taught him. The legendary Radio Ceylon and BBC Broadcaster passed away 15 years ago on the 23rd of September. His birthday falls on the 11th of September. Vernon Corea was the older brother of Ernest Corea, former Editor-in-Chief of the Daily News.
Recently I came across information about an iconic BBC radio programme called Listening with Mother, a childrens programme which ran from 1951 to 1982. The programme started with the words: Are you sitting comfortably It jogged my memory when I was sitting comfortably in the 1960s and 1970s, on the floor of our house at 5 Maha Nuge Gardens - my father was seated nearby. We used to listen to the Radio Ceylon programmes he had recorded with the SLBC or listening to fascinating programmes on the BBC, Deutche Welle, or the Australian Broadcasting Company  it was a real experience listening with Father  he showed me where to find these radio stations, using the dial on the old Blaupunkt radio.
I so enjoyed these moments with my father and these memories of childhood are firmly etched in my mind. Dad was a fountain of knowledge about these international radio stations, he used to tell me all about the radio programmes and we sat together, sometimes late into the night, listening to the radio. It was a special moment between Father and Son and he used to answer all the questions I asked him.
My father Vernon Corea passed away peacefully on the morning of the 23rd of September 2002  12 days earlier, my wife Charika, my son Charin and I visited him on his 75th Birthday. It was a very emotional moment. For some reason, my father was in tears. That was the last birthday I celebrated with him. He used to come on the train and the tube to Essex in the United Kingdom to see his Grandson Charin who called him Gaga. In fact, all the grandchildren called him Gaga. It was a short form for Grandad. We used to tease him when in 1984 Freddie Mercury and the rock group Queen released a song called Radio Ga Ga, we thought that was rather apt and sang the chorus to Dad: All we hear is Radio Ga Ga, radio, someone still loves you. He used to give us his famous half smile whenever he heard the song on the radio. They say that the Freddie Mercurys lyrics were all about how television overtook radio in popularity.
Radio Society of Sri Lanka
Dad had a hand in that too. Reel it back to 1972 and I clearly remember my father showing me a few pages of a script he had personally typed on the old typewriter at home. It was a historic moment for Ceylon when the Radio Society of Sri Lanka carried out the first ever television experiment in Colombo. If I remember correctly, both John Amaratunga and Shan Wickramasinghe were involved in the dawn of the television age in Sri Lanka, via the crucial work of the Radio Society of Sri Lanka, a national non-profit organisation on the island founded by amateur radio enthusiasts in 1950.
Dads picture appeared on the grainy black and white television set, presenting the first ever television programme on this experimental broadcast in Colombo. Yohann de Silva accompanied by the Sparkling Shadows group and Jennifer Labrooy, reading from the 'Light of Asia, were among the highlights of the first ever television programme experiment. Dad created history where television in Sri Lanka was concerned. I remember reading an article about Dad published in a magazine in the 1960s stating When television comes to Sri Lanka, ask Vernon. Here he was heralding history on a locally made transmitter by the Radio Society of Sri Lanka on the 15th of June 1972.
My father was a pioneer of Radio Ceylon. He joined Radio Ceylon as a relief announcer in 1956. He joined the panel of Announcers on a full-time basis in 1957. He was appointed by the charismatic Australian radio expert Clifford Dodd who was sent to Ceylon under the Colombo Plan to oversee the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. Dodds appointment was one of the real successes of Radio Ceylon he masterminded the transformation of the radio station into a lucrative money spinner for the country. Radio Ceylon was King of the Airwaves in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Sri Lanka with millions of people tuning into the radio station from across the Indian sub-continent. Sometimes even radio enthusiasts in the United States found Radio Ceylon on their equipment, according to the QSL cards issued by the station.
This was the heyday of Radio Ceylon. When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Mount Everest, they tried to tune into some news over their transistor radio. They tried several radio stations around the world  the BBC, Voice of America, All India Radio  none of them worked. However, there was one radio station that came out loud and clear on top of the world, on Mount Everest and that was good old Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in Asia. Broadcasting was started on an experimental basis in Ceylon now Sri Lanka by the Telegraph Department in 1923, just three years after the inauguration of broadcasting in Europe. Radio Ceylon came into being three years after the BBC so this station plays a pivotal role in the history of broadcasting.
Historic radio station
A young engineer called Edward Harper was despatched to the Telegraph Office in downtown Colombo taking up his post as Chief Engineer. He was the first person to promote broadcasting on the island. Edward Harper, together with Ceylonese radio enthusiasts, founded the Ceylon Wireless Club. They broadcast gramophone music from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office, aided by a small transmitter built by Telegraph department engineers from the radio equipment of a captured German submarine. These experiments were hugely successful just like the TV experiments undertaken by the Radio Society of Sri Lanka. Edward Harper was the Father of Broadcasting in Ceylon.
A few years ago, prior to the visit to Sri Lanka of Prince Charles the Prince of Wales I, wrote to the Foreign Office  I felt this man was a Great Briton he brought radio to South Asia and hardly anyone in the United Kingdom. He doesnt feature in the list of Great Britons who were pioneers.
Because of these experiments, a regular broadcasting service was instituted in Ceylon, on 16th December 1925 - with the name Colombo Radio, and the call sign Colombo calling. People still hark back to those glory days of Radio Ceylon. A decade ago I founded the Radio Ceylon Facebook Group using social media to inform the younger generation about this historic radio station. I have now handed over the reins to my sister Ouida who has visited the SLBC, Viran Corea (son of the media personality Vijaya Corea), Jude Gunawardene and Chrismarlon Perera who is studying in Canada. They are now popularising Radio Ceylon to a new generation. The membership Radio Ceylon Facebook Group is well over 7,000 followers.
My father took to broadcasting like a duck taking to founder, he presented some of the most popular radio programmes in South Asia. Years after he died I came across fiction books mentioning my father and the radio programs he presented - he was referred to in Monkey Man, a book by Usha K.R. published by Penguin Books in India.
Glen Peters the Indian born author now living in Wales in the United Kingdom refers to Dad in his novel Mrs DSilvas Detective Instincts and the Shaitan of Calcutta. The novel was published in India.
From Great Britain came a book titled: Asian Aunty-Ji life with the BBC Asian Network, BBC Editor Mike Curtis paid a tribute to my father writing about the impact he had with Radio Ceylon, culminating with his program London Sounds Eastern, on BBC Radio London 206.
The influential Hindu Newspaper placed my father Vernon in the Top 5 broadcasters of the world, citing he him as one of the greats in broadcasting. The Hindu also stated that he was the first to introduce Sinhala music onto the English Services of Radio Ceylon. This is certainly true, he promoted the talents of young unknown musicians who achieved stardom on the island and it was a first when he introduced Sinhala music on English radio programmes over the airwaves of the station.

Kuala Lumpur school fire kills students and teachers

At least 25 students and teachers have died in a fire at a religious school in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.
The fire at the Tahfiz Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah broke out in the early hours of the morning.
"The number of confirmed dead are 23 students and two wardens," Khirudin Drahman, director of the fire and rescue department, told AFP.
"I think it is one of the country's worst fire disasters in the past 20 years," he said.
"It really does not make sense for so many to die."
AFP cited police as saying the students were all boys between the age of 13 and 17.
In Islamic tahfiz schools - where children study the Koran - students often live at the school.
Safety concerns
Images and videos circulating online appeared to show the entire upper room of the school, where students would have been sleeping, ablaze.
Officials said fire engines were at the site within minutes, and the blaze was put out within an hour.
Pictures later in the morning showed charred beds inside the school and scorched windows on the top floor.
Local media reports said police believe the fire started on the second floor. Many of the bodies were found piled up near the windows, which were barred with metal grills, said reports.
A number of students were also been taken to hospital, some suffering from smoke inhalation.
Prime Minister Najib Razak tweeted his sympathies to those affected while a government Minister said the incident should be quickly investigated "so that we will be able to prevent future disasters".
"We sympathise with the families. It is one of the worst fires involving so many lives in the capital in recent years, said Loga Bala Mohan, according to AFP.
Malaysian authorities have raised concerns about safety measures at unregulated private religious schools.
Local media report there have been more than 200 fires at such schools since 2015.

Lanka unveils first SME incubator, national policy
Sri Lanka unveiled its first ever SME incubator on 13 September and vowed its third generation economic reforms shall be led by innovation, technology transfer and SMEs.
We need to change our traditional mind-sets and think anew said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on yesterday in Makandura Industrial Zone of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
Wickremesinghe was addressing the launch event of Sri Lankas first ever Incubator and Technology Transfer Centre (ITTC) for SMEs, a joint collaboration between National Enterprises Development Authority (NEDA), Wayamba University and supported by Malaysian Technology Development Cooperation.
The Cabinet approval was first received in July 2016 and the project, due to its importance, was fast tracked to be completed at the earliest time frame. At this event Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also launched NEDAs new web portal www.neda.gov.lk
We are planning large scale industry zones beyond Hambanthota and all the way to Wellawaya and on this side, extending to Wayamba Province, said PM Wickremesinghe and added: For us to go into our next phase, we need more and more innovations. We need to change our traditional mind-sets and think anew. This is how Uber and AirBnB were born.
There are a little more than one million registered SMEs and MSMEs in Sri Lanka providing employment to three people on average said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen. We believe that SMEs are more than 70% of the total number of enterprises in the economy providing 45% of the employment and contributing to 52% of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP).
My Ministry and NEDA have introduced the National SME Policy and National SME Authority and we are handing over the first National SME Policy the Prime Minister at this event.
The SME incubator launched today is the first ever SME incubator in Sri Lanka and this is not just an incubator. It is also the first ever technology transfer centre for Sri Lankan SMEs.
This centre will focus on helping to establish technology SMEs across the country. The Malaysian Technology Development Cooperation has given us their expertise and supported us to establish Sri Lankas first SME incubator.
Chairman of NEDA Omar Khamil said that the incubator is part of the third generation economic reforms of the Unity Government.
As our Prime Minster said, our reforms are led by innovation, technology and SMEs he said.

Lest bureaucrats be judged!
The judgment delivered by the Colombo High Court last week, finding former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita guilty of criminal misappropriation of public funds, sent a powerful message to public servants throughout the country- and will not be without a political fallout.
Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga found Weeratunga and Pelpita guilty of all charges against them. They were accused of diverting TRC funds to fund the distribution of sil redi to voters in the run up to the 2015 presidential election campaign. They were each sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment for all the charges with a fine of two million rupees. They were also ordered to pay the 50 million rupees each to the TRC.
After the verdict, Weeratunga and Pelpita were led away to the Welikada prison. When the verdict was delivered at the High Court last Thursday, politicians- who usually throng court premises when one of their colleagues is in the dock- were conspicuous by their absence. On Monday, Weeratunga and Pelpita lodged an appeal against the verdict.
This is the first high profile corruption case to reach a conclusion since this government took office and would go towards answering its critics who claimed that none of the culprits who engaged in corruption during the previous regime was being punished. However, detractors would claim that neither Weeratunga nor Pelpita were politicians and were merely carrying out orders on behalf of their political masters.
Distribution of sil redi
In his judgment, the High Court Judge observed that on December 5, 2014, just a month prior to the presidential election, a sum of Rs.600 million had been remitted to a bank account maintained by the former Secretary to the President through the intervention of Pelpita, without approval from the board of directors of the TRC.
In a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Kulatunga noted that evidence given by a secretary attached to the TRC had proved that the directors approval was not obtained for this transaction. It was revealed that this transaction had been done through a method called circulation in which no written approval was given to remit the funds, the High Court Judge observed.
While stating that he cannot agree with the contention of the accused that the sil redi distribution programme was a long term process, the High Court Judge maintained that this had been initiated with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate in an urgent manner.
The defence had argued that the distribution of sil redi comes under the expenditure of the President. The defence was of the view that due to insufficient funds at the Presidents disposal, financial assistance from the TRC was sought. However, the High Court held that the funds should have been sought through a supplementary estimate without following an irregular and illegal process.
Former Election Commissioner and now Chairman of the Elections Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya and the former Presidents Coordinating Secretary of Religious Affairs, Venerable Vatinapaha Somananda Thera were among those who gave evidence at the trial.
Weeratunga, who was Secretary to then President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the offence was committed, has evoked much sympathy. Now 67 years of age, he was a distinguished administrative officer who has held many responsible positions in government and served as secretary to Rajapaksa when the latter was Prime Minister. When Rajapaksa was elevated to the office of President, Weeratunga was appointed Secretary to the President. It must be noted that the High Court agreed that neither Weeratunga nor Pelpita appeared to have misappropriated funds for their personal use.
However, Weeratunga, being an experienced public servant, would have been aware of the errors of omission and commission committed at the highest levels of government in the Rajapaksa regime. By carrying out instructions he may have simply been doing his job but he was also following orders that were highly irregular and thereby incriminating himself. He could have chosen not to do so and resigned with his honour and dignity intact, it has been argued.
This debate- about the Sri Lankan public servant at the mercy of his or her political master- will no doubt linger on in the coming weeks but this verdict will have its political consequences. Public servants are now likely to request written instructions from politicians when questionable orders are made- and that is not a negative consequence because it then serves as a system of checks and balances both for officials and politicians.
The reaction of the two major political parties, the United National Party (UNP) and the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to the verdict has been muted. None of their stalwarts have made public statements for or against it. Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition (JO) has predictably registered its protest while the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has categorically commended the verdict.
Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was asked for his reactions to the verdict by eager media men. Usually a master at providing voice cuts, Rajapaksa found himself in all kinds of difficulties trying to defend himself. In the end, he stated that Weeratunga and Pelpita have been convicted because they were trying to foster Buddhism, a reference to the distribution of sil redi. He also took a dig at President Maithripala Sirisena, saying that his wife too could be charged because she was seen distributing sil redi with the President a few days ago.
Rajapaksas defence appeared to have been worse than the offence. The JVPs Vijitha Herath responded in style, asking whether stealing funds from the public was within the tenets of Buddhism. Herath also noted that Weeratungas wife, Indrani Sugathdasa, who served once chaired the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the courage to resign from her post when undue influences were being exerted on her- but that her husband lacked such integrity.
The JVP also queried the massive amount of 600 million rupees that is supposed to have been spent on sil redi, arguing that it was sufficient to provide material for each and every family in the country and inquired whether the average family received this gift.
Asked again at a public event as to why he did not come forward and accept responsibility for the transaction instead of allowing his secretary to be sent to prison, Rajapaksa said that if it was a mistake, he would have admitted it but maintained that it was not a mistake.
I have given eight orders in March, before the presidential election was held, based on requests received by the people. The decision to hand over sil redi was only one among these eight decisions and funds for these programmes were allocated right away. This was not done to secure an advantage at the election as some claim, Rajapaksa argued, but appeared to lose his cool with the reporter posing questions, saying he was being provoked- a rare occurrence for the usually media savvy Rajapaksa.
The verdict against Weeratunga and Pelpita, while heralding a new benchmark for politicians and public servants, comes at a time when a group within the SLFP is trying to bring about a rapprochement between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions of the party. This is with a view of contesting the upcoming Local Government and Provincial Council elections as one entity.
However the Rajapaksa faction, the JO, will see the verdict as a further insult to their cause and this will not help in mending relations between the two camps. It will also strengthen the resolve of those within the JO who are vehemently arguing that they should go it alone.
The latest victim of the tension between the two groups was Deputy Minister of Tourism Promotion and Christian Affairs, Arundika Fernando. Fernando was removed from his post by President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday. It will be recalled that Fernando had a very public spat with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga at the last meeting of the SLFPs Central Committee, when he argued for the reunification of the two factions of the SLFP.
With the Elections Commission now announcing that Local Government elections will be held in January 2018, the government is now in a race against time to try and hold polls to the provincial council on a single date. To do so, it would have to ensure the passage of the 20th Amendment by October 2, 2017. It is attempting to do so, by incorporating the necessary changes to the proposed legislation but whether they will succeed is left to be seen. That is what will be played out in the political arena in the coming weeks.

Locally produced anti-venom injections available from year end
Locally produced anti-venom injections for snake bites will be available from the end of this year. The injections for bites of five varieties of snakes will be produced in Sri Lanka, acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that at the moment anti-venom injections for snake bites are imported to Sri Lanka from countries such as India and those injections had been produced for venom found in Indian snakes and snakes in other countries. Therefore, they are not ideal to treat patients in Sri Lanka who suffer from snake bites.
According to Dr. Bandara, locally produced anti-venom injections will be a 100 percent match for venom found in local snakes. Five injections will be produced locally for the venom of cobra, Russells viper, source tailed viper, hump nosed viper and common krait viper.
The venom of Sri Lankan snakes will be used to produce the injections. Sri Lanka will produce around 50 varieties of drugs required for the country by next year and save a lot of money spent on importing those drugs, he added.

Allegedly Misappropriating Rs.650 million of state funds:
Admission to have given the order:
19th Amendment to Constitution removed Executives immunity:
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson,Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa can be taken to courts over his admission to having given the order to distribute Sil Cloth during the previous Presidential elections.
The former President and current Kurunegala MP who visited his former Secretary, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita in Welikada Prison, said the two were sentenced for having followed his orders.
Weeratunga and the former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), Director General Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs.650 million of state funds during Rajapaksas re-election campaign.
Minister Senaratne however pointed out that Rajapaksas statement came in a little too late.
He should have made the statement earlier when the case was heard for 24 days, not after visiting Welikada, he said addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday.
But this statement comes at a time when the 19th Amendment to the Constitution removed the Executives immunity under the law and all former and incumbent Presidents are liable for prosecution in a court of law.
He can even face contempt of court charges for questioning the verdict, Senaratne said.
The Minister pointed out that on September 11, 2014, during the Uva elections, the Elections Commissioner had warned the government over distributing various goods to the people, and a special note was made on the distribution of Sil cloth on that occasion too.
Furthermore, the Elections Commissioner had asked that Buddhism not be used to gain cheap political mileage. He had also warned the UPFA that if any candidate was caught distributing goods using state assets during election time, they could be disqualified even if they were to win.
On November 22, 2014, the Elections Commissioner sent a letter to Weeratunga stating that public officials who do not have political rights should refrain from participating in any activity to promote a political party, the Co-Cabinet Spokesperson said.
Lalith Weeratunga was asked to keep an eye on all of them but then he got involved too, he added.
To the Buddhist monks organizing a campaign to collect money for Weeratungas and Palpitas fine, Minister Senaratne said the true philosophy of Buddhism would be reflected if they collected funds to help the poor and vulnerable.

OLD PARLIAMENT BUILDING STANDIND THE TEST OF TIME
An excerpt from the British Period Architecture in Sri Lanka (1992) by Lakshman Alwis, reads-
The council chamber is sited in a commanding position, facing the sea and looks majestic with a grand flight of steps leading from ground towards the pedimented portico lined with columns of Ionic Origin.
From this portico one enters the spacious reception hall at first floor. The council chamber which is also at this floor, is carried up through both first and second floors giving a lofty scale and the public gallery is accommodated at the second floor, overlooking the chamber.
Members lounge and other retiring rooms, too, were accommodated at first floor and at second floor: offices, committee rooms and a library. On three sides of both first and second floors there are verandahs and balconies lined with massive colonnades. A central lightwell provided daylight to main corridors.
In 1948 when Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain, the Council Chamber was entirely rearranged to accommodate the New House of Representatives of the first Prime Minister Hon. D.S. Senanayake. In these alterations a processional way was created across the central lightwell from Reception Hall to the Chamber.
The Old Parliament and the present day Presidential Secretariat was built with a powerful vision in mind - That was that all the deliberations, which will be conducted within those walls may serve to weld the several communities and classes of the population together into an organic unity of national life and national progress, not by the suppression of varying traditions but by their co-ordination on a basis of mutual respect. ArchWorld talks to Archt. Channa Daswatte on the modern day Presidential Secretariat.
Archt. Channa Daswatte
The building is several hundred meters long and only three- storeys high. It has been created using striking brown granite. The neo-classical architecture incorporates colonnades. It is said that the structure is a typical instance of the official British architecture employed in Asian colonies to reflect imperial glory.
The architecture of the Presidential secretariat/ old parliament is what is known as a neo-classical building and follows the classical city ego architecture originating in Greece and Rome. It was built as the House of Representatives when Sri Lankan was given Universal Franchise in 1931. The National Parliament met there after independence until the Parliament in Sri Jayawardenepura was built in 1982. The interior was designed as a semi- circular seating layout as it is today, but was changed to a Westminster layout with government and opposition benches after independence and continued to be so till the renovations that made it the Presidential Secretariat, said Daswatte
History
In 1929, this Old Parliament was built on the right bank of the Beira Lake, which had previously been a swamp and soon after the council chamber. The building was declared open as the Legislative Council on January 29, 1930, by Governor Sir Herbert Stanley. Today, it is home to the Presidential Secretariat.
Since 1983 the Old Parliament, has functioned as the Presidential Secretariat and the Office of the Executive President. This is where all important official announcements are made and appointments of state administered. The building, especially the former Council Chamber, is also the venue for various state functions. This is also the place where the President accepts the Letter of Credence of incoming ambassadors as well as high commissioners.
The Old British Parliament is a Neo-Baroque style building that used to house the Legislative Council of Ceylon. The British Coat of Arms adorned the top of the building face till 1948, when it was replaced by the arms of the Dominion of Ceylon and was once again replaced in 1972 with the arms of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The statues that adorn the grounds are that of the distinguished statesmen of Sri Lanka.
The statues are all leaders of our nation who may at one time or another been a Member of the legislature. The statues are that of the First Prime Minister of Ceylon Hon. D.S. Senanayake, Prime Minister of Ceylon Hon. Dudley Senanayake, Prime Minister of Ceylon Sir John Kotalawela and Attorney General and first native elected member of a Legislative Council in the British Empire, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, stated Daswatte.
The chief architect of the Public Works Department, Austin Woodson was responsible for the design of the building with his initial estimate of Rs. 400,000 for the scheme being later revised Rs. 450,000, taking into account the extra expenses involved. Woodson gave the building an open outlook so it would receive the maximum benefit from cool breeze. He was also wise enough to locate the Council Chamber on the east side of the building, away from the noise of the sea and sheltered from the afternoon sun.
Style
The architecture follows the typical buildings of power built by the British Empire in its long rule. The central section derives from the Ancient Greek and Roman temple fronts. The Asiatic society on Horniman Circle in Bombay has an almost identical front built in 1814 but with Doric columns as opposed to the ionic columns we have in the building in Colombo.
When commenting on the present condition of the architecture of the Presidential Secretariat, I feel it is very well kept. In its conversion during the Jayawardena Presidency by Geoffrey Bawa into the presidential secretariat, a very elegant modern addition was done between it and the secretariat building. A recent addition has been made following and copying the earlier classical tradition which seems a bit unfortunate as it seems to distract from 4th main building, But overall the external parts of the building appear to be in grid order, said Daswatte.

PCB spends US$ 2.5-3 million for Independence Cup
The Pakistan Cricket Board will end up spending anywhere between US$ 2.5-3 million for the staging of the three-match T20I series against World XI, as it bids to build on unprecedented international goodwill and bring more cricket back to Pakistan.
A major chunk of that figure will have been spent on bringing the World XI team to Lahore. Nobody has spoken publicly about how much the players are being paid but it is thought to be in the region of $100,000 each. The rest is made up mostly by the logistic costs involved.
The PCB will not, at least, have to pay for the entire costs of the security apparatus for the series. Two international security consultants - Reg Dickason and Nicholls Steyn and Associates - have been engaged, with the $1.1 million cost picked up by the ICC. That is a result of efforts by the PCB over the last year to seek some kind of assistance from the game's governing body from their projected loss of revenues from the absence of international cricket at home.
Although the total spend on the series may appear hefty for a board that hasn't hosted an India series in well over a decade and has hosted one international series at home since 2009, the PCB's financial health appears to be better than has been often thought.
The board has made a profit every year since 2011 and has, in fact, tripled it in the three years to June 2016 - for the year 2015-16, according to its annual report, the PCB made a profit of $14.5 million dollars.
That is one reason a member of the board's governing body said he would be happy even if they manage to just break even over the course of this week. Since this series was not part of Pakistan's original FTP schedule, it does not come under the five-year broadcast deal they signed with Ten Sports in 2013, thought to be around $150 million.
What they end up making, the investment, as the board member pointed out, is a longer-term one. If this series goes off without incident, it paves the way for Sri Lanka to play a solitary T20 in Lahore on October 29 and, potentially, West Indies to visit for a three-match series of T20s in November.

ROBOT REVOLUTION
If you are tired of theoretical learning, and marvel about the Transformers and Iron Man, then 2017 FIRST Global Challenge might be your cup of tea. The worlds first International Robotics Olympiad for high school students was launched recently in Washington D.C, USA. Initiated by FIRST Global, a none profit organization, the event was aimed towards kindling youth passion towards Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).
Armed with the vision of creating young scientific leaders who will collaborate to create a better tomorrow, the FIRST Global Challenge competition saw youth taking on an Olympic-style robotics challenge. The event encourages the youth to think of STEM rooted solutions for global challenges. For 2017 FIRST Global Challenge the youth leaders needed to design, construct and program a robot which will be able to differentiate between clean and dirty water and ultimately provide access to clean and potable water. This is known as one of the 14 Grand Challenges of Engineering as claimed by the US National Academy of Engineering, UK Royal Academy of Engineering, and Chinese Academy of Engineering.
More than 160 nations took part in the inaugural FIRST Global Challenge. A dynamic youth team from Elizabeth Moir School was selected to take part in the event. Youth from many diverse nationalities and walks of life took part in the competition which redefined global robotics and bridged diversity among high school students.
Ishini Gammanpila, Akash Gnanam, Ali Anver and Vinidu Jayasekera made up the Elizabeth Moir School team which ventured on to USA to represent Sri Lanka in the 2017 FIRST Global Challenge. They were mainly selected to take part in 2017 FIRST Global Challenge mainly due to the facts that they were able to meet the tight deadline as well as the enthusiasm that they displayed in taking part in the event.
Collaborating with Tech Assured Holdings (Pvt), the youth worked tirelessly for long hours trying to build a robot that can meet the given expectations. Backed by Dilum Rathnasinghe and Shivashankaran Satchithananthan from the academic staff the youth worked with their toolkit that was provided by FIRST Global Challenge. This huge box which was equipped with essentials provides each team with what they need to make their robot so that each and every entry is manufactured using a uniform set of instruments. This also makes sure that all are on equal grounds on what kind of tools and materials they use to make their product and their work will be judged purely on talent and creativity. Thus Don Pablo Gasper Telliez was born. His name was a combination of their favourite television series Narcoss Protagonist Pablo Escobar and their French teacher Isabelle Telliez who has lent them her classroom to work on the project during the afternoons.
Team Sri Lanka for 2017 FIRST Global Challenge comprised a mixed bag of talent and skills. Akash Gnanam (18) is the schools Drama Club President. He is also a programming guru.
Sharing his experiences about being part of 2017 FIRST Global Challenge Akash said, Overall the competition was just amazing. Firstly, it was extremely challenging because there were all sorts of problems you dont run into until the actual competition. This meant we had to do a lot of repairs there but when Pablo succeeded it made it all the more satisfying. As the competition progressed our robot got better and better and that was really cool to see.
He notes that apart from the actual competition it was amazing to meet so many people from different countries.
They were all extremely cool and seemed to really like our design. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity and the saddest moment was saying goodbye to everyone, including Pablo who we had to semi-disassemble for the journey home, he said.
Ishini Gammanpila (16) has been building remote controlled boats with her father since she was eight years old. She was also one of the leads in this years school play  Rumours. She is a full scholar at the school who has excelled not only academically but also in swimming, singing and dancing.
Before we left Sri Lanka we expected everything to be friendly and calm at the competition. But we were completely mistaken. It was so much more intense than we had thought it was going to be. What was amazing was that the team never gave up whenever something went wrong. Mr Dilum was especially supportive throughout the competition. He was always there to help us. Even though the competition was intense, we managed to make friends with so many teams and got their signatures on our FIRST Global t-shirt as a memento. All in all, it was an incredible experience! she enthused.
Ali Anver (17) is a big thinker. He believes that STEM related advances are accelerating at a speed that frankly scares him. But instead of shying away from these advances he wants to be part of it.
Id never known that you could create so much variety in robots out of one single kit! Frankly the creativity of the robots belonged in the future. Each and every team approached the same problem with different solutions based on their ways of ideas and thinking. Every team could complain and laugh about their robot to everybody else. The humanity in the robotics was just so noticeable... and you couldnt help but cheer everyone on. Thats how Id like it to be remembered - not as a massive competition but just people building something more than robots together, Ali said.
Vinidu Jayasekera (16) is a master of coding and imagines herself in a job that allows her to pursue Artificial Intelligence. She believes that team Sri Lanka performed exceptionally well despite the relatively short time period they had to build the robot.
We worked well as a team and supported each other in every way. I believe we had amazing teams in all our alliances throughout the competition. It was very easy to get along with them and that helped to achieve the second goal of the competition which was to create bonds between different countries. For me, personally, the best part of the competition was meeting people from different cultures. It felt like the whole world was together. In the end, I wasnt disappointed that we didnt win any award because we had already received the biggest award we could hope for: friendship, she opined.
The teams message to other yoiuth who wish to excel in their talents is just be passionate and pursue their goals.
Always research and read. Practise building and coding, Just keep on working on getting better. Then when you get the chance to be in a competition like this one, you will be good, they echoed.

Sangakkara back with Surrey scores unbeaten 85
LONDON - England opener Mark Stonemans fine century put Surrey in charge on the
opening day of their County Championship match against Yorkshire.
The 30-year-old, who made his debut in the Test series win over West Indies this summer, hit a chanceless 131 as the hosts piled up 398-3 at The Oval.
Rory Burns also struck 75 in a first-wicket stand of 178 with Stoneman.
Kumar Sangakkara was unbeaten on 85 at stumps in his first game for the county since June, with Ben Foakes on 64.
Former Sri Lanka batsman Sangakkara has returned for the final three matches of Surreys season after spending two months with the Jamaica Tallawahs in the Caribbean Premier League.
Steven Davies scored 111 in Somersets total of 330-9 on day one of their Championship match against title-chasing Lancashire at Taunton.
Matt Parkinson has figures of 4-68 for Lancashire, who started 36 points behind Division One leaders Essex.
Davies put on 119 with captain Tom Abell (46) for the fifth wicket en route to his second Championship century of the season off 160 balls. The hosts got to their third batting point late on after a brief rain delay.
Those bonus points and a good start could prove crucial for relegation-threatened Somerset, who are 13 points adrift of sixth-placed Middlesex and need a positive result to boost their own survival prospects as much as Lancashire do for their title challenge.
Division Ones leading two wicket takers Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer each claimed another four scalps as Essex took a big step towards the County Championship title at Edgbaston.
Despite a solid effort from opener Dom Sibley, who was last out for 76, bottom club Warwickshire totalled only 201. In-form fast bowler Porter took 4-47, his fifth successive haul of four or more, and off-spinner Harmer 4-62.
Essex then reached stumps on 69-0, with former Bears opener Varun Chopra on 42.
Eyeing a big score on his first return to Edgbaston since going back to Chelmsford a year ago, the ex-Warwickshire captain was accompanied by Nick Browne, who was also still there on 23 when bad light forced an early close.
Former Warwickshire skipper Ian Bell, who has been averaging little more than 20 in first-class cricket this season, looked back to near his best in a fluent 37 before he too was leg before wicket to one that jagged back from Neil Wagner.
An unbeaten 102 from Neil Dexter helped Leicestershire to 325-7 on day one against promotion-chasing Worcestershire at New Road. The visitors had been reduced to 25-3 before captain Mark Cosgrove (74) passed 1,000 Championship runs in 2017.
Dexter was 94 not out when there was a brief delay for bad light and he reached his first century of the season with the 18th four of his innings. Joe Leach, Division Twos leading wicket-taker in 2017, took 3-65.
The home sides captain now has 61 Championship wickets this season, but India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was unable to make a breakthrough on day one, his 29 overs costing 99 runs.
Opener Cameron Bancroft struck his first century of the season to give Gloucestershire a solid start on day one against Kent at Bristol. The Australian batted all day for 124 not out to leave the hosts 242-5 at the close.
He shared an opening stand of 141 with Chris Dent (59) before Joe Denly (2-64) struck for Kent, who chose to field.
Kent fought back with three wickets in the final session before bad light brought an early finish.
Bancroft reached his 10th first-class hundred from 197 deliveries before going into his shell after tea to ensure he remained unbeaten at the close, which came with 9.3 of the scheduled overs still be bowled.
Fifth-placed Kent have drawn their last four Division Two matches and are without a win since 26 May, while Gloucestershire are one place and 30 points below in sixth.
Promotion-chasing Northamptonshire had the upper hand on day one of their County Championship Division Two match, as they reached 59-2 after hustling the home side out for just 207. Richard Gleeson led the way with 5-60 in an accurate display of seam bowling. A seventh-wicket stand of 97 between Andrew Salter (59) and Craig Meschede (49) looked set to rescue Glamorgan in Cardiff. But Northants bowlers started and finished the innings strongly.
Sussex took six wickets in the evening session to fight back against Derbyshire on day one at Hove.
The visitors reached 227-3 at tea but ended on 338-9 with David Wiese taking 4-63 and George Garton 3-79.
Sussex start the match 36 points behind second-placed Worcestershire with a game in hand as they push for promotion from Division Two.
No play was possible on day one of the County Championship Division One match between Middlesex and Hampshire because of wet conditions at Uxbridge. Sixth-placed Middlesex are 13 points ahead of Somerset, who occupy the second relegation spot. Hampshire, who are third, are 13 points better off than their opponents.

SLSI yet to set standards for bio-degradable compost bags
There were mixed reactions from people over the polythene ban while the packaging industry and others raised their concerns. The government simply imposed the ban on polythene without taking any measures to replace it with an alternative and they are still in the process of making regulations and setting standards.
Chairman of the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Prof. Lal Darmasiri in a recent interview with the Daily News said that they are taking measures to promote bio degradable polythene and assured that bio degradable polythene bags will come to the market within the next few weeks. However, when the Daily News attempted to contact the CEA Chairman on their latest progress, he was not available for comment and said he was busy at meetings.
Deputy Director General of SLSI W. N. N. Satharasinghe meanwhile said that SLSI is taking initiatives to set standards for bio degradable polythene bags. She said that they do not have enough facilities to check the quality and standards of the bio degradable polythene bags. There are a few companies in Sri Lanka that manufacture bio degradable polythene bags with international standards. Yet, Sri Lanka does not have a procedure to certify those internationally approved products. Satharasinghe said they are looking for a possible method to certify the internationally approved bio degradable products as well.

Following a directive from Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva was sworn in as Provincial Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs, Rural Development, Cultural and Art Affairs, Social Welfare, Probation and Child Care Services, Womens Affairs, Home Economic Enhancement, Housing and Constructions, and Manpower and Employment at the Governors Secretariat yesterday.
Accordingly, Weerasumana Weerasinghe was cast out of his ministerial portfolios held by him.
The Chief Minister is also the Provincial Minister of Finance, Planning, Law and Order, Engineering Services, Health, Indigenous Medicine, Local Government, Transport and Tourism.
Following the new appointment, he also has the above ministries formerly held by Weerasumana Weerasinghe.
Commenting on his decision to expel the former minister, the governor said that any councillor, once he or she was appointed as a minister, is bound and obliged to uphold the collectiveness and unity of the Cabinet, and has to perform his responsibilities and obligations to the utmost benefit of the people of the province.
A minister is expected to carry out the policies and development plans of the government. He is not supposed to work according to his personal political views with regard to the affairs of the council. If a minister fails to fulfill the aspirations of the people as the Governor of the Province, I am constitutionally empowered to take a suitable decision over the member of the Cabinet. Hence, I had to take a decision over the controversial conduct of the former minister during the past few months, the governor said.
Provincial Ministers U. G. D. Ariyathilake, Chandima Rasaputra and H. W. Gunasena were also sworn in front of Chief Minister on the occasion.
Former Minister Weerasumana Weerasinghe contested on the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket at the 2014 Southern Provincial Council election and was elected to the council from the Matara district.
He is a member of the Communist Party. He had taken part in the Provincial Cabinet meeting held yesterday just a few hours before his dismissal unaware of the developments which were taking place regarding his ministerial portfolio. He had come to know about his dismissal while he was at his ministry at Dhakshina Paya yesterday, taking part in the public day activities.
However, when the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was moved at the Provincial Council Meeting, he had voted against it, joining hands with the Joint Opposition loyalists of the council. Commenting over his dismissal, the sacked minister told the media that he was not bothered about the removal and he was satisfied over his performances as Provincial Minister for he could render a remarkable service to the people of the South as the Provincial Minister.

Sugathadasa track re-laying commences
Training possible from January - Sports Minister:
The re-laying of Sugathadasa synthetic running track which was delayed for about a year due to tender procedure issues commenced yesterday at 9.15 a.m. under the patronage of Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara. The Access-Konika Joint Venture was offered the contract of re-laying the 200m and 400m tracks recently after the facility was closed in 2013.
According to the Sports Minister Jayasekara, the new track will be completed in December. He also said that local athletes were greatly affected by the closing of the Sugathadasa Stadium running track for three years and that they will be able to start training by next January.
"I regret for the damage caused to Lankan athletics by wasting too much time as we had to call for tenders twice," the Minister said.
The tender has been given to a Rs. 269 million bid to Access-Konika Joint Venture. The same company was offered with the contract after the very first tender calling. But following complaints to the Presidential Procurement Board, blaming that the tender board has acted in a bias manner to approve a company far below the minimum standards for the task, Sports Ministry had to recall for fresh tenders last January.
After a more transparent second tender procedure the same company was given the contract, as they have fulfilled all requirements. The original synthetic running track at Sugathadasa Stadium was completed at a cost of Rs 113 million, but the only big event conducted on it was the 2012 Asian Junior Athletics Championship. After few months the track was in a very dilapidated condition with damages surfacing and the authorities had to stop using it from 2013.
The first tender for the re-laying of the track was called following an inspection visit by the Sports Minister last October. The inauguration ceremony of relaying the Sugathadasa Stadium running track was attended by a large number of ministers and politicians.

TIRED PEEPERS
Dark eye circles happen to the best of us. Whether they are the cause of genetics, age, allergens, dehydration or any other factor, getting rid of dark eye circles is one of beautys most frustrating battles. While logging a full nights sleep seems like a reasonable fix for the problem, those bluish rings fail to budge for some of us. Regardless of how rested or how well dressed you are, dark circles can dull your overall appearance in a matter of seconds. Though they are not a serious skin problem, they make you look tired, exhausted, unhealthy and older. So take the initiative to get rid of those unsightly shadows under your eyes by following these remedies.
Why dark eye circles appear
There are two types of dark circles. The first has a bluish tint and these are pools of blood under the skin that can be seen because of how thin and delicate the skin in that area is. It becomes more prominent due to your lifestyle and habits. Eg: lack of sleep or too much exposure to the sun.
The second has a brownish tint and this is hyper pigmentation which is partly hereditary.
Inadequate nutrition
Fluid retention from too much salt in the diet can cause the puffiness of the dark circles to act up. Drinking adequate amounts of water and eating leafy green vegetables can calm the puffiness. An iron deficiency has also been known to cause dark circles.
Connection between Vitamin K and dark eye circles
In clinical studies Vitamin K has been shown to assist in decreasing the appearance of dark eye circles. Retinoids (such as stabilized retinol) have also been proven to decrease the appearance of lines and wrinkles, stimulate collagen and assist in preventing the deposit of pigment in the epidermis. The combination of these two ingredients directly addresses the appearance of darkened colour as well as addressing fine lines, wrinkles, and other signs of aging around the eyes. Topical Vitamin C is also very popular as it is known for brightening skin tone and stimulating collagen.
Remedies for dark circles under eyes
The most important remedy is rest. However, after a certain point, gravity takes its course and as the under-eyelid skin starts to move downward, it initiates more stretching and thinning. In this case it is necessary to use day and night creams with targeted ingredients. There are great products for every budget from the drugstore brand ROC to the more pricey brand SkinCeuticals and the all natural brand Drunk Elephant.
Camouflaging dark eye circles with make up
Dark eye circles tend to be blue or gray in colour . To conceal them you need to apply a colour thats opposite on the color wheel. Therefore concealers with pinky/peachy tones are best for camouflaging dark circles. If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium peach colour.
For medium to dark skin, pick a dark peach or orange colour. When choosing a concealer go for a shade that is 1-2 shades darker than your skin colour.
Seeking medical help
If the size of the dark circles very obviously fluctuates regularly, it is best to consult a dermatologist.
Surgical or medical correction to combat the issue
Topical bleaching cream, chemical peels, laser resurfacing treatment, Intense-pulsed light treatment and Professional Microdermabrasion are some topical and surgical options that you can go for if the problem is serious. However always get advice from a medical professional before proceeding.
Prevention is better than cure
Taking care of your skin from a young age is important. Use natural oils such as avocado or argan oil or creams and serums with Vitamins A, K and C. Rest well, drink lots of water, avoid refined sugar and eat healthy. Following this fitness regime prevents more than just dark circles!

Turning the back on a legend
The Mahanayake of the Malwatte chapter, the Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera, had an unusual visitor the other day. He was none other than Sinnaiah Muttaiah, the father of world record holder for the most number of test wickets, Muttaiah Muralitharan. Obsequies over, Muralitharan senior had a complain to make to the Chief Prelate. Ven. Thibbotuwawe was told that the Pallekelle Cricket Stadium, which was re-named after his son, after the latters record breaking feat of capturing 800 test wickets, has had the name removed by certain parties for unknown reasons.
We are not aware as to the real reasons behind the scrapping of the Murali name, from the stadium. Whatever it may be, it is only right that the Minister of Sports intervenes in the matter and have the name restored. We say this because Murali had placed the country in the world cricketing map in a way which even surpasses that of the countrys famous World Cup victory in 1996. Here is why Sri Lanka was dethroned in the subsequent edition of the World Cup and never again achieved the feat. But Muralis record breaking feat, is, admittedly, insurmountable and will live on for aeons. Here is a son of the soil, who had achieved something lasting for all Sri Lankans to cheer and be proud about, unlike politicians, who have stadiums named after them for delivering little or nothing of any lasting effect.
An inquiry should be launched to ascertain who was behind the move to have the Murali name removed from the stadium. A sports facility, once christened after an individual, rarely has had its name changed in this country. There is, in Antigua, a cricket stadium named after the great Sir Vivian Richards, who, though, is a cricketing icon, who has attained immortality in the sport, has nevertheless statistically not achieved anything that is unsurpassable. Muralis 800 wickets tally, on the other hand, is indeed a superhuman effort and is bound to stand the test of time.
There are other reasons why those responsible for this act should reconsider their decision. Murali had been a unifying force, through his deeds on the cricketing field, which has gone a long way in bridging bridges in ethnic relations between the two major communities. All cricket fans, irrespective of their race, rejoiced when Murali spun his web to snare in the best of batsmen in the world and bring victory to Sri Lanka. The reception accorded to him at his final game at Galle, in the South, the Sinhala Buddhist heartland, where incidentally, he achieved his record breaking feat, was unprecedented. The entire stadium was bedecked with giant Mural cutouts and the sound of fire crackers that rang out when he claimed his 800th scalp and the carnival atmosphere that prevailed was certainly a spectacle that Galle would not have witnessed in a long time. It also has parallels, when Murlai was given the returning hero welcome in his home town, Kandy, where he was greeted by the multitudes, after almost claiming all twenty wickets to fall at the London Oval helping Sri Lanka rout England for the first time in their own den.
It is time that the Cricket Board panjandrums rid themselves out of their pettiness and do justice by a sporting icon who has done the country proud. Sri Lankas cricketing stocks have hit rock bottom and it is best that the Cricket Board officials divert their energies on reviving the fortunes of the national team rather than to remove name boards on cricket stadiums.
The Sports Minister, meanwhile, should lose no time in re-naming the stadium after Murali, if indeed, the name had undergone a change, paying heed to the pleadings of a father who had bequeathed to Sri Lanka, a national asset.
That Herath gem
A comment made by JVP parliamentarian, Vijitha Herath is bound to confound many. Responding to a journalist, at a media briefing, the young MP said his party would accept the recent Rs. 100,000 allowance offered by the government to all MPs, but at the same time adding that they were opposed to the granting such an allowance.
By way of justification, the MP says that if they did not accept the allowance, others would grab this money, refused by them.If our MPs refrain from accepting this allowance, others would rob it, he said while also adding that they are opposed to it because MPs are receiving enough facilities.
We are intrigued. The JVP prides itself as a party that always has the public interest and well-being at heart and disports itself as a crusader against waste and misuse of public funds. But, here, it has not caviled at accepting this allowance, paid for by the public, with the lame excuse that it will be pocketed by others if it turns down the offer. The Rathu Sahodharayas were also known, in the past, not to draw their MPs salaries. Is the practice still on, or they have also joined the rest of the bandwagon

Windies face tough World Cup challenge after washout
Belfast: West Indies will need to smash hosts England in the upcoming one-day international series to avoid the ignominy of being forced to qualify for the World Cup after a washout against Ireland on Wednesday.
The game at Stormont was scrapped without a ball being bowled after fresh rain followed an overnight soaking for the pitch, leaving the umpires with no choice.
It means the 1975 and 1979 World Cup winners will have to beat England 5-0 or 4-0 with either a tie or a no-result in order to qualify ahead of eighth-placed Sri Lanka, who are eight points ahead in the rankings.
Only the top seven ODI sides, apart from hosts England, currently ranked fourth, as of September 30 will qualify directly for the 50-over showpiece event in 2019.
Teams that do not gain direct entry will get another shot through a qualifying tournament.
West Indies captain Jason Holder said qualifying automatically would be a tough task but he is looking forward to the series, which starts in Manchester next week.
"England are a quality cricket side and they are playing at home," said the skipper.
"We're at the stage where we are looking to turn a corner and qualify for the World Cup, whether we have to go through the qualifiers or qualify automatically. We're excited for the series and hopefully we can play some good cricket.
"It won't be an embarrassment to play in the qualifiers. We are where we are and if we do have to play in them, we will take it one step at a time."
The West Indies, who lost the recent Test series against England 2-1, have been boosted by the return of Chris Gayle while Marlon Samuels will join up with the squad after a family bereavement.
"We are still a work in progress and hopefully more players are coming back," said Holder.
"Meantime, we have a young group of players challenging for places and hopefully they can come in and make their presence felt and feel more comfortable in the international arena."
Holder was disappointed at missing out on playing on Wednesday but could not disagree with the umpires' decision.
"Very disappointed. It was set to be a good occasion for Irish cricket and it's great to be here, albeit it's very, very cold," he said.
"It's just unfortunate the weather intervened but it was very wet out there and the last shower settled it."
The abandonment means Ireland are still waiting to play their first match against a Test-playing side since being granted full member status by the International Cricket Council in June.
West Indies fly to England on Thursday ahead of a one-off Twenty20 international at Chester-le-Street on Saturday. The ODI series starts at Old Trafford on September 19. AFP
