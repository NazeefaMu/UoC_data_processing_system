According to Alston it was love
Colombo is abuzz with talk of events from the past; the Rev. Fr. Matthew Pieris saga seems to have been given new life with the screening of the controversial film, According to Mathew. Alston Koch who portrays the role of the fearsome priest shares his views of the character
Alston Koch
He mentioned, Acting is very new to me and it was the convincing of internationally acclaimed movie director Chandran Rutnam to take on this very complicated role of Fr. Matthew that gave me the confidence to consider the role.
While engaged in research on Fr Matthew prior to filming, Alston had stumbled on many who had been introduced to good living and numerous persons who had been exorcised and continue to live a normal life. He portrayed a priest, a husband, a researcher and writer, a lover and a murderer a multi faceted personality who finally met his fate because of lust and desire.
Alston acknowledged, I would lay awake knowing the filming scene of the next day and trying to bring out the personality of the Priest, whether it was the charisma in his preaching or the ruthless scenes of dominance
Research has revealed that once Dalreen Ingram, a mother of three, started working in his office, the Priest found himself drawn to her in body and in mind.
The meeting of minds made him emotionally bonded to her,  quipped Alston.
He added she too was drawn to him, as she saw in him, a man who was able to get his thoughts into action, a man whom she could respect, unlike her husband who was unemployed and in a weak state of mind. Her vulnerability and the time spent together intensified the attraction between the two, which developed into a volatile relationship.
There is no logical explanation to the Reverends final actions. If it was desire and a lustful relationship he longed for with Dalreen, he need not have committed the horrendous murders. A spiritual man, who knew the cost of adultery continued to pursue his passion and his longing to possess her for himself solely. Was Fr. Matthew in love with Dalreen or was it just his psychopathic nature

Berry expensive
Most people have never even seen, let alone tasted, white strawberries, but theyve been a staple of the Japanese luxury fruit market for years. The Asian country actually has several varieties of white strawberries, among which the White Jewel, or Shiroi Houseki stands out as the rarest and most expensive.
White Jewel strawberries were created four years ago, by Yasuhito Teshima, and his farm in Japans Saga Prefecture remains the only one in the world that produces this unique fruit. Teshima-san claims he spent years cross-breeding different types of strawberries and perfecting his growing technique in order to come up with a large strawberry that was white both on the inside and the outside.
One of the secrets to growing White Jewel strawberries is reduced exposure to sunlight, which reduces the level of anthocyanin, the natural chemical that gives fruits and vegetables their color. But Yasuhito Teshima says that even after years of trial and error, his technique is far from perfect. Only 10 percent of his strawberries turn out white, and only a few of these are perfectly pale, with the rest featuring red patches, or sporting a milky ping hue. Once fully developed, White Jewel strawberries will not turn red, even if exposed to direct sunlight.
Teshima acknowledges that his White Jewels have to compete against other types of white strawberries developed in Japan, but claims that his are considerably larger and whiter than any of the other breeds.
As you can imagine, a novelty fruit that is ultra rare and extremely difficult to produce can fetch a very high price, and the White Jewel strawberry is a perfect example. They are sold individually for $10, or in very small packs for $40. I dont care where you live, thats super expensive for a strawberry.
The flavor is something deep, something that doesnt have a huge impact, but it does give you a slightly mysterious feeling and finally, you understand it, and it is really, really tasty, Teshima told Great Big Story.
John Daub, an expat living in Japan, got a chance to try White Jewel while visiting Teshimas farm, and reports the following, The Shiroi Houseki smells very sweet. The skin is very soft. The first bite is juicy with a initial taste like fresh pineapplebut that disappears after a couple of seconds. It gets sweet like candy. Not too overpowering. Unlike candy, the natural sugars dont stay in your mouth and leaves a fresh aftertaste.
Daub adds that in Japanese culture, rare and expensive fruit like the White Jewels are bought as special gifts, rather than just as a sweet snack.
Interestingly enough, White Jewels are not the most expensive Japanese strawberries. That title goes to Kokota strawberries, a rare breed of giant red strawberries that have good acidity and rich sweetness. They can sell for $22 apiece. Metro

Govt. to initiate rapid development initiative
United National Party Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said the United National Front under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe would implement an unprecedented rapid development initiative to protect the citizens, War Heroes and the country within the next 10 months.
He said UNP MPs would go to meet the supporters at grassroots level to understand their grievances.
"The UNP should start a new journey which is free from theft, commissions, and bribes," Premadasa said.
"The Gam Udawa initiative commenced by him as the Minister of Housing would also reach the 20,000 new villages by 2025," he said.
He was also confident that the United National Party would win all the elections in the future.
Assistant UNP Leader UNP Ravi Karunanayake said the UNP should go ahead for the sake of the people leaving behind the dark era under the Rajapaksa rule.
"A new government formed by the UNP would provide all the previous benefits to the public," he added.
Karunanayake also stressed that a stable UNP would rule the country until 2030.
UNP National Organizer Navin Dissanayake requested the people to protect unity within the party and thereby defeat the Rajapaksa regime.
"The new government to be formed from today should give priority to UNPers," he emphasized.
He also said the UNP is the only political party which has a team of good leaders as it selects its party leaders in a democratic manner, but, not on the personal interests.
UNP, during the next six months would fully work for the party supporters and to build the party up, Dissanayake said.
Jathika Hela Urumaya leader Patali Champika Ranwaka said the persons in the previous government who have failed the country by engaging in crime and corruption will soon be brought to justice.
He said the political coup on October 26 violated peoples self-respect and self-pride, which is the very reason why people fought back until victory was claimed.
Ranawaka also said that the fresh start will adhere to a peoples agenda that will ensure economic and social prosperity in the country. Ranawaka also pointed out that it was the people from all parts of the country that defeated the political coup.
We have shown that the Rajapaksas are unable to do anything that they claim. We shall never allow the Rajapaksas to come back to power again, Ranawaka said.
UNF MP, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said the peoples sovereignty had been destroyed within the past 50 days, when Mahinda Rajapaksa ruled the country, but, now the Party has made a good start for a new and a long journey.
"During the Rajapaksa regime, there was no democracy and only nepotism,"he said.
He said the country lost billions of rupees as a result of their fraudulent activities such as the Avant-Garde deal.
Former Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Ven. Dambara Amila Thera and UNF MPs addressed the rally.

Second Act opens in theaters nationwide on December 21 with Limitless emphasizing the powerful message of the movie  the only thing stopping you is you.
Limitless spotlights Lopezs instantly recognizable show-stopping voice and undeniable charisma. Penned by Sia, Limitless is sung with soaring vocals and music that delivers a timely, empowering, and inspiring message.

Opposition crossovers to be considered on unanimous agreement of Govt. MPs
A unanimous agreement from all the government MPs will be considered before accepting Opposition members who are willing to cross over, UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha yesterday said.
A group of 20 Opposition MPs requested to cross over. However, at yesterdays group meeting, some of these persons were vehemently rejected by our MPs. We have been told that the opinion of all our MPs would be considered when allowing the crossovers. We will interview these persons before we take them in, MP Bandara said.
MP Bandara was speaking at a press briefing at Temple Trees yesterday morning, along with UNP MPs Mujibur Rahman and J.C. Alawathuwala.
MP Alawathuwala said young UNP Parliamentarians have a big say in keeping the government in check and on track.
The UNP MPs also said the Cabinet would be sworn in today (18).
The UNP MPs said there are no clashes within the United National Front regarding Cabinet portfolios.
Our MPs are ready to sacrifice their portfolios to keep the Cabinet at a minimum of 30. If we are to maintain a Cabinet of 35 ministers, we will have to seek the approval of Parliament, they said.
The MPs were also critical of President Maithripala Sirisenas recent speech. They said Sirisena had no legitimate reason to sack Wickremesinge from his post or appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa of all people. It was Sirisena who said that Rajapaksa was ready to send him six foot below the ground, they said.
MP Mujibur Rahman said President Sirisena betrayed 6.2 million people who voted for the yahapalana government.
The President complains about many things. But, are we not hurt by his actions It was the UNP voters who made way for him to become the President of this country. They risked their families when supporting him. Then, he went and gave the PM post to Rajapaksa. Should we not get angry about it Should we not complain he questioned.
The only complaint against Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Treasury Bond issue. The people responsible for this issue are still in prison. A Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigated the matter. The accounts of Perpetual Treasuries Pvt. Ltd. are frozen. If President thinks that Wickremesinghe is responsible for this issue, he can file a case against him. But what about Mahinda Rajapaksa The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud and Corruption has made Rajapaksa responsible. How can President Sirisena appoint such a person to the MP post Rahman questioned.
Meanwhile, MP Bandara said the government sector had come to a standstill due to the recent political crisis. However, many government servants have acted prudently under trying circumstances. There have been several discrepancies with regards to tenders and agreements. We have received all these details. We will soon commence investigations into them, Bandara also said.
Asked if the Cabinet will include MPs who have corruption allegations such as MP Ravi Karunanayake and MP Malik Samarawickrama, the UNP MPs said that neither of those has yet been made culprits of any corruption.
On the Singapore-Sri Lanka trade agreement, MP Nalin Bandara said that they are ready to discuss any adjustments proposed by the Expert Committee appointed by the President. He also said an investment worth US$ 1 billion for an iron factory in Trincomalee is to begin as part of this trade agreement.
If someone says that the trade agreement should be cancelled, they are brainless, Bandara said.

Rapunzel of horses
Storm, an eight-year-old Haflinger mare from the Netherlands, has become a star on social media networks like Instagram thanks to her long, wavy locks.
24-year-old student and entrepreneur Naomi Beckers bought Storm from her previous owner two years ago after falling in love with her incredible hair, which interestingly, closely resembles her own blonde, curly locks. The gorgeous mare handt had her hair cut since she was only two-years-old, and she already had a decent number of social media fans when Naomi got her. So she decided to set up a new Instagram account where Storms human admirers could follow her progress, but never imagined it would become so popular. Storms Instagram now has nearly 35,000 followers, making her one of the most popular horses on the photo-sharing social network.
I was planning to post a few pictures on it from time to time, but people kept asking me when I would post another photo, Naomi told Bit Magazine. It is actually a bit out of control, but I think it is very nice that it has grown so much!
Haflinger horses are renowned for their long, beautiful hair, but Storms is longer than most. When she was about three years old she already had wavy locks that passed her shoulder and her owner decided to let the hair it grow even more, only braiding it for protection. Storms hair has kept growing over the last six years and today it measures over one meter in length, earning the nickname Rapunzel, after the famous childrens story character.
You know who Storm reminds me of Frederick the Great, aka the Fabio of Horses, a 17-year-old Friesian with equally gorgeous wavy hair, only black. Imagine if these two got together and made a baby, it would probably end up with the most incredible mane in the history of horses.

Vote on Account in Parliament this week; Budget in February
The Government will present a Vote on Account for two months in Parliament this week and will present a full-budget in mid February, UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake said. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the Vote on Account is to meet the Governments expenditure for January and February.
Budget 2019, which was previously scheduled for November 5, did not find its way to Parliament due to sudden political changes made by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 26.
The sudden change of the Prime Minister by the President led to a political standoff between the UPFA and the UNP also making adverse impacts on the countrys economy.
A Vote on Account is presented when a new government has just been sworn in and they have had no time to present a proper budget.
This procedure is a convention of Parliament and finds no mention in either the Constitution or the Standing Orders. In a Vote of Account, Parliament does not pass funds for new projects, only to those that are in progress. Departments and public agencies are allocated funds to the extent that services essential to the community have to be maintained.

He was speaking at a media briefing at his residence in Millawa on Sunday morning.
He said in three-and-a-half years after coming into power, the UNP has been able to fullfil the pledges mentioned in the election manifesto. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government has decided to give facilities to 2,000 entrepreneurs in Wayamba to develop their exports before 2020.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not initiated any important development projects in the Kurunegala district during his tenure of nearly 10 years. Now they are attempting to resume violent activities.
Whatever they do, the SLPP cannot win the game. The bankrupt Pohottuwa will have to wait for another couple of years to form a new government, he said.
The UNP is still very popular among the people and it could be seen from the tremendous public support it received, he said.

Joe Karunaratne
He strove to make a difference
We appreciate someone through our own eyes and experiences. When that person passes away, we learn more and understand better who he was through the eyes of the world he affected. He lived in Colombo and Washington, D.C., spent time in the U.K., and travelled extensively for business and pleasure. His world was large indeed, but ultimately it was to those around him who mattered most. Joe passed away on the October 18, last year.
Character mattered more than the letters after someones name of course, so it was what someone did with his degree that made the difference. Joe took his LLB and ably and graciously used the knowledge he gained to serve late Dudley Senanayake as his Private Secretary in the 1960s.
He respected public service and his times with Dudley had a profound impact on the rest of his professional career, which expanded to the private sector and the Ceylon Tobacco Company. He took that experience and his vision to develop the duty-free industry for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The stories he shared of government service then and the men and women he worked with had more to do with respect and integrity than what we know now.
With all his extensive global travels, he still loved his island home of Sri Lanka and did his part to share his values and opinions with the community. From serving in Kiwanis International to various charitable organisations, he always focused on transforming those around him and sharing his wealth in more ways than one. When he was supposed to be retired, he instead offered his counsel to younger Sri Lankans who had ideas and needed his help to move forward.Joe appreciated that network of friendships and business partnerships he developed in his lifetime in Sri Lanka. Everyone seemed to have been a batch-mate or the sister of a colleague. It is one thing to make friends, but another to cultivate friendships. It wasnt the numbers but the people who mattered to him. Charmaine and Joe hosted countless grand dinner parties on Gregorys Road and cozier meals in Colombo 3. Whether they were old childhood friends or old friends of their children, Joe made all feel welcome.
Whether it was the foundation learning he received at St. Benedicts College or the Peradeniya University, he was a keen believer of the power of learning both through theory and people.
He inspired and enabled his children to achieve and thrive in the universities in the U.S. He made sure his grandchildren understood the value of their education.
Finally, bringing Joes life into focus from a worldwide perspective back to Sri Lanka to his friends then to his children and grandchildren, little of the above could have, nay would have happened without his wife of 56 years, Charmaine.
For better or for even better, this marriage endured under the watch of the heavens. Joes successes and setbacks, joys and sorrows, and countless other aspects of his life were all experienced with Charmaine at his side.
Only biographers and God can catalogue a mans life adequately. One story to cover 83 years is all we can offer. So, we say to him, in the Latin language he enjoyed quoting, Requiescat in pace (May he [continue] to rest in peace).

Epitome of altruism
It is with profound sadness that I pen these words for my father who passed away on October 30 at the age of 80.
My dad was a kind, generous, and warm person who had a single-minded approach to life. He sacrificed most of his time to help those in need. In his magnanimity, his charitable concerns transcended boundaries of religion and race and as a result, he was a true inspiration to all who associated with him.
My father started life from humble and tragic beginnings. His father was a revenue inspector at the Colombo Municipal Council. He lost his mother before the age of five; she died while giving birth to his fourth sibling. He was raised by his father and grandparents. The family consisted of four siblings; one girl and three boys. He hails from Wellawatta, Colombo 6.
My dad was a bright student in primary school and was well-liked by teachers and peers alike. He was the only student to enter medical school from his batch. He entered on his first attempt and sailed through all his exams in the first attempt as well.
He was a hardworking and diligent student throughout his career who left no stone unturned in order to be successful. He loved his profession as he found that it was another way to help his friends and relatives in need. He went on further to qualify as a surgeon, as well as to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He had a thriving practice in the private sector of the medical profession and this helped him secure a position as a lecturer at the University of Colombo. He was also appointed as a Professor at the Baqai Medical School in Karachi, Pakistan.
My dad was an astute businessman who entered the property market in Sri Lanka. He used the proceeds from the business and medical practice to further finance his pet projects. This included his generosity to the Rotary Club of Colombo Central, Zahira College, and the All Ceylon Moors Association of which he was the President up to the time of his demise. He used his own initiative to create new projects such as the free medical clinic in Slave Island and the Janaza Services which was targetted to the underprivileged. He was heavily involved in helping Madrassa and making religious education a top priority for all. He was nominated to be the Mayor of Colombo as he worked tirelessly in his endeavour to help those in his home city.
He was a dearly loved father, brother and husband. He took his brother Faizel under his wing when he had some challenges and took care of him for the rest of his life. But he was also firm and made the need to do well academically clear to all of us. He raised us with a lot of love and always brought out his calm and sunny side with everyone.
My dads insistence on all three of us, his sons, being doctors was due to his feeling that it would bring stability to our lives; this has led us to do well in our chosen medical fields. He doted his wife and our dear mother, Zeena.
He took care of all her needs and made her the right hand person in all of his endeavours. She, in turn, took care of him during his struggles. A true marriage made with lots of love and compassion.
The illness which took his life was long and challenging one and mum took great care of him with lots of affection and empathy. During the time of his chronic ailments, he was still working on projects such as the orphanage in his mothers name. Dad was my role model, my hero; he showed me how hard work and compassion for the underprivileged could always make one a better person.
Dad touched many lives in various ways. While he is no longer with us, his accomplishments are a shining light which will last an eternity Thanks, dad, for everything. We all miss you so much. May Allah grant you a special place in heaven.

Chinese tea exports stable as demand firm, potential huge
China is expected to export 300,000 metric tons of tea leaves by the end of 2018 out of 2.8 million tons of output. Demand in Europe, the United States and emerging economies such as Africa remains stable, according the China Tea Marketing Association, a non-government industrial union.
Traditional destinations like Europe, the United States and Africa will remain the dominating consumption destinations, but there is more potential to dig, said Wang Qing, head of the CTMA. Exports are at a stable level of around 300,000 tons this year, with total value reaching about $1.5 billion.
Wang said the Chinese tea industry was facing a new historical opportunity as the country has been working on the Belt and Road Initiative.
Zhang Liming, deputy head of the Tea Industry Association of Guangdong, also predicted a stable export performance this year.
He said although the markets in the Belt and Road Initiative economies have increased, taking costs into consideration, the export volume will remain at a stable level at about 300,000 tons.
According to China customs data, in the first three quarters of 2018, China exported 263,000 tons of tea, up 0.29 percent year-on-year. It was worth $1.28 billion, up 10.41 percent year-on-year.
Green tea was the most popular category among various teas that China offered to the world, accounting for 83 percent of the exports.
Volumes of puer tea exports grew almost 21 percent although in terms of absolute figures, the variety accounted for just 2,204 tons.
Malaysia appears to be a promising market for puer exports, according to insiders. Before 2000, Malaysians didnt drink puer. But now, its the most popular Chinese tea in Malaysia, said Liu Junguang, head of the Tea Trade Association of Malaysia.
He further said on average, a Malaysian consumes 900 grams of tea annually, and the national consumption exceeds the national production volume, making it a potential export market for Chinese tea companies.

Cottrell, Hope guide West Indies to crushing T20 win
Sylhet, Monday: Left-arm pacer Sheldon Cottrell delivered a career best 4-28 before Shai Hope struck a half-century as West Indies crushed Bangladesh by eight wickets in their Twenty20 series opener Monday.
West Indies raced to 130-2 in just 10.5 overs after Cottrell and his fellow pacers bowled out Bangladesh for 129 runs in Sylhet.
Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan scored 61 off 43 balls for the home side but could not stave off a thumping defeat.
Hope accelerated the West Indies' run chase with 55 off 23 balls that included six sixes and three fours.
Victory never looked in doubt as he struck spinner Mehidy Hasan for three sixes and a four in just the second over of the innings, yielding 23 runs.
Spinner Mahmudullah Riyad dismissed Hope after medium pacer Mohammad Saifuddin broke a 51-run opening stand with Evin Lewis, who fell for 18.
But Nicholas Pooran and Keemo Paul ensured West Indies cruised to their target, with quickfire innings of 23 and 28 respectively.
Cottrell and fellow pacer Oshane Thomas earlier choked Bangladesh, who opted to bat first, at the start of their innings.
Openers Tamim Iqbal and Liton Das, as well as Soumya Sarkar, all fell for single-figure scores to short-pitch deliveries.
In-form Mushfiqur Rahim was run out for five, leaving Bangladesh on 48-4 before six overs of batting power play had elapsed.
Shakib put on two small partnerships of 25 and 30 respectively with Mahmudullah Riyad and Ariful Haque to lift the side briefly.
"Everything (fell) apart from the toss. Batting failed and then the bowling also obviously went wrong," Shakib said after the match.
"Was a good pitch, should have probably got about 180 on the board."
He hit eight fours and two sixes before being dismissed by Cottrell.
Paul wrapped up Bangladesh's innings with 2-23.
The West Indies are hoping a series win will end their Bangladesh tour on a positive note after losing their Test and one-day international series 2-0 and 2-1 respectively.
"Very good win but it's only one game," skipper Carlos Brathwaite said.
"We have started with a win before and then gone on to lose the series in recent times. So, it's important to be respectful of the opposition."
Bangladesh and West Indies play the remaining two T20 internationals of the series in Dhaka this week. AFP

Celebrating Christmas 2018
Creating harmony and seeking reconciliation
The core message and challenge of Christmas embody a powerful call to foster the goodwill of all and an imperative for efforts at creating harmony and seeking reconciliation of differences. It involves easing tensions, calming anger and contention, resolving conflicts and exercising restraint in all matters, initiating dialogue in patience and establishing mutual understanding between divergent ideological positions, as well as healing the wounds incurred and restoring law and order which guarantee a peaceful society of justice and solidarity.
Despite the valid legal attempts made to tame the constitutional crisis, the recent political upheavals and corresponding social disturbances call all, both those at the helm of government and citizens as well of our dear motherland to give serious thought to re-discovering the lost national cohesion and the international prestige of our country whilst ushering in paths of political stability, economic recovery, national security and ethnic harmony. The country in all its modern history had never been so severely strained under such pain, anxiety, scandal and disruption, the like of which even the civil society had never ever seen before. One is reminded of the sad eras of invasions by our former colonial rulers of this blessed land, known as Tambapanni to King Vijaya, Serendib to the Arabs and Tabrobane to the Greeks.
A very serious question looms large over the horizons as we gaze in wonder at the mighty oceans that surround us, the graceful rivers that flow down and streams that trickle by, glazing mountains of the hill country with their mighty water-falls cascading, adding grace and luster to our landscape: What in the heavens has befallen this Dhamamadeepa of ours after 70 long years of liberation from the clutches of foreign rule, with the country finally coming into our own hands as on a platter
Early challenges
In any growth process there are ups and downs as in evolution there are natural selections and random mutations. As a nation newly freed and able to take our destiny in our own hands, we had a plethora of resources both in terms of human and natural endowments in our country. We were well away in our system of education with the social fabric steady and healthy. Being a repository and sanctuary of four of the worlds greatest and living religions, Sri Lanka had a strong religiously cultural and socially cohesive structure. What was needed was a strong and stable political movement to keep the country well-anchored in her prosperity and growth.
It is unfortunate, that the country and its pawned people became the battleground for party-politics vying for power purely driven by greed even at the present moment of national disaster. The agricultural economy of the early independence era should have been consolidated with our farmers and paddy fields taken to the fore. Agricultural farming could have been modernized with the latest technology as we ventured into the 1950s. The political upheavals were on the prowl already by this time with the capitalistic rightist ideology on one side and the socialistic leftist ideology intruding from the other side. Battles were drawn polarizing the country for a long time along these two major treks, until the open economy appeared in the late 1980s with an executive presidential form of government that enjoyed absolute power on many fronts until it came to an unprecedented crisis about three years ago. There was an outcry either to abolish or at minimum to reduce the excessive powers of the executive presidency.
The burning issues
Our foreign relations went helter-skelter too between being beholden to the capitalistic western nations and socialistic eastern nations as well as some nations of the Middle-East. Once it was the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan which were our great benefactors. Then there was a radical swing towards China and India. The relations with these latter countries proved very difficult, since they were and are still, the biggest powers in Asia. It was difficult for governments to walk the way of the non-aligned path that she had taken at the Bandung Conference in 1955.
At Bandung in Indonesia in April, 1955, representatives from twenty-nine governments of Asian and African nations gathered to discuss peace and the role of the Third World in the Cold War, economic development, and decolonization. The core principles of the Bandung Conference were political: self-determination, mutual respect for sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality. These issues were of central importance to all participants in the conference, most of which had recently emerged from colonial rule. The delegates built upon the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, worked out in negotiations between India and China in 1954, as they sought to build solidarity among recently independent nations.
The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the United Nations members and contain 55% of the world population. These two historical institutions were of immense importance to Sri Lanka vis-a-vis her international relations and integration into the community of worlds nations. Internally, a false extremist trend of nationalism based on hatred towards anything that was foreign and divisive politics that preyed on the ignorance of the rural masses, paved the way to instability oftentimes.
Battle for power
It was unfortunate that within the domain of internal politics, parties and people became polarized into two major blocks of the UNP and the SLFP. In the meanwhile, rural people felt left in the lurch and youth violence began to emerge in early 1970s. They wanted their right to good employment and quality education for the rural youth. Having failed in many ways at their voices being heard, they took to insurrectional violence threatening institutions and political authority. Hundreds of thousands of our youth were killed in this rebellion which raised its head again in the mid-eightees. In both cases, state violence was unleashed to quell the rebellions. It was resorted to sometimes in very cruel, inhuman and crude ways. Mass deaths and mass graves were the inevitable results of this national tragedy.
The culture of violence came to a halt in the 30-year ethnic war that really throttled Sri Lanka in a terrible way, slowing down also its economy. Armaments had to be bought and the military maintained. These thirty years of war and terrorism sank the country in misery as never before and is greatly to be blamed on an unjust and bloated false nationalism as well as a plethora of social injustices that ensued there-from. Everyone began to realize that politics and government based on religion, race, language and ethnicity would end up in inevitable disaster. Also the fact, that no political party at elections mustered an absolute majority, prevented the formation of a strong legislature.
The way forward
Weak coalition governments became the order of the day until recently the two major parties decided to work together as a national government having agreed on a common agenda for developing the country. It is at this point that a crisis came over due to policy and ideology clashes within the ranks of the government and aggravated by a radical decision from the Executive giving rise to an unprecedented political imbroglio. This crisis will not be solved easily unless there is conversion of heart and goodwill for collaboration once again with the interest of the common good of country at heart on the part of politicians and political parties.
The people at large also need education on this important issue for the country to move forward. They should not allow themselves to be bullied into fanciful party manifestos which tend to hypnotize them into false dreams. Mistakes must be humbly accepted and all errors corrected forthwith. Having learned enough and more from this national tragedy, politicians, civil society and people in general (the hoi polloi) must stand together in bringing the nation out of its current chaos and impasse, shock and confusion. There has been an avalanche of errors and bad discernment spilling up all fronts in the rank and file of political authority: the executive, the parliament and political leadership. It is unjust to carry the masses as well into this mess who would still be blissfully ignorant of the depth of misery this constitutional crisis involves. The professionals and the intelligentsia of the nation must intervene to help translate this crisis into a moment of opportunity for insight, enlightenment and growth.
Christmas is no mere cultural pageant or social celebration but an essentially spiritual festival based on a Christian religious truth, celebrated across the globe commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, one of the most influential personages to walk this earth. He is hailed as the one and only historical Incarnation of God. From his Galilean village in modern Israel, he revealed religion to be a source of social transformation, bringing the values of forgiveness and compassion, justice and love into public life and not limiting it to ritual, rites and worship, domesticating it in temples, churches and mosques. We gather in these places of worship in order to go out and be propelled to live the values we believe in. This is where religion enters politics since kings must rule in justice and in goodness, safeguarding human dignity and common good. Crucial issues confront us at this Christmas: political stability, economic prosperity, national security, ethnic harmony, transitional justice following the ravages of war and caring for the poor. These are the building-blocks of peace at this time. When governance becomes unethical and immoral, religion can challenge such erratic social behaviour of public authority, since it is the breaching of public trust.
These days of Christmas, the festival of peace, should see us exorcized of prejudices and errors that blind us to truth, leading all in this beloved motherland into an era of righteous living and social reconstruction. The path to that goal consists invariably in venturing on a relentless and sustained effort at achieving national harmony and seeking reconciliation. This could well be the most gracious gift that citizens can give one another at this Christmas.

## Title: Economic cost from strikes, street protest on the rise
## Supertitle:

Economic cost from strikes, street protest on the rise
The Economic cost of strikes and street protests are on the increase, and most of these are politically motivated. Strikes, are the legitimate right of employees, in any democratic country. The eight million employees in Sri Lanka account for about 38 percent of the total population. This means that for every two persons employed, they have to maintain five unemployed people (keeping in line with our dependency syndrome).
With a negative Trade Balance and Balance of Payments (BOP), increased exchange rates, growing unemployment, increasing inflation, almost double the value of exports to imports, and total borrowings exceeding 90 percent of the GDP, the frustration of the employed is understandable.
Ironically, the plight of employers too has to be understood - having to secure their market share in the international marketplace amidst fierce competition under these weak economic indicators. Accordingly, a need is emerging for the trade unions to be organisational centric leaving behind political interests.
Killing the goose that lays the golden egg to become rich quick, is futile. This is not the time to fight for conditions of employment but to secure employers until the economy recovers, in short, an improved system is required to keep politics and economics separate from each other with clearly demarcated boundaries.
The state and the trade unions have to work together to strengthen the employer with the national economy as a top priority. A provision declaring that the union shall not have any political objects or political fund within the meaning of section 47 of the ordinance may be introduced to the amended Trade Union Act of Sri Lanka that may be applicable to all TUs including both private and the State sectors.
A well-developed wage policy is one of the effective solutions we propose, to address the gap that is anticipated. This intervention is merely to be proactive and addresses a pressing need as well. The four institutions, to which this appeal is made, may in turn assist the TUs to understand their roles and also assist them with acquiring new competencies and technology to uphold professionalism.
The sudden emergence of a wave of protests and strikes that has continued for the past three years, (not only by employees but also by University students as well), paint an extremely poor image of the business climate, in the eyes of foreign investors who are interested in setting up their businesses in Sri Lanka (for whatever strategic reasons).
Continuous Business processes
When continuous business processes are disrupted frequently due to conflicts, the economy start spiraling downwards. Then it becomes a vicious cycle, whereby attracting and retaining better talent becomes an impossible task.
Instead of attracting and retaining, such an unfriendly climate encourages migration of talent, thus leaving the duds to steer the country. The current economic deteriorating of the country demands intelligent and strategic interventions through knowledgeable and competent individuals.
To attract and retain such individuals, the Per Capita Income (PCI) levels of employees have to improve greatly. It is a happy and contended workforce, which will take either a country or an organisation to the next level.
All must understand this emerging need and work towards a unanimously agreed growth goal on a well-designed game plan. We have no time to waste with two giant economies on either side of us, growing.
If we assume that the man days lost due to strikes is an outcome of accumulated and unresolved grievances of employees, then, the increased number of man days lost, year after year, due to strikes (as shown in Table 1) indicates that there are unresolved employee grievances in the Private Sector as a whole and in the Plantation Sector in particular.
Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the changes in global per capita income and contribution to GDP by sector, and the relationships in changes in per capita income in selected countries in the Asian Region, for understanding the dynamics in per capita income and sectoral contribution to GDP.
Many global level research studies have concluded that wages do matter in better quality job outcomes such as, higher labour productivity, employee motivation, attraction of better talent, lowering absenteeism and turnover, work stoppages, poor levels of job engagement, reducing hiring cost of new employees and security related issues.
The World Bank Development Report (2015), citing numerous Field Studies, recognises that poverty taxes peoples mental capacities and self-control, which demotivates high performers. In Sri Lanka, the plantations sector accounts for the highest number of man days lost due to strikes during the period 2003-2016, within the entire Private Sector of the country.
Accordingly, it is an economically credible and worthy hypothesis to assume that there is a direct co-relationship between the wages and outcomes of grievances, which in turn affect the Economy.
Minimum wages
The minimum wage is around Rs. 13,500 per month in Sri Lanka which works out to be Rs.540 per day. Minimum wages have been defined as the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreements or an individual contract.
The collective bargaining process has been used always to increase the minimum wages by many times to enter an upper wage zone known as collective bargaining zone. (General wage fixing convention, 1970). Nineteen wage boards have revised the minimum wages applicable but almost all the minimum wages are around Rs.13,500 per month.
There is a vast disparity between theory and practice. Dont forget the same in minimum wage/living wage aspects as well. According to Professor of Economics, M. Sinnathamby of the University of Peradeniya, (in 2018), the livable wage of a tea plantation worker is Rs. 1,108 per day provided the employee is allowed to work at least 25 days per month.
The manual grade employees spend most of their earnings on carbohydrates to generate energy, whereas most of the monthly salary earners spend most of their earnings to build a house and for the betterment of their children.
Its our opinion that the minimum wage of Sri Lanka is not used to develop a happy employee but to attract FDIs (by letting them exploit our labour) and as a mechanism to create jobs for names sake.
For example, the plantations industry (not the smallholder sector) had approximately 300,000 employees in 1993 and the number has greatly reduced to approximately 160,000 employees by 2017. This has created a huge shortage of labour within the industry managed by the Private Sector.
This affects profitability, and export revenue in US dollar terms.
The livable wage which denotes, a wage that fulfills families basic needs including a moderate diet, decent housing and education, sufficient health care, desirable social and cultural life (on par with the national standards and current levels of Socio-Economic development in the country), appears to be a more useful and relevant wage index to consider.
The percentage difference between the livable wage and minimum wage in UK is 13% and in the USA it is around 84% but for different reasons. Ours is an issue of survival. Thats why we are asking for a wage policy instead of looking at the two indicators.
A wage policy
A wage policy can be defined as a government policy setting wages and wage increases for workers. We are facing many social issues such as mothers leaving their families for jobs as housemaids, and increased crime etc. These are due to wage related anomalies.
There are three main principles that govern wage and salary fixation - External Equity, Internal Equity, and Individual Worth. External Equity principle ensures that jobs are fairly compensated in comparison with similar jobs in the labour market. A Manager in company A can be compared with a Manager in company B doing similar jobs and holding similar responsibilities with the same qualifications, when setting wage levels.
If we consider the job of teaching as an example, then the Internal Equity refers to establishing of wage levels of the teachers (Professor, Proof Reader, and Lecturer) that are different as per the perceived or real differences between the values of jobs they perform. Once the wage category is established then it has to be subdivided to arrive at a reasonable point of remuneration depending on the pay grade Individual Worth refers to pay for performance.
Thus, the compensation system, as far as possible, enables the individual to be rewarded according to his contribution to the organisation. However, it is doubtful if the three policies have been correctly used to determine a livable wage, in Sri Lanka. The main objective of wage and salary administration is to establish and maintain an equitable wage and compensation system. This is so because only a properly developed compensation system creates an enabling work environment. Such a positive vibe is essential to execute the strategies of the organisation effectively.
So much so that the role of the government is to set a National Wage Policy framework to create an enabling and conducive work environment, and take the country to the next level rather than selling the manpower of the country by promoting the cheap labour of Sri Lanka.
It is absolutely essential to infuse the latest technology, skilled labour and export value added products, if we hope to improve the GVA of the agriculture sector.
All these shortcomings can be addressed through formulating a rational and competitive wage policy based on labour demand and supply and productivity levels that wont change with the changing political ideologies.
The idea of getting back to the former Permanent Secretary system and developing a national Wage Policy, emerge as a top priority to make the country an advanced economy. Sri Lanka has an abundance of high value resources compared to a country such as Japan that has frequent natural disasters and limited resources. Yet, the PCI in Japan was more than US $38,000 in 2017.
This means that the benefits of planned economic development should be distributed among the different sections of society. Such a foundation is needed to develop the minimum wage of any industry. The National Human Resources and Employment Policy for Sri Lanka can be made use of to develop the National Wage Policy.

Edible gold pizza
Pizza has long been regarded as the food of the people; Its cheap, easy to make and tastes amazing. But that doesnt apply to all pizzas. For example, a restaurant in New York City serves a pizza that only the 1 percent can afford. Its priced at $2,000 and comes covered in strips of edible 24K gold.
The Industry Kitchen restaurant in New Yorks South Street Seaport was inspired by the nearby Financial District, which attracts the wealthy from all over the world, to create the epitome of decadence pizza. Its officially called the fanceza, but epitome of decadence sounds much more appropriate. This outrageously expensive treat consists of a black pie made with squid ink, Stilton cheese imported from England, Foie Gras and truffles from France, Ossetra caviar harvested from the Caspian Sea, edible flowers, and lost of edible 24K gold strips and flakes from Ecuador.
The pizza is extremely richif youre in the mood for a lavish meal, this is the pizza for you, Executive Chef Braulio Bunay says. Its also one of the most expensive foods money can buy, but apparently preparing it in the form of a pizza makes it more approachable.
The people get in shock because they never see in one dish all these special ingredients Braulio told Insider. Its very expensive and its delicious At $2,000 a pie  thats $250 a slice and around $50 a bite  it damn well better be delicious.
If you can actually afford to spend this much dough (pun intended) on a pizza, you should know that Industry Kitchen requires patrons to order it 48 hours in advance.

The European Union in a joint statement yesterday welcomed the peaceful and democratic resolution of the political crisis in Sri Lanka accordance with the constitution.
In a brief statement, the EU further said, As steady friends of Sri Lanka, we welcome the peaceful and democratic resolution of the political crisis in accordance with the constitution. We commend the resilience of Sri Lankas democratic institutions and will continue to support its efforts towards national reconciliation and prosperity for all.
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Alaina B. Teplitz in a similar note said, The US welcomes the last weekends political developments, which upheld Sri Lankas democratic and constitutional norms.
Ambassador Teplitz in a message posted on her official Tweeter added, SriLanka is a valued partner in the Indo Pacific and we look forward to continuing to develop our relationship with the government and people of this country.
Australias High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson also issued a statement to welcome resolution of the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka by constitutional means.
As a longstanding friend and Indian Ocean neighbour, Australia welcomes resolution of the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka by Constitutional means and the demonstrated resilience of Sri Lankas democratic institutions. We look forward to working with the Sri Lankan Government to take forward its commitments to deliver peace, reconciliation and prosperity, and to build a stronger bilateral relationship, he said.
Following the October 26 coup, the Ambassadors of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Romania, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, as well as the Ambassadors of Norway and Switzerland expressed their concern on the situation in Sri Lanka and called on President Maithripala Sirisena to summon Parliament immediately.
The US Embassy on November 10 issuing a strongly-worded statement said President Sirisenas decision to dissolve Parliament posed a vital threat to Sri Lankas democratic institutions.
There is much at stake and such actions jeopardize Sri Lankas economic progress and international reputation. We call on the President to respect this countrys democratic tradition and the rule of law, and to fulfill the commitments to good governance and democracy upon which he and his Government were elected, the statement added.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne issuing a statement on November 10 expressed Australias concern and disappointment with President Sirisenas decision to dissolve Parliament on November 9. As a longstanding friend, we believe this action undermines Sri Lankas long democratic tradition and poses a risk to its stability and prosperity. We urge respect for the countrys democratic institutions and for all parties to continue to exercise restraint she said.

Former Sri Lankan immigrant had made Indias most expensive movie
The man who bankrolled the science-fiction film 2.0, Indias costliest movie, is a former immigrant from Sri Lanka who is now running his familys telecom, healthcare, financial services, media and entertainment conglomerate in the U.K.
Meet Allirjah Subaskaran, 46, who fled Sri Lanka with his family at the height of the ethnic conflict there three decades ago, and moved first to France, and then later settled in the U.K. He said that he loved watching Tamil films while growing up, and thats why he started Lyca Productions, a production and distribution company based in Chennai, in 2014.
Its part of the privately held Lyca Group, which was named after his sister Leka, with headquarters on the banks of the river Thames in one of Londons financial districts. A 2017 financial presentation by the group claimed that its revenues were more than $2.2 billion in 2016.
The groups flagship brand is Lycamobile started in 2006 in the Netherlands. From there, the group expanded to Belgium, Denmark, Norway and other European countries. Lycamobile says its currently serving 15 million customers across 23 countries. And its hoping to reach 50 million customers by 2020 through an expansion to more markets in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.
The conglomerate employs more than 8,000 people and has interests in media and entertainment encompassing Athavan TV, news and radio in its portfolio. Athavan is popular with the Tamil diaspora across the world. The groups Lyca Radio has four radio stations, including two for the south Asian community in the U.K.
Lyca also runs three restaurants across London: Bella Cosa, an Italian restaurant; Manjal, offering North Indian, South Indian and Sri Lankan cuisine and Loughton Grill House serving British and American cuisines. Its travel arm, LycaFly, offers flight and hotel packages through partnerships with more than 200 airlines and 400,000 hotels. The groups healthcare outfit LycaHealth chaired by his wife Prema, runs three health centers across London and Chennai.
Back at Lyca Productions, the companys debut project in 2014 featured Tamil star Vijay in Kaththi followed by Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, starring fellow Tamil star Vijay Sethupathi.
In 2015, Subaskaran launched his most ambitious project yet  a science-fiction movie that features Rajinikanth, who was number 14 on the recently released Forbes Indias Celebrity 100 list. It was a sequel to the 2010 movie Robot. Lyca had even approached Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger to be part of the film, but he reportedly declined. Made at a cost of $79 million, 2.0 is already off to a strong start at the box office, raking in $86 million in ticket sales in the first 12 days of its release. It also features Bollywood star Askhay Kumar and the music was composed by Oscar-award winning director A.R. Rahman.
Subaskaran started early in business, working first at his familys restaurant in Paris, and then later at their corner shop. Thats when he realized that the most sought-after item for immigrants was calling cards that allowed them to stay in touch with family and friends back home.
Subaskarans family started distributing calling cards, and then expanded into producing the cards. He moved to the U.K. in 1999, and founded Lycatel and then Lycamobile in 2006. His idea was to build a brand associated with international calling.
His business is primarily built around low-cost products targeted at immigrant communities. Even his philanthropy deals with marginalized and displaced populations. Through the Gnanam Foundation that he set up with his mother Gnanambikai and his wife Prema, he supports communities displaced by strife or climate change.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) expects the new Government to look into their grievances and outstanding issues. The expectations of the GMOA will be discussed with President Maithripala Sirisena in the near future, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said the GMOA expects the Government to act on the Singapore Free Trade Agreement after formulating a National FTA Policy and considering the recommendations of the Presidential Commission appointed by the President. The policy should be formulated with state sponsorship.
According to Dr.Aluthge, the state tax policy which made professionals and the entire public suffer should be changed with immediate effect.
The proposed new Prevention of Terrorism Act which is aimed at suppressing trade unions should be withdrawn immediately. All incentives given to professionals before 2015 in order to keep them in the country should be granted to them again. Those incentives were cut down after 2015, Dr.Aluthge said.
Dr. Aluthge pointed out that the National Wages Policy should be protected and it should be strictly followed. The recommendations made by the Presidential Committee appointed for a period of two months should be considered. The Gazette notification on closing down SAITM should be issued with immediate effect.
The Sri Lanka Medical Council should be broughtback to its original status and it should be protected from all forms of interference. There are some other proposals, he added.

This is the first time that such a petition signed against a Health Minister.
According to Dr.Aluthge, the facts for not appointing Dr.Senaratne had been submitted in details. In addition, the GMOA informed the President that as a former Health Minister with a good understanding about the subject, he can keep the Health Ministry with him without appointing a Health Minister.
"The health sector in Sri Lanka will make a progress if President Sirisena keeps the Health Minister portfolio under his purview. An emergency meeting of the GMOA's Executive Committee will be called as soon as possible to discuss future actions in connection with the issue," he added.

Grande unveils Imagine
Ariana Grande has unveiled her new song, Imagine. Its the second upcoming LP single she has recently dropped, alongside the title track from her forthcoming fifth studio album that she has said will be called Thank U, Next. Leading up to the new tune, the singer revealed to a fan via Twitter that the new set will have 13 songs. The record follows the release of 2018s Sweetener.
On the romantic ballad Imagine, Grande dreamily envisions a world with a lover with whom she can find passion and peace with in the aftermath, where she can sleep on your chest. Drip, drip, dripped in gold/ Quick, quick, quick, lets go, she sings over a chilled-out, sultry melody. Kiss me and take off your clothes/ Imagine a world like that.
As she did with Thank U, Next and now with Imagine, Grande is making good on her desire to share new material on her own random release schedule. My dream has always been to be  obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men arent, Grande recently said. We have to do the teaser before the single, then do the single, and wait to do the preorder, and radio has to impact before the video, and we have to do the discount on this day, and all this shit. Its just like, Bruh, I just want to fucking talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do. Why do they get to make records like that and I dont So I do and I did and I am, and I will continue to.
In addition to dropping her late-night new single, she also teamed up with her brother, Frankie, for a soaring cover of Rents Seasons of Love earlier on Thursday. In the accompanying video, the siblings are seen in a studio alongside friends who join them to croon the moving Broadway tune. For the siblings rendition, Ariana Grande served as the vocal producer per her brothers YouTube post. In Frankies post, he also touted Foxs live version of Rent, which will air on January 27th and features Vanessa Hudgens, Tinashe, Jordan Fisher and Kiersey Clemons, among others. Rolling Stone

I took decisions on behalf of motherland - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the statement he made that he would not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if all 225 Members of Parliament should present a signed request was his political opinion. I still stand by that statement, but as a leader who respects Parliamentary traditions and democracy, I offered him that post, he said.
The President was speaking to United National Front Parliamentarians after Ranil Wickremesinghe took oaths before him as the Prime Minister, at the Presidential Secretariat, on Sunday.
Reminding the Parliamentarians that according to the Constitution, neither did Parliament or the Judiciary have the power to name a Prime Minister, the President said since a majority of Parliamentarians had expressed the view that Ranil Wickremesinghe should be given the Premiership after casting 117 votes in his favour, he agreed with that view because he was a virtuous leader who respected Parliamentary tradition.
The President said he took steps to dissolve Parliament, prorogue Parliament, and appoint a new Prime Minister, not at his whims, but after consulting legal experts. Those decisions were taken with good intentions putting the countrys interest first.
He said he had not the slightest intention of breaching the Constitution.
The President said he believed the best solution to the unrest was holding a general election, the reason being that more than the opinion of 122 Members of Parliament, the opinion of 15.5 million voters was decisive, for it will demonstrate the sovereignty of the people, acceptable to the world. I issued the gazette notification to hand over power to the nation.
Although the setting up of an Independent Commissions was a good aspect of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the other aspect was a political controversy.
The President criticised the government for the way it acted for three-and-a-half years, indefinitely postponing the enactment of the Bribery Commission Act which aimed to penalise the accused in the Central Bank bond issue and to recover the money lost by it.
He said failing to apportion ministries on a scientific basis as stated in the election manifesto, failing to implement the recommendation of the Presidential Commission which investigated the Central Bank bond issue, losing the confidence of the Bhikkhu Society, and the imprisonment of war heroes were the other issues of concern that he had objected to.
These factors influenced my recent decisions, he explained.
Whatever people say, I took my decisions in the interests of the public.
Referring to the threats made by certain people to impeach him in Parliament, the President said even if he was sent to prison, the decisions taken by him putting the country before self would be written in the countrys history books as such, like an inscription on a rock. If no one writes it, I will write it, he said.
Referring to the threats about dragging and killing him like Gaddafi, the President said threats of that nature had never been made against any of the countrys previous leaders. This was because people knew the fate that would have followed them if they vocalised such threats under those rulers.
President Sirisena said he was fated to confront such threats because such was the freedom and democracy that has seen the light of day under his office.
I intend to continue administrative function of the government without any clashes because clashes would retard the countrys development, the President said.
President Sirisena said a political movement that is against fraud and corruption is needed in the country to rebuild its economy.
The yahapalana political concept which was breached could be resuscitated only through a political movement that is patriotic and that promotes our cultural and social values, the President said.

Institutionalising Angampora
The Sri Lanka Army by establishing the countrys first-ever Angampora Experiment Institute and Training Centre (AEITC) at the Panagoda Army Cantonment with state patronage added a new chapter to the field of Army sports on December 4, during an induction (Kala Elimangalya) of the Army Angampora group before a gathering headed by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake makes a presentation at the event
Angampora a martial art that dates back to the times of royalty, has been locally used as a particular self-defence technique, endowed with different characteristics such as astrology, meditation, medical methods, sorcery, and illusory tricks.
It was practised exclusively to resist foreign invaders who, during colonial rule, prohibited this practice in the country since they feared its operational aspect.
The establishment of this special wing was a result of a proposal made by Army Angampora Committee Chairman and Director General General Staff (DGGS) Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana, after the former Army Commander General Crishanthe De Silva (Rtd) introduced the concept of reviving this age-old technique of self-defence in the Army in January 2017.
A total of 130 Army soldiers under the capable tutelage of recognised Angampora instructors whose forebears relate its origins to the times of ancient kings, received training for more than 18 months before they become qualified to graduate.
Those veteran instructors, Ravi Wanakulaarachchi, Anthony Don Wijesinghe and Kala Vibhushana Kala Keerthi Devinda Laksiri Ranasinghe performed a dedicated service to train the 130 Army Angampora players with enthusiasm and commitment.
Lieutenant General Senanayake unveiled a plaque and formally inaugurated the state-of-the-art Angampora practising hall (Maduwa) and witnessed their prowess and skills in this ancient martial art.
The Defence Ministry, Sports Ministry and government officials, having evaluated the significance of the project, have extended their fullest cooperation for the establishment of this training institute as a permanent wing with the objective of popularising this martial art among youth, since the Army has now taken the initiative in this regard.
Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando and Major General Ranawana received the Army Commander on arrival. The instructors contribution to the training was appreciated by the Commander with a presentation of mementos.
The Commanders brief address on the occasion praised all those who worked hard to revive this ancient martial art.
Director General Sports Major General Anura Sudasingha who also took much interest in the project was also present, together with several senior officers including the Army Secretary, Angampora Committee, Lieutenant Colonel J. K. R. P. Jayasinghe.

International Migrants Day today
Today is theInternational Migrants Day. In a country where female migrant workers greatly impact its social fabric, International Migrants Day presents an opportunity to reflect on how Sri Lanka can strengthen its mechanisms to assist safe migration, the ILO said in a statement.
The ILO report highlights the glaring absence of follow-up visits to the families of female migrant workers to ensure that children receive adequate care after the registered departure of the mother. Instead, FEDOs are policing the FBR regulation, by investigating the information provided by the woman applicant, violating her right to privacy, and making subjective value judgments on the families and the care arrangements of the children who are left behind.
Sri Lankas Family Background Report (FBR) was implemented in June 2013 by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and initially applicable to mothers with young children seeking employment abroad. A recent study undertaken by the Centre for Poverty Analysis for the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Sri Lanka examines the effects of the FBR. The study asserts that the FBR may be pushing many into undocumented and unsafe migration, exposing them to greater risk of abuse, the ILO statement said.
While there is a sharp drop in the number of documented women migrant workers, village-level reports indicate that an increasing number of women evade the FBR by migrating for work through informal channels.
Invisible and unprotected
Workers who are not registered with the SLBFE fall outside the protection of that institution and are susceptible to forced labour, trafficking, as well as unsafe and exploitative living and working conditions. They are left vulnerable and become invisible with little or no means of protection before, during and after their departure from Sri Lanka.
Recruitment brokers often facilitate this process. These sub-agents offer other avenues of migration which side-step the heavy documentation and delays in processing applications in the FBR regulation.
Welfare of migrant workers and their families
The research also reveals the costs of administration of the FBR regulation. Public officers are overburdened with implementing the FBR regulation. The Foreign Employment Development Officers (FEDOs), in particular, sideline their other important responsibilities on the welfare of migrant workers and their families to carry out FBR-related activities. Senior officials at national level are required to sit at weekly time-consuming FBR Appeals Committee meetings, the ILO statement said.
The report highlights the glaring absence of follow-up visits to the families of female migrant workers to ensure that children receive adequate care after the registered departure of the mother.
Instead, FEDOs are policing the FBR regulation, by investigating the information provided by the woman applicant, violating her right to privacy, and making subjective value judgments on the families and the care arrangements of the children who are left behind.
The FBR also undermines the role that the father can play in childrens upbringing. By focusing on women, and especially lower-skilled women, the gender and class biases of the FBR are transparent: male migrant workers and workers at professional and higher skill levels are outside this monitoring mechanism.
Revising the FBR
The CEPA study for the ILO identifies alternatives to the FBR such as a self-reporting tool and Family Care Plan for all migrant workers at all skill levels. It also recommends a data collection and documentation system through recruitment agencies (or other state entities) to free up the time and resources of FEDOs to facilitate safe migration and support activities for migrant workers and their family members.
Stricter guidelines on recruitment agents (with loss of license for non-compliance) would ensure more reliable information and respect for safe and legal labour migration.
Client-oriented pre-migration decision-making, advisory and counselling sessions for women and men considering migrating for employment would be helpful in ensuring that informed decisions are made, and in consultation with family members where appropriate.

To kill a mocking zombie
The three judges of the Fairway National Literary Award given to the best English work of fiction has come to a unanimous decision: 2018 has produced no ultimate winner in the Sri Lankan English fiction category.
Whether they were motivated into such course of action by the decision of the Swedish Academy to postpone the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature, we are left with the benefit of the doubt. The Fairway judicial panel, however, leaves us with four short-listed works to be satisfied with: Raos Guide to Lime Pickling by Sandali Handagama, The Chameleon by Seheni Hisara Kariyawasan, Stories by Charulatha Abeysekara Thewarathanthri and Zeelam by Navin Weeraratne.
Right now Sri Lanka is on the brink of some unavoidable predicament. The scientists, opinion leaders and top advisors to the countrys political politburo have come to a conclusion: it is a mosquito-borne, zombie apocalypse.
An army zombie hunter and an NGO infection inspector struggle against the increasing, daily outbreaks in Colombo. They discover that the Zees have a secret: one they could use to overwhelm the entire city.
Yet before they can fight the zombies, they must first overcome a panicked social media blackout; the ugliness of unchecked Sinhala-Muslim violence; and the corruption and stupidity of their own government.
By gun and blade they must somehow save their city  but first, they must save themselves.
Shamed and horrified by this phenomenon, Navin Weeraratne amp up his imagination to invent Sri Lankas own version of zombie apocalypse story. He believes in Sri Lankan and Diaspora readers who will appreciate the local flavour - and also the quite local problems. International fans of the genre may find these touches perplexing but will find the mosquito-driven spread of the disease of interest, as written from the perspective of a native of a country actively fighting a mosquito-borne, dengue epidemic, our zombie-zoomed author supposes.
In Zeelam, a Dengue-like virus makes the jump from monkeys to humans and then starts presenting unusual, aggressive symptoms. Mis-diagnosed and undetected over the distraction of three decades of civil war, it evolves into a fully-fledged, zombie virus.
Zeelam looks at a different Sri Lanka, one under siege from constant attacks, and where a mosquitos bite is seen as potentially fatal  for the victim, and those around them. The army has developed specialist first response units called Kill Teams, especially armed and equipped to take on the Zees, Weeraratne reveals the plot of his short-listed work.
The larger burden though is carried by society. NGOs inspect homes for mosquito breeding places, check for infected people and hiding Zees, and must fight without firearms. Bus conductors and shopkeepers all carry Mortein, and people dress to cover as much skin as they can.
As in all Zombie stories, the greatest danger is not from the disease, but from other people. In Zeelam it is a government so stupid and corrupt, it places the survival of the very nation in danger. The GMOA, as usual, goes on strike. Officials cover up each others crimes. Red tape - and even social media bans - hold up life-saving news. It is against this additional challenge, the characters must fight to somehow save their country, Weeraratne elaborates.
Zeelam follows three main characters. Ruven Daniels is a Tamil soldier in an SL Army Kill Team. As a first responder, he quickly notices an increasing sophistication in the Zee attacks. Daniels must balance the reality on the ground, with the governments flawed approach to not just the disease, but the very business of government. He is also younger; he did not serve against the LTTE but must deal with some of the baggage that the war had created. Baggage which, even today, no one really wants to talk about.
Dinuka Fernando is a Sinhalese, NGO Zee Hunter. Her privately-funded group studies the virus, and shares data with groups at home and abroad -- but also knocks on peoples doors, checking for mosquito breeding  and Zee infection. Part of a mostly-female group, they work with and support other women in the field but must also deal with sexists who dont take them seriously, in our show bobz city.
Siripala Fonseka is a government inspector who has a closer relationship with the virus than he cares for. He tries to balance his duty against his illness, and how to live with what hes done.
Domestic violence, the culture of silence that protects it and Buddhist-Muslim tension are also some deal-with-it issues brought up in Zeelam. Weeraratne also reminds that the Chinese are now next door and that whats good for Chinas String of Pearls is not necessarily whats good for the Sri Lankans.
What is ailing Sri Lankan English literature with a judicial panel decision on some epic failure to reach the best status For Weeraratne, the reason rests in the Sri Lankan authorial obsession to narrate the grim reality.
We read books to escape reality. We do not want to read the same old tales of war and poverty over and over again. It is all right to tackle those issues but in an entertaining way. You must have an entertaining story to deal with these issues in a subtle manner, Weeraratne elaborates.
On the other extreme is purple prose, a literary genre now on the decline in the global literary sphere.
The prose is so flowery but lacking a storyline. In between black and white, purple is yet another unwelcome feature in Sri Lankan English literature, as Navin Weeraratne views.

Chapter I - An excerpt
Lets go! Outbreak at the Hilton, a three-year-olds birthday party.
Men in long-sleeved camouflage ran out of the building, assault rifles slapping against the backs. In front of the buildings Financial Crimes Investigation Department sign, they pulled on visored assault helmets and mounted motorbikes. Two Sri Lankan Army Defender jeeps pulled up, SL ARMY  EPIDEMIOLOGY UNIT stenciled on their doors. Other men came running out and boarded them. One handed his flamethrower tanks to grasping hands, which pulled him in next.
The Hilton asked Jehan the driver, in the lead Defender. During office traffic Bloody bad scene.
Lieutenant Ruven Daniels climbed into the passenger seat turned and looked back. Motorbikes, get on the pavements and go down York Street. Defenders will take Janadhipathi Mawatha.
The bikers nodded, and roared off, two to a vehicle. The Defenders pulled away, and started their sirens and red and blue emergency lights. The security guard outside the Steuart watched as they turned onto Hospital Lane. The early-drinking office crowd look stunned and stood in the way, before fleeing at the last moment. They hit Chatham Street and passed Namals Shelby Mustang.
The pollution-pink sunset was moving out to sea. Cars were stuffed into the road like Marie biscuits in a pack. Jehan harassed them with the horn, but the other cars moved aside too slowly.
Fuck this, Daniels opened his door and climbed down. Everybody out! We go on foot.
The soldiers jumped out and ran past the World Trade Centre. Chinese tourists outside the Dutch hospital stopped and took pictures of them (a local did too, but was told not to by the security guard). They hit York Street, which was already full of people rushing to get away, or coming to see the show. Rubbernecking drivers clogged the road.
Outside the Hiltons entrance, they saw the bikers dismounted by a police barricade. Policeman lined it, T-56 assault rifles aimed at the people running out. Two of the bikers were arguing with a fat officer with a Saddam Hussein mustache and a matching frown.
Whats going on here Asked Daniels. He was standing beside the board with the days events; 5 to 8pm was Baby Santush Birthday Party.
These are your men The fat officer made a face like a disgusted aunties. They are abusing me and making unnecessary statements!
Yes, said a biker, youre a bunch of motherfuckers.
Hold on, Daniels raised his hand, are you the OIC
Yes, Saddam Hussein gave the biker a dirty look.
Why arent your men inside You know the rule about outbreak first responders. There are people in there.
Saddams eyes bugged out. That is not our responsibility! This is your job, here, you Army fellows cant get late and then put this on us! Thats a fine thing no men!
Alright, the Lieutenant turned to face his men. Were going in on our own.

Latham unbeaten on 264 as Sri Lanka crumble again
WELLINGTON Monday: New Zealand opener Tom Latham flayed Sri Lanka's bowlers with an unbeaten 264 Monday before the tourists' top order failed again to leave them on the verge of a heavy defeat in the first Test in Wellington.
Latham walked off to a standing ovation at the Basin Reserve after carrying his bat and helping New Zealand to 578, a commanding first-innings lead of 296.
Seamers Tim Southee and Trent Boult then combined to remove Sri Lanka's top order, reducing them to 20 for three at stumps on day three.
Boult dismissed Danushka Gunathilaka on three, while Southee snared Dimuth Karunaratne for 10 and Dhananjaya de Silva for a duck, taking his tally for the match to eight.
The pair, along with short-ball specialist Neil Wagner, will be relishing the prospect of having two full days to attack Sri Lanka's misfiring batting line-up.
But the day belonged to Latham, who added steadily to his overnight total of 121, offering no chances to the frustrated Sri Lankans. It was the sixth best Test score by a New Zealander and the highest this year by a batsman from any nation.
His innings, which lasted more than 11 hours, also continued a horror run at the Basin Reserve for Sri Lanka, where they have now conceded double centuries to four New Zealanders.
New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson helped the Black Caps reach their imposing total with a sparkling 91, while Ross Taylor and Henry Nicholls both reached 50.
Lahiru Kumara was the pick of a Sri Lanka attack that struggled on a flat wicket, taking four for 127.
Taylor was dismissed for 50 in the first over of the day after failing to add to his overnight score, thanks to a sharp catch from Dimuth Karunaratne.
The ball was forcefully struck and initially bounced off Karunaratne's hand at silly mid-off before he recovered to grab it as he tumbled to the ground.
Henry Nicholls also went for 50 after lunch trying to take on spinner Dilruwan Perera.
BJ Watling followed without scoring when he tucked his bat awkwardly under his arm as he ducked a Kumara bouncer and the ball clipped it on the way through. Colin de Grandhomme scored three sixes during an aggressive innings but fell on 49 attempting to bludgeon a fourth.
Sri Lanka, ranked sixth in the world, have lost their last five Tests against New Zealand and suffered a 3-0 home Test series whitewash against England last month. They have faced upheaval in their coaching and selection ranks in recent weeks and arrived in New Zealand low on confidence. In contrast, the fourth-ranked Black Caps entered the two-match contest buoyed by their first away Test series win over Pakistan in 49 years. The New Zealanders are looking for a fourth straight Test series win after also defeating England and the West Indies in the past 12 months.

Arsenals unbeaten run ends
Liverpool back on top as Shaqiri sinks United
London, Sunday: Liverpool powered back to the top of the Premier League as Xherdan Shaqiri inspired a 3-1 win over bitter rivals Manchester United, while Arsenals 22-match unbeaten run was shattered by a shock defeat at Southampton on Sunday.
Jurgen Klopps side made it six successive league victories thanks to Shaqiris late double after Uniteds Jesse Lingard had cancelled out Sadio Manes opener at Anfield.
Shaqiris superb substitute cameo allowed Liverpool to reopen a one-point lead over second-placed Manchester City after the champions had knocked the Reds off the summit with their win against Everton on Saturday.
Liverpools first win in their last six meetings with United ended a frustrating streak against the Old Trafford outfit that dated back to March 2016, while also extending their unbeaten start to the league season to 17 matches.
While that was cause for pre-Christmas revelry on the Kop, more significantly, Liverpools refusal to be subdued by a United team set up by Jose Mourinho with five defenders was another statement of intent as they chase a first English league title since 1990.
The way the boys played and fought was outstanding. We saw the line up of United, how organised they were and they fight from the back. Im over the moon about the performance, Klopp said.
The timing of Shaqiris introduction was not too bad. We need somebody to score the goals.
Of Liverpools title bid, Klopp added: We know we are a good team. We had to prove it and keep on proving it.
Senegal winger Mane put Liverpool ahead in the 24th minute when he broke away from Ashley Young to meet Fabinhos sublime pass with a nimble piece of chest control before shooting past David De Gea.
United equalised against the run of play in the 33rd minute as Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made a hash of catching Romelu Lukakus low cross and Lingard finished off the rebound.
Alissons error didnt prove costly as Switzerland midfielder Shaqiri struck within three minutes of coming off the bench, his shot flicking off the hapless Young into the roof of the net in the 73rd minute.
Shaqiri ensured Liverpool would return to the top in the 80th minute with a stinging strike that clipped the foot of United defender Eric Bailly on its way past De Gea.
United are now 19 points behind Liverpool in sixth place as the pressure mounts on Mourinho following another wretched display.
Meanwhile, Unai Emery admitted Arsenal need to fix their leaky defence after Southamptons Charlie Austin punished a howler from Bernd Leno to stun the Gunners in a 3-2 victory.
Austin settled a thrilling clash at St Marys when he headed home with just five minutes left after Arsenal goalkeeper Leno misjudged Shane Longs cross.
Southampton had twice taken the lead through Danny Ings, only for Henrikh Mkhitaryans brace to draw Arsenal level on each occasion. AFP

Weather-related disasters in SL
Low-income households most vulnerable
Every year, natural disasters wreak havoc on the lives of people around the world. In the recent past, Sri Lanka too has experienced an increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Floods and droughts are the most common weather-related disasters, affecting tens of thousands of people in the country.
Sri Lanka is also prone to hazards such as landslides, storms, coastal erosion, and lightning strikes. The impact of natural disasters could have severe consequences, and according to the report Impact of Disasters in Sri Lanka, 2016, the poorest and the economically vulnerable are those most at risk.
The frequency and aftermath of such disasters have a negative impact on the economy. This blog, based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2016, conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), focuses on the socioeconomic backgrounds of those who have been affected by such weather-related natural disasters during 2016.
Vulnerable groups
Of the 20.7 million population in Sri Lanka, as many as 1.4 million people (or 6.5 per cent) were affected by at least one weather-related natural disaster in 2016. To make matters worse, it is those belonging to the lower income levels who are most severely affected.
Floods affected the most number of people in 2016  735,000 persons or 54.3 per cent of the total number of persons affected. This was followed by droughts that affected 35.8 per cent, landslides that affected 6.1 per cent, and storms that affected 3.8 per cent. Out of the 1.4 million persons affected, 3.7 per cent were considered poor, according to the national poverty line (NPL).
Furthermore, 10.2 per cent were in moderate poverty, according to the global poverty line of US$ 3.20 a day (2011 PPP). There are around one million persons who live just above the national poverty line, and they could easily slip into poverty when affected by natural disasters. Even those who are in middle-income levels could get pushed down to lower- income levels, as natural disasters cause people to lose their livelihoods. As such, it is important to take the above-mentioned nuances into consideration to ascertain who are mostly affected by natural disasters.
According to DCS data, the per capita household expenditure deciles (PCHHEDs) show a much clearer picture of how weather-related disasters affect the poor more than the rich. In 2016, 52.3 per cent of those affected due to weather-related disasters were in the bottom four deciles (or poorest 40 percent of households).
The percentages of persons affected in the richer groups decline after the seventh decile and reached 4.0 per cent in the richest decile. The numbers affected were higher in the bottom three deciles. The reason for this trend could be that the families who are affected by weather-related hazards slip into lower-income levels due to the loss of their livelihoods, the destruction of their limited assets, the lack of resources to recover from such blows, and so on. These vulnerable groups need help to become resilient.
DCS data also show that people living in households headed by skilled agricultural, forestry, and fisheries workers are the most severely affected by natural disasters. Out of the total number of persons affected, almost one-fifth belong to this socioeconomic group (SEG). They are affected by both droughts and floods, but a majority suffer due to droughts.
It is also observed that more than a quarter engaged in agriculture-related activities. As the agricultural sector is affected by both floods and droughts, resulting in crop losses and reduction in yields, it drives up the prices of food. This then has a negative impact not only on those engaged in agriculture, but also on the poorer groups, leading to food insecurity among low-income households.
Most-affected districts
It is important to identify the districts which have been mostly affected to develop suitable strategies to minimise the effects of natural disasters.
People living in Ampara, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Colombo, Gampaha, and Batticaloa districts accounted for more than 60 per cent of those affected by natural disasters. Ampara was the worst off, battered by both drought (106,000 persons affected) and floods (74,000 persons affected). Meanwhile, the Kurunegala district had the largest population affected by drought (114,400 persons).
In Colombo, people are threatened almost entirely by floods. Unplanned urban developments can increase the effects due to flooding in lower elevations close to rivers, affecting mainly low-income families living in high-risk areas, like in the case of Colombo district.
Way forward
The available data on natural disasters, covering a long period of time, need to be analysed in depth. These findings should be used by city and town planners, as well as rural area planners, both at the national and the regional levels, when developing effective strategies to minimise the social and economic impacts of natural disasters. The sharing of available data and information and proper coordination and collaboration between government agencies are absolutely essential in this regard.
The following recommendations should also be implemented:
 Developing a comprehensive database and up to date website giving information on high-risk areas, trends in natural disasters, the number of persons affected, time periods during which the disaster occurred by regions, etc.
 Mapping areas frequently affected by floods, droughts, landslides, storms, etc., so that people can avoid high-risk areas.
 Making early warning systems more effective and efficient, so that the damage and loss of life is minimised.
 Using the available information, especially past trends, to control and reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters and to develop coping strategies.
 Establishing an effective system to rehabilitate the affected people, especially the poorer and economically vulnerable groups, to recover their assets and to help them to get on track to proceed with their livelihoods.

McLarens Group opens Mobil-3M Experience Centre
McLarens Group opened a brand-new Customer Experience Centre dedicated to products from Mobil Lubricants and 3M Global, in Colombo. The experiential centre - located at Union Place, Colombo 02 - houses a universe of products from Mobil and 3M.
McLarens Groups heritage of always providing the very best to the Sri Lankan market is well-founded. With diversified interests in shipping, marine and logistics, McLarens is the partner-of-choice for several multinational organizations with a stake in Sri Lanka.
Speaking at the opening, Dilan Seneviratne- Head of Marketing, McLarens Lubricants Limited., said This is a first-of-its-kind customer experience centre in Sri Lanka. We set out to create a physical space that would allow our customers to come and experience these world-class products from Mobil and 3M. In the case of the former, there are oil products for a variety of sectors from automotive and marine to industrial and energy sectors; in the case of the latter, 3Ms full line of non-healthcare products will be on display.
Seneviratne was also keen to emphasise that this customer experience centre wouldnt be a one-off. This is a first step in our efforts to make these products more accessible to Sri Lankans. Plans are in the pipeline to take this to other major Sri Lankan cities.
The collaboration between McLarens Group and the two American conglomerates underlines McLarens Groups strategy and belief that the Sri Lankan consumer deserves premium quality products made by the best manufacturers in the world.

Rap, Funk, Hi- Hop an Alternative band Unscripted have prospered in the Music industry because of their sheer commitment as Saveen Makalanda put it. Which is why their message to any young musician is simply this  do what you got to do, because you just might be the one to change the whole game! Indeed when heeding his words another quote comes to mind  When the going gets tough the tough gets going! Melodies speaks to Saveen Makalanda of Unscripted whose success surely comes from the fact that they have the desire and discipline to make things happen. Because without discipline, desire amounts to nothing!
Our music is pretty much unscripted. It is a mix of many genres such as Rap, Funk, Hip Hop and alternative. But Id say we have a sound that is unique to us. Music is everything to us, it also gives us a voice so we could speak to people on a level that is universally understood, said Makalanda.
One particular strength in the band is that they have this diversity. They draw inspiration from so many genres of music and this combined with their natural fearlessness to experiment with what they see and hear, all results in some really powerful music that has helped them amass a group of loyal followers.
Our strength would be chemistry of the band and the fact that every member is influenced by all kinds of music around the world. No secret really, we are not afraid of taking risks, explained Makalanda.
Another strength the band has, is their knowledge of music. Knowledge is truly power when it comes to this group of musicians. This has enabled them to break so many barriers. Music is life to them and not a day goes by when they dont share items of music with each other.
All our members come from various musical backgrounds. We love our music. Literally there wont be a day that we dont send each other new music to listen to. Even though there are so many constraints of doing music in this island we want to keep going and somehow break the barrier in this music industry, pointed out Makalanda.
The band have not been idle. They have been putting their noses to the grindstone. Their music has been well received and they have really tasted success over the years.
We have released one EP that includes three songs! The most outstanding one would be the EP H.U.S.T.L.E which included three of our originals and this is important to me because this is the record that put us on the map! Also we released the very first clay animation music video in Sri Lanka for the song H.U.S.T.L.E. Which was done by Chamindika Abeysinghe, explained Makalanda.
The band admires artistes like Anderson Park, Tom Misch, John Mayer, J Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Stevie Wonder, MJ and the Doors. Makalanda points out that it is a learning process listening to these artistes. You need to use your ears and listen. Just by listening to someone talk or by listening to the lyrics of their music you can learn so much.
You just need to be a good listener. You need to pay attention. If you think you know everything about music you will just stagnate. You need to be open minded and you need to have that willingness to absorb what is going on around you. Again listening is important when it comes to everything in life.
If you take some artistes all over the world, they faced rejection after rejection. Yet they succeeded in life. They did not go on American Idol and win a spot in Hollywood. No, they tried again and again and one day their dreams came true!. They did not audition on American Idol and X- Factor. Performance after performance they were turned down and they came up the hard way. One day their hard work and determination paid off. Some of the people they went to must have given them a harder time than Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh or Sharon Osbourne.
We listen to all kinds of music, you could actually learn much more by simply paying attention. In music with a little luck and hard work and single minded focus you can strike gold. You need to be resolute because you can be a game changer on your day if you have that determination, pointed out Makalanda.
Makalanda stated that when you are onstage the feeling is out of this world. You feel youre on top of the world. The band of course party a lot after a hard days work. They have encountered many setbacks but they did not let that deter them.
We will never forget the performance at kacha kacha which was a banger! We completely went unscripted, improvised for hours, while English Sinhala and Tamil rappers would freestyle and the crowd was pretty wild! Hustle EP Launch and tropical jam was special too!, said Makalanda
He also pointed out that an interesting feature of the band is they are not on the same page all the time but this works for them and not against them! This creates a lot of brainstorming because they have so many different ideas! So many ideas are brought to the table. That is the beauty of it. This enables them to come up with some unique and awesome approaches.
Our ambition and goals are simple. To be bigger and better. To take the music scene here to a bigger stage, a wider platform! To stun audiences with our powerful melodies.
We would especially like to thank everyone who supported us in the local music scene! Lone rider productions for doing most of our videos! And of course the Ktown crew and the fans!, said Makalanda

Nearly 50 dengue deaths in 2018
A total of 47,013 dengue cases and around 50 deaths have been reported from all parts of the country this year up to December 14, the Epidemiology Unit said.
According to the sources, the highest number of dengue cases, 9,259 had been reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number, 5, 212 had been reported from the Gampaha district. The third highest number of dengue cases, 4,671had been reported from the Batticaloa district. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 2,307 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 6,952 dengue cases.
The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 17,301, Epidemiologists said. Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without trying home remedies.
All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school. All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All the other medications, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) which can be fatal, they said. People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites(water harbouring places) during the rainy season in order to prevent spread of dengue. Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.

NEW ALLIANCE TO BE REGISTERED - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said, the United National Front (UNF) will form a broad national alliance, which will be called and registered as the National Democratic Front without delay. It will be set up aiming to protect the motherland and democracy, he said.
The resolution related to it will be presented to the United National Party Working Committee this Friday for approval, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the UNFs Victory of Justice rally held Galle Face Green last evening.
Hundreds and thousands of UNF supporters from all across the country gathered at the rally.
UNF MPs said that the rally recorded the highest number of people to have gathered at a political rally in its history.
The Prime Minister said the UNF has to face two major elections in the future and called on the masses to give it a two-thirds majority at a forthcoming General Election. Wickremesinghe promised that he will see to the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
Through that we would also remove the laws contradictory to the Constitution, strengthen the Legislative, the Court and Fundamental Rights.
He said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and they voted for the 19th Amendment together.
It clearly states that it requires a two-thirds majority to dissolve Parliament before four and half years. We extracted it from the UK Parliament Act, he added.
Now they are blaming the court.But, the countrys judicial system became independent due to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, moved by us and thereby could protect the peoples sovereignty.
Saying that the Rajapaksa faction was repeating the need of a General Election, the Prime Minister questioned as to why did they not present any resolution to Parliament to dissolve Parliament without taking over the government. This was a coup. But, now we are going to ask from the every political party, when they needed an election. We cannot protect the Constitution by violating it, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
Now they are talking about racism. However, 90 per cent of the people are for democracy. We need democracy despite religious, race, or any division. We, in this country need reconciliation. We need a political solution. We would present this political solution based on a Unitary State. We would not shy away from it, the PM stressed.
He said, as the new government, they would go ahead by rectifying their faults and shortcomings. According to him, the ministers and the MPs would build up very close relationships with their supporters. We will also expedite the implementation of the law to bring the offenders to justice.
We will also create a civilized society and provide a good future for our young generation. You can point out our shortcomings. I am not angry with the social media. As youth, that is the society you want.
Speaking to the massive crowd, the Prime Minister said this is the Janabalaya (Peoples Power). Nobody can stop this. You were my strength during the past historical 52 days. I am grateful to all for the support extended to protect democracy.
The Rajapaksas tried to disrupt Parliament. They prevented the Speaker from taking his Chair The converted democracy into the chili powder, the Premier said. However, we could face that crisis as we set up a strong Parliament and protected the Fundamental Rights.

Peer mediation confab in Colombo today
UDecide Sri Lanka, a mediation platform for dispute resolution, together with the Rotaract Club of the Law Faculty of the Colombo University and the Rotaract Club of Colombo West, has organised the second phase of the Peer Power project which will be held today at the Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (Law School) auditorium.
At this conference, the organisers will launch Sri Lankas first peer mediation hub consisting of all schools and universities, allowing interested students and teachers to engage in amicable dispute resolution.
The purpose of this project is to create awareness in Sri Lanka of mediation as an amicable, effective and mutually beneficial form of dispute resolution. The systems currently available in resolving problems are mostly adversarial, destroying relationships when the conflict is resolved.
Mediation aims to protect the relationship between disputing parties whilst providing them with a solution. The key characteristic of this method is that the solution for the problem comes from the parties themselves.
The first phase of this project consisted of workshops conducted in schools, universities and teacher training colleges. The main area of focus was to cultivate the habit of peer mediation among the participants and was complemented by introducing essential conflict resolving skills such as identifying the true nature and cause of conflict, active listening and constructive questioning.
These workshops and their curriculum were approved by the Education Ministry as effective and necessary for school students and trainee teachers in teacher training colleges. The workshops were conducted by teams of volunteers from the three organisations involved and these teams so far have conducted 12 workshops successfully, sources said.
The Peer Power project is not a one-time event and will continue every year, promoting and creating awareness on mediation. More information could be obtained on 0759 640372 and 0773 696311.

He said he was thankful to President Sirisena for certain decisions taken in the interests of the country. The UNP was currently facing several problems and it was getting ready it form a national government.
Gammanpila was speaking at a press conference at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head office at Pitakotte yesterday.
He said the SLFP had not expelled Mahinda Rajapaksa from the party membership or the post of party patron and as such Rajapaksa could claim the position of Opposition Leader as a member of the SLFP.
Although Parliamentarians Dr. Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickramaratne and others desired an excellent government administration, they could not achieve some of the desired objectives.
Gammanpila said the duty of an Opposition was to highlight government actions detrimental to the country and added that he would never reveal the internal matters and issues of the UPFA to outsiders because he has always stood by the policy and programme of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa volunteered to accept the Premiership in order to perform his duties by the nation and due to this step some of the dangers posed to the country and nation had receded.

ILO and the Human Rights Standards on Freedom of Association
In Pursuit of Social Justice
The freedom of association for purposes or objects which are lawful is an aspect of pluralism which underpins the concept of democracy. Pluralism relating to industrial relations implies a process of negotiation between employer and workmen and between one or more of them on the one hand and the government on the other. It therefore recognizes these groups as the checks and balances which guarantee democracy. The preamble to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization (ILO), states that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice Sri Lanka has ratified all the principal United Nations Conventions on human rights and also all eight of the International Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental conventions reflected in the 1998 Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at work of the ILO.
Human rights and development are interrelated. They reinforced each other. Rights constitute the essential condition of a good life. The individual has obligations towards the State. But the state also has certain obligations to provide conditions of good life to such persons. Rights are essential but they are not unlimited. Rights and duties are interrelated.
Human rights are rights that everyone has by virtue of his / her being human. Social justice and human rights are intimately connected. Without human rights guaranteed by civil liberties, social rights have no meaning. Political freedom, civil liberties, social justice and cultural vitality are mutual complementary expression of the freedom of human spirit. Without freedom of association, the freedom of individual is at the mercy of the powerful groups or persons.
The International Labour Organization
The International Labour Organization (ILO) is one of the most important agencies of the United Nations which promotes industrial and social peace through some humane conditions of work. It was created as a tripartite body under the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and outlived that body to become in 1946, the first specialized agency associated with the United Nations. Its main objective is to ensure the social and economic well being of the working people all over the world and to guarantee to them decent living standards, adequate employment opportunities and satisfactory conditions of work and pay. The ILO approach to the implementation of human rights is based on three guiding concepts: laying down standards by way of conventions and recommendations, promotional and educational activities, inquiring into complaints and practical assistance involving in applying standards and procedures.
Conventions are instruments adopted by the ILO Conference after a detailed process of discussion, consideration, modification and voting at the Conference. After adoption by the Conference, a Convention becomes applicable to member States, if they ratify it. Ratification is on a voluntary basis, but once ratified, the Convention is an international treaty in the sense that it obliges the ratifying State to give effect to the provisions of the Convention. The ratifying State is obliged to bring both its laws and practices in line with the Convention. There is also a process to which the ILO monitors the observance by State of their obligations flowing from ratification. Resolutions do not involve any ratifications and are not binding on member States. They are intended to influence and shape labour policy including labour law.
There are two ILO Conventions which are directly related to the freedom of association, which are included in the aforesaid eight fundamental ILO Conventions.
(a). The Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organize Convention No. 87 of 1948.
The Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organize Convention No. 87, 1948, sets out the way in which workers and employers organisations should be allowed to function free of control by public authorities. Its objective is to establish the freely exercise the rights of workers and employers, without distinction, to organise for furthering and defending their interests. A summary of the Convention is follows:
(i) Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing with a view to furthering and defending their respective interests. However, national legislation can determine the extent to which the guarantees in the Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police.
(ii) Such organisations have the right to draw up their own constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. Public authorities are required to refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise of this right.
(iii) The organisations are not liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
(iv) These organisations have the right to establish and join federations and confederations which are entitled to the same rights and guarantees, and to affiliate with international organisations.
(v) The acquisition of legal personality by those organisations shall not be subject to restrictive conditions.
(vi) In exercising the rights provided for in the Convention, employers and their respective organisations are required to respect the law of the land, which should not impair, nor be so applied as to impair, the guarantees in the Convention both in respect of its content and its application.
Thus the Convention emphasizes the need for development activities to address human needs directly and protect the working people by creating safe and humane working conditions reforming and extending social security and meeting the needs of the most vulnerable groups such as child workers, women and migrant workers and those in the formal sectors. Development cannot be measured solely by the quantity of production but by its sustainability, by its capacity to protect the livelihood of all human beings. Development should be coupled with distributive justice.
(b). The Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention No. 98, 1949
Adopted in 1949, Convention No 98 seeks to protect workers from controls by employers and employers organisations and also seeks to guarantee non-interference by workers and employers organisations in respect of each other. Article 1 of Convention No. 98 requires that-
(1) Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.
(2) Such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to 
(a) make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not join a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;
(b) cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.
The freedom of association for trade union purposes is meaningless unless the protection is extended to the purposes for which people would wish to so associate. Therefore the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention (No. 98) 1949 has as its objectives the protection of workers who exercise the right to organise, ensuring non interference in workers and employers organisations and the promotion of voluntary collective bargaining. The main provisions of the Convention are as follows:
(i) Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
(ii) Workers shall be protected more particularly against the refusal to employ them by reason of their trade union membership, and against dismissal or any other prejudice by reason of union membership or participation in trade union activities.
(iii) Workers and employers organisations are entitled to protection against acts of interference by each other. This protection is afforded particularly against acts intended to secure the domination, the financing or the control of workers organisations by employers or employers organisations.
(iv) Machinery appropriate to national conditions shall be established, where necessary, to ensure respect for the right to organise as defined by the Convention.
(v) Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the development and use of voluntary collective bargaining to regulate terms and conditions of employment.
The extent to which the Convention applies to the armed forces and the police is determined by national laws or regulations. (Article 5 of the Convention). Although the Convention does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State, it cannot be construed as prejudicing their rights or status.
Human Rights Standards on Freedom of Association
The establishment of the United Nations in 1945 revolutionized human rights protection. From a subject that was treated under classical international law as being an exclusively domestic matter, human rights protection became a subject that came within the purview of the international community governed by international law. Article 1(3) of the UN Charter declares international protection of human rights as a main purpose of United Nations. Further, Member States are deemed to be under an international legal obligation to inter alia, to promote universal respect for an observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language and religion through and joint and separate action in co-operation with the United Nations.
The UDHR
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is still considered as the seminal document that recognizes Universal Human Rights Norms. The document which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948 states in its preamble that the content of the Declaration is to be a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations keeping in mind the ideal expressed in the UN Charters preamble that the peoples of the UN: reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and the worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. The UDHR provided the basis for the formulation by the United Nations of Covenants, Conventions and Declarations on specific matters.
The rights proclaimed in the UDHR can be broadly divided into two kinds: the first refers to civil and political rights which among others, include the right to life, liberty and security of person, freedom of peaceful assembly and association. The second refers to economic, social and cultural rights which relate to among others, the right to work equal pay for equal work, the right to form and join trade unions. The UDHR further states that these rights may only be limited for the purpose of securing recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and that each person has duties to the community in which she / he lives. After the adoption of the UDHR in 1948, two international Covenants on human rights namely the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Optional Protocol to the latter Covenant were adopted by the General Assembly on December 16, 1966. Both came into force in 1976. These instruments, along with the UDHR and Second Optional Protocol adopted in 1989 make up what is now widely known as the International Bill of Rights.
The ICCPR and the ICESCR
The Covenants, unlike the UDHR, are legally binding treaties for those States which are parties to them and they are obliged to respect the procedures for their implementation including the submission of periodic reports in their compliance with their obligations under the Covenants. Although there are two Covenants on human rights, the UN position is reflected in the 1993 Vienna Declaration on Human Rights according to which all human rights are universal, inter-dependent and indivisible.
Article 22 of the ICCPR deals with the freedom of association. This Article has three paragraphs. According to paragraph 1, everyone has the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests. As provided in paragraph 2 of Article 22, no restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. As also provided in paragraph 2, this Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on members of the armed forces and of the police in their exercise of this right. Paragraph 3 of Article 22 provides that nothing in this Article shall authorize State Parties to the International Labour Organization of concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize to take legislative measures which would prejudice or to apply the law in such a manner as to prejudice the guarantees provided in that Convention.
The ICESCR provides for several rights of workers namely right to work (Article 6), right to just and favourable conditions of work (Article 7), and right to form and join trade unions (Article 8). Out of these rights, right to form and join trade unions (Article 8) is relevant to this discussion. Article 8 is different from most other rights under ICESCR. The use of the word ensure in Article 8 is to signal that this right engages immediate and not progressive obligation of the State Party. This means that resources constraints are not an excuse for non compliance. The right to associate referred to above under Article 22 of the ICCPR requires that an effective judicial or quasi- judicial remedy be provided. The Committee of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights indicated in General Comment No 3 (nature of State obligations) that it requires Article 8 to be capable of judicial enforcement. This means that lobbying for the legal protection of these rights is an appropriate implementation strategy.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe vacated Temple Trees and moved to his private residence in Kollupitiya several hours after his swearing in on Sunday.
Wickremesinghe had been occupying Temple Trees since October 26 to resist his sudden removal from the post of Prime Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The UNP was of the view that Wickremesinghes removal was unconstitutional and therefore invalid from the outset.
Wickremesinghe had spent only two nights at Temple Trees during the period from January 9, 2015 to October 26, 2018.
Wickremesinghe and his wife Prof Maithree Wickramasinghe spent 50 days at Temple Trees since October 26, and it became the centre of the peoples struggle against anti-democratic and unconstitutional actions of the Executive.
Prof Maithree Wickramasinghe vacated Temple Trees immediately after the meeting held in it following the swearing in of Wickremesinghe.

The Grinch
Reining in a merry retelling
Christmas is near and the citizens of Whoville are in the merriest of moods, eagerly awaiting the much-loved holiday. However, this plenteous cheer pierces not but a single solitary soul residing in a cave, and that is the Grinch.
For 53 years the Grinch has put up with the nauseatingly optimistic holiday spirit of the people nearby, but this time he deems they have gone too far. The Mayor of Whoville has decided that the holiday shall be three times bigger this year, but the Grinch will not have it. And so he schemes to steal their Christmas and with it their spirit once and for all.
The movie takes us through snow-clad hills in a vibrant azure tint before the establishing shot reveals both Mount Crumpit, on which the Grinchs cave is located, and Whoville. Here were introduced to the Whos, a gladsome bunch and the Grinch, a grumpy old recluse who wants no part in the ongoing festivities. The transition from Whoville to Mt. Crumpit at the beginning of the movie highlights this in a humorous manner; we see the Grinch lash his alarm clock repeatedly with various objects when it starts playing holiday tunes.
The film then introduces a hip-hop version of the classic song Youre a Mean One, Mr. Grinch as it reveals the characters amusing morning routine. Here the Grinchs pet dog, Max, plays the role of an assistant; from preparing his coffee to helping him get his frown on, to choosing his mood clothes ranging from Unhappy to Wretched to Miserable, and even Very Miserable. The movie also has a moment of witty wordplay when it shows a medium close-up shot of the Grinchs body spray which reads Mold Spice, a nod to the line Your hearts a dead tomato splotched with mouldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch.
The roots of the Grinchs disrelish for Christmas is gradually revealed from how he has run out of food due to emotional eating to running away in fear from carolers who approach him. The narrator (Pharrell Williams) initially suggests that perhaps the Grinchs heart is two sizes too small, but we see later that his reasons are far more personal and linked to disappointments he had faced during his childhood.
It would be a stretch to say the film highlights the effects of trauma, but it does, in a way, symbolise how such events may affect a childs viewpoint on certain things, and how such a child would adapt unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with them as he or she grows up. The Grinch is shown to be extremely introverted and misanthropic to a certain degree, but his reasons begin to seep out when he meets Cindy-Lou, an energetic and smart little girl who desperately wants to mail a letter to Santa Claus. The Grinch says that the Who children are selfish because Cindy-Lou is too concerned about her letter to ask how he is after she crashes into him while taking a detour to meet the mailman.
Throughout the first few sequences of the movie, the Grinch is merely a passive villain obstructing the Whos activitiesor at least attempting to and failing miserablyor rather very miserably; but when he comes face to face with the one thing he detests the most on a scale which he had never experienced before, the Grinch decides to play the role of an active villain this time. It is noteworthy to mention that the particular scene that sets him off could be viewed as a representation of the sensory overload associated with anxiety, aside from showcasing flashbacks linked to traumatic events of the past.
Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent at grasping all the grumpy attitudes of the Grinch. From the grumbling to the gasping, from the sneering to the squawking, he meets all these aspects to a tee. One such memorable scene is when the Grinch gets a wonderful terrible idea to rid Whoville of Christmas; the changes in the timbre of his voice during that moment whilst it grows higher in pitch (sounding quite similar to Peter Pettigrew from Harry Potter) to the rather raspy, deeper voice that follows when he declares that he will steal their Christmas are performed perfectly. Furthermore, the animations brilliantly capture the Grinchs facial expressions, especially in the above scene, where the Grinchs evil smile is near to that of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings.
Cameron Seeley delivers an excellent performance as the young Cindy-Lou who wants to meet Santa so she could ask him to help her overworked single mother, Donna (Rashida Jones) to be happy. Pharrell Williams does a fantastic job in meeting the changes of tone and emotions associated with the story. Though certain lines in the narration do stand out as bland, the overall effect on the story is not hindered. The scores also play well in setting the atmosphere for many varying sequences, be it comedic, lighthearted, or dramatic.
There are, however, certain animation scenes related to physics that seemed odd or flawed towards the end of the movie when the Grinch puts his master plan into action. Though he takes on the persona of an anti-Clause/Ethan Hunt (Mission: Impossible) amalgamation while inventing numerous ingenious gadgets, the capabilities of those weapons and the methodology in which he uses them are somewhat unrealistic.
The dialogues are compelling in helping us understand the Grinchs motives and backstory. Further, the film does not reveal too much too fast and keeps a steady flow most of the time. There are a couple of sequences where its flow changes rather abruptly not due to flawed editing, but due to certain plot twists that are either rushed and underwhelming, or just too convenient. One such scene was related to the Grinchs new partner, Fred the reindeer; while the other is towards the climax of the movie where although how the Grinch realises what he really despised was not Christmas but solitude, his change of heart occurs in an anticlimactic manner.
The film does have certain moments of symbolism; one such sight is when Whovilles Christmas lights are aglow whilst the Grinch stands on a ledge in the snow. This draws a contrast between the warmth and optimism of the town and the bitter cold that consumes the Grinch. And perhaps the one message The Grinch tells us, be it quite a cliche, is that kindness and love are what we all need most.

Rising from the ashes
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who was sworn in as Prime Minister for a record fifth time on Sunday lost no time in getting down to business. Addressing the nation immediately after taking oaths, Premier Wickremesinghe flagged off the single most important task confronting them -that of pulling the nation out of the ashes of the political conflagration of the last 50 days.
In a brief address delivered from Temple Tress, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said their first task will be to bring the country back to normalcy and establish the status quo. He did not fail to express his gratitude to all citizens who voiced their unequivocal demand for the restoration of democracy at the height of the political crisis, including protestors, social activists and UNP supporters who carried out their struggle to all parts of the country. He also expressed his gratitude to the Supreme Court, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Parliament for their steadfastness in protecting democracy. He said the first thing they want to achieve is to restore normalcy and kick start development. He also promised to provide better living conditions and to create a prosperous economy for the people despite the serious economic setback that the country had to face due to the political crisis.
The Premier noted that development activities in the country came to a standstill during the last few weeks. They had come to a stage where the Government was in a position to grant the people the dividends for their labour of having to endure hardships during the past three years to bring the country to a stable level. "This was very unfortunate. We all want to lead normal lives. We want development.
Of course, like the Prime Minister implied, this was not a time to have recriminations. True, a grave mistake was committed that placed the country in peril, both in terms of its democratic future and the repercussions on the economy (the cost to the country as result of the crisis has been estimated at over Rs 220 billion). The blow suffered to the image of the country internationally has not been quantified in economic terms but certainly the cost in terms of goodwill will be difficult to shake off. We say this because soon after the advent of the Yahapalanaya Government, Sri Lanka was hailed in the most flattering terms by nations that had hitherto spurned us. The reception accorded to President Maithripala Sirisena at the G20 meeting in Japan where President Barack Obama, it was said, broke way from a meeting of world leaders to come up to President Sirisena to greet the latter was testament to this. So was the visit to the country of a US Secretary of State for the first time in four decades. Why this goodwill was sullied by such a rash decision taken by the President all of a sudden on October 26 is indeed difficult to comprehend.
But now that the status quo has been restored, there is no purpose served in apportioning blame. The nation has to pick up the pieces and move on. The President has expressed his willingness to work with the current dispensation. Premier Wickremesinghe, for his part, showed no hint of the acrimony that existed between them post-October 26. Senior UNPers returning after the swearing, in their limousines, responding to the media, said the parties decided to bury the hatchet while reiterating the hackneyed phrases of there no being permanent friends or enemies in politics.
Of course Premier Wickremesinghe is too mature a politician to allow petty differences stand in the way of seizing on the larger picture. His priority now is to get the country going. No time should be lost in appointing the new Cabinet of Ministers to catch up on the backlog. A backlog there certainly was, what with the entire state machinery semi-paralyzed and senior officials not committing themselves to their tasks fearing repercussions.
The first task of the new Cabinet should be to get the wheels of administration moving and all services hitherto lying in abeyance fully restored.
It is not clear at this stage if the UNF is planning to go it alone or there will another coalition in store. The Greens, at least the young Turks in the party, are determined that they won't have any more alliances. The UPFA/SLFP pohottuwa combine too are not enamoured by such a prospect although UPFA General Secretary MP Mahinda Amaraweera said a final decision will be taken by the President.
Whatever may be the final decision, it is incumbent for both camps to work towards bringing the country back to normalcy. It goes without saying that the economy had been dealt a body blow by the crisis, with the rupee in a runway downward spiral against the dollar and foreign capital fleeing from the country going by the massive pullout by foreigners from the bourse.
This, therefore, is not the time for political games and both parties should declare a truce, at least until such time the country can afford the luxury of divisive party politics.

## Title: Setting up an accounting system for your start-up is not rocket science

## Section: Finance

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 15
Setting up an accounting system for your start-up is not rocket science
Having a robust accounting system in place right from the early stages of your business will help you build a strong foundation for it. Apart from the people, a business systems act as a backbone. Give it the right ones at the right time and you will have a commercial entity that will thrive and withstand most of the storms that come its way.
Most entrepreneurs look forward to setting up management control systems. This includes having certain monitoring tools and financial planning modules in place to be more aware of whats going in the business.
Because having accurate company information handy (in an organized manner) is crucial to correct decision-making, it makes sense to set them up as soon as possible. This especially holds true of accounting systems because it is important to be in the know of the financial health of your company.
Benefits
Let us see what special benefits you receive when you have a good accounting system
Accounting is simply a way of tracking, monitoring and managing every financial transaction or event. Its the pulse of your business. In short, it gives you control over your business. At any time, youll have a handle on: Receivables  (the money that is coming into and owed to the business) and Liabilities  (the money you owe that is going out of the business).
And each month, the system will should produce a minimum of two documents: Profit and Loss statement and Balance Sheet.
Usually the P&L is accrual-based. That is, each monthly P&L statement reflects what you sold not what money you actually received. This is a more accurate reflection of your activity. It smooths out the variability of when your customers may actually pay you. This simple month-end statement shows the revenues you have sold in the previous month and the expenses you have incurred. The difference gives you a profit or loss for that month.
Balance sheet will give you a picture of your companys financial state. It includes your assets and your liabilities and equity (which means, your net assets minus your net liabilities)
Another benefit is you can monitor cash flow. It tells you WHEN money is coming in or going out of the business.
Receivables  if you take cash for a sale, its there. If you invoice clients, you could wait 30, 60 or 90 days to receive payment.
Liabilities  you need to know when future loan repayments or bills for supplies are due. Your suppliers may give 30 days credit or more.
The cash flow statement is different from your monthly profit and loss statement. It gives a clear and real picture of the health of your business. You could have an apparently good business on paper, but thats meaningless if theres no money flowing into the bank. If you are selling a great deal to one client and they are late with their payments, your P&L may look good but your Cash Flow statement may not. This is a key monitor of your companys viability
Building up
Since you understand now the importance of an accounting system, let us take a look how to build it in your start-up firm.
If youre going to set up an accounting system for the first time then cough up a few thousands and obtain the services of a experienced accountant. He or she will advise you on the necessary accounts. This way you can be sure that its done the right way and the system will grow with your company. Remember  do what you do best and bring in experts to do what they do best.
Options
You have three options to consider when determining which accounting system to employ: (1) An outside accounting services, (2) An in-house manual bookkeeping system, (3) An in-house computer-based accounting system.
If you decide to go the outsourcing route (using an outside accounting service), you need to make that decision before you open your businesss doors. If you decide to use an in-house computer-based accounting system, you have to find out more about the manual and computer-based options.
In those cases where your business is a relatively uncomplicated sole proprietorship or partnership, you may decide to carry the manual process. Unless you have a good knowledge of Book Keeping and Accounting with few years practical experience, it is advisable to get a professionals advice to set up the manual books initially and follow-through.
Computer-based systems
If you can afford to purchase good computer, using it to accomplish your bookkeeping and accounting functions almost always makes sense. The least expensive computerized software package available is a tad more expensive than a comparable manual system, but if you use it properly, should save you time, provide you with more information, and establish a base for you to grow into a more sophisticated system as your business expands.
You can consider four categories of computerized systems when shopping for your first accounting package. The system you ultimately select depends on the size and complexity of your business. A description of the four categories follows, along with several basic questions and a collection of tips intended to help you make the final choice.
Category 1:
This includes those quick-and-easy accounting systems used by many families, as well as by small businesses. Theyre basically an electronic cheque book register with the capacity to categorize and cumulate expenses and generate both profit and loss statements and balance sheets. Most systems also include the capability to pay bills electronically. For eg.,Quicken.
There are shortcomings in category 1 systems but when your business is small and you know its going to remain small for few years, and youll be the only person signing the checks, such systems may be satisfactory for you.
Category 2:
Category 2 systems provide a number of services that Category 1 systems dont. For example, it can perform the following functions: Compute, write, and compile employee payroll: Track and age receivables and payables: Aging, which means determining the amount of time your receivables have been due to you or your payables have been due to your vendors: Establish customer receivable ledgers: Maintain a basic inventory system:
Using an automatic system to keep track of your inventory, especially when you have a large number of SKUs (stock keeping units), is the best way to make sure youre getting good numbers.
The primary disadvantage of Category 2 accounting software programs is also it does not provide an audit trail. (An audit trail enables you to track every Rupee of income and expenses, thus making theft much more difficult.)
Category 3:
Category 3 programs provide their owners with all the benefits that Category 2 systems provide, as well as the audit trail.
Category 4:
Unlike the software packages in Categories 1, 2, and 3, which are purchased in a single package, Category 4 systems are purchased in modules, or stand-alone units. However, Category 3 and 4 programs overlap to some degree because a few of the Category 3 programs also come with modules, thus making the choice between the two a bit complicated. Category 4 packages have more horsepower/bandwidth, as well as more module options, they work best for larger companies (more than 200 employees).
Buying a computer-based system
The first two questions you need to ask yourself when choosing a computer-based system. How big is my business What can I afford
Generally speaking, the smaller the business, the more likely you are to use a Category 1 or 2 system. A home-office business can easily get by with a Category 1 system, while most non-home-office businesses with 25 employees or fewer can use a Category 2 system.
You also need to take into account how much inventory youll be managing and whether or not youve decided to outsource your payroll. In other words, the more you ask of your system, the more horsepower you need.
When making your final system decision, consult with your Accountant or computer professional and keep the following reminders in mind:
Dont waste your time purchasing and figuring out a system that youre going to outgrow in six months or a year. Dont waste money on a system youd get such little use out of. Dont buy a system that you think will take you three years or more to grow into. Thats too far out to accurately project.
Buy a system that you think will work for you for the next three years. In addition to considering the software system itself, consider the company behind the package youre buying. Consider the following criteria: the support that the company provides, the history of its program updates (as a general rule, better companies provide more frequent updates), and the future of that company (will it be around to provide upgrades in future years).
In the likely event that you cant answer these questions yourself, call (or email) the company and ask direct questions. Your Accountant may also be able to give you an educated opinion.
There are a number of reputed companies of reliable accounting software represented in Sri Lanka.For example, QuickBooks or MYOB. They are affordable, easy to use and give you all the facilities for recording, reporting and analysing your transactions.
Its clear you need to record all these transactions in real time to understand and analyse the figures, and to get a clear picture of how your business is doing. Its the only way to find out what you need to do to make your business better. That is why a good software is needed.

SL makes strong progress in IoT
Sri Lanka has made significant progress in its IoT (Internet of Things) ventures says a research report filed by www.wiseguyreports.com.
According to the report, in 2018 the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka formally approved a significant investment for network expansion and upgrades work on 4G mobile and fixed broadband services.
Sri Lanka has seen a very strong increase in mobile broadband penetration over the past five years. Report says that in contrast, fixed broadband penetration in Sri Lanka remains very low mainly due to the dominance of the mobile platform and the limited and declining number of fixed lines is restricting more widespread development of fixed broadband. However, the market has grown strongly over the past five years from a very small base.
Over the next five years till 2023, the strong growth is expected to continue.
Sri Lankas mobile market has experienced strong growth over the last six years. Slow growth is predicted over the next five years till 2023. The market will be constrained from higher growth due to very strong local competition and a highly saturated mobile market.
The market is now moving from 4G towards 5G mobile services. Dialog Axiata has carried out a 5G network capability trial with technology partners Ericsson and Huawei in Colombo.
The demonstration included a range of 5G solutions including Massive MIMO, cloud radio and IoT-based smart parking and real time 4K video streaming.
Dialog Axiata has claimed South Asias first launch of a NB-IoT-enabled network supporting IoT solutions such as Connected Home and Car Connect. Mobitel has completed a further round of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests of LTE-Advanced Pro (LTE-A Pro) technology in Colombo.
Sri Lanka has seen a very strong increase in mobile broadband penetration over the past six years, driven by a rising level of 4G mobile subscribers.
However, the mobile broadband market is still at an early stage of development with penetration well below most other developed Asian countries. Strong growth is predicted over the next five years.

SME Business Leaders Recognized for Commitment to Excellence
Sri Lankan businesses that completed a Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Management Development Training Program to help strengthen managerial and technical skills were recognized at an event held in Colombo recently.
Facilitated by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported BIZ+ program, more than 50 managers and business owners in Southern, Eastern, Northern, North Central, and Uva Provinces have participated in this program aiming to expand businesses, improve operations, and motivate workforce.
For more than seven months, the businesses learned to implement business plans, create sustainable jobs in smaller communities, and drive improvements in supply chains.
USAID Mission Director, Reed Aeschliman, said at the event, USAIDs assistance to the SME sector is not about financial investment alone. It is about investing in people and the private sector to lift lives and transform economies. USAID has assisted SMEs across the country to invest in its community, create jobs, develop skills, generate regional economic growth, and most importantly give hope to thousands of Sri Lankans for a better tomorrow 
Sujeewani Gamage and Saman Thilakasiri proprietors of G Rose, a local personal care products company, felt the trainings helped bring enormous changes in their business, got them better organized, and helped to minimize waste and improve cost management. We were also able to understand our own strengths and personality traits and bring in a good supporting structure to fill in the gaps, Sujeewani added.
The 12-part series of one-day workshops included topics such as cost management, new market development, productivity improvement, employee management and retention, operational safety, and health and digital marketing.
USAIDs BIZ+ program has provided more than 60 local businesses with financial, technical and managerial assistance across Sri Lanka. Since 2011, BIZ+ has invested LKR 1.5 billion (USD 11.3 million) to support local businesses in hospitality, agriculture, coir, automobile services, handicraft, and food processing sectors.

This was with the objectives of promoting and profiling of goods and services, products and produces and tourism and culture of Sri Lanka among the nationals of Bahrain, foreign expatriates and other nationalities. The paramount objectives of this event were to promote exports of goods, produce and products from Sri Lanka to Bahrain and tourism from Bahrain to Sri Lanka.

SUSIL FERNANDO
I bumped into him at Hilton the other day, he was here on a whistle stop visit to Sri Lanka to attend a wedding. During the first Sri Lankan Test team to tour overseas in 1983, Susil Fernando opened batting with Sidath Wettimuny in New Zealand. Those were the days when the Sri Lankan team got step motherly treatment and the Tests were few and far between, consequently Susils interest waned and he went to settle down under. He stated that they played for a pittance those days, prior to 1989 the division 1 players even had to pay their club fees, even during the tour of New Zealand Susil stressed the fact that they were paid only Rs. 400/- a day. In Susils days when he played Test matches in Colombo he had to take a tuk-tuk to the ground and the ride was bumpy to say the least, it was a far cry from the luxury buses with police escort.
Hathurusingha on a mo-bike
I can remember Chandika Hathurusingha going round the bend at the Kanatte roundabout on his motor bike with his kit slung on his back on his way to play England at the SSC in a Test match. I have also seen Dulip Liyanage getting off the 154 bus to attend a Test Match. I would not be surprised if our team will fly in a helicopter in the near future if they keep on underperforming.
Reverting back to Susil, he mentioned that in spite of the bare necessities, the passion took pride of place to represent the mother country. He also represented Sri Lanka in the 1983 World Cup which India won. The pressure to perform was not that great those days and nowadays performing under pressure plays a significant role as a result. Players in Susils era were more carefree.
Susil mentioned that on the New Zealand tour late Abu Fuard was the manager and that he was very strict. W.A.N. Silva was the coach. He also stressed the fact that there were no hanky panky after curfew hours and that all the players were safely tucked up in bed by 10 p.m.
Susil was born and bred in Moratuwa, where the likes of Lasantha Rodrigo, H.I. Fernando, Duleep Mendis, Romesh Kaluwitharana and a host of other well known cricketers emerged. apart from all the others swashbuckling batsmen, Susil was also somewhat different, he was a patient accumulator of runs, getting huge hundreds for Air Force in the Sara Trophy. Mendis played softball cricket with Susil as young brats with a host of cricket mad kids.
Carpenters-Cricketers-Calypso
Moratuwa is well known for its carpenters and baila - a local form of calypso where Trinidad is famous for, and the two schools St Sebastians and Prince of Wales has produced a host of famous cricketers. Susil is one of them. Kusal Mendis is another. At present and recent past the coastal belt south of Colombo like Kandana, Jaela and Negombo have given Sri Lanka good cricketers like Dilhara Fernando, Graeme Labrooy, Dhammika Prasad, Nuwan Pradeep etc. I presume that the common factor to these areas is the sea and their nutritious diet of fish.
Sir Richard Hadlee
Susil had faced Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Sir Richard Hadlee all three were brilliant all rounders and Susil was fortunate enough to face all three of them. Imran Khan and Kapil Dev during the 1983 World Cup and Hadlee during that tour to New Zealand. According to Susil, Hadlee was the best out of the lot since he could swing and seam both ways at will at brisk pace. He also mentioned the fact that Kapil Dev had a beautiful late outswinger and that Imran Khan was the fastest of the lot with a dangerous inswinger.
Susil says that the wickets in New Zealand were seamers dreams and at Auckland he managed get 46 out of a total of 145 odd runs and to face Hadlee, Chatfield, Sneddon and Co was not easy and his patience and sound judgment of the ball outside his offstick paid dividends.
Susil was of the opinion that the late Gamini Dissanayake was the key factor for us to gain Test status and his decision making was unwavering and he was capable of brushing off big brothers looking over his shoulder. He also lamented the fact that we are losing Test matches at home which were never heard of those days and the passion to play for the country has deserted our national cricketers for some unknown reason.

Theresa May warns against second Brexit vote
UK: British Prime Minister Theresa May will on Monday warn MPs against supporting a second referendum, saying it would do irreparable damage to British politics.
Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum, she is expected to tell Parliament, according to extracts from her speech released by Downing Street.
Anther vote... would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, she will say, adding that a second vote would likely leave us no further forward.
She will warn that another referendum would also further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.
Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum in 2016 and is set to leave on March 29 next year, although May is struggling to get parliament to accept a divorce agreement she struck last month.
May has faced calls for a second referendum to resolve the impasse but has argued that this would betray the 2016 result and undermine public confidence in politics.
Campaigners for a referendum said Mays comments on Monday showed that the idea is being taken seriously.
A new public vote would be different from the referendum in 2016 because we now know more about what Brexit means, said Margaret Beckett, an MP from the main opposition Labour Party and Peoples Vote supporter.
Any effort to force Brexit over the line without checking that it has the continued consent of the British people will only reinforce divisions, she said.
Dozens of MPs from all the main parties also support a second referendum, as do former Prime Ministers John Major and Tony Blair.
There have also been reports that government officials are considering giving the public a vote.
May has delayed a crucial vote by MPs on the draft Brexit deal until next month, leaving the political scene in limbo. If parliament fails to approve the text, Britain will crash out of the European Union regardless -- a prospect that experts warn could lead to serious trade disruption and trigger a financial crisis.
But former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit campaigner, said anyone considering a second referendum was out of their minds.
A second referendum would provoke instant, deep and ineradicable feelings of betrayal, he wrote on Monday in his weekly column in the Daily Telegraph.

Im incredibly proud of the team, said Southgate.
There was a disconnection with the fans for a long period and that was understandable.
Huge credit to the players, they played with great pride, great style and I think people really appreciated how they conducted themselves and represented their country.

A group of 21 Sri Lanka Freedom Party Members (SLFP) have decided not to join the Government formed by the United National Party (UNP). They have arrived at this decision at a meeting they had with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
There is no truth that some of the members of the group plan to shift their allegiance to the Government and instead they all are intact in the Opposition as one body, with one mind, he said.
UPFA MP Nishantha Muthuhettigama told our sister newspaper, the Dinamina, that the group has decided to stick together and strengthen the Opposition. Muthuhettigama claimed that while the Government commands only 101 Members, the UPFA has 103 Members in Parliament. Hence, the decision of the group to stay away without joing the Government.

A New Jersey woman has her wedding ring back, nine years after she accidentally flushed it down her toilet.
Paula Stanton was sure the diamond-encrusted gold ring was lost forever after she noticed it wasn't on her finger while she was cleaning her bathroom nearly a decade ago.
Luckily, a member of Somers Point's public works department remembered Stanton mentioning the ring about three years ago. Last month, Ted Gogol was doing maintenance work near a manhole about 400 feet from Stanton's house.
He tells the Press of Atlantic City he saw a shiny object sitting the mud. It turned out to be Stanton's ring, and after boiling it in peroxide and lemon juice, she is wearing it again.

Wits in jangles with holiday jingles!
With Christmas just around the corner there is a nip in the air and continuous jingles jangling in my head. I notice that every year around this time, I hear holiday music. It follows me everywhere this overused melodic nemesis piped in the malls and lifts and waiting rooms.
My ears have been assailed and are echoing with the Christmas tunes that are becoming exasperating with their bankrupt repertoire. I am sure you would agree with me wholesale, and retail that I am fed up with hearing Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock! Jingle bells. . . BANG! That was the festive sound of the radio being struck with a hammer by me! So you see an overdose of the holiday music has me already in a holi-daze!
God rest ye merry gentle people, let nothing you dismay, except excessive festive music, heard well in advance of Christmas Day. Yep, its that time again! That magical time of year when it is impossible to leave your house without a faint fa-a-la- la-la ringing in your ears. Tis the season of Christmas songs. Tis the season when you are reminded every single day. Tis the season when you can recite every single word of, Its the Most Wonderful Time of the Year because youve heard it 27,876 times this morning already and, let me tell you, there is nothing remotely wonderful about the kids jingle-belling and everyone telling you to be of good cheer.
Its extremely annoying. In fact, its more than just annoying. I hate to bring you tidings of discomfort, not joy, but some Christmas music is emotionally damaging and hazardous to your health. And if you've ever worked in a shop during November and December, chances are you will have found Christmas music incredibly infuriating.
I must also admit that I am not a big fan of The Little Drummer Boy. I am certain you are with me on that. Oh, sure, The Little Drummer Boy is a beautiful song, for maybe the first 35 minutes. But eventually it gets on your nerves, those voices shrieking Rum-pa-pa-pum!
For openers, drums do not go Rum-pa-pa-pum. Drums go Rat-a-tat-tat. Also, I have issues with the line from The Little Drummer Boy that goes: The ox and lamb kept time. Really How Did they clack their hooves together, castanet-style Did they dance Are we supposed to believe that two barnyard animals with legume-level IQs spontaneously started doing the macarena If they did they must have been unique laughing stock cattle and sheep with a sense of humour and a year for music.
I'll tell you this: If I were taking care of a newborn baby, and somebody came around whacking on a drum, that person would find himself in the emergency room having his drumsticks surgically removed from his rum-pa-pa-pum, if you know what I mean. Take it from me theres no drummer boy mentioned anywhere in the gospels. Besides, Baruppapumpum is not a word in English or in Sinhala or Tamil, though it does sound a bit like the sound an automatic weapon makes while firing on all cylinders.
People can be so unfair at times even during the season of good cheer. The cops especially have no sense of fair play or humour either. If youre singing Christmas songs on your neighbours lawn at night with your church group, its called carol singing. But if youre doing it alone on the street wearing a Santa outfit its called drunk and disorderly behaviour. Or say, if you are doing it with no outfit at all, you will be charged with indecent exposure.
For a nation that sometimes finds it difficult to bare its soul, some Sri Lankan seasonal party drunks are surprisingly relaxed when it comes to baring their bodies. Many of them in a sober state are incredibly well dressed before divesting themselves of their clothes to begin their frivolities. In mitigation I must say in their defence that they all wore clothes suited to an activity far smarter than the one in which they were engaged in before being copped. There were men who had worn only neckties for the occasion, which they claimed had provided adequate cover to any dangling adjuncts far more effectively than old Adams fig leaf. But the cops are usually unmoved and refuse to buy excuses of exhibitionists prone to proper underwear amnesia.
Nobody announces in advance that they plan to end up buck naked in public. But it is amazing how often somebody does, plunging themselves into a world of almost unchecked social high-jinks. And the cops have the temerity to say that Santas nuts. That he is displaying naked aggression. That hes hallucinating. They call it the Insanity Clause. So they frog-march you to the cop shop while you switch to a rousing baila with the popular local hit Ralahamy Mung polisiyay, Ralahamy Mung.
Ok, I will admit that the cops throw a blanket or a rain-cape around you when you are nabbed in an unclothed state in public. But they dont actually do so through compassion or to keep you warm from the cold snap either. I suspect they do it because they dont want to suffer an inferiority complex for the rest of the season.
A former journalistic colleague named Lou Hart and I once checked into adjoining hotel rooms one Christmas Eve while on an assignment in Singapore. I was just about to shower when I heard a huge commotion in the corridor outside. Opening the door I was assailed by the sight of Lou bawling his head off at an army of hotel staff. He was tipsy and looked a sight with a hotel towel, which was much too small for him, draped around his waist.
He was blubbering incoherently that his shower head attachment was defective. Guests disturbed by his stentorian roar and peeping into the corridor only heard this part of his complaint: My damned attachment is loose and is moving around free willy! Lou was actually mixing free-wheeling and willy-nilly both literally and metaphorically.
And there was old Aunt Madeleine who at a family Christmas reunion had had one too many. She advanced towards the podium tottering perilously on insecure stiletto heels, much like a stilt-walker. Then just as the toastmaster finished his celebratory ritual, Aunt Madeleine raised her glass leaned towards the microphone and made her own salutation: Up yours! After a few moments of stunned silence, the toastmaster explained that she had actually been going for was Bottoms up!
