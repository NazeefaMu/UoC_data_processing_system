Abolishing SAITM the only solution: IUSF
The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) said yesterday that the only solution to resolve the issue concerning the Malabe private medical college was to abolish it.
IUSF members addressing the media in Colombo said that appointing various commissions to find solutions were futile.
They said that allowing the medical college to function will create numerous problems and also open the doors for other private medical colleges to come into the fray.
The IUSF said that the countrys political leaders should get involved in the matter and take immediate steps to abolish the private medical college and restore the credibility of medical education in Sri Lanka.

President of the Member Network Panel of ACCA Sri Lanka Adrian Perera said organisations the world over are under mounting pressure from their wide array of stakeholders, from investors to governments to non-governmental organisations and even communities and customers, it has become imperative that entities are transparent and accountable in all their dealings. "They must demonstrate their efforts to manage the impacts of their operations. Sustainability reporting has now become an important route through which corporate accountability and integrity can be demonstrated."
The ACCA Sri Lanka Awards for Sustainability Reporting were launched in November 2004, based on the objectives of rewarding and recognising those organisations which report and disclose environmental, social or full sustainability information within Sri Lanka, encourage the uptake of environmental, social and/or sustainability reporting and raise awareness in corporate transparency issues and increase accountability of responsiveness to stakeholders.

ADG should refrain from signing irrelevant circulars: GMOA
The Acting Director General of Health Services has issued a circular to all hospital directors instructing them to remove black flags from hospital premises. These are not tasks assigned to him. He will have to send more circulars in future if the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) decides to hoist white, red or multi couloured flags as a part of the ongoing protest, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said a group of armed persons had entered the Elpitiya base hospital and removed the black flags hoisted at the hospital premises as a part of the ongoing protest.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the doctors of the hospital have currently withdrawn from duties until their safety is ensured. The trade unions have the sole right to protest against anything and that right cannot be violated through issuing circulars.
The GMOA requested
the Acting Director General of Health Services to sign only the circulars that are relevant tohim.
This is the first time in Sri Lankan history that a Director General of Health Services had signed an irrelevant circular, he added.

Bandara challenges GL
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara challenged former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris who claimed that the SLFP was now limited to its name board, to obstruct the successful forward march of the SLFP Youth Front if he [Peiris] could.
I challenge G.L. Peiris who chairs a new political movement to obstruct the SLFP Youth Front, which is now creating a huge youth force countrywide, if he is able to do so and if he thinks the SLFP has limited itself to its name board, Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference organised by the SLFP Youth Front at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
Bandara said Peiris who crossed over several times from one party to another, has no right to talk about the SLFP as he never loves the party and on several occasions crossed over to other parties. Unlike him, we love our party. People who dont love the party, can betray it. I urge Peiris and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa not to betray the SLFP and try to split it. Can the SLFP win the next election without unity in the party Bandra questioned. Speaking on the Youth Front activities, he said district level Balamandala are being set up countrywide at present.
It is observed that youths are rallying round the SLFP eagerly. The party received a huge support at a recent membership drive in the Killinochchi and Vavuniya districts. It has been scheduled to hold another Balamandala meeting in the Baticaloa and Trincomalee districts, Bandara said.
A significant number of youths joined the SLFP leveling allegations against the political leadership in their areas.
These youths said that they were taken for a ride by the political representation in their areas. The youths said they were used by those politicians to gain political power including to enter Parliament, Bandara said.
He added that except present President Maithripala Sirisena, both former Presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa became executive presidents of the country as a result of the SLFP.
However, the present President did not receive the direct assistance of the party to become the President. The views of the grass-roots level party membership has changed now. They want a united journey without splitting the party.
Asked whether the new political party formed by Karuna Amman is a challenge to the SLFPs political activities in the North and East, Bandara said it wont be a challenge as the youths are well aware of the political trend in the country.
Bandara added that President Sirisena has been an SLFP activist for 50 years and in that period he had been the General Secretary of the SLFP for 12 years.
During his tenure as the General Secretary he was able to drive the party in the right direction wining all elections held during that period, Bandara added.
He said officials of the relevant ministries are duty bound to make the people aware regarding the activities carried out under their respective ministries.
People should be made aware regarding the Google balloon project, he said.

Former French PM confident European Parliament will vote in favour of Sri Lanka
The President of the Constitutional Council of France and former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius yesterday stated that he believed that the European Parliament would vote in favour of granting Sri Lanka GSP Plus when it convenes in May of this year.
The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (EU) in January proposed to restore the special concessions under the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP Plus) for imports from Sri Lanka in exchange of an improved human rights and labour record. The recommendation however has to be ratified by the European Parliament to take effect.
Fabius who delivered a lecture on Europe and the International Order, Post-Brexit at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies observed that Europe would remain a major trading partner and leading financial source for infrastructure to Sri Lanka despite Britain choosing to leave its fold. France is a strong supporter of Sri Lanka receiving GSP Plus,Fabius said.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera who also addressed the event said that 40 percent of all exports to the EU was to the UK and thus Brexit would greatly affect the countrys trade, With Brexit, Sri Lanka will lose the advantage of the GSP plus in the UK and the possible depreciation of the pound during and after Brexit will also add to the impact and affect inbound tourism as well as exports, said Samaraweera.
Fabius pointed out that though Brexit would be triggered later this year,it would take at least two years for the process to finalize leading to a period of great economic uncertainty especially in the UK.
He however added that given that the EU market was still larger than a standalone British one, countries trading with the EU would still be at an advantage.
The granting of GSP plus was stopped to Sri Lanka in 2010 due to the failure to address the reported human rights violations in the country.
Fabius also said that France was ready to help Sri Lanka rise from its trauma from decades of civil war at its own pace.
An important observation as Sri Lanka looks to answer for its slow progress in tackling alleged war crimes and human rights violations at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council Sessions in Geneva on February 27.

People worry about blood transfusions but how many would consider the quality of oxygen given during surgery
Gas World, an associate company of Industrial Gases, Sri Lanka's first globally certified provider of oxygen and nitrogen, the quality of oxygen given for surgical and medical procedures is of uttermost importance.
Industrial Gases the parent company of Gas World, is a fully Sri Lankan owned and managed company, specialising in oxygen and nitrogen solutions for industrial and medical purposes for over 25 years.

The Company adheres to World Health Organization recommended GMP guidelines with US, BPor European Pharmacopeia standards that are monitored by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka.  Achieving the highest possible standards is a priority for us not just as a company but also for the growth of the industry Industrial Gases Chairman Sumith Guruge said.

Commenting on the gas sector in Sri Lanka, Dr Parakrama Herath, Director Compliance of Gas World, whose expertise is recognised as an authoritative opinion on the subject in the industry, says that having introduced international guidelines to comply with global standards, much still needs to be done.
Industrial Gases also has one of the most advanced manufacturing plants in Sri Lanka for the production of liquid oxygen. State-of-the-art technology that together with global best practices is the combination that is operational at Industrial Gases.
The process may seem simple enough but it is liquid oxygen in its purest form, specifically required for numerous surgical and medical needs,"Guruge said.

German investor eager to pump Rs. 5 bn to bailout CIFL
Offers Bank Guarantee against CB loan
Vandell Financial Services SA, Germany and another foreign investor has expressed willingness to bail out the defunct Central Investment and Finance Co Ltd (CIFL).
The second investor yet to be named has been made a stand by, in case Vandell Financial Services withdraws its intent for CIFL.
In a stock market filing it has been stated that Vandell Financial Services has confirmed their willingness to offer a Bank Guarantee against a loan from the Central Bank and have requested the name of the beneficiary in whose name the Bank guarantee should be issued. We understand that the Central Bank has sought approval to accept a Bank guarantee instead of obtaining real estate as specified in the relevant legislation, the stock market filing said.Vandell has indicated that their delegation will visit Sri Lanka again once the confirmation of the loan is received.
Meanwhile, the Central Bank has referred another interested foreign Investor representative to CIFL who was provided with the basic information required for their due diligence after signing a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
We are awaiting the outcome from them as an alternative solution in case Vandell backs out.
With regard to Financial Statements, the draft audited financials for March 31, 2015, the Central Bank has not approved the draft audited financial statements submitted by KPMG. Vandell Financial Services SA, Germany visited Sri Lanka last year to study on the operations of CIFL and invest with the company. The German company according to an official from CIFL Depositors Association (CIFLDA), has indicated they are ready to invest upto Rs. 5 billion. They (Vendell) were also looking at paying 50% of deposits to depositors up front. The German company was also keen to invest in Sri Lanka in other areas of business investing a further Rs.1 billion including the North East.

As of December 2016, the public deposit liability stood at nearly Rs. 4 billion and there were over 4,000 depositors. CILF was initially registered as a public limited liability company on July 3, 1968. Subsequently it came under the ownership of Deepthi Perera of ASPIC Group in 2004. It became a public liability company in July 2011 and is currently listed on the CSE. (SS)

Government should probe alleged rights violations: Sampanthan
TNA Leader and Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan has pointed out that if Sri Lanka was given more time to act on the Resolution on alleged war crimes and human rights violations, the UN would have to subject Sri Lankas progress to the highest scrutiny.
He made this statement to the media when asked about Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweeras remarks that the country would make a submission to ask for more time to act on alleged war crimes and human rights violations at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva. The 34th UN Human Rights Council sessions are scheduled to take place from February 27 to 24 March. The government is trying to evade its responsibilities when it comes to investigating into alleged human rights violations and war crimes during the last phase of the war which is also against the accepted principles of Geneva,Sampanthan said and added that such acts by the government simply earned the government criticism and the displeasure of the Tamil people.

Government should take over SAITM: GMOA
Many persons who deposited money with Golden Key and Sakvithi died of heartbreak after been cheated of their life-savings. Similarly many parents of SAITM students too are undergoing the same trauma. Association (GMOA) Secretary, Dr. Navin de Zoysa said, "We cannot ignore the situation and turn a blind eye and let patients die from wrong treatment. We informed the President that SAITM should be taken over by the Government, Government Medical Officers," he said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA head quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Sri Lanka Medical Council can appeal to the Supreme Court on the SAITM judgement and other parties too can file cases. "The Presidential Committee is yet to be appointed."
There are about 900 students at SAITM and there are two groups of parents with two different opinions. We have to solve the SAITM issue before commencing the discussion on private medical colleges. We have to stop adding dirt to the existing mountain of dirt," said de Zoysa.
According to the GMOA Secretary, the `minimum quality' for medical education is not the best and highest quality. "The minimum quality only ensure the safety of patients' lives. It is the duty of the Health Minister to ensure the safety of patients who obtain health care services from Sri Lanka. The decision makers will obtain health care services from Singapore, but the poor people are the ones who have to suffer," he said.
"The globally accepted procedure of establishing private medical faculties is to set up a complete teaching hospital, followed by the medical faculty with all facilities and recruiting medical students is the final stage. But in Sri Lanka the procedure has been from the last step to the first," he said.
Dr. Zoysa pointed out that if an effective solution is not given in a week, the GMOA will resort to stern trade union action. The country will be educated on the issue.
The SLMC is a Technical Judiciary. If the Health Minister says the GMOA is not up to standard, his own standard stands questionable as he is also registered with the SLMC.
The SLMC was established through a Parliament Act passed in 1927 and 19th article has clearly vested power on the SLMC to regulate medical education institutions," he added.

HNB launches Smart Pay card for SL schools
HNB partnered with D.S. Senanayake College to launch Smart Pay, a revolutionary new proprietary card that will completely redesign payments and attendance recording in schools.
The official launch of HNB Smart Pay was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebrations of D. S. Senanayake College. Utilizing near-field communication (NFC) technology, HNB Smart Pay will enable students to simply tap their cards on specially designed devices placed strategically around the school to record their attendance each morning as they enter the school.
The 50th anniversary celebrations and Smart Pay launch event were graced by the presence the President Maithripala Sirisena and several other distinguished dignitaries.
The Smart Pay prepaid card - which is being made available to all students regardless of whether they own an HNB bank account, will also enable students to make digital payments within the school premises; from canteen purchases to buying textbooks and stationary supplies from the school bookshop and even covering payment of school fees.
HNB has long been a pioneer in the introduction of cutting-edge technology into the Sri Lankan banking industry. In that regard, the launch of HNB Smart Pay for schools is another bold step forward in our digital journey that we believe will empower school children by teaching them how to save and spend responsibly within a cashless payment ecosystem. We invite all of Sri Lanka's educational institutions to join hands with us on similar initiatives to make this technology-led vision a reality, HNB Chief Digital Officer, Sidath Wijeratne explained.
Designed in accordance with the most comprehensive international security standards and protocols, HNB Smart Pay card can be topped up at any HNB branch, through the bank's internet and mobile banking platforms, at HNB ATMs or at any of the HNB Point-of-Sales (POS) devices placed at strategic locations inside the school premises.
The topping up process for HNB Smart Pay was also designed with convenience in mind. Parents will receive automated notifications whenever the card runs low on funds and a further notification every time the card is topped up, thereby ensuring that parents have full visibility into their children's spending habits.
Notably, the Smart Pay card is also capable of linking with HNB Singithi savings accounts for children, enabling students to transfer any pocket money that they have saved up to their account, helping them to save more and win valuable prizes.
In developing HNB Smart Pay our goal above all else was to create a holistic solution capable of meeting the specific needs of a school environment on multiple levels and in that regard we are very proud of the results that we have achieved.
Through HNB Smart Pay, we have been able to offer a product that can help the school to track attendance and very soon, even monitor library book borrowing while at the same time, helping students to make payments quickly, easily and accurately, enabling them to make the most of their interval by wasting less time in the canteen. Since payments through the student card can only be made within the school premises, this also gives parents an added sense of security.
We are confident that this card will be the first step in bridging the digital divide in our schools and we therefore warmly invite all other schools to come on board with HNB Smart Pay. HNB Senior Manager - Card Centre, Roshantha Jayatunge said.

India launches record 104 satellites in single mission

India has created history by successfully launching 104 satellites on a single mission, overtaking the previous record of 37 satellites launched by Russia in 2014.
All but three of the satellites are from foreign countries, most of them from the United States.
The launch took place from the Sriharikota space centre in east India.
Observers say it is a sign that India is emerging as a major player in the multi-billion dollar space market.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate the scientists tweeting,
"This remarkable feat by @isro is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation. India salutes our scientists."
The phrase "world record" has also been trending on Twitter India for much of Wednesday morning.
Of the 104 small satellites, 96 belong to the United States while Israel, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and the Netherlands are the other foreign clients.
An Indian cartographic satellite, believed to be capable of taking high resolution images is also on board. It is expected to be used to monitor regional arch rivals Pakistan and China.
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the successful launch is yet another feather in the cap of India's ambitious space programme that has earned a reputation of offering a reliable low cost alternative to existing international players.
The Indian government has increased the budget for its space programme this year and also announced plans to send a mission to Venus.
Over the past two decades, India has become a key player in the lucrative commercial space market offering a low-cost alternative.

Capital Alliance (CAL), has created history by becoming the only broker to register an account digitally with the Colombo Stock Exchange for the first time in Sri Lanka.
This fills a major void that should have been attended two years ago by the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The digital signature process was legalised in 2006 but the CSE never made use of it.
The new digital technology enables digital sign on to all CALs financial services, the only one of its kind in the country.
CAL Group Managing Director and CEO Ajith Fernando said by enabling digital signatures for our services online, they have effectively created a new gateway for clients to trade online with minimal hassle.
This facility offers unparalleled ease-of-use and flexibility to our clients to conduct their transactions online, at their convenience, and in secure manner from anywhere, anytime.
He said that they hope attract around 20,000 new account by the end of this year.
Even Sri Lankans working overseas could now log in and create an account and this will create more accounts to the CSE.
This technology empowers customers to open an account by placing digital signatures while being anywhere in the world, thus doing away with paperwork. This innovation is yet another testimony of CALs commitment to deliver excellence in execution, world-class research and product innovation.
The entire digital signature process has been formulated in compliance with the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006. In rolling this out, CAL has partnered with eMudhra Ltd, which is a leading Certifying Authority in Asia and is a pioneer in e-Signatures, digital identity, and authentication solutions with marquee clients in BFSI (Banking, Financial services and Insurance) and various other sectors.We have invested around Rs. 30 million for this process, CAL CEO Harinlal Aturupane.
The system comprises of both automatic and manual verifications to ensure the authenticity of customers. There are some foolproof automatic validation measures that are inbuilt in the system in order to safeguard clients interest and data security. Last year Cal also launched an unique mobile application for trading CAL ONLINE, which provides access to real-time information on Equity and Debt markets and the ability to trade real-time in a seamless manner from mobiles or tablets.

LGBTIQ community asks govt. to reconsider decriminalising homosexuality
The LGBTIQ community of Sri Lanka has asked the government to reconsider decriminalizing homosexuality in Sri Lanka and recognize all its citizens as equals no matter their sexual orientation.
The Cabinet recently rejected draft proposals in the National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP) to repeal Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code which largely worked to perpetuate a cycle of violence against the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex, Questioning/Queer (LGBTIQ) community in Sri Lanka.
A collection of Sri Lankans identifying as LGBTIQ, held a media briefing to reiterate the need to repeal Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code which the government has pushed against citing cultural reasons.
We need to discuss what our culture really is, the hypocrisy through which we use it and who defines what culture is and should be, said Senior Lecturer, Open University, Dr Harini Amarasuriya addressing the media.
Culture is fluid and it changes with time as we become a more humane society. This is a good opportunity for us to highlight a more fundamental rights problem in our society and the question of whether all are equal before the law, she added.
Sections 365/365A prohibit carnal intercourse against the order of nature and acts if gross indecency and though it does not specify homosexuality, it is interpreted to mean so by law enforcement officers.
They say that you do not need to repeal the law because it is not enforced. But when you do not have proper enforcement or application of the law, it allows various parties to misinterpret it to their advantage, explained a member of the community, Vanadas Thyagarajah
What is natural or unnatural should be decided by medicine and not by culture, otherwise we are in grave danger of maintaining structural violence, he added.
Dr Dayanath Ranatunga, who sought to dispel myths surrounding homosexuality said, Science shows that humans have both heterosexual and homosexual tendencies and who you are attracted to depends on which is more dominant. But at times certain, people exhibit homophobia, because they fear that by accepting homosexuality, their own tendencies might come out.
In the 1990s, the American College of Psychiatrists decided that homosexuality was normal and not a deviation, while at the same time, the World Health Organization(WHO) whose standards we follow for all diseases, removed homosexuality from its Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders.
Thenu Ranken speaking on the difficulties faced by the community said, There is a certain frame society imposes on us and if we do not fit in, we are rejected. No one asks why we do not fit in.
Most have serious difficulties in receiving an education, work, housing and are isolated by family and friends.
Our society has to take responsibility for every murder and suicide of members of the community. This is not a choice, this is how we were born and it is not an infringement on anyones life, this is a very personal aspect of our lives, he said.
Madu Dissanayake, pointed out that given that the law criminalized LGBTIQ members, it made it harder for them to access to essential services.
Bhoomi Harendran, Human Rights and Transgender Activist said, When accessing services, in hospitals or courts, services should not be provided based on who that person loves or what is between his or her legs.

SAITM Private Medical Collage Parents Society President P.M.B.K.Thennakoon said they feel sad when they see their children study hard spending sleepless nights. Their marriages get delayed due to medical education. Efforts are being made to deprive them from getting the MBBS degree. They are waiting without achieving both goals, getting married and obtaining the MBBS degree, Thennakoon said.
Addressing a press conference at the BMICH, Colombo yesterday, he said that if anyone demands SAITM MBBS degree holders to sit for the Act 16 Examination, it will be a violation of their human rights. This examination is relevant only for foreign MBBS degree holders. There is no student among SAITM medical students, who does not have three simple passes at the A/L examination.
According to Thennakoon, there are about 300 students in the SAITM, who had been selected for state universities to follow other courses in the science stream except medicine. They did not go to state universities to follow degrees as they wanted to become doctors through the SAITM. In some state medical faculties, the subject `anatomy is handled by veterinary physicians. This is the standard of some state medical faculties, he said.
Thennakoon said the opportunity to receive education by paying money should not be blocked. All should respect the decision by the Court of appeal on the SAITM. Action should be taken against those do not respect the Judiciary. No one can call the SAITM `Hora Upadhi Kade (fake degree shop) as the Judiciary has accepted its legality.

Supply Chain Project  Management tips
More specifically, what is a project It's a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.A supply chain project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.
And a project is unique in that it is not a routine operation, but a specific set of operations designed to accomplish a singular goal. So a project team often includes people who don't usually work together - sometimes from different organizations and across multiple geographies.The development of software for an improved business process, the construction of a building or bridge, the relief effort after a natural disaster, the expansion of sales into a new geographic market - all are projects.
And all must be expertly managed to deliver the on-time, on-budget results, learning and integration that organization's needs.
Problems arise in every organization. Such problems as what products/systems to develop, should capacity be expanded, or should a computer be purchased are just a few of an endless number of continuing problems about which management must concern itself if the firm is to survive. These problems and their alternative solutions establish some elements of change around which the organization must adapt. Supply chain projects are generally established to carry out these changes and someone is always responsible for each project's successful completion.
Every project is unique in terms of the problems that arise, the priorities and resources assigned it, the environment in which it operates, and the project manager's attitude and style used to guide and control project activities. Therefore, the organizational structure for the project must be designed to fit within that project's operating constraints. The organizational structure implemented may not be the same structure used throughout the life cycle of the project due to changes in priorities, available resource, project personnel, laws, and other contingencies. Regardless of the project management structure chosen, management must realize that a dynamic state of equilibrium between limited personnel and financial resources and the objectives of the project will be necessary if project management is to be successful in their particular organization. Before touching on the major tools and techniques of project management, let's get to the bottom of what project management truly is. Later, it will list the benefits that the tools and techniques of project management bring to the systems analysis process.
Projects
Nearly every activity within an organization could be labeled as a project possessing unique characteristics and varying levels of importance to the organization. A project is defined as a planned undertaking of related activities to reach an objective that has a beginning and an end. All projects solve some type of problem, but projects may also be established simply to determine and define feasible alternative solutions to problems. Seven primary characteristics of a project include:
1. Objective: Each has a specific goal to reach.
2. Schedule: Point in time in which they must be accomplished.
3. Complexity: Does the technology exist to achieve the project objectives
4. Size and Nature of Task: Step-by-step plan of action.
5. Resources: Labor, personnel, equipment, materials, facilities, etc.
6. Organizational Structure: The meshing of project requirements into the existing organization.
7. Information and Control Systems: These must be structured to handle problems through the typical lines of authority.
Project Management
In the past, a company typically decided to undertake a project effort, assigned the project and the necessary resources to a carefully selected individual and assumed they were using some form of project management. Organizational implications were of little importance. Although the basic concepts of project management are simple, applying these concepts to an existing organization is not. Each task requires a particular mix of these tools and techniques structured to fit the task environment and life cycle (from conception to completion) of the task.
Employing project management technologies minimizes the disruption of routine business activities in many cases by placing under a single command all of the skills, technologies, and resources needed to realize the project. The skills required depend on each specific project and the resources available at that time. The greater the amount of adjustments a parent organization must make to fulfill project objectives, the greater chance exists for project failure. The form of project management will be unique for every project endeavor and will change throughout the project.
The supply chain project management process typically includes four key phases: initiating the project, planning the project, executing the project, and closing the project. An outline of each phase is provided below.
Initiating the Project -
The project management techniques related to the project initiation phase include:
1. Establishing the project initiation team. This involves organizing team members to assist in carrying out the project initiation activities.
2. Establishing a relationship with the customer. The understanding of your customer's organization will foster a stronger relationship between the two of you.
3. Establishing the project initiation plan. Defines the activities required to organize the team while working to define the goals and scope of the project.
4. Establishing management procedures. Concerned with developing team communication and reporting procedures, job assignments and roles, project change procedure, and how project funding and billing will be handled.
5. Establishing the project management environment and workbook. Focuses on the collection and organization of the tools that you will use while managing the project.
Planning the Project -
The project management techniques related to the project planning phase include:
1. Describing project scope, alternatives, and feasibility. The understanding of the content and complexity of the project. Some relevant questions that should be answered include:
What problem/opportunity does the project address
What results are to be achieved
What needs to be done
How will success be measured
How will we know when we are finished
2. Divide the project into tasks. This technique is also known as the work breakdown structure. This step is done to ensure an easy progression between tasks.
3. Estimating resources and creating a resource plan. This helps to gather and arrange resources in the most effective manner.
4. Developing a preliminary schedule. In this step, you are to assign time estimates to each activity in the work breakdown structure. From here, you will be able to create the target start and end dates for the project.
5. Developing a communication plan. The idea here is to outline the communication procedures between management, team members, and the customer.
6. Determining project standards and procedures. The specification of how various deliverables are produced and tested by the project team.
7. Identifying and assessing risk. The goal here is to identify potential sources of risk and the consequences of those risks.
8. Creating a preliminary budget. The budget should summarize the planned expenses and revenues related to the project.
9. Developing a statement of work. This document will list the work to be done and the expected outcome of the project.
10. Setting a baseline project plan. This should provide an estimate of the project's tasks and resource requirements.
Executing the Project -
The project management techniques related to the project execution phase include:
1. Executing the baseline project plan. The job of the project manager is to initiate the execution of project activities, acquire and assign resources, orient and train new team members, keep the project on schedule, and assure the quality of project deliverables.
2. Monitoring project progress against the baseline project plan. Using Gantt and PERT charts, which will be discussed in detail further on in this paper, can assist the project manager in doing this.
3. Managing changes to the baseline project plan.
4. Maintaining the project workbook. Maintaining complete records of all project events is necessary. The project workbook is the primary source of information for producing all project reports.
5. Communicating the project status. This means that the entire project plan should be shared with the entire project team and any revisions to the plan should be communicated to all interested parties so that everyone understands how the plan is evolving.
Closing down the Project - The project management techniques related to the project closedown phase include:
1. Closing down the project. In this stage, it is important to notify all interested parties of the completion of the project. Also, all project documentation and records should be finalized so that the final review of the project can be conducted.
2. Conducting post project reviews. This is done to determine the strengths and weaknesses of project deliverables, the processes used to create them, and the project management process.
3. Closing the customer contract. The final activity is to ensure that all contractual terms of the project have been met.
The techniques listed above in the four key phases of project management enable a project team to:
* Link project goals and objectives to stakeholder needs.
* Focus on customer needs.
* Build high-performance project teams.
* Work across functional boundaries.
* Develop work breakdown structures.
* Estimate project costs and schedules.
* Meet time constraints.
* Calculate risks.
* Establish a dependable project control and monitoring system.
Tools
Project management is a challenging task with many complex responsibilities. Fortunately, there are many tools available to assist with accomplishing the tasks and executing the responsibilities. Some require a computer with supporting software, while others can be used manually. Project managers should choose a project management tool that best suits their management style. No one tool addresses all project management needs. Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) and Gantt Charts are two of the most commonly used project management tools and are described below. Both of these project management tools can be produced manually or with commercially available project management software.
PERT is a planning and control tool used for defining and controlling the tasks necessary to complete a project. PERT charts and Critical Path Method (CPM) charts are often used interchangeably; the only difference is how task times are computed. Both charts display the total project with all scheduled tasks shown in sequence. The displayed tasks show which ones are in parallel, those tasks that can be performed at the same time. A graphic representation called a Project Network or CPM Diagram is used to portray graphically the interrelationships of the elements of a project and to show the order in which the activities must be performed
PERT planning involves the following steps:
1. Identify the specific activities and milestones. The activities are the tasks of the project. The milestones are the events that mark the beginning and the end of one or more activities.
2. Determine the proper sequence of activities. This step may be combined with #1 above since the activity sequence is evident for some tasks. Other tasks may require some analysis to determine the exact order in which they should be performed.
3. Construct a network diagram. Using the activity sequence information, a network diagram can be drawn showing the sequence of the successive and parallel activities. Arrowed lines represent the activities and circles or bubbles represent milestones.
4. Estimate the time required for each activity. Weeks are a commonly used unit of time for activity completion, but any consistent unit of time can be used. A distinguishing feature of PERT is its ability to deal with uncertainty in activity completion times. For each activity, the model usually includes three time estimates:
o Optimistic time - the shortest time in which the activity can be completed.
o Most likely time - the completion time having the highest probability.
o Pessimistic time - the longest time that an activity may take.
From this, the expected time for each activity can be calculated using the following weighted average:
Expected Time = (Optimistic + 4 x Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
This helps to bias time estimates away from the unrealistically short timescales normally assumed.
5. Determine the critical path. The critical path is determined by adding the times for the activities in each sequence and determining the longest path in the project. The critical path determines the total calendar time required for the project. The amount of time that a non-critical path activity can be delayed without delaying the project is referred to as slack time.
If the critical path is not immediately obvious, it may be helpful to determine the following four times for each activity:
ES - Earliest Start time
EF - Earliest Finish time
LS - Latest Start time
LF - Latest Finish time
These times are calculated using the expected time for the relevant activities. The earliest start and finish times of each activity are determined by working forward through the network and determining the earliest time at which an activity can start and finish considering its predecessor activities. The latest start and finish times are the latest times that an activity can start and finish without delaying the project. LS and LF are found by working backward through the network. The difference in the latest and earliest finish of each activity is that activity's slack. The critical path then is the path through the network in which none of the activities have slack.
The variance in the project completion time can be calculated by summing the variances in the completion times of the activities in the critical path. Given this variance, one can calculate the probability that the project will be completed by a certain date assuming a normal probability distribution for the critical path. The normal distribution assumption holds if the number of activities in the path is large enough for the central limit theorem to be applied.
6. Update the PERT chart as the project progresses. As the project unfolds, the estimated times can be replaced with actual times. In cases where there are delays, additional resources may be needed to stay on schedule and the PERT chart may be modified to reflect the new situation. An example of a PERT chart is provided below:
Benefits to using a PERT chart or the Critical Path Method include:
* Improved planning and scheduling of activities.
* Improved forecasting of resource requirements.
* Identification of repetitive planning patterns which can be followed in other projects, thus simplifying the planning process.
* Ability to see and thus reschedule activities to reflect interproject dependencies and resource limitations following know priority rules.
* It also provides the following: expected project completion time, probability of completion before a specified date, the critical path activities that impact completion time, the activities that have slack time and that can lend resources to critical path activities, and activity start and end dates.
Gantt charts are used to show calendar time task assignments in days, weeks or months. The tool uses graphic representations to show start, elapsed, and completion times of each task within a project. Gantt charts are ideal for tracking progress. The number of days actually required to complete a task that reaches a milestone can be compared with the planned or estimated number. The actual workdays, from actual start to actual finish, are plotted below the scheduled days. This information helps target potential timeline slippage or failure points. These charts serve as a valuable budgeting tool and can show dollars allocated versus dollars spent.
To draw up a Gantt chart, follow these steps:
1. List all activities in the plan. For each task, show the earliest start date, estimated length of time it will take, and whether it is parallel or sequential. If tasks are sequential, show which stages they depend on.
2. Head up graph paper with the days or weeks through completion.
3. Plot tasks onto graph paper. Show each task starting on the earliest possible date. Draw it as a bar, with the length of the bar being the length of the task. Above the task bars, mark the time taken to complete them.
4. Schedule activities. Schedule them in such a way that sequential actions are carried out in the required sequence. Ensure that dependent activities do not start until the activities they depend on have been completed. Where possible, schedule parallel tasks so that they do not interfere with sequential actions on the critical path. While scheduling, ensure that you make best use of the resources you have available, and do not over-commit resources. Also, allow some slack time in the schedule for holdups, overruns, failures, etc.
5. Presenting the analysis. In the final version of your Gantt chart, combine your draft analysis (#3 above) with your scheduling and analysis of resources (#4 above). This chart will show when you anticipate that jobs should start and finish. An example of a Gantt chart is provided below:
Benefits of using a Gantt chart include:
Gives an easy to understand visual display of the scheduled time of a task or activity.
Makes it easy to develop what if scenarios.
Enables better project control by promoting clearer communication.
Becomes a tool for negotiations.
Shows the actual progress against the planned schedule.
Can report results at appropriate levels.
Allows comparison of multiple projects to determine risk or resource allocation.
Rewards the project manager with more visibility and control over the project.
The Future
Project management tools have evolved from simple spreadsheet products to sophisticated, Web-based project information portals. The obvious trend in project management software, as with almost everything in information technology, is a move toward Web-based systems. Most project management tools can be accessed via browsers and those that do not currently have this capability are moving in that direction.
Project management tools continue to evolve in terms of capabilities and user interface. The general direction is toward more integrated process and knowledge management systems, and user interfaces with a Web look. Project management tools are gradually becoming integrated project information portals with capabilities far beyond simple project tracking and reporting.
As the sophistication of these products continues to grow, however, so too does their complexity. It is important for project management software vendors to keep things simple and easy to use. Project management tools should not become the focus of a project manager's life or add time to project activities. If a project manager has to spend too much time learning a product's features, their ability to actively manage the project process diminishes, totally defeating the purpose of the tool.

Turnbull talks border protection, economic development with PM Wickremesinghe

Aside from signing two new agreements, Turnbull said the two nations would continue to work together to help end the "scourge" of people smuggling.
Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said this on Wednesday when he met with his Sri Lankan counterpart Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to celebrate 70 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.
"The Australian and Sri Lankan navies have a strong and growing relationship with joint exercises and officer training," Turnbull said at a press conference in Canberra on Wednesday.
"We also have longstanding, close cooperation aimed at ending the scourge of people smuggling."
PM Wickremesinghe, when questioned about the high number of Sri Lankans who fled the country and attempted to come to Australia illegally by boat, said they were welcome to return despite breaking the law.
"They left Sri Lanka illegally. They are welcome to return to Sri Lanka and we won't prosecute them, so they can come back to Sri Lanka, and we will have them, but they broke the law in attempting to come to Australia," PM Wickremesinghe told the press on Wednesday.
Turnbull also took the opportunity to praise the strong bilateral relationship between the two nations, lauding cooperation in a number of key sectors.
"The Sri-Lankan Australian community has made an enormous contribution to Australia, the most successful multicultural society in the world. In fields as diverse as business, culture, education, law, medicine and sport and they are part of the bedrock on which our bilateral relationship is built," Turnbull said.
"We are also pleased to witness the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Sri Lanka and Australia to strengthen cooperation in sport."
"This will see exchanges of athletes, coaches, managers, health professionals, sports scientists and the sharing of anti-doping technology."
"Our close relationship and our many ties are only strengthened by our friendly competition on the cricket pitch, which we agreed was the only area in which we are rivalrous."
Premier Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka had no better friend than Australia, and said in addition to an agreement on sports, the leaders signed a deal regarding economic development as well.
"We signed two important agreements today, one on economic development, but that was not complete without the one on sports. So Sri Lanka and Australia have shared a common past," he said.
"There are many values we inherited from the British empire to which we added our own values, and Australia today is one of the leading members of the Asia-Pacific region."
"When we look to the future, we have no better friend than Australia."

Vasu welcomes Karuna Amman's new party
Welcoming the new party formed by Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday said he hoped the new political party will oppose the extremist politics practiced by certain Tamil politicians in the North and East.
Addressing a press briefing organised by the Socialist Alliance in Colombo, Nanayakkara noted that the new party should stand against extremist politics practiced by Northern Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran and certain other political leaders.
He suggested the new party should form closer links with the main stream political parties in the South and promote democratic values rather than pursuing the path of extremism.
Certain extremist Tamil politicians were conniving with foreign elements with vested interest, he said adding that the new party should deviate from this norm and promote reconciliation while standing for the rights of the Tamil speaking people.
The former LTTE leader turned Deputy Minister, recently formed a new party named the Tamil United Freedom Party in Batticaloa.
Muralitharan said his party will voice the concerns of Tamils in the North and East.
After the end of the war in 2009, Muralitharan joined the SLFP with a group of his supporters and was appointed as a Vice President of the SLFP by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
