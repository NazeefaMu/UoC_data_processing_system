Following on, Dujon made 5 in the second innings, but England ended up winning the match by 5 wickets.

SHIVNARINE CHANDERPAUL OUT FOR 0 IN LAST MATCH

Eating disorders, figure skating's 'dirty little secret'
Gangneung, Friday: Four years ago, Russia's Yulia Lipnitskaya had the world at her 15-year-old feet, before the ground crumbled beneath them.
The figure skater had emerged as one of the golden athletes of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, enchanting her audience to win the team title -- and a very public bear hug from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
But during the Pyeongchang Winter Games, Lipnitskaya is back home in Russia, her skates gathering dust, after she retired in September due to health issues related to anorexia. Eating disorders have been described as "skating's dirty little secret" -- partly because sufferers usually strive to keep their problem well hidden.
Canada's Gabrielle Daleman said she received messages from many other skaters when she opened up about her own problems.
"I don't know if it's the sport or if it's just the way people look at themselves," the 20-year-old told AFP.
"I just wasn't happy with the way I was looked, from being bullied (at school) and everything, I was getting criticised.
"I tried to look a certain way what people wanted me to look, rather than just feel good about myself. So that's something I've learned over the past year." Daleman, who finished 15th in the women's singles in Pyeongchang, said her eating disorder started at school, where she was bullied over a learning disability. "I got a lot of messages from other skaters. Ashley Cain messaged me, Gracie (Gold) messaged me, Evgenia Medvedeva messaged me. -AFP

Election results a warning, not a refusal of UNP: Minister Harrison
The results of the recently concluded Local Government election is an encouragement for the United National Party (UNP) to move forward with courage, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said.
He was addressing a meeting of the National Post and Telecommunication Workers Union in Colombo yesterday.
The Minister added that the people have given a red light to the government through the LG election. With the election results, the UNP is duty bound to convert the red light to a green light. However, the election results cannot be considered a refusal but a warning, he said.
This is only a warning. We should be modest to understand it and to work hard to change the red light to a green light, he added.
According to him, people have forgotten the dark era, in which most of the rights of the people were deprived.
There was no media freedom unlike today. If one wrote anything against the government, that person would be assaulted, abducted or killed.
But under this government, no media institutions are torched, no media persons are attacked or abducted or killed. Media institutions are not controlled by Temple Trees now as it was during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
Speaking on the postal service employees, the Minister said that the government will address their issues promptly.
International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe addressing the gathering said that a significant volume of development activities had taken place throughout the country. But the people are not aware of those progressive activities taking place due to the failures of the communication mechanism. This situation may have affected the election results, he said.
The State Minister added that if there is a pure UNP government, the country would achieve a significant progress.
He also said that a majority of the people have forgotten that there was no law or democracy in the country during the last regime.
He added that 100 Japanese companies are commencing their businesses in the production zone, scheduled to be set up on a 400-acre land in Kalutara.
Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Ministry R.M. D.B. Meegasmulla said that the postal service should be streamlined so as to suit the needs of society. The postal service cannot be limited to the delivery of letters. Then the services of the postal serve should be widened to meet the requirements of the ever advancing society. Post offices should also be subjected to a radical change to meet the public aspirations.
Post Master General Rohana Abeyratne said that the postal service marked a seven percent increase in the annual income.
The postal service should develop as a global service. So far, we considered the challenges within the country. But we have to focus on competing with global trends, he said.

PM tells group of ministers, deputy ministers:
Govt. will fulfil people's mandate
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government will focus on the amendments that need to be brought in while working within the mandate given to it by the people.
He stressed that they needed to work within the mandate given to them by the people and discuss the type of amendments that need to be brought in, the speed in which they have to be implemented, look at their mistakes and shortcomings and plan what action needs to be taken immediately.
We need to focus on the Local Government election results, correct our mistakes and shortcomings and take steps to fulfil the aspirations of the people, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, made these observations after a meeting at Temple Trees yesterday, with a team of UNP ministers and deputy ministers to discuss the way forward for the country and look at what needs to be done during the tenure of the government.
He asked that the team hand in a report of suggestions and ideas of the projects that need to be implemented and the initiatives taken.
Ministers Sajith Premadasa, Harin Fernando, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Naveen Dissanayake and Sagala Ratnayaka and Deputy Ministers Harsha de Silva and Ajith P. Perera and State Minister Eran Wickremaratne were present at the discussions held at Temple Trees.
The Local Government election results have clearly shown that the public is not pleased with the programme that we have implemented so far. In many countries around the world, such elections are held to feel the pulse of the people.
To see whether the people support the governments programme or not, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe observed.
It is not that we have done nothing with our time but that we cannot be satisfied with the speed of implementation of our programmes whilst other plans have had issues, the Prime Minister added.
The meeting not only discussed the future course of action of the government but also that of the United National Party. The Prime Minister further noted that as they successfully take forward the programmes of the government, within the UNP, they were committed to create a new generation of leaders.
This generation of leaders would be among the ministers, Members of Parliament, Local Government members as well as within the party membership itself, he said.
I have brought you all together here to discuss whether we should embark on a radical path in future, the Prime Minister said.
Traditionally, this reform process is done by the Seniors, the Prime Minister noted but this time, as they were going to create a new generation of leaders, I have entrusted the duty of putting forward suggestions for reform to you, you who will take the party forward in future.
This is just a part of the new journey the UNP will take, the Premier added and promised to appoint a team to look into the party restructuring process next week.
I hope to complete the process within a month, the Premier added.
The Prime Minister also explained that he would discuss the report put forward by the ministers with the President and other ministers and take action thereafter.

The home and home match and polls results
Causes for the Unity Governments defeat at the local government elections are still being dissected by the pundits. Some attribute the loss to electorates backlash on the government, in the form of a protest vote, over the high cost of living, while others ascribe it to the fallout from the bond issue. There are others who put forward the gross neglect of farmers and peasants as reasons while some are of the view that waste and profligacy such as in the purchase of luxury vehicles for government ministers had turned the voter- especially the middle class - away from the ruling alliance. The other school of thought advanced is that the threat of a division of the country, dinned into the public, effectively, by the Joint Opposition, through the introduction of the new constitution, had its impact on the voter, in the south. Equally, others simply attribute the outcome to the Mahinda factor.
However, Cabinet spokesman, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne thinks different. Addressing the post Cabinet media briefing, the minister said that he was of the view that the home and home match between the partners of the alliance government contributed in large measure for the voters reacting as they did. He said this was the first election in post independence history where an alliance governing the country kept on attacking each of their partners during an election campaign. He said one of the main reasons for the defeat of the UNP and SLFP at the recent LG polls was the two parties trading various allegations. This led to the loss of lots of votes for both the UNP and SLFP, he opined. He further went on to say that the damning accusations hurled at each other on the campaign trail, by both parties, in their bid to harness the maximum votes, boomeranged on both. The people made up their minds from what they were hearing that the UNP, SLFP and the Podujana Peramuna consist of rogues. Hence they would vote for Mahinda Rajapaksa because he, at least, won the war.
Minister Dr. Senaratne is not off the mark in his assertion. The UNP and SLFP MPs were at each others jugular from the very inception and not just during the election campaign. The alliance partners were talking at cross purposes and contradicting each other in their numerous utterances before the TV mikes. Matters only came to head during the polls campaign.
Clearly the wrong signals were sent to the voting public. The impression created was that of a government in drift, with those at the levers of power not in control. Things did not help when both sides started accusing each other of being rogues. This clearly detracted from the more serious accusations made against the Rajapaksas and their associates. Rajapaksas crimes were yet to be proven but here they were confronted with a situation where the President, no less, was coming out openly to claim that there were big time rogues in his government. ape aanduweth loku horu innawa. There was little doubt as to whom these remarks were aimed at. Not to be outdone, the UNP too started turning its guns on the President. The voters were confused and voted for the lesser evil, against whom charges were yet to be proved, while, in the governments case, the accusations had a ring of truth in it, what with the President, no less, spilling the beans.
For all intents and purposes, the alliance partners, UNP and SLFP/ UPFA, were campaigning in a vacuum, not complementing each other, which also went onto portray a picture of instability.
Blunders were also not in short supply. Suspending Brigadier Priyankara Fernando, our Defence attache in London, for reacting inappropriately to a group of pro-LTTE demonstrators, opposite Sri Lankas High Commission building, by the Foreign Ministry, was seized upon with glee by the Joint Opposition, to make maximum political capital out of the episode. The Presidents subsequent cancellation of the suspension only made matters worse, betraying the contradictions within the Yahapalanaya government nay, a breakdown in the administration. Of course the spate of strikes, failure to resolve the SAITM issue, doctors trade union action, the fuel crisis, the unresolved garbage problem, all combined to conspire against the government, that reflected in the results of the LG elections.
Be that as it may, with the Unity Government now firmly re-established, it behoves on the alliance partners to end their bickering and work for the common good of the country. All right thinking members of the public are of the view that the coming together of the once arch political foes was the best thing that happened to the country in its post independence history. These segments, no doubt, will want the status quo to continue, in the name of stability. The dark pall that hung over the country following announcement of the LG polls result is gradually being dispelled, with the PM and UPFA General Secretary announcing the Unity Government would stay put. It is the responsibility of all to ensure it continues for the rest of its duration.

India-bound gas pipeline breaks ground on Afghan section
TURKMENISTAN: Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India on Friday ceremonially broke ground on the Afghan section of an ambitious, multi-billion dollar gas pipeline expected to help ease energy deficits in South Asia.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Turkmen counterpart Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov joined Pakistani Premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and India's External Affairs Minister Shri M. J. Akbar for the ceremony at gas-rich Turkmenistan's border with Afghanistan.
Dignitaries including diplomats from the foreign missions in Turkmenistan were greeted by Turkmen national songs and traditional nomadic tents serving up food on an overcast day at the border post of Serkhetabat, once the southernmost tip of the Soviet Union.
Speaking at the ceremony, Ghani said the pipeline would unite (the) countries in quotes translated into Russian for reporters at the ceremony.
There were pessimistic voices, but now we are witnessing the construction of the TAPI gas pipeline, said Ghani, using the acronym for the conduit which takes its name from the four countries.
The quartet aims to complete the 1,840-kilometre (1,143-mile) pipeline and begin pumping natural gas from Turkmenistan's giant Galkynysh gas field by the beginning of 2020.
While the pipeline will traverse war-wracked Afghanistan, raising security concerns, the bulk of the 33 billion cubic metres of gas to be pumped annually through the conduit will be purchased by South Asian rivals Pakistan and India.
Turkmen strongman Berdymukhamedov, whose country currently depends heavily on China as a market for its natural gas exports, called diversification of gas deliveries an important part of the politics of the isolated Central Asian country. And he said work on the Turkmen section of the pipeline was still ongoing.
India's commitment to the pipeline has previously been questioned over its relationship with Pakistan and easy-access to liquified natural gas markets seen as potential stumbling blocks.
But its external affairs minister hailed the project as a symbol of our goals and a new page in cooperation between the four countries in a speech at the ceremony Friday.
The overall funding picture for the mammoth gas pipeline remains unclear, with commercial energy giants such as France's Total failing to follow up on reported interest in the project.
Turkmenistan sits on the world's fourth-largest gas reserves but lost a major buyer in Russia after Russian energy giant Gazprom wound down imports of Turkmen gas and then ceased purchases completely in 2016.- AFP

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Navy will be in rough seas against Kandy
Where others have failed this season, can the Sri Lanka Navy succeed In Sundays Clifford Cup final against Kandy The Sailors would cherish to become the first team to conquer Kandy SC who are unbeaten this season in the league as well as the knockouts but it wont be an easy task. The Kandy SC team who knows how to win matches will be at full throttle and will want to preserve the winning record which means so much to them. Kandy SC will play their usual hard game of rugby to pocket this title as well for another year. Theyve been through a kind of training that would not be out of place in the final tomorrow. The Sailors are likely to find most of their problems coming from up-front where Kandy SC has shown tremendous fire. The young, fit and willing Kandy SCs pack can push the strong Sailors act to breaking point with their fierce loose play and possession of the ball. It had been this factor that has taken the wind out of most of the sails of clubs. And their halves combination is excellent, and the centers, wingers and the fullback are in top form.
For the Sailors their back division is going to have a hard evening. Aware the Sri Lanka Navys scoring strength lies in the back division, Kandy SC will undoubtedly throw a net round them. However, it will not be an easy tactic to see through. Kandy SCs cover defense is the best seen this season. A marked characteristic is that there is a back-up-bridge of at least three forwards when their outsides are going up tackle their man.
As long as the ball is kept on the ground in straight forward rucks Kandy SC forwards can successfully initiate second phase attacks through their linkman. Tomorrow a mixed convoy of vans, jeeps, buses and cars will travel down to Colombo, carrying the fans, led by Kandy Faa. Kandy SC has won the Clifford Cup a record 21 times, including a consecutive period of ten years between 1995 and 2005 (the competition was not held in 1998) and six consecutive years between 2007 and 2012.
In 2006 Kandy SC and Navy SC both withdrew from the tournament (Kandy due to a dispute over the ground allocation and Navy as their members were called up for national service duty).
CR & FC have won it 14 times, including a tie with Dimbulla ACC, Havelock SC have won it 13 times including a tie with Police SC, Police SC 8 times with ties against Havelock SC and Army SC, CH & FC 7 times, Dimbulla A & CC twice including a tie with CR & FC, Army SC twice with one tie with Police SC and Air Force SC and Navy SC once each.
Rajans first win of the season
Dharmaraja gained their first victory for the season when they defeated St Sylvesters by 6 wickets. St Sylvesters 141 and 128. Rajans 130 and 142 for 4 wickets.

No improvement in anti-corruption moves: TI
Sri Lanka has made no significant improvement in its perceived levels of public sector corruption, according to Transparency Internationals 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranking of 180 countries released yesterday.
While the country has moved up 4 places, from 95th to 91st, its CPI score has only risen by two points, from 36 to 38, which Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) says represents a slow rate of progress.
A close analysis of Sri Lankas positioning in the CPI from 2012 to 2017 shows that despite institutional strengthening of anti-corruption agencies following the 19th Amendment, consistent failure in implementation has led to very limited progress, said TISL Executive Director Asoke Obeyesekere at a press conference held Thursday for this years CSI launch.
For any change in score to be considered significant, it requires typically a change of 6 points. That is a global measure. But [this year] we have seen a two point increase, he added.
Sri Lanka has failed to show such progress in its CPI score for each of the past five years.
Citizens still face corruption when trying to avail of essential public services, ranging from waste collection to school enrollment. Therefore, the limited change in the perception of public sector corruption reflects the limited change experienced by people in their everyday encounters with the state.
The index uses a point scale of zero to 100, where zero is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. This year, explained Obeyesekere, more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50. Sri Lanka, with a score of 38, fell below the international average of 43, and below the Asia-Pacific regional average of 44.
Compared to other SAARC member countries, Sri Lanka ranks third, following Bhutan with a score of 67 and India with a score of 40.

Honouring D R Wijewardene:
Patriot, iconic entrepreneur
There is nothing more touching than the sight of a nation in search of its great men, nothing more beautiful than its readiness to accept a hero on trust.
- James Russell Lowell (1819-1891) American Poet, Critic, Diplomat.
Yielding to an age old, deeply entrenched tradition, we tend to record the memory of certain events and individuals. The stark assumption on such an occasion is that, those events and individuals, are no longer around and that they have passed away  either a long time ago or fairly recently.
But, when we think about events organised in memory of an exceptional phenomenon of the calibre of the illustrious D R Wijewardene, we cannot help but feel, that a fresh formula is called for.
The formidable aura of influence, that illustrious D R Wijewardene has left us, still remains a pulsating and living legacy.
His multifaceted contribution, has turned out to be unageingly contemporary.
Early in his youth, he espoused the cause of National Independence, totally discarding the pursuit of personal and private goals. Wide avenues were open to him to amass a comfortable fortune, if that was the goal he set for himself.
Instead he opted for the risky search for National Independence. Even a slight mis-step in that danger-fraught arena, would have elicited the wrath of touchy colonial powers, leading invariably either to incarceration or death.
While at his academic pursuits in London, he was propelled by a hidden agenda and a prioritized mission. Both those were unerringly directed at one specific goal  the promotion of the cause of National Independence.
Historical Lion Flag
In the course of this unswerving commitment, he achieved a singularly serendipitous victory'.
He discovered the historical Lion Flag, which was brought down in March 1815, to enable the hoisting of the British Union Jack.
This historical treasure was found in a closet in the Royal Hospital at Cholsea of all the places.
How this precious historical object found its way into this strange location, is an utterly intriguing puzzle. Incidentally, as strange twists in history would have it, it was this Lion Flag that became the First National Flag of Independence Sri Lanka (the Ceylon).
Although he was very much at the centre of the struggle for National Independence, he never wanted any post or privileged place, for himself.
Even the founding of the Publishing House, was, in reality, an extension of the struggle for independence.
He was convinced, far sighted by, that only people blessed with knowledge will be the truest inheritors of independence. His intention was to present to the masses of this independent land, a series of publications that would enrich their wisdom, enabling them to arrive at right and proper choices.
Firmly guided by this humane and noble vision, he established Lake House.
Under his meticulous supervision and unrelaxed discipline, Lake House achieved the stature of an exemplary entrepreneurial institution in Sri Lanka.
On one recent occasion this is how I summed up this unique organisational development.
Returning home from oversees, young D R established a newspaper publishing domain. He was fully convinced, that, information and proper knowledge should constitute the two staple assets of a truly independent nation. A well informed nation equipped with pragmatic wisdom will be the enlightened citizens, who could be trusted to make the right choices for the people and the land.
Lake House publications
As a trend-setting institution, Lake House has continued to flourish over the years, because the total establishment reflected the highly impressive austere ways of the remarkable founder.
As has been emphasised, over and over again, of the young scholar coming home, was bent primarily on making money, he could have almost effortlessly achieved that individualistic goal. But, he always, thought beyond that target and dedicated himself to the well-being of the land of his birth.
His personal discipline was astonishing. He was so keen that he never allowed either his photograph or any written reference to him to appear in Lake House publications. His citadel earned an exquisite reputation as a highly impressive centre of discipline, orderliness and total dedication to service. It exuded such allure, that even some new graduates preferred employment at Lake House to State Administrative Service.
Lake House, has been a trail blazer in the introduction of state of the art technologies. The Crabtree Rotary, set up to facilitate speedy printing is a tribute to his far-sightedness.
An area that remains largely forgotten is the role played by the D R Centre, to produce generation after generation of writers, administrations, scholars, who are foremost among the intellectual elites of Sri Lanka.
These traditions and processes initiated by this great personality keep on thriving fully supporting the statement that he is still a living and pulsating presence.
But, so far, the Mother Land, for whose independence he bought had and sacrificed much, has not paid him the tribute of the production of a definitive biography.
It is time that all right thinking people thought about filling this hiatus, without much loss of time. DR is, undoubtedly an unfading presence.

PMD to buy 10,000 MT of paddy from Anuradhapura
Although the Maha season paddy harvesting is in progress in the Anuradhapura district, the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has not commenced purchasing paddy yet competitively with the private sector. However, the PMB had planned to buy 10,000 MT of paddy from the Anuradhapura district.
This is due to the Maha paddy cultivation had been limited due to the drought in Anuradhapura.
The raw Nadu variety is bought at Rs. 38 to 39 per kilo whereas raw Samba is bought at Rs. 49 - 50 on the spot. Harvesting is in progress in the Kahatagasdigiliya, Horowpothana, Kekirawa, Galnewa and Eppawala areas.
Anuradhapura PMB Regional Manager Nimal Tennakoon said they have requested the government through the Anuradhapura government agent to provide Rs. 350 million to purchase paddy.
This situation might change and the private sector traders will exploit the situation by buying paddy at low prices. We, the PMB, are ready to prevent such a situation aiming to open purchasing centres in the Bulnewa, Galnewa, Thambuttegama, Nochchiyagama, Katiyawa, Rajangane, Thalawa and Kekirawa areas in the Mahaweli H Zone where paddy is grown in around 27,000 hectares.
However, we are ready to open 28 purchasing centres depending on the paddy inflow to the market. We buy Nadu at Rs. 38 per kilo and Samba at Rs. 41 per kilo.
Thus, we are not allowing paddy prices to drop than that limit, the Regional Manager emphasized.

The politics of coalition in survival mode
As we approach the end of two weeks after the recent Local Government poll there is a motley of political developments that point to somewhat receding divisions within the ruling coalition of the UNP and SLFP-UPFA, and strategic thinking among the SLPP aimed at the longer goals of electoral success in the future.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, informed Parliament that National Government  which brought the UNP and UPFA together by the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of September 3, 2015, remains valid, and the National Government is in place. This followed questions raised with the Speaker by members of the Opposition  those of the Joint Opposition and the JVP leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, regarding the lack of validity of the MoU, not been extended beyond its two year term. The two statements from the UNP leader and the UPFA General Secretary sought to clear the doubts expressed to the Speaker by the Opposition, and convey the message that the post-Local Government election differences between the two parties of the ruling coalition, had not led to a breakdown of this political and governing relationship.
The continuing validity of this MoU is important in the context of the structure of the government, especially the size of the Cabinet, because the absence of a Government of National Unity would mean there could only be 30 Cabinet Ministers, and reducing the number of Deputy Ministers and State Ministers. While Parliament is given this assurance, there remains an area of doubt, in view of reports that President Sirisena has sought the opinion of the Supreme Court on the status of the agreement on unity.
The statement to Parliament by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe underscored the constitutionality of the present position, stating the MoU was signed in keeping with provision 46(4) of the Constitution, as amended, and submitting such documents of agreement between parties in the House, to Parliament, is not mandatory. This position on constitutionality was similar to the position the Prime Minister took last Friday, when he told the media that he remained as Prime Minister under the provisions of the Constitution, when there were strong demands, both by the SLFP and SLPP for his removal from office, and such demands appeared to affected President Sirisena, leading to concerns about the unity of the coalition.
Reports of a Cabinet reshuffle have not materialized at the time this is written on Thursday (when the shakeup was due), and it appears the coalition of unity would continue; causing major issues to members of the UPFA-SLFP within it. They were among the loudest calling for the removal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, after the local polls, which was a continuance of the campaign of attack against the UNP and its leader by the UPFA-SLFP Ministers during the local poll campaign, more than echoing attacks at the UNP and its leadership by President Sirisena himself. It certainly gives the impression that the UPFA-SLFP voices in this anti-UNP and anti-Ranil campaign are not aware of constitutional realities, which came about through the 19th Amendment, adopted with their support. Most of the UPFA-SLFP Ministers display a great liking for their former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR), who now leads the SLPP in substance, and show a major display of constitutional ignorance and political unreality, which does not seem wholly acceptable to MR himself, in the context of future politics.
Harsh realities
Had the National Unity coalition collapsed as the SLFP Ministers and activists campaigned for, the ability of the UNP to form even a minority government, with support on an issue basis with the TNA, Muslim parties, and even the JVP, would mean reduction of the Cabinet to 30 members and the complete elimination of UPFA-SLFP members. If some UPFA ministers cross over to support PM Wickremesinghe and the UNP, as things were evident, the loud and screaming SLFPers would have little choice but to be independent members of the Opposition, This is certainly not the stuff they bargained for, when they abandoned Mahinda Rajapaksa, after the August 2015 General Election, and responded to President Sirisenas call for a National Government, with all the perks and privileges of ministerial office. The reality of politics has certainly dealt a harsh blow on these leapfrogging players of the blue camp.
The SLPP that won so hugely in the Local Poll, to control the vast majority of local bodies, continues its own call to be the leading party of the Opposition, with Mahinda Rajapaksa himself as the Leader of the Opposition. This goes beyond the earlier call for the Joint Opposition (JO) to be the main opposition in parliament, claiming to have the largest number of opposition members in Parliament. This is indeed a major fallacy, which does not take note of parliamentary tradition, and the realities of the SLPPs recent electoral success.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, with his considerable experience in parliamentary politics would no doubt make a good Leader of the Opposition. But, both he and the JO members in parliament are not members of any parliamentary opposition. All of them won as candidates of the UPFA at the August 2015 General Election. The leader of the UPFA-SLFP at that election was President Maithripala Sirisena, who in fact said before the election that he would not recommend MR to be Prime Minister, if the UPFA obtained a majority of seats. The UNP obtained the majority of 106 seats, and the UPFA was many seats behind the 113 needed for a majority in the 225 member House.
The memories of those in the JO, and now the SLPP claimants, have certainly shut down the reality that the UPFA, led by President Sirisena joined the UNP, with the MoU of September 2015 to form the government of National Unity. All JO (or now SLPP claimed members) remain in the UPFA, that is part of the Government, and its leader, President Sirisena chairs Cabinet meetings. So, how can the JO or SLPP members claim any status as Opposition members or the office of Leader of the Opposition
The TNA became the main Opposition party because it was the party with the largest number of opposition members, just like the TULF became the official opposition party after the JR Jayewardene UNP landslide victory in 1977.
The JO members, who are making loud noises about it being the formal and largest Opposition, would have to resign from the SLFP or UPFA, and declare their new party allegiance to Parliament, to be considered a separate Opposition party. This is true for Mahinda Rajapaksa, too. Of course they are no doubt aware of the dangers of resigning from the party they were elected to parliament from, and declaring a new party allegiance, because this could lead to expulsion from Parliament. This is the harsh reality.
Or else, there must be a calculation to remove the leadership of the SLFP and UPFA, leading to a new Rajapaksa leadership there, which could be the stuff of later politics, considering the massive defeat suffered by the SLFP in the recent local poll, and the longer goals of the SLPP.
A timely warning
TNA and Opposition Leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan has certainly given an important warning to the SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksa not to use the resounding majority it got in the Local Government poll, to raise issues of communalism, especially with regard to the threat of Eelam, as seen in the campaign of MR and the key SLPP players in the recent election.
He has made it very clear the result of the recent poll, where the SLPP won 44.69 % of votes polled, and all parties opposed to the SLPP  UNP UPFA  SLFP  JVU  polled 55.31% of votes, have clearly showed the result as not being that of a referendum for the SLPP.
In this context, considering the anti-Tamil minority and anti-federal slogans used by the SLPP during the campaign to vote for the Pohottuva against an Eelam, he warns could lead to new ethnic tensions in the country. He said the SLPP propaganda was malicious, vicious, fallacious ad false and cautioned that if you proceed with this agenda, I want to tell you, Eelam will bloom, not on account of us, but on account of your Lotus Bud. Your Lotus Bud will bloom into an Eelam. That is what will happen. Therefore, please resist your temptation to achieve cheap political gain by carrying on such false propaganda.
One does recall that in his first media comment after the SLPP won the poll; Mahinda Rajapaksa did look at the purple spread on the map hanging behind him and said the size of Eelam had been reduced. This shows the Eelam issue and the campaign against a new Constitution were key factors in the SLPP campaign. This was clearly beyond the purpose of the election, which was to elect Local Government bodies. As the politics of this poll settles down, one must hope that racism is not given new opportunities to bloom, through the longer political goals of the SLPP.

Commissioner General of Examinations B. Sanath Pujitha has sent a circular to all government and
private school heads asking them to get National Identity Cards (NICs) for the students who are to sit for the GCE (A/L) and (O/L) Examinations this year in August and December.
Many students and parents were reported to have undergone much inconvenience in previous years at the last moment as certain school heads had not taken steps to get NICs for their students in advance.
The Department has decided that A/L students should produce their NICs at examination centres to prove their identity to do away with possible frauds at examination centres in 2018.
A senior school principal in Kurunegala told Daily News that 25 mobile service programmes are to be held by the Department of Registration of Persons for students to get NICs in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province in 2018.

SA female cricketer does what 4064 international men cricketers couldnt do
South African female cricket Chloe Tryon achieved an unprecedented feat during the first T20 against India at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom last Tuesday even though she could not end up on the winning side.
The 24-year-old South African played a scintillating innings of 32 runs in just seven deliveries at the fag end of their innings. During that six-minute inning, Tryon hit four sixes and two boundaries and could not score off just one delivery.
What makes the innings even more remarkable is the strike rate. Tryons runs came at a strike rate of 457.14 and if we talk of innings played of over 25 runs, Tryons strike rate is one of a kind in international cricket.
According to statistician Mohandas Menon, 4064 men have played international cricket till February 14, 2018 and none of those men have played an international innings with a strike as high as Tryons.
In 2007, Dwayne Smith hit 29 off nine deliveries in a T20 match against Bangladesh at a strike rate of 414.28. He had struck four sixes and a boundary in that innings.
Despite Tryons record-breaking innings, South Africa lost the match by seven wickets, thanks to Mithali Rajs 54 not out.
Chasing 164/4, Mithali got good support from Veda Krishnamurthy (37 not out), Jemimah Rodriques (37) and opener Smriti Mandhana (28) as India overhauled the target with 1.1 overs and seven wickets to spare.
Mithali struck her 11th fifty in T20I cricket. Her unbeaten 54 came from 48 deliveries, out of which six went for fours and one went over the rope.
In the South African innings, captain Dane van Niekerk (38), Tryon (32 not out) and Mignon du Preez (31) contributed with crucial knocks. They were assisted by Nadine de Klerk (23 not out), Lizelle Lee (19) and Sune Luus (18).
For India, off-spinner Anuja Patil picked up two wickets, while medium pacers Shikha Pandey and Pooja Vastrakar got a wicket each.
Earlier, Jhulan Goswami had been ruled out of the five-match T20I series against South Africa due to a heel injury.  Indiatoday

Son of former Pakistan cricketer commits suicide
Mohammad Zaryab, the Pakistani cricketer, has committed suicide after being dropped from Karachi U19 team. He was the son of the former cricketer of the country Amir Hanif who represented Pakistan in five One-Day Internationals in the 1990s.
Zaryab was a talented batsman and was expecting a call-up to the side for the upcoming tournament. However, he was dropped by the selectors citing that he was over-aged for the U19 cricket.
The youngster was left heartbroken over his expulsion from the team and hanged himself to death. Zaryab was the first-year student at a college and the oldest son of Hanif. He recently represented Karachi in a U19 cricket tournament in Lahore.
Though he was sent back home due to an injury with an assurance from the coaches that he would be selected again according to reports, Mohammad Zaryab had resisted the move of him being sent back home as the injury to him was not so serious.
The father of the cricketer and the former Pakistan cricketer Amir Hanif confirmed the news of his dejected son committing suicide after not being selected in the U19 team. He claimed that the coaches in the team had pressurised Zaryab a lot while he was in the team and this is what has forced to kill himself.
My son was pressurised, he was told he was over-age. The coaches behaviour towards him forced him (to kill himself), he said according to Pakistan Today.
Hanif also urged that steps should be taken in order to save the lives of other budding cricketers in the country.
My son was disappointed with the attitude of the coaches. We should take steps to save others sons, he added.
According to the official website of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Mohammad Zaryabs current age is 18 years and 158 days and by no means he was overage to play in the U19 team. The funeral prayers of the deceased was offered on Tuesday.

Udayanga on the run, passports impounded in Dubai
Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga and his wife are reportedly on the run after Sri Lankan authorities had taken measures to have a red warrant issued against him.
However, a source closely associated with this investigation said he did not have a passport as his passport had been impounded by the Dubai Police.
Responding to posts by Weeratunge on social media, stating that there is no red alert issued against him, this legal source said, From last year INTERPOL does not display the red alerts on their website due to various human rights issues.Therefore, although the red notice is issued for his arrest, it is not displayed on the INTERPOL website. The team from Sri Lanka went to Dubai and extensive discussions were held with the Dubai authorities.Udayanga Weeratunga had also been questioned at length by the Dubai authorities and released on the assurance that he would not leave the country and that he would make himself available for questioning when required by the Sri Lankan authorities.
However, after the red alert was issued and the Sri Lankan authorities had obtained a warrant for his arrest, he was asked to report to them for a statement. However, he had not reported to the Dubai Police and has been on the run, together with his wife. It is also evident that if he is to leave the country, he has to take the sea route, which is risky. But the source said he may even try to escape that way. However his escape is not going to be easy.
Meanwhile, issuing a statement yesterday, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said Weeratunga still has the opportunity to return to Sri Lanka and present himself to the court in order to prove his innocence, instead of making statements on social media.
The Police Spokesman said, Weeratunga is a citizen of Sri Lanka.Therefore he must respect and adhere to the laws of this country. Instead of declaring his innocence through social media, he has the opportunity to return to Sri Lanka and prove his innocence before a court of law.The Sri Lankan Police have not restricted or prevented him from doing so.
A complaint was received by the FCID on March 10, 2015 regarding a financial embezzlement that had taken place in 2006 during the purchase of four MiG aircraft and the overhaul of the four aircraft that belonged to the Sri Lanka Air Force. Accordingly, an investigation was initiated and findings were presented to court under case number B639/15.
During this investigation Weeratungas involvement in this deal was revealed and it was also disclosed that he had received large sums of money to his bank accounts from overseas which was highly suspicious. He was wanted to record a statement in this regard.
Although the summons for him to appear in court were issued through his close relatives and diplomatic channels, he had chosen to disregard it.
Taking into consideration the fact that Udayanga had no intention of cooperating with the investigations willingly, an open warrant was issued for his arrest on October 20, 2016. Further court issued an order to freeze 16 bank accounts operated by him. At the time there was around US$ 1.7 million in his bank accounts.
On the basis of a Blue Notice obtained by Interpol Sri Lanka on Weeratunga, Sri Lanka authorities had been working through mutual legal assistance with a number of countries to trace his whereabouts and subsequently a red alert was issued.
His diplomatic service ended on February 28, 2015 but instead of handing over or cancelling the diplomatic passport D3643585 that was issued to him, on March 6, 2015 he had obtained a normal passport from the Immigration and Emigration Department in Sri Lanka. Investigations have revealed that he had used this passport and travelled to the UAE on October 4, 2016.
Subsequently, the Colombo Fort Magistrate issued an order to impound the passport bearing number D3643585 and passport number N 5400885.
However, the former Ambassador had tried to use his diplomatic passport bearing number D3643585 and travel to the USA via the UAE when he was intercepted in the UAE on February 4,2018.
In a social media post on February 20 Weeratunga had stated that he had requested the investigation team that had gone to Ukraine to record a statement from him there, but they had failed to do so. However, investigations have revealed that at the time the Sri Lankan team was in Ukraine on October 4, 2016, Weeratunga had been in the UAE and not in Ukraine.

USNS Mercy to return to Sri Lanka during Pacific Partnership mission
Asia-Pacifics largest humanitarian assistance and disaster-relief preparedness mission is returning to Sri Lanka and Vietnam as the United States continues to cultivate partnerships in the region.
During this years Pacific Partnership exercise, which begins on Friday and runs through June, the Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy will travel to Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam while the USNS Fall River heads to, Malaysia, Palau, Thailand and Yap in Micronesia. Events will include civic-action projects, community health exchanges, medical symposiums and disaster-response training.
More than 800 personnel from the Navy and other countries are involved in the mission, which began in response to a deadly tsunami that ravaged parts of the region in 2004.
This marks the second year Pacific Partnership will visit Sri Lanka, whose location next to a critical sea lane attracts both the U.S. and China.
In October, the USS Nimitz and its strike group made a port call on the capital, Colombo, becoming the first U.S. aircraft carrier to do so in three decades.
This years Sri Lanka stop will be similar to 2017s mission, said Task Force 73 spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson.
The scope of engagements is on a similar scale with a variety of medical, civil engineering products and community engagements over the course of two weeks, he said.
The U.S. is also pursuing closer ties with Vietnam, which hotly contests Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. China has built up and militarized artificial islands in parts of the sea that Vietnam and other nations depend on for fishing and commerce.
Abrahamson said the Mercys Vietnam visit will come sometime after March, when the USS Carl Vinson is expected to stop in Danang, becoming the first U.S. carrier to do so since the Vietnam War.

Youngest player to top ICC player rankings
India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always produced the best spinners in world cricket throughout the years but the three nations now have stiff competition from Afghanistan.
Less than one-year-old as a full member nation, the Afghanistan national cricket teams rise has been phenomenal to say the least.
Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the mid-19th century, but it is only in recent years that the world has taken notice of the national team after it was granted a full ICC membership along with Ireland.
Afghanistan recently hammered Zimbabwe in the United Arab Emirates and won the 5-match ODI series 4-1 with two spin bowlers playing the starring roles.
Leg-spinner Rashid Khan and off-break bowler Mujeeb Zadran are making waves in world cricket and were the chief architects in their teams triumph in the UAE.
Rashid ended up as the highest wicket-taker in the series with 16 wickets in 5 ODIs at an average of 7.93 with best bowling figures of 5 for 24.
Rashid joined India pacer Jasprit Bumrah at the top of the ICC ODI rankings for bowlers to become the youngest to attain top ranking.
His 51 runs in two innings in the Zimbabwe series, including a brisk 43 in the final match in Sharjah last Monday, also helped him break into the top-five in the list of all-rounders while he has also moved up 11 slots to take 114th place among batsmen.
Overall he has 86 wickets in 37 ODIs which makes him the most successful bowler in the 50-over format after 37 games ahead of some great names like Saqlain Mushtaq (73), Mitchell Starc (73), Ajantha Mendis (72) and Shane Bond (71).
Sixteen-year-old Mujeeb came in a close second with 12 wickets at 17.58 with best figures of 5 for 50 in the 4th ODI which made him the youngest bowler to take a five-wicket haul in one-day internationals The teenage spin twins had also picked up 7 wickets each in the three-match ODI series against Ireland last month.
Nineteen-year-old Rashid has already become a household name in India and Australia after finishing as the second highest wicket-taker (11 wickets in 7 matches at an average of 16.63) in the World Twenty20 in 2016. He then made a huge impact in his debut seasons in the Indian Premier League last year and the Big Bash League this year. 2016 IPL champions Sunrisers Hyderabad had seen Rashids potential and skill which is why they paid a whopping Rs 4 crore for his services last year.
The Nangarhar-born cricketer repaid the faith shown in him by the team management with 17 wickets in just 14 matches in his debut season at an average of 21.05.
He was the second highest wicket-taker for SRH behind purple cap holder and teammate Bhuvneshwar Kumar (26 wickets in 14 matches) and the sixth-highest overall last season.
That is why SRH retained Rashid using the Right to Match card for a mind-boggling Rs 9 crore at the auction last month making him the joint-seventh costliest player along with Australias Glenn Maxwell.
He was costlier than even Indias first choice spinners - Yuzvendra Chahal (RTM by RCB for Rs 6 crore) and Kuldeep Yadav (RTM by KKR for Rs 5.80 crore).
He was even better in the BBL this season finishing as the joint-highest wicket-taker, along with Dwayne Bravo, with 18 scalps in 11 matches at 13.83.
Then comes Mujeeb, who burst onto the international scene in December last year against Ireland, which made him the first cricketer born in the 21st century to make his international debut.
Mujeeb picked up 4 wickets for 24 runs in 10 overs as Afghanistan defeated Ireland by 138 runs in the 1st ODI of the three-match series. He now holds the joint-best figures for an Afghan bowler on ODI debut with Shapoor Zadran.
The Khost-born spinner also went for a staggering price in the IPL auction last month, being sold for Rs 4 crore to Kings XI Punjab despite not having played in the tournament yet.
Mujeeb will now be aiming to make an impact as big as Rashid did in his maiden season in the IPL and make his country proud just like his national teammate.

Physician heal thyself
The dust storm that erupted after the ground level victory of the SLPP (JO) at the local government elections has now settled down one could see the contours of the victory and defeat suffered by all major parties more clearly. The SLPP victory is not all that straight as it needs Opposition support to form administrations in almost two-thirds of Councils in which they hold a majority of seats. To that extent the defeated parties have an effective power in deciding the final outcome. Thus it is not a blank cheque that was given to it by the voters.
The confusion thus created was worst confounded by subjective efforts of the major parties in seeking to change the central government with their own imaginary governments and imaginary portfolios as well as repeated calls for the removal of the Prime Minister. This was despite the specific provisions in the Constitution that the President has no power to remove the Prime Minister unless the Parliament passes a Vote of No Confidence on him or unless he resigns on his own. Either the politicos were ignorant of the Supreme Law of the land or they deliberately wished to undermine it.
The call for the change of the central government was wrong on account of the fact that the legitimacy of its mandate has not expired. The Government was formed according to the mandate given by the people on August 17, 2015 when the legitimate President of the Republic invited the Leader of the party with the majority of MPs to form the government. It had passed votes of confidence several times and until a Vote of No Confidence is passed or the Budget fails to get Parliament approval it has legitimacy to run for the full term. Besides, there is no precedent in international experience where a central government was changed following a defeat at local government polls.
Political parties
Amidst all this confusion, claims and counter-claims of political parties and knee-jerk reactions of interested parties there is one factor on which there is almost universal acceptance. That is that the Government has been given a clear warning to correct its mistakes and embark on the promised path towards implementing the January 8th mandate without deviations. Failure to do so would be its doom.
We would like to propose certain changes as part of a rectification drive by the Government, if it heeds the popular warning.
It has to re-consider its blind adherence to the neo-liberal economic policies which even their mentors are now abandoning. Its principal drawback is the lack of equity in the distribution of its gains. Equality of opportunity and equity in distribution are necessary.
Ever since 1977 people were fooled by promises of trickle down benefits which were never realized. It is not a personal failure of those who governed whether it is a Bandaranaike, a Rajapaksa or a Wickremesinghe. It is a systematic failure. Over the years the gap between the haves and have-nots has widened. The wealth of the country has been concentrating in a few hands. A mere change of government or a return of the Rajapaksa era will not guarantee equity. There should be a definite pro-poor and people-friendly socio-economic development programme of action. It should include re-distribution of national income equitably. To call the people to tighten their belts when the affluent and symbolically Ministers and their deputies display vulgar ostentation devouring much public funds parasitically there cannot be any equity. They need to sacrifice extra-ordinary comforts and perks of office.
All extravagant projects with only cosmetic value should be abandoned in preference to those that are production-centred. The craze for macro-projects is also another obsession that has to be abandoned. Perhaps chances of abundant sleaze may be the attraction.
Dogmatic adherence to both nationalization and liberalization should be done away with and at each instance a concrete appraisal of the benefits of otherwise of either should be made before arriving at a decision. Unsolicited investment proposals from whatever quarter have to be carefully weighed before approval. Though it is imperative to get FDI the government must be selective in choosing them to suit the national interests, especially to protect nascent local industry and agriculture.
Soaring cost of living is a perennial problem for the poor and the lower middle classes. From the performance of the Government during the last three years shows that its objective has been not to provide relief to them but to develop the upper middle class through economic concessions. The increase in indirect taxation through VAT and custom duties as well as service charges was meant to favour the upper middle class and those with higher incomes.

The poor should be guaranteed a subsidized package of essential commodities as a safety net both to improve their income and prevent the growth of malnutrition and poverty. Emphasis on developing preventive health and improvement of basic educational facilities as against giving priority to cosmetic projects such as supplying Wi-Fi and Tabs distribution is more urgent.
As regards the prices of agricultural goods such as vegetables, potatoes etc. cost of transport and storage facilities are major debilitating factors. The use of the railways for transport as well as the restoration of the services rendered earlier by the Marketing department would certainly improve the situation. A hundred percent free market or the governments total abstention from business activity is a luxury and an oddity that cannot be afforded.
The government has also failed to provide necessary agricultural inputs in time for cultivation. The unavailability of fertilizers in time and their higher costs following instant purchases without tenders was a key element of dissatisfaction with the government as witnessed at the local government polls. Even at present potato cultivators are not getting a fair price for their crops due to heavy imports.
Food security is a major concern, especially due to periodic droughts and floods. Post-harvest loss is also an impediment that should be rectified. Meanwhile, attempts are being made to divert attention of the farmers to cash crop cultivation in preference to paddy cultivation. Academics and foreign consultants have advocated such measures to improve the living standards of the farmers. But it runs the risk of destroying the food security of the people, especially that of the staple diet.
Sri Lanka is still mainly an agricultural country. In the short term it is the development of agriculture -its modernization and development of its technological base that promises a quick improvement of the GDP.
Economic development programme
It is a fact that there is a shortage of both skilled and unskilled labour amounting to at least half a million hands. The only way to rectify this situation is to improve the dignity of labour by providing an adequate salary, the lack of which is the principal reason for the existence of a large number of vacancies. True, an attitudinal change among youth is required but it is only a secondary factor needing a long-term solution.
We are told that a new economic development programme is being worked out by the National Economic Council under the President. However, unless detailed out in a pragmatic plan of action to be implemented within the next two years a policy couched in nice language full of promises would be of no avail.
Similarly a reshuffle of the Cabinet could amount to a mere shuffling of a pack of cards with its jokers merely changing hands. One thing is clear, whether a national government or not, the country cannot afford a jumbo Cabinet. It is high time to reduce its size to manageable size. Nor should certain perks of MPs and Ministers, for example, attendance allowances for each sitting and subsidized meals should be done away with. Import of fresh vehicles for them also should be abandoned and the needy given vehicles from those available in Ministries.
In the political field much remains to be done both in local and foreign policies but we keep it for another occasion.

SLMCs victory will strengthen Puttalam people
The victory of the SLMC at the last Local Council election is the victory of Puttalam people.
"It saved our peoples self-respect too, SLMC candidate for Puttalam Urban Council election and former Puttalam Urban Council former Chairman and former Deputy Minister K.A.Baiz said.
He was addressing his supporters in Puttalam recently.

Akila Dananjaya reminds me of young Murali - Hathurusingha
There is a popular song hit by the name Everything I Touch Turns To Gold by English pop group Saint Etienne that can be attributed to Sri Lankas new head coach Chandika Hathurusingha who on his first assignment has changed the fortunes of the national team across all three formats  Tests, One-Day Internationals and T20 Internationals. Not so long ago this very same team was struggling to compete with other nations at international level and the cricket they played had reached a point of no return.
Hathurusingha is renowned for uplifting Bangladesh as an international cricket nation during his four-year tenure as coach and now he is beginning to do the same with the Sri Lanka team guiding them to a successful tour of Bangladesh where they won the Test and T20I series and emerged champions of the one-day tri-series that featured Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.
The DAILY NEWS caught up with Hathurusingha after the team returned from their triumphant tour of Bangladesh to get to know the intricacies of how the coach works with the players to form a winning combination and what the future looks like for the countrys cricket.
Q: Are you surprised by the results obtained in Bangladesh
CH: Not surprised by the results but surprised by the improvement we showed in a short space of time. I was surprised by the way we played and the dominance that we showed there. I expected to win but I also expected a lot more fight from Bangladesh especially in the ODIs and Tests.
Q: Do you believe in the old adage that the coach is only as good as the players
CH: The coach is only as good as the players because you cant go and bat and bowl for them I certainly believe in that. Then again if you dont utilise what you have then you can under achieve as well.
Q: You are credited with preparing players mentally and working on mental toughness, how much of that have you been doing with the Sri Lanka team
CH: Preparing mentally I dont know what I am doing you must ask the players. We try to be realistic, identify what our strengths are, the opportunities against that particular opponent and the conditions of the particular day and try to maximise every bit of talent we have. Thats what I am trying to do and probably get the players to understand their strengths and limitations.
Q: Can you elaborate on the sudden changes that have been brought about in the games of Thisara Perera and Kusal Mendis
CH: For both of them I saw immense potential. For example Thisara was never given the particular role that suited him in the past because of that he probably didnt realise how good he can be. But at the same time he has the second highest Man of the Match awards after another player in Sri Lanka. So that means there is something special in him to change the course of the game which I saw from outside before I came. He is a big part of our plans going forward. I spoke to him of what he can be and what he can do and how good he can be. Then myself, Rumesh (Ratnayake) and Thilan (Samaraweera) put him in a kind of a situation that he is challenged every time he comes to training, more than before. He did train differently in the last few months.
In the case of Kusal Mendis he had lost confidence in himself and a little bit of faith in his ability. It is natural for a young player to have success and a little bit of dip which I have experienced with some other players in other countries where I was coaching. Everyone can have that kind of dip but its nothing to be worried about. You have to trust your ability. I felt that a lot of information has been fed to him that has made him lose his way of playing and his actual strength. We had to clear his mind and identify his strengths.
Q: Was it a gamble you took giving an ODI cap to Shehan Madushanka (Tri-series final v Bangladesh) and a Test cap to Akila Dananjaya (2nd Test v Bangladesh)
CH: I dont take it as a gamble but I saw something special. I foresaw what they can do given the right role and environment. I believe that throwing talented players into the deep end is the best way to get them playing international cricket. When you put trust on them and if they are talented they will give you results. I spoke to Shehan and told him clearly what I wanted him to do and what he is capable of doing. Just go and do it without worrying about the outcome. Even Akila I thought he was a very good Test player although he was playing only one-day cricket. You have to play them in the right conditions. The conditions in which they played suited both of them.
Q: How do you rate Akila Dananjaya as a Test bowler
CH: He reminds me of young Murali because his off-spin is ideal for Test cricket, the loop, the speed that he bowls and the lines he bowls are for Test cricket. He can bowl a few other balls as well. I am not saying that he is going to play in every Test match going forward but whenever we think we need someone to suit the conditions we know that we have someone special.
Q: What do you bring to the table that other coaches dont
CH: I dont know to be honest. I believe if you do what other people are doing youll never be the best. You have to be really creative and be the leader of whatever you do thats what I believe. We cant copy other coaches from other countries. If you do that you cant be competitive youll always become second. If you want to be the best you have to be unique. I try to think differently and work on what I have and maximise it.
Q: How did you manage to change the fortunes of a team that has been struggling in international cricket so quickly
CH: For instance Bangladesh played the same team and dominated international cricket domestically for the past 3 years and we beat the same team. I think I read the game and the situation and I am probably blessed with that talent. I dont know. We did positional changes that is one thing. For example Kusal Mendis to open the batting and Dushmantha Chameera to bowl with the white new ball. My analyst showed me that he had played 9 matches and taken only one wicket in ODI cricket previously. I was surprised for someone like him taking one wicket in 9 games there was something wrong somewhere. We had to change it. There were also positional changes and there is a lot of tactical things involved which I dont want to divulge.
Q: Do you set challenges or any goals to the team
CH: Playing international cricket is a challenge itself. You are expected to win games. The challenge comes with playing for your country at the highest level. You have to play to win and find ways to do that.
Q: What does the team need to move forward
CH: We have a lot of areas we can still improve one thing is we need to believe that we are good enough and the confidence. We have a lot of injuries and we need to manage that, it is something to address. From last month or so we have changed the ways we trained that is going to help us to maximise our potential and help us to win all the time.

No. 334). The value of the elephant calf was estimated as Rs. 6.9 million by the Wildlife Department.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing for the Attorney General raised objections regarding the defences request that a bail condition directing the suspect to be appear before CID be removed.
Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana appeared for the former Magistrate.

Bizarre! NZ batsman blasts a six off the bowler's head
Black Caps Test opener Jeet Raval, who hammered a splendid century for Auckland in New Zealand's domestic one-day competition, has gained fame for one of the most bizarre sixes ever hit.
The Indian-origin batsman slammed 149 runs off 153 balls against Canterbury, including 10 fours and four sixes. One of his maximums, however, came off in the most strange manner as the ball flew over the rope after deflecting off bowler Andrew Ellis' head. Ellis, a former Black Caps bowler, was trying to stop an onslaught from Raval but the batsman came down the track and hit the ball back towards him.
Ellis was left with little time to react and couldn't lift his hands up quick enough. The ball then hit Ellis on his head and somehow managed to fly over the long-off fence. The umpires signalled a boundary initially but they changed it to a six. Raval was quick to check on Ellis' condition.
According to reports, Ellis cleared a concussion test and was back on the field to continue with his bowling.
Ellis eventually had the last laugh as he picked Raval but not before the batsman had powered Auckland to 304/6 in 50 overs.  ITV

Candidates who failed to poll over 5% of votes
The surety deposits of candidates who did not poll more than 5 percent of the total valid votes polled at the recently concluded Local Government (LG)Election, will be forfeited to Government, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
The surety deposit for a candidate representing an independent group was Rs. 5,000, while it was Rs. 1,500 for a candidate of a political party.
Deshapriya said there are political parties which have obtained one seat but polled less than five percent of the total valid votes at the LG body. There are political parties which have obtained 4.5 percent at the council and managed to secure one seat, but still the surety deposit is non-refundable, he added.
He said the surety deposit of candidates in the additional list would not be refunded if their political party or the independent group failed to obtain at least five percent of the votes in their respective council.
He said the Elections Secretariat is in the process of refunding the surety deposits of all other candidates.

The centenary year of the MUSTANGS
The MUSTANGS are a group of senior old boys from both colleges, Royal College and S. Thomas College, who meet once a year, in a private tent to watch and enjoy the game and share the camaraderie which prevails in the tent. Most of us have known each other from our respective school days and therefore naturally it has become a meeting place for old friends.
The MUSTANGS tent which celebrates its centenary this year was for a long time, the only private tent at the match. This changed in 1975, with the COLTS TENT being given the permission to have their private tent at the match.
We are very fortunate, that Mr. Fred Wirasekera, one of the six founder members of the MUSTANGS has written an article in the match souvenir in 1979. This article details of how four old Royalists and two old Thomians formed the tent.
Even at that time, the Royal-Thomian was a great social event and it extended to the families of the school boys as well as the old boys of the two colleges, and close friends of the old boys. Most of us have very close friends in the other schools when we befriended many through sports by playing against each other at school level and they too shared in the revelry of the big match
The Mustangs colours were chosen by Mr. Wirasekera and Wilmot Perera and remain the same - PINK, GREY and BLACK.
They even had a Mustang Tie specially made for them by the well-known company SULKA of Bond Street, where one of the founder members Mr. Wilmot Perera went to England for his honeymoon.
Successive Co-coordinators and subsequently Secretaries have done their best to continue the traditions of 100 years.
In the last 5 years the demand from old boys who reached the age of 50 to join the tent has grown tremendously. Therefore, we are now compelled to limit our membership.
The original name MUSTANGS were thought of by the founder members who were young, enthusiastic and eager to enjoy themselves at the match and the same spirit continues and will surely last another 100 years.
