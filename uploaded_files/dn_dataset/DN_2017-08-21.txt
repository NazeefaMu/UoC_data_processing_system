Killer robots: Experts warn of 'third revolution in warfare'

More than 100 leading robotics experts are urging the United Nations to take action in order to prevent the development of "killer robots".
In a letter to the organisation, artificial intelligence (AI) leaders, including billionaire Elon Musk, warn of "a third revolution in warfare".
Thelettersays "lethal autonomous" technology is a "Pandora's box", adding that time is of the essence.
The 116 experts are calling for a ban on the use of AI in managing weaponry.
"Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend," the letter says.
"These can be weapons of terror, weapons that despots and terrorists use against innocent populations, and weapons hacked to behave in undesirable ways," it adds.
There is an urgent tone to the message from the technology leaders, who warn that "we do not have long to act".
"Once this Pandora's box is opened, it will be hard to close."
Experts are calling for what they describe as "morally wrong" technology to be added to the list of weapons banned under the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).
Along with Tesla co-founder and chief executive Mr Musk, the technology leaders include Mustafa Suleyman, Google's DeepMind co-founder.
A UN group focusing on autonomous weaponry was scheduled to meet on Monday but the meeting has been postponed until November, according to the group's website.
A potential ban on the development of "killer robot" technology has previously been discussed by UN committees.
In 2015, more than 1,000 tech experts, scientists and researcherswrote a letterwarning about the dangers of autonomous weaponry.
Among the signatories of the 2015 letter were scientist Stephen Hawking, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Mr Musk.
A killer robot is a fully autonomous weapon that can select and engage targets without human intervention. They do not currently exist but advances in technology are bringing them closer to reality.
Those in favour of killer robots believe the current laws of war may be sufficient to address any problems that might emerge if they are ever deployed, arguing that a moratorium, not an outright ban, should be called if this is not the case.
However, those who oppose their use believe they are a threat to humanity and any autonomous "kill functions" should be banned.

Kyrgios to meet Dimitrov in Cincinnati final
CINCINNATI, Saturday - Australian Nick Kyrgios overcame Spanish veteran David Ferrer on Saturday to set up a clash against Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov in the final of the Cincinnati Open.
The 22-year-old Kyrgios, looking for his first title of the year, beat the former world number three 7-6(3) 7-6(4), while Dimitrov also advanced to his first Masters 1000 final with a 7-6(4) 7-6(10) victory over American John Isner.
Kyrgios, who has struggled with hip and shoulder injuries the past two months, showed grit to advance.
He was a nightmare to play, especially because I'm a tall guy and he's not the tallest guy, Kyrgios told reporters.
It's a tough matchup for me. I thought today I didn't play my best tennis.
In the tie-breaks I served well, but I definitely didn't bring my best tennis today.
I'm just really proud that I managed to scrap out the win.
Seventh seed Dimitrov needed almost two hours to book his place in Sunday's final.
The world number 11 had his work cut out against big-serving Isner, with neither player dropping serve in a match where break opportunities were few and far between.
Isner had two break point chances, Dimitrov only one.
Dimitrov saved a set point in the second set tiebreak, before putting away the dogged American to reach his first Masters 1000 final.
I think it's a good step, Dimitrov said. It's a good step. I have been on the tour for quite some time now, and I appreciate those moments.
I'm starting to appreciate them even more.

A league of their own
His smile has won as much fame as his prowess as a batsman. It has brought a ray of hope to the team and fans even during the gravest situations of a match. At 50 Hashan Tillakaratne has done his bit and more on behalf of the passion of his life: cricket. Being a member of the legendary 1996 Cricket World Cup winning team has been the feather on his cap. He has also been a former test captain and is the current batting coach for the Sri Lankan cricket team. His love for the sport has spread onto his family. All three of his sons follow in their fathers footsteps. 22 years of married life has moulded Apsari Tillakaratne nee Singhabahu too into a cricket specialist. She was recently appointed as the Convener for Sri Lanka Womens Cricket.
The cricketer
Cricket is in Hashans blood. It is his main passion and he lives and breathes for the sport. He will do anything for cricket. One phrase he keeps on chanting daily is that he has attained everything that he has got today because of cricket. Dedication and lots of hard work got him into the national team. He attended practices regularly. He has always been fully involved in the game.
The family man
Hashan loves to maintain a beautiful home. One way of relaxation for him is redoing our home in Piliyandala. Even these days he is renovating our house. He has removed some of our old doors and is replacing them with antique doors. He loves antique items and wants to change the outlook of the house now and then. He also looks into the household chores. We have three sons: Duvindu Sachin and Ravindu Sachin who are twins and Rajindu Irya who will be 12 years in September. The twins are named after our favourite cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. They are 21 years old and employed at MAS Ratmalana. Kumar Sangakkara and his wife, Yehali, named Rajindu. He is playing in the under 13 A team at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia.
Best qualities
Hashan is a very down to earth and simple person. Though he was very famous during his stint he has never had any ego issues about it. I realized that he is quite a family man from the first moment we began chatting. Hashan has always been close to his parents and brother, Yasas. This was the first quality which attracted me to him.
The meeting
I was employed as a cabin crew member for Emirates. The Sri Lanka cricket team had flown to Dubai for a tournament in Sharjah. One of my close friends, Eshantha, was living there with his partner. He called and invited me to dinner at his place adding that the Sri Lankan cricket team will also be there. I said ok at first but later began to have second thoughts about attending since I was wondering if I had to go for the event merely because the Sri Lankan cricket team will be attending. I was clueless about cricket then. I was not a cricket enthusiast either. So I refused the invitation politely. I shared my apartment with two Indian girls. I happen to mention Eshanthas invitation to them and they became so excited and begged me to take them along to meet the cricketers. I was forced to call back and notify them that we were attending after all. During the event Eshantha began to talk about Hashan in particular with me for some reason. He also introduced me to him and we began chatting. Hashan invited me to come and watch the matches. I watched a match for the first time in my life in Sharjah in 1995.
The marriage
The Sri Lankan team returned to Sri Lanka after the Sarjah Cup. I had to fly to Bangkok next. I got a call there and it was Hashan calling me in Bangkok from Sri Lanka! I was surprised and inquired how he found out the number and he gleefully told me that he has many friends working at Emirates. He proposed to me then stressing that we have similar tastes and that our ideas match. The proposal came about a week after our first meeting.
I was the breadwinner of my family during that time because my father was ill. I related this to Hashan and I asked him to meet my parents when I return to Sri Lanka. My parents liked him. They felt that he was like their own son when he addressed them. My parents requested me to take a decision relating that I have done a lot on behalf of them and my sister.
Though I continued to fly, I soon realized that I had to be with Hashan. He was representing the country which was a national duty and he was at his career peak then. I decided that I had to make the sacrifice of giving up my job. It was a very difficult decision to make because my job offered a lot of benefits and a high salary. Our wedding ceremony was held on April 9.
Happiest moment in life
Winning the 2006 World Cup is no doubt Hashans gloriest moment in life. Even today he says he wakes up hugging the World Cup and goes to sleep in the same gesture. I was pregnant but not even three months when I flew to Pakistan to attend the World Cup finals. My doctor was against me flying but since I am used to flying I knew I could stomach the journey. The last few stages of the match were very emotional. The whole team was awestruck. Some of us were even in tears when the final overs were on. I was with Romesh Kaluwitharana and Arjuna Ranatungas wives. All the Pakistani fans were cheering for us and their cheers still echo in my ears.
Double celebrations
Post winning the World Cup I stumbled upon the fact that I will be expecting twins. I was about five months gone then and it was just after we returned from a tour in USA where the team was invited to play a few matches. I felt a slight pain on the side of my stomach. My mother took me to Homagama Hospital where our doctor examined me and said that I am fine and it must be due to fatigue. However a matron who is known to my mother advised me to get a scan done. I went to Navaloka with our friend, Ajitha, since Hashan had practices at that time. The doctor smiled and told me that he can see one but not the other. I was surprised and asked what he meant. He informed me that he had heard two heartbeats and that is why he wanted us to do a scan.
Soon after we returned to NCC Grounds Ajitha rushed up to Hashan and related the incident to him. We were overjoyed but we also felt like our duties have been doubled as well.
Seeing double
I have taken the twins on almost all the tours that Hashan has taken part in when they were small. Once in UK when my passport was being checked at the airport they were confused about their pictures. Both photos were identical and they believed that it was one childs photograph which has been copied and used to represent the other. They even measured the length of the face in the pictures to spot a difference but found out that all the details were identical! Then there were incidents like I would get them confused and try to feed medicine to the same child twice. We had to tie a band on Duvindus hand to recognize one from the other during their childhood.
Greatest strength and greatest weakness,
Hashan is very honest. He does not steal. However he trusts a lot of people and that has gotten him in hot water at times. He also gets a bit excited when one of the children falls ill.
Most difficult period
Just after the 1999 World Cup the selectors decided to drop four of the team members: Arjuna, Roshan, Aravinda and Hashan, stating that they are making way for youngsters. Hashan had a good batting average at that time. Therefore he did not expect that he would get dropped. It was a very disappointing phrase for him. He played domestic matches for NCC for two years and made a comeback. He had his career best performance then. He also captained the team in 2003/4 before retiring.
Favourite travels
Hashan loves wildlife. We visit a small lodge we own in Yala Park when we have a holiday. The kids too look forward to these trips. Hashan also loves to visit ancient religious places in rural areas.
An alternative profession
Hashans parents have told me that he was very studious during his school days. He has engaged in politics for a brief period. I think he would have continued to be in politics if he did not get into cricket.
Nickname for her
I have three names: Deepika Sandamali Apsari. Everyone knows me as Apsari but Hashan is the only person who calls me Deepika.

Lessons from India : Pension wise
The existing public service pension scheme in Sri Lanka has become a cause of concern to the Government in view of the large absolute amount of expenditure incurred and the rapid rising trend of such expenditure.
The State Minister of Labour and Trade Unions, Ravindra Samaraweera said recently that the present strength of the public service is 1.4 million, whereas ideally, it should be around 800,000. He added, The pension scheme in the present form is a heavy burden on the people. With this in view the Government is considering to evolve a contributory pension scheme.
The debate relating to the need for the reforms of the Government pension system is continuing.
In Sri Lanka, pension benefits form part of public servants conditions of service. It is financed and managed by the Government. Public service includes employees of government, statutory bodies and local authorities. Their pension benefit consists of a fixed monthly payment until death for the pensioner, and also includes survivors benefits. Thus, the public service pension is a defined benefit scheme.
Employees in the private sector are not included in this scheme. They and their employers are instead required to contribute to the Employees Provident Fund. The employee contributes 8 % of the salary while employer contributes minimum 12%. There is also an Employees Trust Fund where the employer contributes 3 % of the employees salary. On retirement, a subscriber can withdraw the balance lying on these two accounts as the retirement benefit.
Reforms
One important factor generally cited for introduction of pension reforms is on account of the rapid growth observed in public servant pension payments, which is likely to pose a serious threat to fiscal sustainability.
Some economists fear that this sharp growth could crowd out public investments in education, health and infrastructure. This is especially the case with a low-income country with a limited tax base like Sri Lanka. It has also been observed that public servant pension benefits are generous compared to those available to the private sector. Public servants represent only 17 per cent of the total labour force. It is argued that a large section of the society falls outside the purview of the social security provided by the government. Proponents of this argument maintain that it is not fair by the rest of the labour force who are compelled to sustain the subsidy-based pension programme for a small segment of workforce.
It is further argued that there is a need to look into many others in the uncovered labour sector to combat poverty among the elders. A number of countries provide social security to the old.
However, some observers believe that public sector pension, because they are not based on contributions, can be described as deferred salaries. Public servants accept a lower current salary in exchange for the promise of a pension in their old age. If this pension were contributory, they would insist on a higher salary. A good reform system should take into consideration this point-of view also.
Indian experience
It is this writers opinion that the Government must appoint a high-powered committee to examine the problem of continually rising expenditure on public service pension benefits.
Important issues that should evoke the interest of the committee include the extent of the public servants pension liability in the past, present and future; factors responsible for such growth; and alternative methods to be adopted to reduce the financial outgo and restore fiscal balance while retaining the current pensioners legitimate rights.
In this instance, we may be able to learn a great deal from the Indian experience.
National pension system
According to UNOs Population Division, World's life expectancy is expected to reach 75 years by 2050 from present level of 65 years. The better health and sanitation conditions have increased the life span. As a result, workers of post-retirement years have begun to increase. Thus, rising cost of living, inflation and increasing life expectancy made retirement planning essential part of any workers life.
By mid-90s, India understood this reality, and in 1999, commissioned a national project titled OASIS (an acronym for old age social and income security) to examine policy related to old age income security in India.
Based on the recommendations of the OASIS report, Government of India introduced a new Defined Contribution Pension System instead of a Defined Benefit Pension system.
In order to provide social security to more citizens, Indian Government started the National Pension System (NPS). It was launched on January 1, 2004. Three months before this launch, India also established Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) to act as the regulator of the pension sector in the country. The authority is broadly responsible for the orderly growth and development of the pension sector in India.
NPS was started with the objective of providing retirement income to all working citizens.
NPS aimed to institute pension reforms and to inculcate the habit of saving for retirement among the working citizens.
Initially, NPS was introduced for the new government recruits (except armed forces) but with effect from May 1, 2009, NPS has been provided for all citizens of the country including the unorganised sector workers.
NPS offers some important features to help subscriber save for retirement:
The subscriber will be allotted a Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN). This account number will remain the same for the rest of subscriber's life.
PRAN provides access to two personal accounts: Tier 1 Account: This is a non-withdrawable account meant for savings for retirement; Tier 2 Account: This is simply a voluntary savings facility. The subscriber is free to withdraw savings from this account whenever subscriber wishes. Tier 2 is meant for independent workers.
All Government employees will contribute through their workplace to National Pension System 10% of his/ her salary every month. This is mandatory. An equivalent government's contribution will be invested in his/her NPS account. The subscribers can withdraw from NPS only on his/ her retirement, final resignation or death.
The funds contributed by the subscribers are invested by the PFRDA through registered Pension Fund Managers (PFMs) as per the investment guidelines provided by PFRDA. At present, there are eight Pension Fund Managers (PFMs) and the subscriber has option to select any one of them to handle his account.
On retirement, a subscriber cannot take home the total accumulated savings but should invest minimum 40% of it to purchase a life annuity from PFRDA. This is mandatory.
Life annuity is a financial instrument which offers monthly/quarterly/annual pension at a specified rate for the period the subscriber chooses. Indian Life Insurance companies which are licensed by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) are empowered by PFRDA to act as Annuity Service Providers to provide annuity services to the subscribers of NPS. Currently, there are 7 ASPs empanelled by PFRDA.
The ASPs may offer some variants which have slightly different or combination type of annuities: (1) Pension payable for life at a uniform rate to the annuitant only; (2). Pension for life with return of purchase price on death of the annuitant (Policyholder). (3). Pension payable for life and increasing at a simple rate of 3% p.a. (4) Pension for life with a provision of 50% of the annuity payable to spouse during his/her lifetime on death of the annuitant. (5) Pension for life with a provision of 100% of the annuity payable to spouse during his/her lifetime on death of the annuitant.
Benefits of NPS
Some of the benefits of the National Pension System (NPS) are: (1) It is a transparent and cost effective system wherein the pension contributions are invested in the pension fund schemes and the subscriber will be able to know the value of the investment on day-to-day basis; (2) It is simple - all the subscriber has to do, is to open an account with his/her workplace office and get a Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN); (3) It is portable - each subscriber is identified by a unique number and has a separate PRAN which remains same even if he/she gets transferred to any other office; (4) It is regulated - NPS is regulated by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority with transparent investment norms and regular monitoring and performance review of fund managers.
Looking forward, India is already witnessing a paradigm shift in the entire concept of public pension scheme as a social security measure from a welfare-oriented to needs-oriented one, with much greater accessibility and sustainability. NPS is now regarded as a great framework that can enable long term savings for retirement and provide a decent hedge against post-retirement income uncertainties for the unorganised sector, besides being a valuable income supplement for the organised sector.
NPS is now equipped to take on the opportunities and challenges of creating an inclusive, affordable and fair pension system in India.

Lethal Man Utd hit four again, Arsenal lose at Stoke
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester United netted four goals for the second consecutive week in the Premier League to rout Swansea City 4-0 on Saturday and ensure their highest-scoring start to a season for 110 years.
United manager Jose Mourinho said he let the horses run freely at the Liberty Stadium but his old foe Arsene Wenger was left frustrated after his Arsenal thoroughbreds were shackled in a 1-0 defeat at Stoke City.
Liverpool struggled to squeeze past Crystal Palace 1-0 and promoted Brighton and Hove Albion suffered their second defeat in two games, 2-0 at Leicester City.
Goals flowed at Southampton, who snuffed out an astonishing comeback by 10-man West Ham United to win 3-2.
Mourinho's United completed their victory with a devastating late burst in which Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba and substitute Anthony Martial scored between the 80th and 84th minutes after Eric Bailly had netted late in the first half with his first goal for the club.
United, who scored twice late on to beat West Ham by the same score last weekend, have one of the strongest benches in the league and it was Martial's 75th-minute introduction that began the mayhem.
It was 1-0 and we thought let's go for more and exploit the fragile morale of the opponent. Our bench is really good - the players have a lot to give, Mourinho said.
Martial capped the rout with a delightful strike after he picked the ball up 35 yards out, cut inside and thumped the ball past a despairing Lukasz Fabianski.
There was happiness in our play, Mourinho said.
There was no need to close the door. Swansea badly missed the departed Gylfi Sigurdsson and injured Fernando Llorente and look to be in desperate need of reinforcements in the transfer window.
Arsenal's early-season optimism after their opening day win over Leicester was dissipated quickly after Jese, Stoke's new loan signing from Paris St Germain, capped a fine debut by scoring the winner 90 seconds after the break.
The home side, revelling once again in being Arsenal's bogey team, then produced a magnificent rearguard action to keep out the Gunners, who had an equaliser from Alexandre Lacazette ruled out for a fractional offside.
Liverpool secured their first league win of the season, and inflicted Palace's second defeat, when Sadio Mane broke the Anfield deadlock after 73 minutes, although Christian Benteke should have given the visitors the lead moments earlier.
Southampton got the better of an astonishing game of two penalties, a sending-off and an ultimately futile West Ham fightback at St Mary's.
After the home side went 2-0 through Manolo Gabbiadini and a Dusan Tadic penalty, and West Ham's Marko Arnautovic was sent off for elbowing Jack Stephens, the Hammers started to play.
Mexican forward Javier Hernandez scored his first goals for the club to bring hope of an unlikely point before Saints second penalty deep into stoppage-time was converted by Charlie Austin.

New worry for Modi as China takes deep root in Nepal
Dharchula in western Nepal is a Doklam doppelganger in that it is situated at the trijunction of Nepal, China and India. The town is bifurcated across India and Nepal by the river Kali; the terra firma underneath is the de facto border since the Treaty of Sugauli that ended the Anglo-Nepalese war of 1814-16. The suspension bridge over the river connects Nepal and the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. Dharchula was an important town on the old Tibet-Nepal-India trade route.
That was before China occupied Tibet in 1950. On the edges of the Chameliya tributary of the Kali in Nepali Dharchula is where Ajay Kumar Dahal lives alone. The family and life of the project chief of the state-owned Nepal Electricity Authoritys (NEAs) 30 MW Chameliya Hydroelectric Project is as divided and fragmented as the land he operates on. Dahals family is in Kathmandu, nearly 1,000 km away.
His sons are studying to be engineers: one in China and the other in India. He himself was one of the last Nepali engineers to have got his professional degree from Tashkent Poly Technical Institute in a now extinct country called the USSR, much like Tibet.
However, there is nobody fighting to reclaim the USSR. Dahal graduated in 1990, the year the USSR formally collapsed.

Norwegian research vessel In Sri Lanka to assess marine resources

A planning seminar is due to take place in Colombo on the arrival of the Norwegian Research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen to Sri Lanka in 2018 to carry out a survey on the marine resources.
The arrival of the ship marks the technical and institutional cooperation on Fisheries between Norway and Sri Lanka, which was endorsed by top level political authorities of the two countries.
The aim of the planned survey is to know the current status of marine resources including fish stocks and to investigate stocks of unexploited/ underutilized fishery resources on the continental shelf and slope.
The last stock assessment for Sri Lanka has been carried out by the previous Dr. Fridtjof Nansen in 1978 to 1980.
The new marine research vessel RV Dr Fridtjof Nansen is owned by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) and is jointly operated by the Institute of Marine Research of Norway, and Food and Agriculture organization to help developing countries improve their fisheries management.
The Ambassador of Norway to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Thorbjrn Gaustadsther addressing a gathering at an event to recognize the finalization of the planning schedules for the Vessels arrival to the Bay of Bengal, stated that the new research vessel will make it possible to significantly step up Norways assistance for ecosystem-based marine management in developing countries.
He further stated that this is part of the new Ocean strategy of Norway and Norway considers this as creating partnerships for the oceans as it enhances sharing knowledge both across industries and across international borders.

Only medical laboratory in Sri Lanka to achieve such feat  : Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics receives accreditation  from College of American Pathologists
Multi award-winning, dynamic hospital brand, Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC, continues to reach new heights of excellence in the Healthcare services sector with its fully-owned subsidiary Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics (LHD) receiving the prestigious accreditation status by the College of American Pathologists (CAP).
This is a recognition for meeting globally-acceptable standards of Medical Laboratory practices.
Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics has scored another First, in being the only medical laboratory in Sri Lanka to achieve CAP accreditation, and now joins the 7,000-strong CAP-accredited facilities in the world, endorsing the exceptional quality of services it provides to patients. Incidentally, Lanka Hospital laboratory was the first to be accredited by the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board (SLAB) in 2009 for compliance with ISO 15189 standards for medical laboratories. Dr. Sarath Paranavitane, Chairman, The Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC and Lanka Hospital Diagnostics, said: By receiving this accreditation from the College of American Pathologists, which is the gold standard for international accreditation, Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics has proven its commitment to uplift the standard of quality in diagnostics in order to provide our patients with reliable and precise reports.
The CAP Accreditation was granted in the wake of continued assessment of the laboratorys performance by CAP over the last couple of years. Strict adherence to guidelines laid down by CAP covering all aspects pertaining to good laboratory practices, with documented evidence of extensive laboratory experimentation to verify the performance of each test on offer, are of prime importance. LHD has obtained an excellent score in the world-wide continuous External Quality Assessment programme conducted by CAP for every test in each department. This has enabled LHD to showcase its calibre in being comfortably on par with the developed world. Once accredited, the CAP requires annual renewal and bi-annual inspection by a visiting team of experts to ensure continuity of standards.
Dr. Prasad Medawatte, Group Chief Executive Officer, The Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC, said: This achievement highlights the continuous improvement and commitment of Lanka Hospital towards international standard patient care by providing accurate laboratory results with state-of-the-art laboratory equipment, and a well-qualified and internationally recognized team of medical laboratory Consultants and technicians, facilities. This accreditation is also a testament to our compliance with safety measures, processes and procedures.
During the recent on-site inspection, the CAP assessors had the opportunity to meet and question laboratory staff, examine documents on their qualifications and competencies as well as physically inspect and approve the choice of equipment, facilities, safety measures, record-keeping and management as a whole.
Speaking on the subject, Dr. Geethani Galagoda, Head of Laboratories said: We are honoured to be awarded the CAP accreditation, the gold standard of medical laboratory accreditation. It is a testament to the professionalism, high levels of quality management and excellent patient care services provided at Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics for every test on our wide menu of over a thousand tests.
Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics is the only private medical laboratory to have a team of full-time consultants heading all departments. They, along with the rest of the staff worked tirelessly to achieve this status, said Dr. Saroja Siriwardene, Consultant Chemical Pathologist. We at LHD, now gear ourselves to continue to serve, following guidelines and maintaining the required standards at all times.

Panasian Power to construct two new Mini Hydropower Plants
Panasian Power has acquired Lower Kotmale Oya Power Two (Pvt) Ltd.
With this acquisition Panasian will commence construction on two mini hydropower plants (MHP) in the Nuwara Eliya district in early 2018 with an estimated investment of Rs 400 million. Upon completion these MHPs are expected to yield a combined output of 7.53 GWh per annum.
This latest acquisition is in keeping with our long term goal of increasing our renewable energy footprint to meet the local demand for clean, low cost energy. Furthermore, our decade long experience in the mini hydropower sector makes us ideally suited to ensure that the project runs efficiently with the highest energy output, said Pathmanatha Podiwala, General Manager of Panasian Power.
Renewable energy projects like this will help propel Sri Lanka towards a sustainable energy future that will yield benefits throughout our economy and increase the quality of life, he said.
Podiwala said due to the convenient accessibility, short length of structures and minimal environmental impact, construction of the project is not expected to exceed 12 months.
The Lower Kotmale Oya Power Two(Pvt) Ltd was formed as a special purpose vehicle company to develop two cascade projects, the Lower Kotmale Oya II MHP and Medakumbura MHP, utilizing water resources from Kotmale Oya in the Pudaluoya township, NuwaraEliya district.
Panasian Power, which was incorporated in 1982, owns and operates a Mini Hydropower Plantsand supplies electricity directly to the Ceylon Electricity Board in accordance with the Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) entered into on July 5, 2004 and spans for 15 years with a further extension of 5 years.

Plight of those fenced off
The electric fence had often been proposed as a magic solution to many of the problems faced as a result of the human-elephant conflict raging in many parts of the island. Whilst it has benefitted some, the fence, when erected in an unplanned manner, had caused more harm than good in the lives of those it is supposed to protect. At many a time, the electric fence had been erected through the village, splitting it in half and dividing a people rather than keeping the elephants out.
The Government had introduced many schemes to compensate these villages, but the crux of the matter is that many of these programmes do not address the grievances of the affected people and at times, dont work at all.
Failed schemes
The village of Porasankulama lies in the 63rd Division of the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat. It is a hot spot for human-elephant conflicts, being no different to many of the villages in Galgamuwa which constantly live in fear of elephant attacks. But today, the villagers of Porasankulama complain that they feel as if they have fallen from the frying pan and into the fire.
An electric fence built through the village of Porasankulam 12 years ago, has led to many villagers losing their lands; many 'jayabhoomi' or title deed lands. They had, in total, sacrificed over 100 acres of their lands to the fence and at present, have no land to grow produce for their own survival.
While the poorly planned fence stands despite protests from the village, government officials who insist on the fence staying have cared little for anything else. The village is yet to see a proper access road being constructed and has very few amenities to boast of in addition to the village attacks.
We suffer untold grievances due to this electric fence. Five out of seven days of the week are spent running around the country complaining to various officials about this fence.
These are our ancestral lands. It has been 12 years since the fence was erected and since then, we have not been able to work in any of our fields, said W. M. Sisira Kumara, 40.
He complained that when villagers tried to venture beyond the fence to cultivate lands, Wildlife Department officials prevented them from doing so and sued them for such actions.
My hearts breaks having to see all our fields turn into wastelands. We are all farmers here; this is all we know. Elephant problems, water, roads, we have many grievances. We lost our paddy along with our fields and so, we have no rice either. We dont even have space to grow some vegetables. They combined all of these lands to erect the fence. The officials did not go about this in a proper way. I feel that this fence was erected over our very own lives, he added.
W.P. Seeman, 60, lost three acres of land given to him by his father, to the fence. He had to use up another two acres to build his own house and now is left with very little land to make a living on.
We are pleased that they erected this fence. This is a must for the village. But we lost many things to build this fence. We dont want compensation from the Government, what we ask from them is that we get back our lands. A fence should not be erected at the expense of peoples lands. You need to build a fence which will keep the wild elephants away from the crops we grow, we grow nothing now. There are 155 families in this village and almost all of them have suffered as a result of this fence, he said.
Government officials, however, have been pressurizing the villagers to take the compensation. B.G. Jayatissa, 48, explained that both Wildlife and Forest officers had visited their village many times to convince them to come to a settlement over the lands.
These officials who work for the Government do not understand the value of our lands. Though they say those things for their own convenience, we cannot lose the right to our lands which we have had since the time of our great grandfathers. Only we know of the pain of having lost these lands. One and a half acres of my own land was lost to this fence. I dont even have space to grow some basic vegetables. We have now been reduced to labourers in other peoples lands, we no longer have the blessing of growing our own produce. I am saddened every time I remember how all these abandoned fields were once green, he said.
B.G. Asilin, 51, in the meantime explained that the fence was initially supposed to be built on forest land, but later changed due to officials not wanting to take on the extra work of clearing forest land.
Before this fence was erected, the officials informed us that we could carry on with our farming with no problem at all. They were too lazy to clear the jungle, so they erected the fence on our own lands. We have written letters and petitions about this problem to every place possible, she said.
According to Asilin, on April 26, 2011, they received a letter from the Kurunegala Land Commissioners Office informing them that all lands should be returned to their rightful owners. Officials from the Surveyor Generals Department had arrived to survey the land, but had soon left, complaining that the lands were all overgrown.
They asked us to clean the jungle and keep it for them to survey. When we went to clear the jungle, Wildlife officials asked us not to do that. Thus, we have become similar to iron which is beaten from all sides, she said.
Pressure for compensation
As the villagers fight on, Wildlife Officials, according to W.P. Lakshman, 52, have said that they might risk losing both the lands as well as any compensation awarded to them,
It is true that we have an elephant problem and it is also true that an electric fence is needed to resolve it but we cannot stand aside and let them use our own lands for the fence; making it difficult for us to have a livelihood. We might just perish in the end. We have informed the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat of this problem and I ask the officials to solve this issue as soon as possible, he said.
A Wildlife Officer of the Department of Wildlife Office in Meegallewa, speaking to the Daily News, admitted to there being an issue and said, Even though we tried to get these people compensation for the lands they lost, they are not in favour of it. The Government thus far has no scheme to provide alternative lands to those who have lost their lands due to a fence.
Attempts made to contact Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera proved futile.
The situation faced by the villagers of Porasankulama is dire. Those who wish to be buried in their own places of birth, no longer have land to have that wish fulfilled. Village life too has been boxed in as a result of the fence; common spaces such as a sports ground, place to meet as a community, all have been lost. The map of Porasankulama shows a village sprawled over many acres, but in reality, the villagers have no access to their lands beyond the electric fence. Like the elephants, the villagers too have been fenced out.

Proposal to increase taxes on soft drinks

The set of proposals to increase taxes on soft drinks prepared by WHO was handed over to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratna by WHO resident Representative Dr. Razia Pendse recently.
The proposal was prepared by WHO on a special request made by Minister Senaratna.
Diabetes is spreading among adults and children and 10percent of the population has diabetes. It is said that every year 52,000 healthy lives are lost due to these soft drinks. Consumption of these drinks waste Rs 28 billion a year. Marketing and advertising has resulted in an increase in the consumption of such drinks.
According to the WHO, urban poor consume a lot of soft drinks while they dont pay attention to consuming fruits and milk which are healthy.
In this set of proposals, the WHO has proposed alternatives in taxing. Under this it is proposed to tax Rs one for each gram of sugar added to a 100 ml soft drink. The minister of health said that he would present it to the cabinet in the future for approval.

Punishment and bail on exceptional circumstances
In general, public property means any property which can be utilized by the general public without any payments or can be used commonly on payments. but sometimes common people use the term of public property as any property which are belonged to the Government or State.
Under a legal point-of-view and the Offences under the Public Property Act, public property is given a different meaning as it is a question of legal issue if any person commits an offence against public property. Therefore, it's pertinent to study the what public property is, what are the offences committed against the public property, how to grant bail for offenders and what sentences can be imposed against the offences committed on public property.
As an ordinary citizen, everybody should have a general understanding about the law, as no one can say that they were not aware of the law after committing the offence; therefore, before coming to comprehensive study, we first look at the provisions of the offences against the Pubic Properly Act and its amendments.
This law was first enacted as Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 and amended subsequently by Offences Against Public Property [Amendment] Act No. 28 of 1999.
What is Public Property
Under Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982, public property is interpreted as follows;
'Public property' means the property of the Government, any department, statutory board, public cooperation, bank, co-operative society or co-operative union.
Any State property is public property, but there are some exceptions to the property of the State and other State institutions. In this context, any property belonging to a public cooperation is considered as public property, but if the public cooperation is established under the Companies Act, the said property is not considered as public property, even if the government holds the full ownership.
The constitution and the Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 have given same interpretation to public cooperation as follows
Public cooperation means any cooperation board or other body which was or is established by or under any written law other than the Companies Ordinance with funds or capital wholly or partly provided by the Government by way of grant loan or otherwise.
As per this interpretation, properties of public co-operations which are established under the Companies Act are expressly excluded under the Offences Against Public Property Act. For example, in the present world, we can see several co-operations established under the Companies Act as co-operations for smooth economic functions such as Ceylon Fertilizer cooperation, Lanka Sathosa and similar institutions, in that event we have to ascertain as to how or under what provisions the public institutes are established.
If banks are concerned under this Act, properties belonging to State banks are considered as public property and properties of the co-operative society, or co-operative unions, registered under the Co-operative Society Act No. 5 of 1972, are considered as public property.
What are the offences under Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982
Under Section 2, 3, 4 and 5, Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 are:
i. Misuse of public property- Section 2
ii. Theft of public property- Section 3
iii. Dishonest misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery, falsification of accounts.
What are the sentences given for the offences
Under Section 2, 3, 4 and 5 Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982, any person who commits the above offences shall be punished by imprisonment for a term not less than one year, but not more than twenty years with a fine of Rs. 1,000 or three times the value of the property.
Bail under Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982
Any person charged under this act shall not be released on bail until the trial has concluded, but the Magistrate Court has power to grant bail to a suspect on exceptional circumstances, while the person suspected or charged is in remand. In that event, a Police Officer not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police has to file a certificate stating that the value of the property of which the offence committed is more that Rs 25, 000, but Police sometimes does not to file the said certificate, if the value of the property is below Rs 100,000.
As per the case Ravi Karunanayake vs Ruwan Gunasekera CA/MC Revision 05/2004 decided on 13/01/2055, provision of the Bail Act is applicable to offences under this Act also.
It is also stated in Section 8 (2) of the Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 that the offender should be kept in remand until the appeal is concluded and bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances in that event.
Now, due to the development of the sentencing system, the Court is empowered to impose a lesser sentence or suspend the sentence under this Act, notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.
What are the Exceptional Circumstances considered for granting bail under Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982.
Our law has given broad interpretation for the term exceptional circumstances in granting bail in several decided cases and it should be decided as per the facts and circumstances of the case.
The usual considerations taken into account by Courts on granting bail or remanding are decided in case 'Queen vs Liyanage 65 NLR 289' and as follows;
a) The nature of the crime: is it a serious or trifling one
b) The severity of the punishment
c) The nature of evidence and consequently, the probability of conviction
d) The record of the accused: whether there are pending cases or previous convictions
e) Long period of remand without charges being framed
f) Trivial nature or the value of the subject matter
g) Any undue family handicaps or hardships supported with documentation
h) The unlikelihood of accused absconding or interfering with witnesses
i) Where investigations are completed.
In considering bail, our Courts exercise wide discretion to decide exceptional circumstances. The Court can grant or cancel a subsisting order, releasing such a person on bail if the Court has reason to believe that such person would
i) Not appear to stand his inquiry or trial
ii) Interfere with the witnesses or the evidence against him or otherwise obstruct the course of justice
iii) Commit an offence while on bail
or
iv) That the particular gravity of and public reaction to the alleged offence may give rise to public disquiet.
In the five-judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in Anuruddha Ratwatte and others vs. Attorney General, 2003 - 2 SLR ( Sri Lanka Law Reports) page 39, it was said that even in a day-to-day trial at a Trial-at-Bar in the High Court, if the accused was enlarged on bail prior to the commencement of the trial, cancellation of bail should be considered in terms of Sec. 14 of the Bail Act.
But, in many occasions, misuse or malpractices and other causes may undermine the principles recognized by our Courts in granting bail in the system of the administration of justice.

* Reports contain insufficient or inadequate material on investigations
* Lack of proper supervision by senior Police officers in preparation of reports to Courts
* Court is burdened with more cases, as such, judges tend to make remand orders mechanically without proper assessment, evaluation and consideration, especially in lower Courts due to lack of time
* With no specific time period to conclude investigations depending on the alleged offences committed, Courts grants excessive time period for objections for Police and or State officers
* Sometimes, tendency of certain judges in lower Courts to consider remanding as punishment
* Imposing of rigid bail conditions
* Delay in preparation of indictments to be forwarded to High Courts
Therefore, one needs to look through the system for granting or refusing bail for developing a better policy.

Asking for a sample under RTI Act
Question
I reside in a house close to a main road which is under construction. We complained to the Urban Council several times to construct the road properly. However, the construction work had been given to a private constructing company. We doubt whether quality of the concrete is up to standards. Can I ask on behalf of all the villagers for a concrete sample under the Right to Information Act From whom should I ask for information
Daily News Reader
Answer
Under the Right Act No. 12 of 2016 information includes any material which is recorded in, in any form including records, documents, memos, emails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, log books, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, correspondence, memorandum, draft legislation, book, plan, map, drawing, diagram, pictorial or graphic work, photograph, film, microfilm, sound recording, video tape, machine readable record, computer records and other documentary material, regardless of its physical form or character and any copy thereof;
Therefore, you can request for a concrete sample under RTI Act. The next question is from whom you should ask First you can request for information about the construction company. After finding details, you can ask them to provide sample of concrete they are using to construct the road.

Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict begins fast-unto-death
Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict and LTTE member Murugan alias Sriharan from Sri Lanka began his fast-unto-death in the Vellore prison on Friday in a bid to attain Jeeva samadhi declaring that he would continue his fast till his plea for release is considered.
He had been on a minimum diet until Thursday and on Friday he stopped taking any food, a senior jail official told the newspaper confirming that Murugan, is trying to end his life or merge with the absolute in physical form by being in a meditative state. When last heard, Vellore prison officials were trying to persuade him not to go ahead with the Jeeva samadhi plan.
It may be noted that Murugan, who had turned more spiritual in the last few years, had submitted a petition on July 19 to the Vellore Prison Superintendent saying that he would desist intake of food from August 18 to attain Jeeva samadhi, a practice said to have used by hermits and sages in the past. Murugan is a life-convict in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and had spent more than 26 years in jail so far, without even getting a parole. Murugans wife Nalini, who is also a convict, had approached the high court seeking parole to attend her daughters wedding.There are seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, namely, Perarivalan, Murugan, Shantan, Robert Pais, Nalini, Jayakumar and Ravichandran. Nalini was initially awarded death sentence, which was later converted to life imprisonment by the state government.
Besides her, four others, including her husband Murugan were sentenced to death and three others to a life term by the Supreme Court for their role in the assassination of the former Prime Minister on May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbadur by LTTE suicide bomber Dhanu.
The apex court later citing an inordinate delay in disposing of their mercy petitions commuted the death sentence of the other three. No convict in Rajiv assassination case was given parole by the jail official from the day they were lodged in prison after conviction. Only two convicts got paroles based on a court order. -

Reimbursement programme to enable heart surgeries to be done at private hospitals
The Government will shortly introduce a reimbursement programme to enable heart patients get their surgeries done at private hospitals, Parliamentary Reforms and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The minister was addressing the media at Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday.
With this move, heart patients will no longer be required to wait in the waiting lists of government hospitals. They can get their surgeries done in private hospitals and the Government will pay for it, he said.
The Government early this month also announced a drastic price reduction of heart stents. Accordingly, the maximum retail price of a bare metal stent has been fixed at Rs.24,000 and the maximum price of a drug-eluting stent has been fixed at Rs.105,000.
Stents are provided free of charge for heart patients who undergo surgeries in state hospitals.

A revolutionary leukaemia treatment could soon be approved
A revolutionary gene therapy treatment for leukaemia is awaiting a thumbs-up in the US and could change the game in countering the disease.
If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the treatment in September, CTL019 will be the first gene therapy allowed for clinical use in the US  and the fourth in the world, following Glybera and Strimvelis, two gene- therapy products recently approved in Europe for two genetic diseases, and Gendicine (for cancer) in China in 2004.
CTL019 is a custom-made, personalised drug developed by the University of Pennsylvania and health company Novartis. The treatment consists of a single shot of immune cells reprogrammed to kill the patients specific leukaemic cells.
Clinical trials show remarkable results. Originally tested in 30 patients affected by resistant acute B-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)  an aggressive blood cancer  CTL019 induced complete remission (meaning that the leukaemia vanished) in 90 per cent of patients. The trial was later extended to 50 patients and resulted in a similar remission rate, which is extremely high for ALL.
ALL accounts for 25 per cent of all cancer in children. The standard treatment is based on chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation. If the standard treatment fails, a bone marrow donor is unavailable or the patient relapses, there are no other therapeutic options and the chances of survival are slim. It is estimated that 15 per cent of cases do not respond to standard treatment.
CTL019 represents a major opportunity for these children. Indeed, families of children affected by ALL, whose lives were saved by CTL019, strongly advocated for its approval.
How it works
The treatment is the result of more than 20 years of research in the fields of molecular biology, virology and haematology. The administration of CTL019 is a lengthy procedure. Immune cells called T cells are taken from the patient using a procedure similar to blood collection.
The cells are then grown and genetically modified in a laboratory for expression of a molecule receptor called CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) which is able to recognise CD19, a molecule widely expressed on B-leukemic cells. The genetically modified immune cells are then administered back to the patient in a procedure which resembles a transfusion.
It is unclear how long the CTL019 reprogrammed cells will persist in the patients circulation and whether this should be a reason to worry or celebrate. It is not fully understood whether they will remain for long periods of time and go on to harm the patient, for example, or persist and offer protection from any further leukaemic growth.
In the lab, CTL019 has been added to T cells by inserting specific genes inside the T cells using viruses as vectors for the genetic transfer. This is also the system used in the Strimvelis and Glybera treatments.
The approach exploits the natural ability of certain viruses to infect cells and introduce genes into them. The vectors used are not virulent and therefore they are not able to cause a disease, but they can add genes to the human genome.
The first trials using this type of approach didnt fully take into consideration the potential harm of inserting a gene into a random sequence of human DNA. The results had a tragic setback: in 2002, a gene therapy patient developed a leukaemia. This had a profound impact on public opinion.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to improve the methodology and vector design in order to reduce the risks. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of such new treatments are unknown and patients will need to be under close monitoring for 15 years.
As scientists, we all hope and work hard to find a definitive cure for all cancers. We dont know yet if the patients that undertook the CTL019 trials can be considered cured or whether they will eventually relapse. But this drug is an opportunity to prolong the survival of patients that currently have no other option. In the meantime, we will celebrate every success in the battle to prolong the survival of cancer patients.
An analogous protocol called UCART19, is also under development at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.
In 2015, a one-year-old baby affected by refractory ALL was the first patient ever treated with UCART19. The brilliant results led to the development of a phase I clinical trial.
No treatment can be considered 100 per cent safe. For every patient, there are risks and benefits to take into consideration. Nevertheless, CTL019 has produced some excellent results and the side effects have been managed well. At the moment, this treatment is a very promising option for patients with relapsed ALL. Lets hope it saves lives.

A right royal drubbing for Sri Lanka
DAMBULLA: Sri Lanka squandered a great start by the top order to lose the first one-day international to India by nine wickets at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium yesterday.
Invited to bat first on a slow batting track Sri Lanka raced away to 139-1 by the halfway mark but lost their last nine wickets for just 77 runs in the next 19 overs to finish with a disappointing total of 216 that hardly proved competitive to an Indian side that had one of the strongest batting line ups in contemporary one-day cricket.
So it was no surprise to see India powered by opener Shikhar Dhawans eleventh one-day century and his third against Sri Lanka cruise to victory to go one-up in the five-match series. India finished on 220 for one in 28.5 overs to record their biggest win in terms of balls to spare  127.
Dhawan who was not in the original squad for the Test series that India won 3-0 but subsequently recalled following the injury to Murali Vijay carried his exceptional form into the one-day game by striking his third hundred of the tour 132 not out off 90 balls inclusive of 20 fours and three sixes. He had won the Man of the Series in the Tests with two big hundreds at Galle (190) and at Pallekele (119).
With skipper Virat Kohli also weighing in with his 44th one-day fifty  82 not out off 70 balls (10 fours, 1 six) Dhawan put the result of the match beyond doubt by sharing an unbroken second wicket partnership of 197 off 143 balls following the early loss of Rohit Sharma for four off a run out when his bat got jammed in the ground trying to beat Chamara Kapugederas direct hit from cover point.
The way man-of-the-match Dhawan batted he seemed to be toying with the Lankan bowling on a docile pitch which the Lankan batsmen failed to make full use of. Sri Lanka had a chance of getting his wicket at 120 but lo and behold the captain Upul Tharanga who had spoken a lot about improving the fielding in the pre-match press conference dropped him on 120 at mid-on off Lasith Malinga.
Niroshan Dickwella and Dhanushka Gunathilaka produced another solid opening partnership laying the foundation for a competitive total when they put on 74 off 14 overs. The stand was broken when Gunathilaka who was well set at 35 tried to reverse sweep off-spinner Kedar Jadhav and hit the ball straight to extra cover.
Kusal Mendis who replaced him helped Dickwella add a further 65 for the second wicket before the rot started. Jadhav trapped Dickwella lbw on the sweep shot for 64 and Mendis playing too much across the line was done in by the left-arm spin of Axar Patel for 36.
From there onwards Sri Lankas batting lost direction as the batsmen got out to some poor shots and allowed India get back into the game. Once they got a grip of things the Indian spinners simply strangled the batting with some intelligent bowling that led to some desperate shot making.
The later order batsmen and the tail forgot that there was a frontline batsman Angelo Mathews at the other end and simply threw away their wickets instead of trying to help him bat out the full quota of overs.
Mathews was left high and dry on 36 not out desperately seeking a partner who could hang around with him. Patel ended up with his best figures in ODI cricket taking 3 for 34.
The two teams meet up at Pallekele on August 24 and 27 for the second and third ODIs. - ST

Samurdhi will not be curtailed: Duminda
The Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake assured that Samurdhi relief would not be abolished or limited. He said false propaganda campaign was launched by some bankrupt politicians that the Samurdhi would be done away with by the Government.
Minister Dissanayake said a Cabinet decision was made recently after looking into the loopholes and defects in the present Samurdhi granting system and remedial steps would be taken to provide more benefits to the recipients.
He said the President declared a year for abolishing poverty to empower the livelihood of low income families.
The former government allocated Rs. 14 billion to provide Samurdhi. The fund was later doubled. Those who were denied Samurdhi dividends although they were eligible to receive it would be offered the benefit forthwith. We will look into the complaints in this regard and will provide the benefit to everyone who deserve it. The shortcomings of the present system would be addressed, the minister said.

Searching for Stanley Kunitzs Garden
The road to Provincetown is a dead-end street. The spit of land it sits on, so slim theres only one way in and one out, perched as it is like a ball at the tip of a seals nose. Looking at the Cape on a map, the peninsula resembles a fish hook tossed out into the open Atlantic by the mainland to see what proverbial fish in the sea might find available for the reeling in and keeping. Cape Cod thus turns in on itself and Provincetown faces not Open Ocean but Plymouth, Massachusetts, home to the rock where the Mayflower landed in 1620 and the pilgrims disembarked to begin building the idea of a new England. This is Pilgrim country.
I was playing pilgrim.
It was Memorial Day weekend and, wanting to maximize the extra leisure time at my disposal, I had escaped Philadelphia, where I had been logging 12-hour days in front of a screen and eating too much instant shells and cheese after 8pm. For company, Id invited a man I was seeing, Josh, a documentary filmmaker from Manhattan by way of Kentucky.
Good opportunity
Wed met through friends a number of years back but only begun dating a few months earlier, traveling between our respective cities on weekends as we tried to get a better feel for each other. This three-day weekend had seemed a good opportunity to make some progress in that department, so we made a plan to get some sun, some beach, some fried fish, and to do something about which Id recently gotten a bee in my bonnet: pay my respects the late poet Stanley Kunitz by visiting his summer cottage and garden, neither of which are open to the public.
Ever since my college poetry professor had passed around a copy of Kunitzs Robin Redbreast, hed become a poet to whose work I found myself returning over the years, often finding in it whatever solace I sought at this point or that as my early twenties gave way to my late-twenties and those to thirty and so on. In Robin Redbreast Kunitz describes an encounter with the dingiest bird you ever saw and relates how he picked up the injured animal and felt its heart throbbing in his hand. He lifts the bird up, encouraging it to fly off, only to discover a hole in its head where the hunters brand / had tunneled out his wits, and through that hole, the cold flash of the blue / unappeasable sky. I remember taking the photocopy home and pinning it to my bulletin board, never hearing the phrase like a hole in my head quite the same way again.
Graduating seniors
When the time came, that same poetry professor had hosted a dinner at her house for her graduating seniors. For each us she made a small bag of souvenirs, complete with a line of poetry she said reminded her of us. In my bag was a line from Kunitzs poem The Layers, that said, [N]o doubt the next chapter / in my book of transformations / is already written. / I am not done with my changes. Its a poem I now give to my own students in the introductory creative writing class I teach, and when I read it aloud for them, I pause a little longer at the end of it than I do with other poems, wondering whether these children on the cusp of adulthood understand yet what change means.
Had I considered it, it probably would have dawned on me that Memorial Day weekend in Provincetown might be a madhouse, which it was. Driving into town on that gray, misty Friday evening there were women everywhere, swarming the town like ants on honey. They filled sidewalks, walked abreast down the middle of streets, hung from windows, congregated on balconies, on lawns, outside of bars, in couples and larger groups. It was a joyous if alternate universe, and Josh and I stared at each other wide-eyed bafflement, wondering what it was wed just driven into.
A quick google as we sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting for the walls of women to part and make way for slow-moving vehicles, revealed the mystery: Womens Weekend, known more colloquially as Baby Dyke Weekend because its marketed to the under-35 set.
Town slogan
Apparently, every Memorial Day, lesbians flock to Provincetown by the thousands. Think David Byrnes Independence Day: Hey mister, hey lady, hey sisters, walking hand in hand, Well be lovers, in the open, Well be lovers on Independence Day. Hand in hand, hand in hand, hand in hand, hand in hand . . . The song sounds like a block party in the name of human love and I smiled, thinking how the town slogan, the Birthplace of American Liberty, had become more apt than its founders could have ever anticipated.
Aside from boasting the highest proportion of same-sex couples of any zip code in the country, Provincetown is also an artists colony.
Thats what attracted Kunitz and his third wife, Elise Asher, a painter, to the town in the late 1950s. When the vibrancy of the artistic community theyd initially come for appeared to be waning, he co-founded the Fine Arts Work Center.
Art fellowship
His love of Provincetowns seclusion and his need for the vibrancy of its cultural life reflects the push and pull he felt between the rural and urban. While he believed art withers without fellowship, he also said that he was more at peace with himself when in daily contact with the natural world.

Seethawaka Export Processing Zone  to be more environmental friendly
With the passing of time and investments gaining momentum, activities have diversified at Seethawaka Export Processing Zone (SEPZ). It has become necessary to address the environmental issues very soon.
The issues at SEPZ Concerning waste could be characterized into two main categories: hazardous waste disposal and non-hazardous waste disposal.
There are 26 factories operating in the Zone and the solid waste generated by their manufacturing activities are directly dumped at the dump yard. There are five factories who regularly send out the waste for disposal to Central Environment Authority approved facilitators.
Each day, around 12 MT of waste is dumped at the yard. Villagers from the surrounding areas are permitted to collect whatever they can find from the dump yard and eke out a living.
The balance waste remains collecting daily at the yard. The dump yard waste comprises fabric off cuts, polythene, papers, card board, rubber and wooden debris. For more than 12 years the dump yard at the SEPZ located on a higher elevation in the Zone has been storing all the solid waste.
Steps are now being taken to sort the waste into distinct categories, so that open tender procedures could be followed to dispose the waste. This will assist to keep the zone environmentally clean and friendly.
In Sri Lanka, unfortunately the disposal of solid waste does not have a concrete solution as yet. There is no agency that is competent to handle solid waste management efficiently and in an eco-friendly manner.
The dump yard at SEPZ during warm weather has a very high tendency to catch fire and has to be controlled fast, thus preventing it spreading to the adjoining enterprises. We as a nation are very slow in handling environmental issues seriously.
Government should collect proposals from bidders to set up projects that could assist in waste management and also that promote recycling and reusing solid waste. Such projects should be encouraged with special incentives to overcome this major issue.
We at SEPZ are in the process of establishing a sorting shed to segregate the waste and to take measures to call bids to dispose the accumulated waste amongst interested parties.
In order for the SEPZ to obtain the environment protection license it is of prime importance that solid waste disposal issue is looked into fast.
The most problematic hazardous waste generated is sludge from the operation of effluent treatment plants. There are 13 hazardous waste generating industries at SEPZ. Daily around 8 MT of industrial sludge is generated.
This is dumped into the sanitary landfill which is now filled to the brim and cannot accommodate any more. In addition to the industrial sludge, the common waste water treatment plant also generates 17 MT of sludge per day.
Industrial sludge is disposed of by finding temporary solutions. Considering the urgency of the issue a new sanitary landfill is to be constructed soon.
It is a well-known fact that many industrially developed countries today use solid waste generated through industrial activities, as a source generating energy.
Public-private partnerships could and should be encouraged for this purpose.
Land could be provided by the state, while expertise from Government sources and investment from the investor community will assist to set up solid waste management projects. Presently investments with dry operations are only encouraged at SEPZ.
During the rainy season the dump yard can become a breeding source for dengue and other diseases. When plastic containers and water retraining debris are stacked in the dump yard with the rains setting in, it will eventually breed dengue mosquitoes. Therefore periodically preventive measures are taken to clean this area. By this regular monitoring practice the spread of dengue is prevented.
Not only the Zone at Seethawaka but also the country is faced with a serious problem with the accumulation of disposable and undisposable waste.
Recently the Meethotamulla dump with tons of waste collapsed, killing a few and causing a serious threat to the people living in the vicinity. Yet even to date no concrete solution has yet been arrived at by the Government.
The BOI has the massive task of promoting foreign direct investments and also create employment opportunities by opening new industrial zones. My question is, how are we to handle the solid waste disposal Are we geared to face this issue
At SEPZ, we are studying many proposals, evaluating these proposals and trying to arrive at the best solution. That is to sort out, then segregate and dispose the waste by inviting bidders to buy the waste. The remaining solid waste which is hazardous has to be incinerated. Cost should not be the deciding factor but time and fast results should be placed as first priority to resolve this matter.

Setting up of NEC will not abolish CCEM: Gayantha
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by the Prime Minister will not be abolished with the setting up of National Economic Council (NEC) headed by the President, Parliamentary Reforms and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The minister was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday. The minister said the recommendations and proposals of the CCEM and the NEC would finally reach the Cabinet, and the Cabinet could either endorse or reject them after careful consideration.
The CCEM chaired by the PM over the past several months took decisions on many projects and investments, and economic affairs and those were submitted to the Cabinet for consideration. The Presidents proposal in setting up the NEC is to make it the central decision making body on all economic affairs. Both will be answerable to the Cabinet, the minister said.
The Cabinet last week approved the Presidents proposal to set up the NEC. The NEC chaired by the President will comprise the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, Central Bank Governor and Secretary to the Treasury among others.
The CCEM was appointed following a Cabinet decision on September 22, 2015. According to the Performance Report of Prime Ministers Office, the CCEM had conducted 43 meetings from January to December 2016, and it has given 931 decisions/policy directives mainly on key economic issues related to National Policies and Economic Affairs, Finance, Development Strategies and International Trade, Transport and Civil Aviation, Ports and Shipping, Power and Renewable Energy, Highways and Public Enterprises Development.
Minister Karunathilake commenting on the criticisms directed at Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said he too holds the opinion that legal actions pertaining to certain cases related to large scale corruption and fraud have been unduly delayed.
"This is the widely held public opinion and it was reverberated in the UNP Working Committee and the Parliamentary Group meeting. We have to deliver on our pre-election promises. We, by no means, want to interfere in judiciary, but we see that the current pace of these investigations is sluggish.
The law should be implemented against the wrong doers, may they be in the previous government or this government, the minister said.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.90% W-o-W (or LKR 26.42Bn) to LKR 2,918.38Bn cf. LKR 2,944.80Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 60.84% (or LKR 1.99Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by HNB, Sampath Bank, LOLC, Commercial Bank, Com. Credit, NDB & HNB[X] which accounted for 93.13% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 24.35% (or LKR 0.80Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH & Browns Capital which accounted for 83.0% of the sector turnover.
The Manufacturing Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 5.24% (or LKR 0.17Bn) to the market driven by Chevron, Tokyo Cement, Tokyo Cement[NV] & Grain Elevators which accounted for 55.27% of the sector turnover.

Point of view
Share markets fell for the 5th consecutive week, losing ~56 points W-o-W to close at 6436.28 points amid low retail participation and mixed Q217 corporate results.
Markets which lost ~85 points during the start of the week, closed at a 4-month low on Thursday, but reversed its losing streak on Friday to add ~28 points which helped wipe-off some of the weeks early losses.
Nevertheless, the negative sentiment that has pre-dominated markets over the past five weeks continued to dampen actitivty, resulting in the Benchmark ASPI losing ~330 points over this 5-week period and dragging the Y-T-D returns on the Index to 3.3% (cf. 8.6% recorded five weeks ago).
Average turnover levels for the week however amounted to LKR 0.65Bn, ~45% higher than last weeks average of LKR 0.45Bn amid greater Institutional, HNI & Foreign participation. Crossings for the week consequently accounted to 49% of total market turnover, with large parcels traded in HNB (44% of crossings), Sampath (32% of crossings) and JKH (16% of crossings).
Net foreign flows too improved to LKR 0.98Bn, 394% higher than last week as foreigners continued to support equity markets for the 29th consecutive week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the Inland Revenue Bill which is expected to be passed by Parliament next Friday (Aug 25th).
June quarter earnings mixed
Corporate earnings over the June17 quarter have been mixed, with ~54% of the 214 companies that have reported thus far recording Y-o-Y gains.
Earnings of the approx. 75% of corporates who have reported so far has totaled LKR 36Bn compared to the LKR 50Bn reported by all corporates in June16 and relative to LKR76Bn reported (by total market) in the March17 quarter.
Compared to last year (June 16) when ~76% of the market reported total earnings of LKR40Bn, the June 17 results of the 75% of corporates who have reported so far has fallen marginally to LKR36 Bn reflecting the pressures on the economy from the drought and flood impact earlier this year.
Sri Lankas new Inland Revenue bill meanwhile is to be presented next week and is expected to be passed by end-week1, with the Finance Ministry adding that many of the concerns raised by both the private sector and all the concerns raised by the Supreme court having been addressed.
The Finance Ministry also announced the removal of the 10% telecom data levy, while revising import levies on vehicles such as motorcycles, single cabs and mini trucks, adding that these measures along with several credit schemes targeting SMEs and exporters were aimed at promoting job growth and entrepreneurship.

## Title: A solution to Sri Lankas fast bowler injuries
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports

A solution to Sri Lankas fast bowler injuries
A solution to Sri Lankas constant injuries to their fast bowlers could be at hand if the authorities who control cricket at school and national levels take the views expressed by Senarath Alwis seriously.
The real problem originates from the under 13 and under 15 age group players, said Alwis, a former junior coach of Bangladesh, junior cricket coach of Royal College (under 13, 15 and 17) for 12 years, a Level 4 cricket coach and ex-director Physical Education, University of Colombo.
It was while coaching Royal that I stumbled across the mystery behind why fast bowlers of the national team suffer from injuries constantly, he said.
According to Alwis prior to 1996 an under 13 cricketer would play with a leather ball weighing 4 ounce and the distance between wickets was 20 yards. For the under 15 cricketer it was the same ball but he would bowl at the normal length of 22 yards. This way Alwis said there was no extra strain on the young cricketer.
But where the issue erupted was when Sri Lanka sent a team to participate at the Lombard under 15 challenge cup in England in 1996 where the boys had to bowl with the standard ball used for first-class and international matches weighing 5 ounces.
The change that came into place at the time placed a heavy burden on the young bowler to deliver a ball much heavier and to a greater distance. When he tries to do that the muscles and nerves gets damaged and tear, said Alwis.
A boy develops his body from ages 12 upto 16 and during that time when he gets an injury of this nature it will remain with him right throughout his career. When they are young such injuries dont trouble them so much and they continue to play with it. It is when they come to the under 19 level and from there progress to club and A team levels and the matches and training becomes hectic, the injury inside also grows and becomes a major issue, he observed.
In the past six years there are 21 fast bowlers who have suffered injuries. They get some treatment and return to play and after some time that injury recurs again. In the national cricket team today there isnt a single bowler who has not suffered an injury.
A fast bowler cannot play a series of three matches without breaking down. This is not the only reason for injuries but it is one of the key factors I believe.
The problem began after the 1996 under 15 tournament where the schools and education department authorities stuck to that rule instead of reverting to the existing one. Alwis cited examples of fast bowlers like Chaminda Vaas, Pramodya Wickremasinghe and Ravindra Pushpakumara who never suffered the types of injuries todays bowlers undergo because they played school cricket in the pre-1996 era.
You may question why that age rule does not affect other cricket nations. The reason is India and Pakistan always field players who are over age. Although they say they are under 15 in actual fact they are under 17, I experienced this while I was coaching in Bangladesh. As for the players from European countries like England, Australia, New Zealand etc they are brought up on good nutrition and have good physique. In Sri Lanka it cannot happen because an over age player gets reported quickly by someone who will send in a petition against him, so Sri Lanka always sends players in the proper age group, said Alwis.
Alwis stated that when this rule was implemented the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) president was R.D.M.P. Weeratunga who was also the principal of Thurstan College.
When I explained this rule change and the effect it had on the young cricketers he readily accepted my views but nothing was done thereafter to change it, said Alwis. There are about 500-1000 young cricketers affected by this age rule.
Another vital point that Alwis brought out was the change in the age qualification rule that stands today at January 1 for all age groups.
When you make it January 1 an under13 child born in December has to play in the under 15 tournament. So what happens when a 12-year-old boy tries to bowl with a 5 ounce ball He will resort to throw it instead of bowl because he does not have the strength to bowl such a heavy ball a distance of 22 yards. This is the cause of so many schoolboy bowlers resorting to throwing, said Alwis.
One of the reasons why we dont have good quality spinners coming out of schools is that the junior cricketer trying to bowl with a heavy ball eventually ends up bowling at medium pace because he finds it difficult to flight the heavy ball at that age. So they bowl flat and fast.
Alwis said that he failed to understand why Sri Lanka Cricket or the Schools Association are still sticking to that age group rule which is ruining the development of our fast bowlers.
That age group rule was implemented only for a one-off under 15 tournament in England and it has never been played since, why we should still stick to it is certainly baffling, said Alwis.
I have delved into an area which no one has touched on before. I am talking through my experience.
Alwis said if the age group qualification is restored to September 1 for under 13 and May 1 for under 15 and the ball used for under 15 is changed to 4 ounces as it was before it would drastically cut down on the number of injuries to fast bowlers and the effect will be felt within the next 3-5 years.He hoped the cricket authorities would take serious notice of this malady and take steps to make the necessary changes that is affecting the nations cricket at the moment.

Spain hunts Barcelona carnage suspect
SPAIN: A grief-stricken Barcelona Sunday commemorated the victims of two devastating terror attacks at a mass in the citys Sagrada Familia church, as police hunted for a Moroccan man believed to be the driver that killed 14 people.
As investigators scrambled to piece together the attacks, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said Saturday the cell behind the carnage that also injured 120 and plunged the country into shock had been dismantled, though local authorities took a more cautious tone.
Police said they had cast a dragnet for 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who media reports say was the driver of a van that smashed into people on Barcelonas busy Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday.
An extensive operation including roadblocks was deployed across Catalonia on Saturday afternoon, police said, urging people not to disclose information about the checkpoints. Two days after the assaults that struck the busy tourist hub and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils, Spaniards put on a defiant front while mourning the victims, with crowds out in force to greet King Felipe and Queen Letizia as they arrived to pay homage to the victims.
Slogans like Las Ramblas is crying but alive were seen on shop windows, while a convoy of taxis with Were not afraid plastered on their windows sounded their horns.
People are coming here like they are seeking comfort from others, said Sergio Lopez, 36, whose family runs a kiosk on the main tourist thoroughfare.
Following the 10:00 am mass at Gaudis Sagrada Familia, nearly 100,000 people gathered at Barcelonas Camp Nou stadium yesterday for their teams first game of the season, to be marked by a minute of silence for the victims.
Hours after the Barcelona carnage, a similar attack struck in the seaside town of Cambrils early Friday. Police shot and killed the five attackers in Cambrils, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts.
The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, believed to be its first in Spain. The terror cell in Spain reportedly comprised at least 12 young men, some of them teenagers. Investigators have been homing in on the small town of Ripoll, at the foot of the Pyrenees, where many of the suspects -- including Abouyaaqoub -- lived.
On Saturday, police raided the apartment of an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, according to his flatmate who gave his name only as Nourddem.
But Spanish daily El Pais, quoting police sources, said the imam might have been one of those killed in an explosion in a home in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Barcelona, where the alleged jihadists were believed to have been building bombs. A waiter at a Ripoll cafe told AFP he had served beers to some of the suspects numerous times, most recently just two days ago. Police said they believed the suspects were planning a much larger attack.
And as the hunt for Abouyaaqoub gathered pace, a white van linked to the attacks was found in Spain, said French authorities, who had earlier been warned by their Spanish colleagues that the vehicle may have crossed into France.
Victims of the attack came from three dozen countries including Algeria, Australia, China, France, Ireland, Peru and Venezuela, reflecting Barcelonas status as Spains most popular tourist destination.
Fifty-four people are still in hospital, including 12 in critical condition, Catalan emergency services said. With the peak summer tourism season still in full swing, the Spanish government ordered security ramped up in crowded places, though it kept the terror threat level at four out of a maximum five, Zoido said. - AFP

The task before Minister Marapana
New Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana appears set to clean the Augean Stables. Soon after assuming office, the well known lawyer and President's Counsel assured that he would initiate action to probe allegations against Sri Lankan diplomats, including charges of corruption and misbehaviour. The Minister was responding to concerns raised by Chief Incumbent of Nalandaramaya, Ven.Thiniyawala Palitha Thera that there were many charges against the conduct of some personnel posted to foreign missions but none of them have been brought to book. The Ven. Thera prevailed on the minister that the corrupt and the unqualified be recalled from their foreign postings. The Thera said that there were 37 non career diplomats in Sri Lankan missions worldwide and that was enough for the downfall of the Foreign Service.
Minister Marapana, known for his honesty and integrity and who would not hesitate to call a spade a spade, we are certain, would not brook any political interference in the matter of diplomatic appointments and will no doubt act in the best interest of the country and our foreign relations. Needless to say, our foreign service has reached a scandalous state with square pegs in round holes occupying important positions in overseas missions. Things reached the nadir when our Ambassador to the Court of St. James, no less, was assaulted by a political thug of the Rajapaksa regime who is still roaming free with no action taken. Not only that, another envoy, a nephew of the former President, is today on the run from the law in connection with a murder and a multimillion dollar arms deal. Can anything be more worse for the country's reputation
Minister Marapana, it is hoped, would undertake a full cleanup of the foreign service and weed out the misfits and undesirables. His, of course, will be a tough job, given that there are still elements of the Rajapaksa regime manning important positions in the Foreign Ministry wielding influence and clout and who work against the interests of the Yahapalanaya government.
It (the foreign service) has also acquired the reputation of being an employments agency and a refuge for the boys and the gals of political panjandrums. All governments are guilty for this state of affairs, with the country losing on the long run. Political rejects and those requested to stand down from contesting elections are more often than not the first choice preferences for foreign postings, with the country not benefiting in any way. It is also party time for the kith and kin of politicians, their friends, relatives who are given plum appointments in our foreign missions. A close kinsman of the former President, with no qualification whatsoever, was made ambassador to the US, no less. That worthy, it is said, was concentrating his energies in furthering his business interests in that country with the least attention being paid to his job, for which he was being paid by the tax payer. The outcrop of this was that the Sri Lankan government being compelled to enlist the services of PR firms in the US to promote the image of the country spending millions of dollars. The individual in question also had the ignominy of having to spend a stint at the state guest house for a large scale swindle while being our ambassador to the US. There was also an instance where a Lankan diplomat had decamped after serving his stint oversees, sullying the image of the country.
It is hoped that Minister Marapana will stand up to political pressure and desist from appointing misfits to man our foreign missions. Career diplomats should receive priority in foreign postings. Today, it is no secret that our career diplomats are a disillusioned lot, having being overlooked for important assignments in preference to political favourites. There should be a clearly laid down ratio for foreign postings between career and non career diplomats, with the former receiving the lion's share, as was adopted during the time of Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. This is not to say diplomatic posts should not be filled with those outside the foreign service. In the past there have been non career diplomats who have excelled in the job and served the country with distinction. It has also been the trend to appoint misfits and political stooges for second tier positions in our foreign missions. These persons serve no purpose other than being a burden on the tax payer and are open to corrupt practices. They, more often than not, make use of the opportunity to educate their children in the destination country and are wont to stay put once their tour of duty is over. There was once such a specimen who sought asylum in a western country on the grounds that he was being persecuted in his own country.
Minister Marapana, no doubt, will have a tough job in bringing order out of chaos in our foreign service. He will also have to overcome the intrigue latent in the service, particular among those who have dug in their heels and resent intrusion into their well guarded preserves.

Teaching them to speak
Beginning in the Middle Ages and continuing well beyond the eighteenth century, medical treatments were devised in an effort to cure deafness. Many were violent, yielding illness, suffering, and at times death: Hot coals were forced into the mouths of the deaf to get them to speak by the force of the burning. Catheters were inserted through the nostrils, twisting them through the nasal cavity and into the Eustachian tubes and injecting burning liquids.
Wide holes were drilled into the crown of a young girls skull so she could hear through the openings. Severe blistering agents were applied to the neck, scorching it from nape to chin with a hot cylinder full of magical burning leaves. Adhesive cotton was applied and set afire; vomitories and purgative agents were used; hot needles were injected into the mastoids, or the mastoids were removed altogether. One French doctor threaded the necks of deaf students with seton needles and, with a hammer, fractured the skulls of a number of deaf children just behind the ear. All of these practices were based on the idea that drilling, cutting, fracturing, scorching, or poisoning would open up the ear, the brain, and the body to the world of sound.
Sounds reproduced
Sixteenth-century Europe also saw a bloodless but equally ineffectual approach to treating the deaf, one concerned less with the intelligibility of speech and more with reproducing its sounds. The century marked the beginning of the oralist movement, which contended that the deaf should abjure their signs and learn to speak, a practice motivated in part by a central problem for aristocratic families in Europe with deaf children: they had to be able to speak in order to inherit. And so the influence of those who taught the deaf grew.
One of the most well known among those teachers was Juan Pablo Bonet, a Spaniard. Bonet and those who followed him were either charlatans or incompetents; they mistook their students inability to speak for ignorance, and they not only failed to acknowledge but also prohibited their students from using their own language. In 1620, Bonet published the first known work on teaching the deaf to speak, Reduccin de las letras y arte para ensear a ablar los mudos (The Simplification of Letters and the Art of Teaching the Mute to Speak). In it, he writes that the deaf are inferior beings, monsters of nature and human only in form. He claimed he could cure them with his scientific art. But what was that art
First, Bonet was to teach the deaf how to make the simple sounds the letters represent, adding a curious analysis of the origin of Roman letters that purports to show how each letter represents the shape of the mouth as it makes the sound.
The two loops in the letter B, for example, depict our convex lips as we puff on them just before releasing the voiced air.
The C shows the shape made by our open mouth and a throat blocked by an arched tongue curved at the back to touch the edges of the soft palate. P has only a single loop because the expiration of unvoiced air acts primarily on the upper lip. G is like C but with the jaw extended a bit, giving us the shelf at the base of the Gs opening. The A, turned ninety degrees, is the mouth forming a trumpet as it makes the sound.
The As transversal is there to emphasize that, just like at the dentists office, the mouth has to stay open.
Simple sounds
Bonet then tells us what needs to be done: First the teacher shows the student how to make the simple sounds of the letters by shining a light on his own mouth as he utters them, using a leather replica of a tongue to help illustrate its movements, thus avoiding the messy business of put[ting] ones fingers into the students mouth.
Some letters, Bonet tells us, are quite simple. To form the letter f, for example, the mute blows out air while keeping the upper teeth pressed on the lower lip, holding the tongue immobile.

An unbeaten half-century from Chamari Atapattu led Yorkshire Diamonds to victory over Loughborough Lightning in the womens Super League.
Rain saw the match reduced to 13 overs per side, before Atapattus 66 off 40 balls helped the Diamonds post 110-5.
England seamer Katherine Brunt took two wickets in two overs, bowling Amy Jones and trapping Ellyse Perry lbw, as Lightning fell to 13-2.
Georgia Elwiss hit 41 but could not stop her side falling to a 17-run loss.
Sri Lanka all-rounder Atapattus 66 not out, which included nine fours and two huge sixes, was her first half-century since she smashed an unbeaten 178 in the World Cup against Australia in June.
The 27-year-old also took 2-11 in three overs, bowling Australian opener Elyse Villani before having Lightning captain Elwiss caught at cover, as the hosts struggled at Haslegrave.
A third loss of the tournament for Lightning, who reached last years Finals Day, leaves qualifying for the knockout stages unlikely.  BBC

You Are What You Say
As always, last week too, after a two-hour visit I left the home of one of my former lecturers at Uni, who, without doubt is the best teacher I have ever known, with a mind full of useful tidbits and a million questions that awaited to be explored further. One question that kept bugging me came up when in our conversation my teacher said there are certain words that are never used these days, like invaluable. I gasped in horror. I had used that very word, in this very space in my article the previous week. When I blurted out, But Miss, I use it all the time, she looked at me for almost a second and said in a dramatic tone, You are a fall back to your parents' generation!
Could this really be true Do I inadvertently use words I had picked up during my childhood, reading every single book on my father's bookshelves which were all published in the 60s and 70s or beyond What kind of image do my readers have of me from the words I use in my articles Can these very words that I am using now, reveal a lot about me
Apparently, the answers are yes, yes, and yes. According to social psychologist James W. Pennebaker of the University of Texas at Austin, the way we write and speak can reveal volumes about our identity and character. After analyzing 400,000 textsincluding essays by college students, instant messages between lovers, chat room discussions, and press conference transcriptshe concluded that words are important keys to someones psychological state.
Other studies too have found that people use language in different ways, and those differences are a function of their personality. The more frequently people use certain words, the more likely it is that they display certain personality traits.
For example, extroverts talk about fun-related stuff:music, party, and food. People with lower EQ (emotional intelligence) are more likely to use emotional and negative words: stress, depressed, angry, and unfortunate. Narcissists talk about themselvesthe number of self-referential words (e.g., I, me, mine, myself, etc.) is indicative of someones self-love and entitlement. Artistic and intellectual individuals use highbrow words, such as narrative, rhetoric, and leitmotiv.
When asked if words really provide a window to the soul Professor Pennebaker, said, when he began analyzing peoples writing and speech, he didnt expect results like this. For instance, when he analyzed poems by writers who committed suicide versus poems by those who didnt, he had thought hed find more dark and negative content words in the suicides poetry. He didntbut he did discover significant differences in the frequency of words like I. Those who were depressed used it more often. In study after study, he kept finding the same thing. When he analyzed military transcripts, he could tell peoples relative ranks based on their speech patternsand, it was the pronouns, articles, conjunctions, and other function words that made a difference, not the content words.
Explaining why function words are important he says, People require social skills to use and understand function words, and theyre processed in the brain differently. They are the key to understanding relationships between speakers, objects, and other people. When we analyze peoples use of function words, we can get a sense of their emotional state and personality, and their age and social class. Prof Pennebaker takes as an example the pronoun-heavy sentence: I dont think I buy it.
When you use this sentence he says You reveal a lot about yourself. Why did you say I dont think I buy it instead of I dont buy it or even Thats ridiculous Pronouns tell us where people focus their attention. If someone uses the pronoun I, its a sign of self-focus. Say someone asks Whats the weather outside You could answer Its hot or I think its hot. The I think may seem insignificant, but its quite meaningful. It shows youre more focused on yourself. Depressed people use the word I much more often than emotionally stable people. People who are lower in status use I much more frequently.
Prof Pennebaker also says we can tell if someone is lying by their use of function words. A person whos lying tends to use we more or use sentences without a first-person pronoun at all. Instead of saying I didnt take your book, a liar might say Thats not the kind of thing that anyone with integrity would do. People who are honest use exclusive words like but and without and negations such as no, none, and never much more frequently. Weve analyzed transcripts of court testimony, and the differences in speech patterns are really clear, explains the Professor.
It appears the words we use reveal our gender as well. Most people think men use I more, because men are more narcissistic and self-congratulatory. Says Prof Pennebaker, But across studies and cultures, we found that women use I, me, and mine more. Women are more self-attentive and aware of their internal state. Men use more articles: a, an, and the. That means men talk about objects and things more. You use articles when youre referring to concrete objects, because articles precede concrete nouns. Women also use more third-person pronounshe, she, and theybecause women talk more about people and relationships, and theyre better at managing them.
In addition, a couples use of we-words when talking to a third party can convey a satisfying relationship. Laboratory studies reveal, when talking about marital disagreements, we-words indicated a good relationship whereas the use of you-words suggested problems. The use of you-words, such as you, your, and yourself, were most apparent in toxic conversationsusually where the two participants were accusing each other of various shortcomings.
Prof. Pennebaker also found that when the language style of two people matched, when they used pronouns, prepositions, articles and so forth in similar ways at similar rates, they were much more likely to end up on a date. This is not because similar people are attracted to each other, Prof. Pennebaker says; people can be very different. It's that when we are around people that we have a genuine interest in, our language subtly shifts. "When two people are paying close attention, they use language in the same way," he says. "And it's one of these things that humans do automatically. They aren't aware of it, but if you look closely at their language, count up their use of "I," and "the," and "and," you can see it. It's right there.
Having read so much, I used an online service to analyze an old copy I had written for the Daily News, (I use 'so' way too much said the analysis) and came up with the following: You are social, generous and imperturbable. You are cheerful,assertive, and respectful of authority. You consider both achieving success and taking pleasure in life to guide a large part of what you do. You seek out opportunities to improve yourself and demonstrate that you are a capable person. And you are highly motivated to enjoy life to its fullest.
And I certainly hope that describes me!
So, the next time you write something or open your mouth to say something, remember, words matter.
[emailprotected]
Your Personality revealed through the words you write
* Powerful people dont tend to say I very much; less powerful people do.
* Using I tends to increase peoples perception of your authenticity.
* If you use a lot of negative words or irony, you may be judged neurotic.
* Extroverts tend to use more positive words.
* If you talk a lot about achievements, youll be seen as conscientious.
* Using the word we creates an instant feeling of familiarity in your reader.
* Using one is very formal and distancing, so be careful of that.
* Likewise, your gender (and the gender of your readers) may dictate how you write. Women tend to talk more and tell more stories, whereas men like to get right to the point.
* Use simple words. If your readers have to reach for the dictionary, they probably wont. And avoid jargon at all costs  remember that you are an expert in your field, but your readers probably arent.
* In addition, using complicated words to try to make yourself seem smarter doesn't work
*Be aspirational. Your message should be something people want to hear (You can do it!) as opposed to something they dont want to think about (It will be hard!).

No dengue patients were reported from the Thalalla area when thousands dengue patients were reported from other areas in the country, Thalalla Public Health Inspector Indika Gunawardena said.
He was participating a beach clean up campaign at the Thalalla beach last Saturday morning (19) along with tourists and hotel employees.
The campaign was initiated by stakeholders in the tourist industry in Devinuwara.
94 dengue cases were reported in the Devinuwara PS area during the last six months but Thalalla had not reported any. 20 were recorded from the Kandegodella. I appreciate the initiative taken by the hotel staff and foreign nationals to clean up mosquito breeding grounds in my area, he said.
Convener of the beach cleanup campaign Lal Jayadewa said tourists arrivals were considerably reduced after the outbreak of dengue. "We should ensure that our area is free of dengue and other
diseases or tourists would not arrive in the region anymore, he said.
A tourist hotel GM Chathura Gajasinghe said many tourists had cancelled their bookings at tourist hotels due to dengue outbreak in the country.
Australian tourist Helen Langston said she joined the campaign seeing the dismal sight of the once beautiful Thalalla beach.
I visit Thalalla regularly and the beach was spotless when I first visited the area. It is sad that the Sri Lankans do not value their beaches. Authorities should place litter bins at places frequented by the public, she said.

We are branded tribesmen when we protect national assets, Rajapakshe
Ports and airports lie on lands handed over to us by our forefathers to be protected for future generations. When we who have obtained a mandate for five years speak about their safety and protection, certain five star politicians brand us as tribesmen, Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting after attending a ceremony held at the Bodhirajaramaya, Thiriyaya Junction, Gomarankadawala, Trincomalee to mark the opening of its water treatment plant.
Minister Rajapakshe said they owned a duty to protect and safeguard country's resources for future generations.
Rajapakshe said they were facing a great challenge and alleged that people who tried to brand them as tribesmen, probably had no proper parents. "We were not ashamed to be branded as tribesmen because we have spoken about protecting our 2,600-year old heritage," he said.
He said the country was experiencing a period of transit when Bhikkhus and the people should rally round to take firm decisions. "We should adopt the practice of Lichchavi Kings in solving problems cropping up in the country. Instead of the Buddhist four noble truths, what have come to the forefront in political platforms today were jealousy, hate, anger and hatred," he said.
"A large number of farmers who supplied our staple diet and their family members have fallen victims to kidney disease. Health authorities had no proper plan to save their lives. The authorities had failed to control dengue because they were preoccupied with other agendas spreading enmity and hatred," the minister said.
"The Raja Rata had recorded 13,457 kidney patients and 127 of them had died during the last four months," Rajapakshe said.
The minister said the time had come to change the 'Thattu Maru' system and vituperative politics. "Today we had a national government dedicated to a new political culture. We have been able to win over the world which had marginalised us as a country. We have risen up as a proud nation once again," the minister said.
"Today we had an independent judiciary which is no second to other independent judiciaries in the world. We had no need to engage foreign judges or lawyers to fight our cases here or abroad, Rajapakshe said.
He said the late Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Thera had once commented that there was no unity among the Sinhalese. "If the Sinhalese, which form the majority community, was disunited, it would lead to division among minority communities." he said.
"Unity of the majority community would always ensure the safety and protection of minorities," Rajapakshe said.

Additional daily Qatar Airways flights to Colombo and Dhaka

Qatar Airways has announced an increase in the number of daily flights to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh due to the continued robust demand from passengers on both destinations.
Qatar Airways revealed in a press release that it increased its Colombo service from four to five flights per day, while it increased Dhaka service from two to three flights per day, commencing from September 1, 2017, just one month after the last frequency increase.
The additional non-stop daily services to and from Colombo and Dhaka will each be serviced by Qatar Airways modern A320s, adding more than 1,000 seats to the current weekly capacity to and from both exciting destinations.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker noted the growth of the business and tourism sectors in these cities, pointing out that these new flights will provide more convenient options for more passengers to travel to and from Doha to many destinations in Europe, America and the Middle East and will enable them to experience Qatar Airways services.
The increased capacity on the Dhaka and Colombo routes represents a major commitment by Qatar Airways to enhance its offering to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Al Baker said, adding that this commitment has been rewarded with the loyalty of many thousands of passengers per month who choose to fly with it.

All Blacks legend Colin Meads dies aged 81
WELLINGTON, Sunday  All Blacks legend Sir Colin Meads died Sunday aged 81 after a long battle with cancer, New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.
Meads, widely known by his nickname Pinetree was regarded as one of the greatest players of the game and is in World Rugby Hall of Fame. Prime Minister Bill English said it was a sad day not only for New Zealand rugby but for the country. Meads was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August last year. The tough lock played 133 matches for the All Blacks between 1957 and 1971, and became recognised throughout the world as the face of New Zealand rugby.
He was not only a great All Black but also a genuinely good New Zealand bloke, English said.
He represented what it means to be a New Zealander. He was no-nonsense, reliable, hardworking, warm and very generous with his time.
I remember when I was younger hearing stories about how he used to shear sheep all day and go running at night.
Meads youngest daughter Shelley Mitchell said her father led a full life. He loved being an All Black and he loved his family dearly. We will miss him terribly.
Meads is survived by his wife Verna, their five children, 14 grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.  AFP

Anandatissa De Alwis
A true godfather
Whenever my dear family friend Manel Abhayarathna calls me, she never fails to ask me why I don't write a piece on my uncle. In her own inimitable style, she would say You were so close to him, so why don't you write about him In today's world of politics and politicians, he stands out as a unique figure. This refrain had been going on for many years whenever she meets me or speaks to me, but has always been an unfinished conversation. But now, with his 21st death anniversary approaching and with me getting older, I thought it is perhaps the right time to put pen to paper and write of my late uncle and godfather. I don't know if he would appreciate it, for he never sought publicity or media spotlight.
Maha Amarasinghege Anandatissa de Alwisjournalist, politician, advertising guru, Member of Parliament, Governor, Cabinet Minister and Speaker of the Housewas a fitting example of a hard working self-made man who made a success of whatever he set his sights on, except for his own benefit.
As my uncle and also as my godfather, though he knew me from the day I was born, I got to know him only when I was a teenager, when he was known as Chief by all who worked for him in the advertising industry and elsewhere.
Though he never once demanded any respect, the reference to Chief seemed to have been created to describe his personality. He carried a certain aura which aptly suited a Chief and though he displayed a stern facade, he was a softie inside.
Chief was a handsome man who carried a magnetic personality and one who was able to get the best of his charges by simply encouraging them to do things on their own. Although I have known him since I was a toddler, I really got to know him after he and his sons Anthony (Sandy) and Ranjith moved in with us to support my family following the sudden death of my fatherthe sole breadwinner in my family. Our family comprised my mother, Elmo, Helen, Frank and myself. He treated us all like his own children and at some stage, all of us played a role in his life. To my dear mother, one of the six sisters Chief helped bring up, the devastating blow of losing her husband at such a young age was somewhat softened by this move as she, much like the rest of the De Alwis girls, adored and hero-worshipped their brother. At times, Chief found this somewhat embarrassing, especially when he discovered that some of his brothers-in-law were not amused by their wives unfailing dedication and loyalty to him!
The Ad industry and JWT
Chief's career in Advertising began with his association with Reggie Candappaa brilliant visualiser and artist who later took Grants Advertising to great heights. With Chief's creative copywriting skills and Reggie Candappa's visualising and artistic skills, they made a formidable team in the local Ad industry. Chief left Grants to take up an offer from J. Walter Thompson's (JWT) International.
My affection for the Advertising Industry took root at an early age when I used to eavesdrop on the discussions at home, some of which went on till late night. I later gathered that they were unofficial plans board meeting and usually comprised a few senior executives form JWT to which Chief had been tasked to resurrect by its Regional Office then located in India.
JWT's head office had decided to wind up in Colombo and had its Regional Head based in India visit Colombo to mop up operations. The late Percy Colombage, who was Chief Advertising Manager of Lake House newspapers, persuaded the man to give it one more try before winding up and introduced Chief to him. The first meeting at Galle Face Hotel had gone well, but to Percy's horror, the second was not promising. The Englishman had been rather curt and after turning up late for the initial twenty-minute interview, had indicated that he will get back to Chief with his decision. At the second, Chief had deliberately delayed in attending the meeting and when the Englishman voiced his displeasure, Chief had retorted that it was he who needed a Manager and that Chief did not need JWT! Much later, they became close friends. Chief was credited for having brought JWT back to leadership in the industry before quitting to take up the position of Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of State under J. R. Jayawardene in 1965.
My late brother Elmo, was also a keen participant at these plans board meetings and assisted in the accounts dept in the early stages, as Chief refused to offer him employment because he was a nephew. Later, on the recommendation of the regional office, Elmo was absorbed to the permanent staff of JWT and was an Accounts Manager until he left to take up a higher posting at AJN Seneviratne and Sons, under Noel Seneviratne. Following the downfall of the then UNP government in 1970, Chief went back to the advertising industry and set up his own.
A nature lover
To Chief, benefits and privileges meant nothing. In fact, as a Cabinet Minister, he was not even aware that he was entitled to a duty-free car permit every once in three years.
Perhaps this lack of interest in material things may have been borne out of the hard life he had as a young man trying to look after six pretty sisters by himself. Struck by the unfortunate and premature commitment commitment of his wife (my father's sister) to a Nursing Home, Chief was quite content with the least in materialism but sought the most in his reading.
After decades in politics and public life, as a former MP, Governor, Speaker and Cabinet Minister, he had not owned a house and died in a rented flat in Colpetty. His wealth was his library which he guarded with unbelievable affection and would only lend to people he identified we 'literary minded.' His love for nature, in particular, flowers, could not be hidden. He began reading volumes about orchids and roses and consulted many experts in the country and the only opportunity he got to try his hand at it was when he was appointed Permanent Secretary and afforded a house with a garden. He wasted little time in developing his garden and spent hours, even at night, minding and even talking to the plants! He once told me that he visited an orchid garden in Thailand and the owner taught him to communicate with the plants; a practice he began in his garden too.
He also developed a liking for cockerels and was once gifted a beautiful pair from Thailand and had them taken care of by one of his sisters living some 10 miles out of Colombo. He would visit them whenever he could, and spend hours with them.
A fascinating conversationalist and orator
Chief held a soft spot for India and marveled at its culture and often quoted great Indian leaders. When the legendary philosopher Krishnamurthy visited Sri Lanka, it was Chief who was tasked to interview him on TV. Ravi Shankar and many other Indians of repute were among his favourites. In a stirring speech in Parliament. Chief once castigated the country for seeking markets in the western world when a huge Indian market was staring us in the face! This was more than 30 years ago and it is only today that we are realizing his vision, albeit slowly.
His ability to speak on virtually any subject was simply amazing. He delighted his audiences with his style of delivery and wit. He was comfortable with any subject, be it, Politics, Art, Literature, Religion, Culture, History and possessed deep insights to the subjects. His wit was observed on numerous occasions both in Parliament and outside.
When I introduced my prospective wife to him. She was visibly nervous and mentioned to him that she felt like been interviewed for a job. Chief responded by telling her not to worry too much as it would be one job interview at which he hoped the applicant would not possess experience!
Though born a Buddhist, he adored the Blessed Virgin Mother and never left his abode without worshiping her image. He could quote from the Dammapada as well as the Bible and also quote Prophet Mohammed and Hindu religious texts.
I also recall an occasion when he wanted to discuss some issues with me and not wanting to be late for a function at which he was the chief guest, asked me to ride with him in the car and discuss the matter during the drive. As we approached the venue, he asked me that the function was about! He had not brought his letter of invitation and was clueless of the occasion. Having reached the hotel where the function was, he was met by the organisers and the GM of the hotel and most reluctantly, I was dragged into an event which I was not even invited to! Though I was embarrassed by the turn of events, I was proud of his performanceno one realized that he did not know what the function was about when he left for it! He sat at the head table on the podium and all he had was a glance at a banner behind him and the one or two known people representing the organisers of the event. The manner in which he enthralled the audience on that occasion left me thanking the good Lord for giving me that opportunity to witness his skills. Many who knew him will vouch for his prowess as an orator of the highest calibre. He would often reminisce his days as a member of the YMCA and the exposure he received there and was proud of his alma materAnanda College, Colombo. There are so many instances which I can recount to illustrate this man and his character, but whoever deems it fit to publish this piece will find it too lengthy.
The introduction of Television to Sri Lanka, the ground work to break the shackles of media monopoly by the State, the guidance to tourism in Sri Lanka, the respect and freedom of the Press and journalists are among the few areas which Chief was able to launch.
Unsung hero
Many in this generation are unaware of the achievements of this man who should surely go down as one of the most humble unsung heroes of this beautiful country which he loved so much and gave up so much for.
Though many friends persuaded him to write books, he never good down to it and would always give a philosophical response and bury the thought. Professor Thilak Ratnakara reiterates this fact when he refers to it in his foreword in the book Collected Speeches of Dr. Anandatissa De Alwis thus, Though this country loses from this extreme reticence on his part, it shows his lack of intellectual arrogance.
This is the only published book I am aware of and that too produced at the initiative of Manel Abhayaratna.
Irwin Weerakkody, former journalist who also excelled in Sinhala copywriting and later establishing Phoenix Advertising, wrote a pamphlet on Chief for his election campaign.
As uncle and nephew, we were very close to each other and as a result, we also had our differences. Fortunately, saner counsel prevailed and I thank God for having given me the opportunity to be among the last to see him on the morning of his 75th birthday which unfortunately was the day before he passed away.
In Christian scripture, it is said that abstaining from food and drink is not the only sacrifice one can make; abstaining from the things you like to do to please yourself is even more meritorious. Chief made many such sacrifices throughout his life time and will have definitely pleased God.

Banker with a big heart
Born inAhangama, he had his early education at Mahinda College, Galle and thereafter graduated from Vidyodaya University. His banking career started with People's Bank immediately after his graduation in 1964. Thereafter, he worked at National Savings Bank, Commercial Bank and finally at Sampath Bank until his retirement. After his retirement, he had short stints with Seylan Bank and the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka.
We came under his wings, when we joined Commercial Bank of Ceylon as junior clerks in 1979. He was the credit officer in charge of our department. As a Manger, he was a very professional banker. As a person, he was a modest gentleman and a humble human being. He worked with great devotion and positive commitment. Gaining popularity was not a concern for him. Gaining wealth was not what he cared for in life.
When Sampath Bank was started in 1987, he joined as the Credit Manager for retail businesses. His passion and commitment to serve small and medium entrepreneurs aligned well with Sampath Banks objective of helping and improving small ventures that may not fit into to the footprint of many other banks. His well-rounded advice and extended helping hand paved the way forward for many small businessmen who were struggling to get their ventures off the ground. The success story is that he was behind the growth of many ventures that are considered market leaders of today. His dream was to see small-timers becoming leading businessmen in Sri Lanka.As a credit manager, he carefully nurtured many junior officers. Although he was our Manager by rank, for us he was a dear friend. Whenever we were faced with a problem he was always there to help us. We vividly remember how he helped one of our junior officers who made a wrong move. It was Silva who came to his rescue. Silva offered to accompany that junior officer to see the chief manager. On behalf of his junior officer, he presented the case to the chief manager and the junior officer accepted the responsibility for the wrongdoing. The chief manager commended that junior officer for being truthful and praised his honesty. If not for Silvas encouragement and guidance, that officer may not have had the courage to go up to the chief manager and would have had to pay heavily for his sins. Silva was always there for his staff members.
We have not seen him in confrontations; may it be with the senior management or with the junior officers of his department. He was a team player; he would stand by decisions of the majority, even though that may not be his preferred choice. Senior management respected him as a manager with a vision. Junior staff members at all levels loved him as a manager they could trust. There are many bankers (holding high positions today) who were trained and mentored by him when they were starting their professional careers. He enjoyed entertaining his friends, colleagues and even his junior staff members. The door of his residence was always open to all those whom he associated with.
With his demise, the country has not only lost the benefit of the depth of his knowledge, wealth of experience and mastery of proven skills in banking which he gained having served banks in various capacities for many years, but also a friend, a mentor and good human being.
He is survived by his loving and devoted wife who is a retired teacher, and his two loving daughters both of whom are now overseas.May he attain Nibbana!

Dr. Upali Mahanama
A friend indeed
In the Sunday Times of July 30, an appreciation was written about Dr. Upali Mahanama by one of his closest friends Mailk Cader, under the heading 'Service to humanity was the best of his work.' I could not agree with him more in his description of Upali.
In 1970, I too had the privilege of being introduced to this wonderful gentleman by the name of Upali. I was later informed that his surname was Mahanama. As we all know, 'maha' means big or great and true to his name, he remained a great friend of mine since that day onwards.
I say this knowing his achievements; some of which I would like to mention below.
He was a versatile cricketer, cricket adminstrator, umpire, MCA president, a vocalist, a speaker of no mean repute, entertainer, compere, cabaret artiste, social worker, director of several companies and truly a great friend!
He was founder president of the Colombo South Jaycees and won six out of nine national awards. He was awarded best Jaycee and his chapter Colombo South won an Asian award for a project called 'operation clean up.'
In 1972, at the JCI conference in Hong Kong, Upali was elected the chairman of the conference's bid committee.
In 1977, he was national president of the Sri Lanka JCs and was awarded the JCI Senatorship; the highest international honour. he was elected JCI World Vice President to Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland.
Some years later, I followed his footsteps in freemasonry and worked closely with him on several charity projects.
While working on various projects, what struck me most about Upali was that if a plan did not work out, he would change the plan, not the goal. The goal remained the same and was achieved. Merits performed throughout his life include helping friends at time of need, finding employment and shelter, settling family disputes, advising people who were going astray and being a strength to the poor, the weak and many others; too many to mention. Another trait in upali was his humour and wit. If laughter is the best medicine, then Upali was the best person in that field.
There is a Mexican saying: 'a man dies three times.'
The first is when his soul leaves his body.
The next is when he is cremated or buried and is now out of sight. The third is when his friends and relatives have forgotten him.
In the case of Upali, he will never have that third death as he is one unforgettable character.
He leaves behind his wife Swarna and two sons, Devaka and Roshan and their families, who loved him dearly.

Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair from September 6 to 10
The Department of International Trade Promotion (DITP), Ministry of Commerce, guarantees the quality and craftsmanship of Thai jewelry brands with the Thailand Trust Mark or T Mark, a symbol of trusted quality and excellence, while preparing to host the 60th edition of the Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair which will take place from September 6 to 10 at Challenger Hall 1-3, IMPACT Muang Thong Thani, Bangkok.
With the gems and jewelry industry in Thailand on the rise, the country is now the worlds 10th largest gems and jewelry exporting country, and exports of gems and jewelry, excluding gold, are forecast to rise 5% this year to US$7.32 billion according to the Ministry of Commerce.
Though the gems and jewelry industry in Thailand have greatly expanded, manufacturers are designing and producing jewelry with more care than ever to cater to the styles of international buyers and to keep up the world-renowned reputation of Thai jewelry. Thailand is a hub for exquisite, high quality jewelry designs at affordable prices, said Thanyaporn Chiewhatpong, marketing manager of Grace of Art, a jewelry brand that received T Mark in 2015.
To reassure the quality and craftsmanship of jewelry made in Thailand, buyers can look for the Thailand Trust Mark or T Mark, established by the DITP in 2012 to strengthen and promote Thai products and services with trusted quality in every dimension from the highest standard of production, fair labor, giving consideration to environmental concerns and social responsibility with the most important factor as the Heartmade Quality.
Many Thai jewelry brands have received T Mark such as Dhanu, de facto Asia, Beauty Gems, Pranda Jewelry, The Premier and Maya Trade, all of which are leading jewelry brands that are exported worldwide and are well-known for being handcrafted in Thailand.
Currently, 738 Thai companies in eight industries have received T Mark, including companies producing jewelry, fashion products, lifestyle products, food and agricultural products, to companies in the service industry.
To see the world-famous gems and jewelry from Thailand, visit the Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair where suppliers and designers will showcase their products in more than 2,100 booths during the 5-day fair.

BC judge to deliberate fate of Sri Lankan man convicted of human smuggling
The fate of a Sri Lankan man convicted of human smuggling for his role in the voyage of the MV Sun Sea from Thailand to the BC coast is now in the hands of a BC Supreme Court judge.
The vessel arrived in BC waters in 2010 with 492 Tamil migrants seeking asylum.
The sentencing hearing for Kunarobinson Christhurajah concluded Friday in the BC Supreme Court in Vancouver with submissions from his lawyer. Of all the migrants charged with human smuggling, Christhurajah was the only one to be convicted.
Christhurajah has been out on bail since February 2017 after serving more than six years in jail.
Crown lawyers are seeking a lengthy prison sentence of 18 years.
With credit for time served, that would mean Christhurajah would serve 11 years in prison. Christhurajahs lawyer is seeking a significantly lighter sentence of four years, which means he would not serve any additional prison time.During submissions on Friday, Christhurajahs lawyer, Casey Leggett, told the court his client has already served more time than he should have. However way you quantify the credit given to him, he has already served well in excess of the upper limit of the range established by our courts, said Leggett, who denied the Crowns claims there was sufficient evidence to prove Christhurajah was one of the masterminds of the MV Sun Sea voyage and benefited financially from passengers who paid a fee to be on the ship.
Leggett argued Christhurajahs motive for embarking on the voyage is a mitigating factor.
It cant be disputed that the primary purpose ... was simply to help himself, his family and his fellow countrymen flee persecution, said Leggett.Christhurajah made the voyage on the MV Sun Sea with his wife, who gave birth to his daughter while he was in jail. He now lives in Metro Vancouver with both of them. Leggett told the court Friday Christhurajah had to wait until his daughter was six years old before he could hold her for the first time.Fridays court proceedings mark the end of court proceedings related to human smuggling on the MV Ocean Lady and the MV Sun Sea  nearly eight years after the arrival of the first ship [MV Ocean Lady] in October of 2009.

Behind an empty plate
By 2050, the world must feed 9 billion people. The demand for food will be 60% greater than it is today. The United Nations has set ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture as the second of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the year 2030.
Why is food security such a major global challenge
The obvious reason is that everybody needs food.
What causes it
1. Population growth  this varies considerably across countries. Africa is expected to double its population from 1 to 2 billion by 2050. Populations in the developing world are also becoming increasingly urbanized, with 2.5 billion additional urban residents projected in Africa and Asia.
2. Changing tastes  not only is the population growing, but its diet is changing too. As people become more affluent they start eating food that is richer in processed foods, meat and dairy. But to produce more meat means growing more grain.
3. Climate change  currently, 40% of the worlds landmass is arid, and rising temperatures will turn yet more of it into desert. At current rates, the amount of food were growing today will feed only half of the population by 2050.
4. Water scarcity  this is another impending crisis: 28% of agriculture lies in water-stressed regions. It takes roughly 1,500 litres of water to produce a kilogram of wheat, and about 16,000 litres to produce a kilogram of beef. In 2050, well need twice as much water.
5. Troubled farmers  in developed countries, less than 2% of people grow crops or breed animals for food. Fewer and fewer people are choosing farming as an occupation. Meanwhile, food prices are rising, arable land continues to be lost to sprawl and soil is being degraded by over-farming.
How has Singapore become the second-most food secure country in the world
Economist Intelligence Unit recently ranked Singapore as the second-most food secure country in the world, behind only the United States.
The Units Global Food Security Index is based on three factors, affordability, availability, and quality and safety. Singapore ranks 1st, 11th and 13th on these three criteria, respectively. That puts it ahead of major food-producing countries like Malaysia (34), Brazil (36) and Australia (9).
This achievement is largely attributable to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), and comes despite a heavy dependency on food imports. At present, Singapore imports almost 90 percent of its food, and less than 1 percent of its land area is used for agriculture.
Through its Food Security Roadmap, AVA has diversified sources of food and optimization of local production. These policies, especially those that seek to diversify the source of food imports, are important as they help to spread the risks associated with Singapores high levels of food imports.
The Sino-Singapore food zone established in Jilin Province, China, in 2010, is just one example of food diversification efforts.
The Jilin food zone has been designed as a foot-and-mouth disease-free-zone so that it can be an important source of pork. Not without its challenges, it is meant to enhance the city-states food security. This will provide further resilience against food supply disruptions.
AVA has also ensured increased local food production over time through the provision of the Food Fund.
Investments in new farming techniques such as hydroponics have contributed to a 30 percent increase in local vegetable production over the past 10 years. By the end of 2014, some 40 percent of local farms had benefited from this Fund.
Some of Singapores most important trade partners, like the United States and Australia, place great importance on the city-states retail food market.
The U.S. sees Singapore as diverse, dynamic, highly developed, extremely competitive, and very strict with its sanitary requirements. Customers in Singapore are considered to be open to a wide range of foreign concept foods, conscious of food safety and health, and aware of sustainable products. However, they are not necessarily willing to pay more for them.
In 2013, the U.S. exported retail food products to Singapore worth approximately $575 million, making tiny Singapore its 13th largest market. Exports were led by dairy, prepared foods, fresh fruits, and pork products.
For Australia, Singapore was its 9th largest market for food, beverage and agribusiness products in 2014, with exports of A$1.1 billion ($760 million) the same year, principally animal fats, dairy products, red meats, sugars and sugar confectionery and pork.
Resilience
From a policy perspective, Singapore has managed to accomplish the difficult task of becoming a food secure country by boosting the resilience of its food supply. Policy alternatives such as diversification of sources, the Food Fund, and facilitating food imports are all important components of a well planned and coordinated strategy. Nonetheless, the next 50 years are likely to be more complex as alternative possibilities depend on external forces.
Singapore continues to develop its food security strategies, seeking opportunities and addressing risks in an increasingly complex environment. One relevant lesson that other Asian countries could learn from the city-state is the understanding that food security does not mean food self-sufficiency, since no country can be self-sufficient in all food products.
National food security depends on both domestic production and imports, and requires effective distribution, in addition to diversification, partnerships, and good long-term planning.
These are the reasons why Singapore, which imports most of its food, has become the second-most food secure country in the world.

Breastfeeding makes nation wealthy and healthy
Dr. Dhammica Rowel (MBBS, MA (Health Promotion), MSc. MD (Com. Med) is a Consultant Community Physician attached to the Intra-natal and Newborn Care (NPM) Unit of the Family Health Bureau (FHB) of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry. Today she speaks about the importance and essential requirement of breastfeeding which gives priceless benefits for both mother and her infant.
Q: What are the benefits that should be given to employed breastfeeding mothers by the state and private institutions
A - The laws governing maternity leave in Sri Lanka for the private sector are the Shop and Office Employees Act No 19 of 1954 and the Maternity Benefits Ordinance No 32 of 1939.
The Establishment code of Sri Lanka is the law applicable to state sector employees. According to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance a pregnant employee is entitled to 12 weeks (2 weeks before and 10 weeks after confinement) inclusive of holidays for the first two births and 6 weeks or 42 days for subsequent birth if she has two children living. Women employees governed by the Shop and Office Employees act of 1954 are entitled to 84 working days leave for the first and second child. Any birth which occurs when the woman has two children living at the time of confinement will only entitles the mother to 42 working days.
Female officers to whom the Establishment Code applies are entitled to 84 working days leave with full pay, another 84 calendar days with half pay to look after the child and another 84 calendar days no pay leave only if it is required for the purpose of looking after the child. All maternity leave entitlements are available for each birth irrespective of the number of births as no limitation are placed on them as in the case of the Maternity Benefits Ordinance and Shop and Office Employees Act.
There it is obvious that there are differences between the three laws. In addition to leave, another important provision is nursing intervals. According to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance nursing mothers are entitled to two, one hour nursing intervals per day until the child is one year old.
The time period may be reduced to half an hour each if the employer provides crche facilities at the workplace.
The Shop and Office Employees Act does not provide mothers with nursing breaks after returning to work. Women in the state sector receive two half hour breaks per day after returning to work until the child is six months old.
Q: Do present day employed breastfeeding mothers enjoy their rights
A - The employed women should be aware of their right for maternity benefits and maternity leave. The mothers are educated on their rights in the antenatal clinics. Most of the organizations provide maternity leave as they are stipulated by law.
Q: What are the changes that need to be done when it comes to the current law and availability of facilities for employed breast feeding mothers
A- The National Breastfeeding Policy is to exclusively breastfeed for complete six months and continues to breastfeeding up to two years or beyond. There are some sharp contrasts in the laws governing different groups of workers in our country. Women working in the government sector enjoy the benefits for any number of children, which is not for the women working in the private sector. Work is in progress to revise the Shop and Office Employees Act to extend the benefit to any number of children.
Also as described earlier there are differences in the number of days leave available to each category of women. Only working days are considered in the calculating the number of days leave granted to women covered by the Shop and Office Employees Act and Establishment Codes. Holidays are included in the calculation for women covered by the Maternity Benefits Ordinance. Therefore the latter women are getting lesser total number of days that the former. The other differences that need attention are; non availability of nursing breaks for mothers under the Shop and Office Employees Act, lack of provisions for half pay and no pay leave for women working in the private sector, absence of paternity leave other than three days for state sector employees.
Other differences that should be addressed are; requirement to provide crche facilities other than under the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, define laws to provide benefits to casual workers under the maternity Benefits Ordinance, non-availability of legislation for women in the non-formal sector.
Q : What the employed breastfeeding mothers can do to ensure that their infants get adequate breast milk
A- Even after returning to work, the working mothers can breastfeed. Every mother should ensure that they continue breastfeeding. Infants should be exclusively breastfed up to 6 months and mothers should continue to breastfeed babies up to two years or even beyond with adequate complementary feeding. How can she do that When the mother has to return to work after 84 days, she should start getting ready from 42 days onwards. If she has to return to work at 42 days, she would have to start getting ready from about 14 days. She has to learn the correct techniques of expressing breast milk, storing breast milk, prepare stored breast milk to feed baby, cup feeding the baby. She should start initially with one cup feed, and gradually increase according to the number of feeds she will have to give the baby in her absence. The care giver should be trained to cup feed the baby.
Expressed breast milk can be kept in the room temperature for 6 hours, in the lower compartment of the refrigerator for 24 hrs and in the deep freezer for one month. Small cups with lids can be used to store breast milk. Before storing the cup should be labeled with the date and time of collection. A wide mouthed cup can be easily cleansed with soap and water. Stored breast milk should thaw in a pot of warm water before feeding the baby. Always have a backup storage in the deep freezer, to be used in an emergency for example if the mother is getting later than usual from work.
In order to maintain her lactation, breastfeeding mothers should put the baby to the breast when ever she is with the baby and night feeds should be continued. While she is at work at least every 3 hours mother should express breast milk.
Q: How the husband, in-laws and other family members can help an employed breastfeeding mother
A- All mothers, fathers and family should remember that taking trouble to breastfeed is an investment for the future of the child, the mother, the family and society. Working mothers need lot of support to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. She will have to spend time with the baby, feeding the baby and expressing breast milk for the next day.
She should be encouraged to do so by the family and she should be supported with the routine house work so that she will have adequate time to spend with the time and for breastfeeding. Every one in the family should remember that it is an investment for the family.
Q: How is a work place benefited by supporting women to breastfeed
A Evidence show that employers benefit by supporting breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers have been found to be happy mothers as opposed to mothers who are formula feeding their babies, hence productivity of breastfeeding mothers are higher than formula feeding mothers.
Also it is shown that there is less absenteeism, better retention of workers, less health care costs for breastfeeding mothers.
And when companies support breastfeeding they will be recognized as family friendly organizations. Work places need to provide facilities such as a room with privacy to express breast milk while at work.

Broad tops Botham as England rout West Indies
BIRMINGHAM, Saturday - Stuart Broad starred as England thrashed the West Indies by an innings and 209 runs to ensure the inaugural day/night Test in Britain ended inside three days at Edgbaston on Saturday.
West Indies, following-on, lost 19 wickets for 261 runs in the day's play as England surged to a 1-0 lead in this three-Test series.
Having been bowled out for just 168 in their first innings, after England had piled up 514 for eight declared on the back of man-of-the-match Alastair Cook's 243 and captain Joe Root's 136, the West Indies collapsed to 137 all out second time around. Broad took three wickets for 34 runs in 10 overs, including a spell of three for four in 11 balls that saw him surpass England great Ian Botham's tally of 383 Test wickets. Broad is now second in England's list of all-time leading Test wicket-takers, with only new-ball colleague James Anderson ahead of him.
Very remarkable, very pleasing, Root told Sky Sports. We talk about being ruthless. Stuart Broad has had a fantastic career... He has those spells in him where he can turn a game on its head.
Meanwhile Cook told BBC's Test Match Special: It's always nice to win and contribute with a big score.
We bowled well today -- Jimmy and Broady are world class. Defeat left the West Indies without a Test win in England since 2000.
Their squad is missing several star names, the legacy of a bitter dispute with their board and the attraction of the lucrative Caribbean Premier League Twenty20 tournament that is taking place at the same time as this tour.
But West Indies captain Jason Holder said his youthful side could not afford to lose heart in the short time between now and Friday's start of the second Test at Headingley.
It is obviously very disappointing, Holder told Sky Sports.
We have to just believe. It is not impossible, we can't drop our heads on one game, the series is not lost.
It was Anderson who did the initial damage in both West Indies innings.
Barely had a Windies first innings where Jermaine Blackwood's 79 not out accounted for nearly half the total finished, then Anderson struck again when Kieran Powell edged to former captain Cook at first slip. West Indies were 42 for two when Test debutant Kyle Hope (12) was lbw to seamer Toby Roland-Jones. Kraigg Brathwaite (40) resisted for 107 minutes before he was lbw on review to off-spinner Moeen Ali to leave West Indies 76 for four at tea. Blackwood was then stumped by wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow off Ali before Broad struck. He had Roston Chase plumb lbw and Holder edged to Cook next ball.
Broad, who had drawn level with Botham, had a shot at an unprecedented third career Test hat-trick, but Kemar Roach survived. Broad was soon celebrating again though, bowling Shane Dowrich to top Botham's mark as the former all-rounder looked on from a television commentary box.
Roland-Jones ended the match when he had Alzarri Joseph caught in the slips by all-rounder Ben Stokes.
The West Indies, 44 for one overnight, lost seven wickets for 89 runs in 23 overs in Saturday's first session as they subsided to 145 for eight at lunch.
Anderson had a wicket just six balls into the day's play when Kyle Hope was caught in the gully for his overnight 25. The wickets kept tumbling with only Blackwood, who drove Roland-Jones for two stylish straight fours, offering any sort of resistance.
He showed plenty of character too when, after being hit on the helmet by Stokes, he cut the pace bowler's next ball for four. Blackwood completed a 49-ball fifty and later hit both Ali and Broad for well-struck straight sixes.
The innings ended when last man Miguel Cummins was run out by Tom Westley's throw from midwicket as Blackwood tried to keep the strike.

China moves to curb overseas acquisitions as firms' debt levels rise
The Chinese government has served notice on the countrys foreign investment spree in football clubs, skyscrapers and Hollywood as it moves to curb rising levels of debt among domestic companies.
The announcement of restrictions in a range of sectors follows a buying spree around the globe during which Chinese firms and business tycoons have taken control of assets including Legendary Entertainment, the US film producer behind Jurassic World and Warcraft, buildings such as the Cheesegrater in London, and English football clubs including Southampton and Aston Villa.
The curbs were announced in a document released on Friday by the state council, Chinas cabinet, in the latest move to halt a string of foreign acquisitions. This week the International Monetary Fund described Chinas credit-fuelled economic strategy as dangerous, in a strongly worded statement warning that the countrys approach risks financial turmoil.
Raising concerns that some of the companies involved may be taking on too much debt, the council said: There are great opportunities for our nations companies to embark on foreign investment, but they also face numerous risks and challenges.
It added that through the new guidance, the government hopes to promote the rational, orderly and healthy development of foreign investment while effectively guarding against risks.
The document limits overseas investments in areas such as hotels, cinemas, the entertainment industry, real estate and sports clubs. It also bans outright investments in enterprises related to gambling and the sex industry. The Chinese government had already flagged hotels as an area of concern, having reportedly asked the insurance group Anbang to sell the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York.
One of Chinas biggest conglomerates, Wanda Group, also bowed to pressure from the government when it abandoned the $1bn (780m) purchase of the entertainment company Dick Clark Productions earlier this year. In 2016 Wanda bought Legendary Entertainment for $3.5bn, having become the worlds biggest cinema operator in 2012 with its purchase of a majority stake in US chain AMC for $2.6bn.
At the same time, the document encourages companies to plough money into projects related to the Belt and Road project, President Xi Jinpings signature foreign policy initiative that seeks to link China with other parts of Asia and eastern Europe through multibillion-dollar investments in ports, highways, railways, power plants and other infrastructure.
The Chinese government has pledged to double the size of the countrys economy between 2010 and 2020, leading to rapid growth in non-financial sector debt to help achieve its aim. Total debt has quadrupled since the financial crisis to $28tn at the end of last year.
As part of his drive for stronger government leadership over the economy, Xi has been moving to reassert control over top state enterprises while reining in sprawling conglomerates such as Wanda, Anbang, Fosun International and HNA Group, which have expanded rapidly via debt-fuelled foreign acquisitions.
Chinas state planner, the national development and reform commission, said on Friday it would provide better guidance on risks to companies investing overseas in order to prevent vicious competition and corruption.

Speech matters
Our hearty congratulations reach out the timely article captioned Art of Proper Speech authored by S R Balachandran of Colombo  06 on August 14. It is quite impartial, intelligent and an educative narrative which every reader should not have missed. More and more articles of this nature, short and sweet, would enlighten the general public on the value of right speech.
I agree wholeheartedly with Balachandrans opinions and how he proves it. I do have a couple of points of difference, though.
First of all, we must inspect whom Balachandrans subtle views are aimed at: Parliament, and by established extension, any organ of political body. We must establish the point that Balachandran attempts to drive home. Barring a stunning change in precedent, he defends all kinds of speech, written and verbal, with the exception of offensive wording.
At the midpoint, where speech is simultaneously offensive and legally protected, some of our politicians verbal brawls begin spewing disgusting slurs, vulgarities and offences. At this point, Balachandran shall no longer defend the speech. Apparently we can see the pain it brings to those groups and individuals it targets.
What sort of world would it be if verbal offenders got to disrupt and even force the cancellation of speeches without any consequences
Thank you, Balachandran, for making the public aware on worthwhile issues of the said nature.

Coca - Cola Gives Back Life
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd recently supported and sponsored the collection and clean-up of PET bottles following the large crowds gathered at the Kataragama Perahera Festival. It was an effective community-driven initiative with the partnership between Coca-Cola, Beira Enviro Solutions Ltd (part of BPPL Holdings) and the Kataragama Committee to collect and recycle PET during and after the Kataragama Festival.
Bottled water, fruit juices and carbonated soft drinks are packaged in 100% recyclable PET plastic bottles, thus making PET the most widely recycled plastic in the world.
Coca-Cola partnered with Beira to Give Back Life to these used, empty PET bottles which would otherwise have possibly journeyed to garbage dump sites. Coca-Colas principle of extended producer responsibility ensured education, awareness and capacity-building initiatives towards an individuals responsibility towards responsible disposal and recycling, as well as the importance of community-driven, sustainable initiatives in PET collection, recycling and waste management practices.
The PET clean-up drive not only improved the immediate surroundings but also encouraged festival participants to take individual initiative.
Ensuring an end-to-end approach to the littering issue during the festivities, 1000 litre and 5000 litre bins were placed in easily accessible locations around the venue for the festival participants to responsibly dispose of their PET bottles.
It was a completely hands-on initiative by the organisers with volunteers from Coca-Cola participating on the day to lead the awareness programme in driving recognition of the universal recycling symbol for the PET package  the number 1 inside the arrows arranged in a triangle.

Country needs dedicated public servants: President
The government will always stand by public servants who render a sincere and dedicated service according to their conscience. If any section or unit of the public service comes in for criticism, the head of the section should bear responsibility for it, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing a meeting at the Diagana Central Province Sports Complex premises to mark the presentation of land title deeds to farmer families in the Victoria and Kotmale Zones held under the National programme to award 100,000 title deeds to settlers on the Mahaweli Development Region on August 18 afternoon.
President Sirisena said for a long time the people had been disenchanted with the working of the Lands Section of the public service.
All officials should try to learn from such unpleasant experiences and dedicate themselves towards rendering a proper public service in the present and the future land ownership was a question relating to a persons life and heritage. Enhancing of that ownership was a duty owned to the citizens of the country, the President said.
He said the government had to contend with allegations and protests in carrying out its duties because it was a common feature in a democracy. Such allegations and protests would not occur if there was no freedom and democracy in the country.
A period when people feared to demand their rights and politicians feared to express their point of view had been ended in the country, President Sirisena said. It was the duty and responsibility of all to enjoy and safeguard the democratic rights by resolving the outstanding problems of Mahaweli settlers, the President said.
These land title deeds are presented to Mahaweli settlers on the directives of President Maitrhipala Sirisena. Almost 85 percent of the land title deed grants programme had been completed so far and the government hoped to complete this soon.
A batch of 1,300 farmers in the Victoria and Kotmale Mahaweli Zones received title deeds at this ceremony with the President making a symbolic presentation to 100 farmers. Land title deeds were also presented in respect of six places of worship.
The Maha Sangha led by Ven.Niyangoda Vijithasiri Anunayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, Ven.Wendaruwe Upali, Senior Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter,Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya chapter and Ven. Ankumbure Pemaswansa, Lekakhadikari of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and S.B.Dissanayake, Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne, Central Province chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Secretary Mahaweli And Environment Ministry Anura Dissanayake were also present on the occasion.

Country's economy stabilising under present government: Prime Minister
"The country's economy has achieved some form of stability under the present Government. The loans obtained by the country should be settled during the present generation without leaving it to the next. We will be saddled with the highest amount of loans in 2020. Repayment of loans will not be a problem because the country will be able to record a higher income by then," Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a series of meetings in the Akuressa electorate after opening several new divisional secretariat buildings in Hulandawa, Malimbada and Thibbbotuwawa and opening several estate housing projects on August 18.
The Prime Minister recalled the first political revolution occurred in the country in 1956 and said the second political and economic revolution occurred in 1977 after J.R. Jayewardene became Prime Minister with a five sixth majority in parliament. "The next revolution occurred in 2015 even devoid of two third majority in parliament. That was with the setting up of a national government with the two main parties joining in. This was a unique and exceptional development unprecedented in South Asia," he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that by the end of its first two year term, several concessions had been granted to the people as economic relief in consultation with the Finance Minister.
"After abolishing the 10 percent telecommunication levy, companies in the sector were requested to grant a corresponding relief on their part. Now they have granted relief in the form of a data package. This now added up to a 20 percent concession which would increase internet use and earn more income for the country.
"The massive tax concession granted to light vehicles would help facilitate the vehicle needs of areas like the Southern Province for transport of tea and other goods. The tax relief on motorcycles would grant a concession of nearly Rs. 50,000 to people purchasing such vehicles. The increased import of light vehicles would be a great impetus towards developing the village economy," the Prime Minister said.The Premier said the main objective of the Yahapalana Government was to increase the amount of money in the hands of the ordinary public. The Prime Minister said the management of the Hambantota Port, which was a white elephant earlier was given to a Chinese company on a 70-year lease.
"As a result the country will get 1.1 billion US dollars; a part of which can be put to use after paying part of a loan. Discussions were on with the Indian Government for managing operations of the Mattala Airport. As a result, the port and airport would become profitable ventures without being a national burden. The China Merchant Company will operate ships to Hambantota.
"It had expressed interest in starting an oil refinery there and setting up of a NLG power station to provide electricity tot he area.
"Inquiries were made to launch a steel factory, a dock yard, and a cement factory in Hambantota. It would be adequate for us even if half of these projects came into fruition.
"An industrial zone would be set up at Hambantota and a tourism zone at Mattala. Nearly 2,000 acres would be apportioned for setting up a tourism from Bentara to Pitabeddara. The first tourist zone would be set up at Dedduwa before the end of this year. Another industrial zone would be set up at Weligama. All these would bring development to Hiniduma, Deniyaya, Rakwana and other areas bordering the Sinharaja forest," the Prime Minister said. He said the Government was now implementing its pledge to provide houses for plantation Workers. Steps were taken to introduce science as an Advanced Level subject in plantation Tamil schools.
The Prime Minister said the previous regime held the presidential election two years before because it was unable to overcome the massive debt burden. The Government had not run away from the debt burden inherited by the previous.
w"We are improving the economy and trying to overcome the debt burden while offering relief to the people," he said.
"We have now launched the development era. We have transformed loss making institutions into profitable ventures. We will never heap unnecessary burdens on the people. We will ensure a better future for youth. So let us join hands in this forward march as your support is most crucial for its ultimate success," the Prime Minister said.

## Date: Monday, August 21, 2017 - 14:45
Court rejects Udayanga's request to recall warrant

The Colombo Fort Magistrate rejected a request made by former Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga to recall the warrant issued against him through the INTERPOL over the financial fraud that was alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne further rejected an application made by Udayanga Weeratunga challenging the impounding of two passports belonging to him as part of investigations into controversial MiG aircraft deal.
The Defence Counsel Anil Silva PC appearing on behalf of Udayanga Weeratunga requested to recall the arrest warrant issued against him through the INTERPOL and not to impound his passports.
The Magistrate observed that there are no reasonable grounds to recall the warrant against the suspect since he is alleged to have committed cognisable offences.
'Udayanga Weeratunga was noticed to appear before FCID but he did not turn up. The Court also issued notices to his local and foreign residences. A law abiding citizen should not behave like this', the Magistrate observed. 
Meanwhile, the Magistrate orally observed that the prosecutors should take necessary action against other persons who involved in this alleged fraudulent transaction.
On June 30, the Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to impound two passports belonging to former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga in the magisterial inquiry pertaining to the controversial MiG aircraft transaction.
Accordingly, a diplomatic passport bearing number D 3643585 and a general passport bearing number N 5400885 issued by the Sri Lankan government to Udayanga Weeratunga were ordered to be impounded by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in accordance with Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 51 C of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had earlier issued a warrant through INTERPOL for the arrest of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Anil Silva PC submitted to Court that issuing of warrant against his client and impounding his passports had not been done in accordance with the law. He further said Weeratunga has been in Ukraine for nearly three decades.
The Financial Crimes Investigations Division(FCID) conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft transaction informed Court that they have sought the assistance of Interpol to trace former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga who is currently living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The FCID informed Court that they were yet to ascertain Udayangas exact address in UAE and further said he has visited multiple countries including Japan using passports issued by Sri Lankan government.
The FCID conducting investigations into the MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report dated October 11, 2016. The FCID sought a warrant written in English through the Interpol from the Fort Magistrates Court to arrest former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA). The FCID told Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to serve notices on Udayanga Weeratunga who has been residing in Ukraine for several years.
The FCID had informed Court that Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack craft. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million. On June 9, 2016, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notices on Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up.
The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which were allegedly earned through the Mig-27 transaction.
The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price.
He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

Day of the humanitarian heroes
Saturday August 19 was World Humanitarian Day. It is held every year on this day to pay tribute to aid workers who have risked and lost their lives in humanitarian service. The Day was designated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2008 to coincide with the date of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.
The bomb attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad killed 22 humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Mello was born in Brazil, and worked tirelessly over three decades to help those victims of armed conflict by easing their pain and making sure the world did not forget them.
Dangerous and difficult environments
Awareness was a vital part of his campaign, trying to ensure that those in First World countries and places of peace remembered that there was more to war than the deaths of combatants and conflicts between governments. These people struggle every day to survive against odds that were created in spite of their desire to just live in peace and safety.
The Canal Hotel bombing was a massive loss for the United Nations and the humanitarian community and marked a turning point for humanitarian operations in Iraq and worldwide. Each year, World Humanitarian Day focuses on a theme, bringing together stakeholders from across the humanitarian system to advocate survival, well-being, and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety and security of aid workers.
Around the world, humanitarian aid workers operate in dangerous and difficult environments. Over the past 20 years, 4,132 aid workers have been attacked. Last year alone 91 aid workers were killed, 88 were injured and 73 were kidnapped in the line of duty. The majority of these attacks took place in five countries: South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Attacks against aid workers are deplorable and represent clear violations of international humanitarian law. In addition to endangering aid workers, these attacks threaten humanitarian operations and the lives of millions of people who rely on humanitarian assistance for their survival.
Every year thousands of men and women the world over put their lives in danger working in humanitarian causes all over the world. Working in the most poverty and illness stricken third world countries the world over, often in areas of great social violence, these dedicated heroes put their lives on the line, and sometimes lose them in the pursuit of their goals. World Humanitarian Day is when we remember these heroes and their sacrifices.
Natural hazards
Every day humanitarian aid workers help millions of people around the world, regardless of who they are and where they are. In essence, the day is a global celebration of people helping people. These are victims trapped in wars that arent of their own making. Meanwhile, the world isnt doing enough to stop their suffering. The UN demands that world leaders do everything in their power to protect the millions of civilians caught in armed conflict.
It is estimated that more than 130 million people worldwide require humanitarian assistance in order to survive. During the first ever World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, held in May, a United Nations commitment was made to support those affected by crises, as well as those individuals who go out of their way to deliver aid to those in need. This milestone summit marked a major shift in how the international community prevents human suffering by preparing for and responding to crises. Yet, we have to recognise that the world is at a critical juncture, as we are witnessing human suffering unparalleled since the Second World War. More than 60 million people, mostly children, have been forced from their homes due to conflicts and violence. The human and economic cost of disasters caused by natural hazards is also on the rise. Over the past two decades, 218 million people were affected each year by disasters at an annual cost to the global economy that now exceeds US$300 billion. That is why we must continually seek better ways to meet the needs of millions of people affected by conflicts and disasters in our rapidly changing world.
Every day, humanitarian aid workers stand on the front lines of war and disaster to provide life-saving assistance to millions of people worldwide. These people brave tremendous dangers and difficulties to deliver assistance to those who need it most and it is fitting that we applaud their absolute selflessness on this special day. In honour of them, a number of events will take place around the world. For instance, a wreath-laying ceremony will take place at the United Nations headquarters in New York, along with a high- profile event that will be held in the General Assembly Hall.
A digital campaign will be launched to raise awareness of the impossible choices faced by people caught in crisis. Photography exhibitions and film screenings will complement these activities by documenting and portraying the lives of those affected by conflict and disaster.
Humanitarian needs
The UN Secretary-General held the first-ever global humanitarian summit of this scale in Istanbul in May 2016. The goal of this summit was to find new ways to tackle humanitarian needs in our fast-changing world. This three-year initiative is being managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The summit set a new agenda for global humanitarian action. It focuses on humanitarian effectiveness, reducing vulnerability and managing risk, transformation through innovation, and serving the needs of people in conflict.
The Day also seeks to draw attention to humanitarian needs worldwide and the importance of international co-operation in meeting these needs. Every year, disasters cause immense suffering for millions of people  usually the world's poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable individuals. Humanitarian aid workers strive to provide life-saving assistance and long term rehabilitation to disaster-affected communities, regardless of where they are in the world and without discrimination based on nationality, social group, religion, sex, race or any other factor.
Humanitarian aid is based on a number of founding principles, including humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. Humanitarian aid workers should be respected, and be able to access those in need in order to provide vital assistance. Humanitarian aid workers can be international, but most come from the country in which they work. They reflect all cultures, ideologies and backgrounds and they are united by their commitment to humanitarianism.
Everyone can be a humanitarian. People affected by disasters are often the first to help their own communities following a disaster. Responding to emergencies is only one aspect of humanitarian work.
Humanitarian workers also support communities to rebuild their lives after disasters, to become more resilient to future crises, to advocate for their voices to be heard, and to build lasting and sustainable peace in areas of conflict.

Dr Swami deployed to lead SLs historic Madrid entry
Sri Lanka has appointed an eminent legal personality and a time-honoured expert in Intellectual Property (IP) to lead the countrys historic accession to the international trademark system called the Madrid Protocol. And the accession is slated to be completed by August next year.
We thank you for your contribution to the development of our intellectual property said the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on August 17. Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the 7 of the 11 members of the newly appointed Intellectual Property Advisory Commission of Sri Lanka (IPACSL) on 18 August at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Colombo. The IPACSL is the guiding mechanism advising the National Intellectual Property Office under the Minister of Industry and Commerce on matters on IP & patents and their future direction. Minister Bathiudeen was making the appointments on 18 August as per Section 162 of Intellectual Property Act No 36 of 2003 which stipulates the Minister may constitute an Advisory Commission for the purpose of advising him in relation to the law relating to Copyright, Industrial Designs, Marks, Patents, and unfair competition and any other area or subject of intellectual property.
We thank you for your contribution to the development of our intellectual property. You bring a wealth of expertise to Sri Lankas Intellectual Property domain, said Minister Bathiudeen, and added, I direct you to focus on clearing any pending backlogs, fast-tracking the Madrid Convention and amendments to Copyright laws so that our entire IP gathers speed for development. I thank World Intellectual Property Organisation for its support on Madrid Convention. We shall achieve Madrid by August 2018, if things go according to plans. The Unity Government aims to develop our knowledge economy and also exports to greater levels and IP plays a key role in it.
We thank Minister Bathiudeen for honoring us with these appointments, said Dr Swaminathan, the new Chairperson of the Commission, responding to Minister Bathiudeen, We will render our best efforts clear all pending backlogs and upgrade the present legal framework in par with international standards. Especially, my priority is to prepare our National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) and make it more efficient towards the adoption of Madrid Standards, in a years time. Earlier we planned to achieve this by the end of this year but due to heavy load at NIPO, we are calling for a little more time. Our Trademark Application processing will be speeded up. In that, my immediate focus is to ensure that Sri Lanka will implement the Madrid Convention at its earliest possible opportunity. We are also focusing on amending the Copyright Laws so that latest digital property rights and laws are integrated. Sri Lankas digital property changes will be along the lines of the most modern digital laws in the world at this moment- the European Commission that is.
Dr Swaminathan, a longstanding advisor of IPACSL, was himself a former Chairperson of it at one time-in 1989-90 functioning under the then Trade and Shipping Minster R. Mansoor. Dr Swaminathan holds LLB (Ceylon), LLM, M. Phil. (Colombo and LLD (Honoris Causa) Degrees and is an Attorney-at-Law and in the legal profession for over 50 years.
He is the Precedent Partner of Messrs. Julius & Creasy and is a Member of the Law Commission of Sri Lanka and Former Member of the Council of Legal Education. He is also a Member of the Company Law Advisory Commission and Intellectual Property Law Advisory Commission, in addition holding many other high tier appointments in the legal sphere of Sri Lanka.
Accordingly, Minister Bathiudeen has appointed Dr JM Swaminathan (Attorney at Law and senior partner of Julius and Creasy, one of the oldest civil law firms in Sri Lanka), as the new Chairperson of IPACSL. Other members appointed on 17 August were Mrs Suganthi Wijayasuriya-Kadirgamar (Senior Partner F. J. & G. de Saram), Dr Nishantha Sampath Punchihewa (Senior Lecturer in Law-Colombo University), Tilak Kariyawasam (Chairman and Executive Director of Sri Lanka Nature Group), Prof. Ajith P de Alwis (Moratuwa University), and Lakshan Algama Perera (Representative of Exporters Association of Sri Lanka) while Geethanjali Ranawaka (Director-General of Intellectual Property) becomes the ex-officio member.
Previously on April 27, Minister Bathiudeen announced that Rs 100 million has been allocated by his Ministry for work on Sri Lankas accession to the Madrid Protocol. We made a collective decision to proceed to Madrid system in 2015 with the collaboration of our exporters. NIPO has already commenced upgrading their IP system so that NIPO systems are Madrid compatible. A complete restructuring program of NIPO is underway, said Minister Bathiudeen.

Emma Stone beats J-Law in Forbes highest-paid list

Oscar-winner Emma Stone has been named by Forbes as the highest-paid actress of the year.
The 28-year-old star scored 20m in pre-tax earnings in the year up to June, beating Jennifer Lawrence off the top spot for the first time since 2015.
Stone has La La Land to thank for the boost, after the musical won her a best actress Oscar and made 345m worldwide.
She saw a 160% increase on her earnings in 2016, when she made 7.75m.
In July, Stone gave an interview to Out magazine revealing her male co-stars in past projects had to take pay cuts after being offered a larger salary, to close the pay gap.
"That's something they do for me because they feel it's what's right and fair," she said.
"If my male co-star, who has a higher quote then me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life."
Lawrence, who topped the list for two consecutive years, slid down to number three after Jennifer Aniston, who made 19m last year with comedies Mother's Day and Office Christmas Party.
J-Law's 18m fell short of her earnings in previous years, when she won the Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook and scored 35m.
This year, Forbes' top 10 actresses made a combined gross of 133m - 16% less than the same top 10 spots in 2016.
The actors' list, due to be published later in the week, is expected to show once again men banking far more than their female counterparts.
The issue of pay disparity grabbed headlines in 2014 after a leak of stolen emails from Sony showed that Lawrence was paid less than her male co-stars Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner in David O Russell's American Hustle.
Last year, Dwayne The Rock Johnson topped Forbes' list of highest-paid actors at 49m - more than double Stone's total this year.
Missing from the list was Scarlett Johansson, who failed to make more than the 8.9m cut off with Hail, Caesar! and Captain America: Civil War.

Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Bimputh Finance PLCs National Long-Term Rating at BB(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
Bimpuths rating reflects its small franchise compared with higher-rated peers and high-risk appetite stemming from its microfinance-dominated loan portfolio, which Fitch sees as risky due to the segments greater susceptibility to economic cycles. Fitchs assessment also captures likely pressure on Bimpuths capitalisation from high loan growth, which is forecast by managements guidance, and limited funding diversity due to a heavy reliance on borrowings.
Fitch believes aggressive loan growth would pressure Bimpuths capitalisation in the absence of any meaningful capital infusions.
The companys Fitch Core Capital ratio remained flat at 16.5% as at end-March 2017 and Fitch believes Bimputh would depend on its 94% owner, Daya Group, for capital infusions.

Five teams into T20 Blast quarter-finals
LONDON, Saturday - Cameron Delport's unbeaten 109 helped Leicestershire reach the T20 Blast quarter-finals with a thrilling two-run victory over Nottinghamshire. The Foxes made 203-5 from their 20 overs, with the hosts falling just short of the target on 201-8.
Warwickshire beat Lancashire, and Derbyshire also progressed from the North Group by beating Worcestershire.
In the South Group, wins for Somerset and Surrey helped them join Glamorgan and Hampshire in the knockout stages. Yorkshire, second heading into the night, were knocked out, having needed two of Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire to lose, plus a draw or defeat for Northamptonshire.
Leicestershire needed a win to guarantee their progression having started the night in fifth place, level on points with Yorkshire, Birmingham in third and Derbyshire in fourth.
Leicestershire lost New Zealand international Luke Ronchi with only 10 runs on the board, but Delport, who had yet to reach 50 in the T20 Blast before the night, put the hosts in control.
The Australian hit nine fours and six sixes in his 59-ball innings, with Mark Cosgrove (37) and Ned Eckersley (30) also making valuable contributions.
Samit Patel raced to 39 from 18 balls, before Dan Christian smashed 73 from 32 deliveries for Nottinghamshire, who had already guaranteed top spot before their final game. Nottinghamshire will host Somerset in the quarter-finals, while Leicestershire's reward is a trip to Glamorgan.
The teams from third to ninth in the South Group were separated by only two points heading into the final round of games, with every side down to eighth-placed Essex maintaining hopes of qualification.
Somerset started the night in seventh but cruised to victory over second-placed Hampshire thanks to Peter Trego's unbeaten 84 from 50 balls, followed by a brilliant bowling performance.
The visitors made 189-3 at Southampton, before Hampshire collapsed to 91 all out from 18.3 overs, with Roelof van der Merwe and Craig Overton each taking three wickets. The victory, coupled with losses for Middlesex, Sussex and Kent, was enough to take Somerset to fourth in the table. Sussex narrowly missed out on the knockout stages as, despite a 55-run win over Essex, they missed out on a top-four spot because of an inferior net run-rate, 0.423 to Somerset's 0.491. South Group leaders Glamorgan were already assured of a place in the last eight, and they impressed again in a rain-affected game against Middlesex at Cardiff. Third-placed Surrey progressed with a 10-run victory over fourth-placed Kent, thanks in large part to England batsman Jason Roy's 78 from 43 balls.
Roy struck 10 fours and three sixes as he carried the Surrey innings, with no other batsman making more than 20. In a low-scoring game, Rikki Clarke then took 4-16 to help limit Kent to 144-8 and set up a quarter-final against Warwickshire.

FTAs will not harm local industries - President
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) which will be signed by the Government with foreign countries will not cause harm in any way to locally manufactured products as the Governments prime objective is to encourage and protect the countrys own industrialists when signing FTAs.
President Maithripala Sirisena made this assurance to over 500 local industrialists who were present at the annual CNCI Achiever Awards 2017 ceremony, conducted by Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI). The industrialists who were present at the awards ceremony represented their respective manufacturing and service sectors.
Speaking further President Sirisena highlighted the invaluable role played by the CNCI in the promotion of industries in Sri Lanka and said their contribution to the growth of the national economy was commendable.
While encouraging industrialists and manufacturers for their contribution towards the development of the countrys economy, President Sirisena remarked that certain groups in the country meet industrialists and provide wrong information about FTAs .
He said their ultimate attempt was to create an image that the FTAs which will be signed by the Government with foreign countries will badly affect local industries.
The intention of these elements is to discourage local industrialists and also tarnish the Governments good work, he said.
The President once again assured that the Government will never sign any FTAs that destroy the countrys industries. Highlighting the importance of establishing the National Economic Council the President said both he and the Prime Minister with the help of all stakeholders have a massive plan to develop the countrys economy to a greater extent in the next coming months.
He said before forming the National Economic Council that helps and encourage the countrys small, medium or large industrialists, the Government discussed with officials in the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank and the International Monitory Fund (IMF).
In addition, we also discussed with local economy experts and Sri Lankan economy experts living overseas before establishing the National Economic Council since this will help to develop local industries.
CNCI Chairman Tissa Seneviratne highlighted that this achievers awards ceremony encourages and upgrade not only the industrialists and service sector personnel in the country, but also helps to swell the countrys economy to a greater extent.
He said all industrialists associating CNCI are looking forward to contribute in sustainable development plans of the Government.
He also said the CNCI believes the Government keeps the bank interest low and parity rate of rupee with other world currencies in a stable level.

A gigantic mission!
Fresh air scented with wild flowers, evenings around a camp fire and a night sky full of stars; for many camping is the ultimate getaway from busy lives in the city but for a guide camping is more than a getaway. It opens the door to empower themselves to make their own choices in decision making at all levels making them endure the challenges and emerging as a future leader.
Camping adds flavour to the life of a guide making them one with nature. The Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association will hold their centenary Girl Guide Camp `Jumbo 17- Eco Safari Sri Lanka from August 23 to 27at the Sri Lanka Army Infantry Training Centre in Minneriya. Approximately 1,200 girl guides will participate at the camp together with 200 leaders and senior guides.
This event is being organised in line with the centenary celebrations SGGA had earlier this year including the centenary grand awards ceremony which was held in February at the BMICH and the huge rally with the participation of 6,000 girl guides at Bogambara grounds.
The camp will bring out the values of guides. Camping is crucial for guides as they have to get involved in outdoor activities. Girl guides are focusing more on the 12 to 17 years age group at this camp. Girls who had at least camped once were chosen to participate. Participants will include schools island-wide not only the famous schools in each province. Eco Safari 2017is an ecologically sensitive event which will give a brand new experience to the girl guides, Deputy Chief Commissioner, SGGA, Visakha Tillekeratne said.
The guides will visit an eco-village where they will engage in rice and paddy cultivation, learn about organic fruits and vegetables. Children should be aware of agriculture in the country to reduce the carbon food print. They will also taste various food and juices made from fruits and vegetables that are grown in the dry zone such as kekiri and lime juice, tamarind and water melon juice and many more, Tillekeratne added.
Jumbo issues
The elephant is the symbol of this years camp and is also the symbol of SLGGA. There are so many issues with elephants in our country. We should be aware of the importance of this gentle animal. The participants will have quizzes on elephants and there will be a key note speaker, 23 year old Tharindu Muthukumarana who recently launched his book on life of elephants. It will give the guides the knowledge of the elephant which is now an endangered species. Children cannot take part in conservation if they do not connect with the environment. The camp will give them the opportunity to observe the nature at the National park which is full of biodiversity and wildlife particularly birds, the leopard and elephants, Tillekeratne said.
She added that there will be an adventure trek which will include `Adventure in Lend a Hand, `Sporting Adventures `Aesthetic Adventures and camp excursions. Girls will get the opportunity to try something new and exciting. There will be workshops on pottery, jewellery designing and crafts. The girls will enjoy camp fires as well. The camp will be a platform for exchanging friendship and thus promoting harmony among all communities. There will be around 42 guides from North and Eastern provinces. The camps will be divided into three sub camps - Kandula, Raja and Kadol representing elephants that were historically important in our country, Tillekeratne added.
Values
Girl Guides from Colombo will travel by train. For some girls it is their first time in the train. It will enrich their lives and add new experience. Camping opens up the avenues to go back to the fundamentals in life. Being a girl guide give one the advantage of breaking free from the routine life children spend going back and forth from school and tuition classes. The camp will enable girls to rise to challenges they face in everyday life, increase their environmental awareness, promote healthy living and give them the independence to explore life while involving in team work. Girls will be able to maximize their talents and we will inculcate Girl Guide values in the participants so that they can take the message to outer community, she said.
Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association, a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girls Scouts was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1917 by Methodist Missionaries. Since then the movement has been reaching out to girls from various paths of life to develop their full potential as responsible citizens of their country. Director of the Executive Committee, Sri Girl Guides Association, Vajira Silva is dedicated in making this camp a success, Tillekeratne added.
She also commended Sri Lanka Army for the generous support they extend in providing logistics for the campers. Sri Lanka Army was delighted to extend their assistance in this event.
The image of the Army which was tarnished during the times of conflict will be restored in collaborating in such events. They have built new water tanks and toilets especially for the camp. Around fifty female army officers will provide security and meals will be provided free of charge. We thank Sri Lanka Army for their unfailing support rendered towards making the camp a reality, Tillekeratne said.

Glyphosate unearthed
Glyphosate is a good non-selective plant killer, but then, so are many other herbicides. All of them kill both the crops and the weeds. The specialty of glyphosate and its very extensive use is only in relation to its use on genetically modified Roundup Ready crops that are so engineered not to die of glyphosate sprayed indiscriminately over farmland by airplane, helicopter and massive crop sprayers. Another dangerous use of more recent origin is to use glyphosate as a desiccant even on non-GMO seed, and cereal crops, cotton and sugarcane  purely for convenience of harvesting.
Due regard was shown towards the petition with over two million signatures urging the EU not to extend the license to use glyphosate in the EU and to the survey that indicated that two-thirds of the population in the EU wanted glyphosate banned. Also, France which had promoted a ban had, after the change of government, covertly opposed the ban close to the deadline date of June 30, 2016. EU regulatory agencies too were criticized for bias in favour of glyphosate based on dubious research and conclusions.
In this confusing situation EU Health Commissioner granted an 18 month extension of the license advising that a firm decision should be reached by then.
Determination of a Tribunal in The Hague, The Netherlands
A panel of five international judges set up as a Tribunal to ponder on complaints against Roundup and Monsanto delivered their legal opinion on April 17 this year. The judges conclude that;
1. Monsanto has engaged in practices that have impinged on the basic human right to a healthy environment, the right to food and the right to health.
2. Monsanto's conduct has a negative impact on the right of scientists to freely conduct indispensable research.
3. Despite the development of regulations intended to protect the environment, a gap remains between commitments and the reality of environmental protection. International law should now precisely and clearly assert the protection of the environment and establish the crime of ecocide. The Tribunal concludes that if ecocide were formally recognized as a crime in international criminal law, the activities of Monsanto could possibly constitute a crime of ecocide.
4. There is a need to assert the primacy of international human and environmental rights law. A set of legal rules is in place to protect investors rights in the frame of the World Trade Organisation and in b ilateral investment treaties and in clauses in free-trade agreements. These provisions tend to undermine the capacity of nations to maintain policies, laws and practices protecting human and environmental rights. United Nations bodies urgently need to take action; otherwise key questions of human and environmental rights violations will be resolved by private tribunals operating entirely outside the United Nations framework.
5. Non-state actors must be held responsible within international human rights law. Multinational enterprises should be recognized as responsible actors and should be subjected to the International Criminal Court jurisdiction in case of infringement of fundamental rights. The Tribunal clearly identifies and denounces a severe disparity between the rights of multinational corporations and their obligations. Therefore, the advisory opinion encourages authoritative bodies to protect the effectiveness of international human rights and environmental law against the conduct of multinational corporations.
These conclusions open the door for the filing of damages suits against manufacturers and users. It has already started in California against oil companies - that they promoted their businesses and products while knowingly, and deliberately covering up the dangers of pollution and predicted dangers of climate change. Monsanto too stands exposed to such claims by farmers who are now dying of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma after using glyphosate for over 20 years in their farms. The Companys history is worse than dismal. They have exposed the world to DDT, BPA, Lasso, Strychnine, Aspartame, Agent Orange, Dioxin, genetically modified seeds and one or two more products in addition to glyphosate.
All these products have raised very serious health hazard controversies and consumer opposition. Many were banned. All were strongly promoted as safe.
Our administrators must be ignorant of the fact that a small Irish company has introduced in Austria their own herbicide under the name of Roundup with the permission of Monsanto, but with a different active ingredient replacing glyphosate. And that active ingredient Nothing but the good old traditional weed killer  Vinegar!
If vinegar is too expensive, acetic acid can be used since it could be much cheaper as it is imported in bulk for the rubber industry. Vinegar and a 5%-10% acetic acid solution in water are almost the same in acid strength.
Another possible weed killer is kerosene. Another possibility is a blow torch fitted with a long handle to enable a standing worker to apply the flame on the weeds at ground level.
Please note that all these methods kill soil bacteria, but not as badly as Roundup does. If you want healthy plants and good harvests, you must have healthy soil. Healthy soils have phosphorus and nitrogen produced in plant absorbable forms and quantities by soil bacteria.
People have to tackle this problem of the pros and cons of glyphosate through the application of the Precautionary Principle. The Precautionary Principle is a strategy to cope with possible risks where scientific understanding is yet incomplete, such as the risks of nano technology, genetically modified organisms and systemic insecticides. Though here it is couched in high-faluting language, it is a simple and natural reaction or act of all living beings.
When you see danger you take precautions. It is a natural automatic or common-sense reaction. You do not ask for scientific proof.
Take precautions
If you throw up after eating spoiled food, you put an immediate stop to eating that food. You do not want proof that the food is spoilt. You know it made you sick. That is sufficient for you.
Take a look at the current dengue epidemic. You see mosquitoes in your garden. Do you try to get proof that they are dengue virus carriers No. You just eliminate them.
You get dengue. You are not aware of a mosquito bite.
Then how can you say your illness is due to a mosquito And to which particular mosquito Do you demand proof that it carried the virus No to all. You take the precaution of getting treatment for the important need of saving your life.
That is what is urged with glyphosate formulations too. Take precautions. Use it only after its use is proved to be reasonably safe. Current minimum safety levels are fictitious. The MSL in the USA is SEVEN times that in the EU. Can this be so if the MSLs are based on research Shams like this provoke people to protest. There has been too much humbugging with glyphosate.
Re-use will not happen. Glyphosate is a slow, insidious and inevitable killer. It kills the crucial bacteria in our gut.
It chelates with crucial trace nutrient elements taken in from our food, as well as with metal nuclei of the enzymes in our body. In doing so it impedes growth and normal metabolic processes causing nutrient and trace metal deficiencies, cell damage, cell mutation, organ collapse and so on  all leading to serious illness and finally death.
There is no preventive treatment, let alone a cure, so far. In this light, Monsantos claim of safety is a total lie.

Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that in the letter, the GMOA requested all MPs to raise the issue of governments inability to solve the SAITM issue and the general crisis the health sector has fallen into due to the Health Ministers conduct.
Aluthge said that the letter especially addresses allegations against the Health Minister for showing partiality when solving the SAITM issue since a close relation of the Health Minister is studying in SAITM and handing over the responsibility of solving the SAITM issue to the Health Minister.
The letter consists of eight key points.
In addition, the letter also points out some key issues to all the MPs. Some of them are ignoring the commonly agreed practical set of proposals presented to solve the SAITM issue, pumping Rs. 3000 million of public funds annually to maintain a privately owned hospital, not gazetting the minimum standards of medical education and purposely sabotaging all solutions and efforts made by the President and Prime Minister to solve the SAITM issue, he added.

Hamlet in you, above all!
Bard's most beloved and famous character with a harsh ending, Prince of Denmark, Hamlet's character is built up quickly and fast forward that ends the hopelessness and the frustration in the philosophy of life. Hamlet never differs in dignity but is often over-subtilized and unmatched in features of blown youth. He has the bearing and the intelligence and not afraid to simplify.
I always believe there is a Hamlet in every man if he is able to assess himself. To begin with, every speech of Hamlet can be fitted into a mosaic of effects arising from his young life over-brimming in tragedy and pain of mind. Looking at all theatrical Hamlet variations, we all defy their pigeonholing for Hamlet was never a happy prince often pondering: 'To be or not to be'.
Ancient chronicle
Shakespeare who chose not to be a strict disciplinarian because they remain remote in time and place from his age. He opted to select his fables from Italian romances, English histories, French tragedies and ancient chronicle. He had the audacity to pry into PLUTARCH of Thomas North.
This proves Shakespeare's foreign plots and he must not be censored too hard for many of the strange events that occurred in his plays. One must remember that he was not the historian of his time and neither did he pretend to be one. He may have been careless with time and places; or for that matter, the countries and in the process for he invents many of them. This makes us think why the strange events that took place in Denmark or the wilds of Scotland, may have been more accurate if one of his contemporaries among the University-wits, wrote the identical plays.
Most of his plays were founded on imagination though, at the end, they looked so convincing to create characters that were to be immortalized in the future; such as Hamlet and Ophelia; Romeo and Juliet, Portia, Othello. etc.
Unfailing humanity
It is indeed not enough to evaluate Shakespeare's gifts but to accept them in totality. Very rarely can another playwright give the illusion to their characters the way he has done. Even those who have been critical, fail to sum him up, have failed and are always excessive, inhumane, arbitrary or over-theatrical and fail to recognize their own extravagance. However, they even reluctantly accept that his characters whether good or bad, move with the realities of romantic or historical happenings and possess unfailing humanity that makes plausible with in senses and sympathy.
The profound difference in Bard's work and that of his contemporaries contains the greater truth that is more serious and substantial and fundamentally does not belong to his plays.
They are academically more advanced, logical and philosophical on which they have majored from seats of the academy. More often than not, These University-wits have rubbed it hard and sore on Shakespeare who would not even have felt its impact because of his secondary education.
With time, Shakespeare proved his superiority and completely wiped their theories out. He proved his point when he gave much space to the apical and consciously continued on a greater scale. He lay before them that he had been in contact with what were or what he believed to be, the realities of the past.
It was a challenge none could take up.
Genuine history
His efforts to revive the happenings of the past left him with a taste of truth in his treatment of subjects and their characters.
His six dramas of English history and three Roman tragedies together with Hamlet, Lear and Macbeth are based on earlier legendary chronicles accepted as genuine history, are in my opinion incorrect and found nowhere else but in Shakespearean drama. I do not understand why Shakespeare wits fail to accept my theory and speak out when the truth is glaring out. Why be afraid of Shakespeare
Many believe that other playwrights made history unreal and Shakespeare did not. I do not agree on this but that Shakespeare could warrant the truth where it is necessary. His works mostly connect to national history with ancient religious drama and edification.
Skipping from one chronicle to another impartially he leaves London for Rome and abandons his inspirational leanings from Holinshed for Plutarch. He snaps its spirit to paint the characters such as Coriolanus, Brutus, Julius Caesar, Antony Cleopatra etc. His first act was to breathe new life into famous idols and events.
Human drama
Did he do it I suppose so;
Violation of truth incapable of conceiving drama made Shakespeare less scrupulously reactive. With him, the broad epic manner was an insight to human drama that he highlighted in his plays. He had an excellent fantasy and gentle expressions wherein he flowed it, was necessary for him to have stopped but did not. This is where I find his controversial attitude while scholars keep silent over it. To the point of excesses, he is an abundant writer and lacks self-control where his genius ran away with him as mentioned by Ben Jonson. I always believe that literary judgment often rests upon antithesis. Laboriously the minds of men are focused and contrast spontaneously where it is warranted. I have tried and is still trying to deal with this side of Willian Shakespeare in the weekly series I wrote in the Daily News under the caption, INSIDE SHAKESPEARE's MIND, but still failed to get to the bottom of it.
Besides his variety of poetic gifts, he could endow imaginary beings with life and events and developed the easy natural spontaneous efforts. Very few characters of any importance in any play earlier failed to receive from their creators the vital spark until Shakespeare arrived and changed the scenario. The world persuades audiences and readers alike in the presence of his plays today as it was from the beginning ever since he took centre stage in the theatre much to the discomfort of the puritans of the day. It is principally in this respect that Shakespeare differ and surpass his rivals.
He remains Shakespeare every day, every moment.
But is Shakespeare's art less real because it is essentially mobile Shakespeare tendency to efface all its traces can reveal their secret. But hidden behind illusions, his art creates what the mind refuses to bear. His sonnets bear testimony to this side of his work. It is true that he can be eloquent and effective where it is warranted and has the wit to feed his characters differently. In doing justice to a genre that doth not belong to him but using it for a noble and artificial tragedy, the force of contrast become his own, unless Shakespeare tells us that a particular play is an adaptation, most of us will be ignorant of the fact. He is open about from where he borrows inspiration but declaim it as essential. Very often, he makes a real character from a clown or fool to add dignity to play.
Supreme master
And Shakespeare is crafty; he never repeats a character nor an event. Each play has its own authenticity. He is a great storyteller, a psychologist by turn.
Is not HAMLET a fragment of a tragedy. He should have still built around the story to make it more high-profile. It is his best tragedy and plays with such powerful dialogue as not found anywhere else in his plays.
He turns philosophical in places and question how low doth love obey How is the thread that binds hearts, spun and broken on sudden changes of feelings; He cannot answer himself through to him love is the supreme master of wisdom and feel. They repudiate their own vows to frustration which the Prince of Denmark is all about.
THAT IS WHY I KEEP REPEATING THAT THERE IS A PART OF HAMLET IN EVERY MAN.

Hope for breast cancer patients
A new scanning technique could predict whether breast cancer is likely to spread into the lungs, research suggests. Scientists hope the innovative technique could allow doctors to intensively treat tumours before they start to expand. The research by UK scientists is still at an early stage, and so far has only been proven to work in mice.
But if it can be replicated in humans it would dramatically improve the prognosis of those diagnosed with breast cancer. Tumours in the breast are relatively easy to treat, because they can be simply removed with surgery or targeted with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
But when the cancer spreads to another part of the body - a process known as metastasis - it is much harder to treat.
Most deaths from cancer are caused by secondary tumours, which in breast cancer usually appear in the lungs, the liver or the bones.
Scientists at King's College London think the new imaging technique will allow them to identify women whose cancer is likely to spread into their lungs, allowing them to use intensive treatments earlier to stop the spread.
What did they find
The researchers discovered specific immune cells, called 'myeloid-derived suppressor cells' or MDSCs, start to accumulate in high levels in the lungs before the cancer spreads. These cells suppress the local immune system and promote the formation of new blood vessels, paving the way for the cancer to spread. The King's team developed a radioactive 'tracer' molecule which detects these MDSC cells using a 3D gamma-ray scanner.
The tracer is injected into the patient, binds onto the MDSC cells, and shows up on the scanner.
The team, whose work is published in the Theranostics journal, found in tests on mice that they could spot the MDSC cells well before any lung tumours became visible.
Further research is needed
Researcher Dr Fabian Flores-Borja said: 'By combining cell biology and imaging techniques, we have established a method to predict, at an early time-point during tumour development, whether tumour invasion will occur. 'We envision this technique being used to help select patients for either further surveillance or intensified therapy, as well as aiding cancer research. 'The development of a test that is able to identify an increased risk of metastasis soon after a patient is diagnosed with breast cancer, would be very useful in helping choose the best treatment for patients.'
Breast cancer: The facts
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among British women, with more than 55,000 diagnosed each year.
The vast majority of these women - 78 per cent - survive for at least a decade after receiving their diagnosis.
But the cancer still kills 11,400 women a year, virtually all of them after tumours spread outside the breast.
The findings are 'exciting'
Baroness Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now, which helped fund the study, added: 'While more research is needed before this could be tested in patients, the prospect of a hospital scan which could predict whether breast cancer will spread to the lungs is incredibly exciting.
'More immediately, this study brings a brand-new method to the table that will help researchers unpick how the immune system is involved in the spread of breast cancer. Finding ways to predict and halt the spread of the disease will be crucial if we are to finally stop people dying from it.
'This is a promising step towards being able to use 3D imaging to help offer more personalised therapy. Ultimately, anything that could provide patients and their doctors with a more accurate picture of whether their breast cancer may spread will help us tailor treatments to stop this from happening.' http://www.dailymail.co.uk

I regret we could not spend more time with Prabhakaran:Solheim
Norwegian peace mediator Erik Solheim, breaks his silence on his controversial role in a conversation with WIONs Padma Rao Sundarji. Excerpts of the interview.
Padma Rao Sundarji: How and when did the government of Norway decide to mediate in Sri Lanka and why did they pick you
Erik Solheim: We were invited in absolute secrecy by the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga. At the time, only two people in Colombo knew, she and foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. It stayed like that for one-and-a-half years. Only later, it became public.I believe we were invited because we could potentially be acceptable to India as a small nation. And, we were invited because we had, at that time, seen some successes in the Middle East. They were small successes. But as a small, faraway nation it was felt that we could not really mess up Sri Lanka and could be acceptable to both the Tigers and the government of Sri Lanka at the same time.
Q: And were you acceptable to New Delhi too
There was a lot of scepticism in Delhi. What will these pink, Christian Europeans with no real knowledge of South Asia make of problems on this continent But at the end, we were not only acceptable to India, we had the closest relationship. After every visit to Sri Lanka, I went to New Delhi to inform the political leadership and the Indian intelligence about what I had achieved or not achieved.
Take us back to your first and earliest effort at peace mediation in Sri Lanka. When was that and what was the result
It was when I went to meet Prabhakaran for the first time. Again, that was not known to anyone in Sri Lanka; not even the PM was aware that we were allowed to go there by the President. We met him in an area controlled by the Tigers. We went by helicopter. Flying low over the fields and up again if it was mountains, it was kind of scary. Because neither the army nor the LTTE cadres on the ground knew we were there, they could have easily shot us down. Then we met with Prabhakaran. It was a good meeting. They confirmed their interest in the peace process. But it was a little bit difficult to understand how Prabhakaran got this enormous standing among Tamils, how he could be seen as their god, creator, and saviour at the time. He had this huge following. But we couldnt really understand why people were following him like that.
Q:What proved to be the biggest hurdles during all the years of peace mediation
The first of two main hurdles was the fact that Sri Lankas Sinhala community was divided into two main parties, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP). Through independence, these two parties fought for power and both were much more consumed by the power struggle than with outreach to the Tamil community. Whenever one party was in power, the other party would oppose whatever the rival party did. Then the power would shift and so would positions.That was a huge problem. The Tamil community could not really place any confidence in any single offer from the Sinhala leaders because they did not know whether it would last. And then the more important issue: everyone knew that the only solution would be not a separate state but a federal organisation of Sri Lanka. In which the Tamils would have a lot of say and self-rule in the Tamil-dominated area but within one Sri Lankan state. And then, was Prabhakaran really ready for anything but a separate state Could he embrace federalism The LTTE did that in one meeting in Oslo in 2002. But Prabhakaran was not consistent on acceptance of federalism. Still, we do not know whether he would have later accepted it. So working with that was difficult.These were the two main difficulties.
There are a lot of allegations against the Norwegian mediators. One is that even though the LTTE, within years of the struggle, were acknowledged to be an armed separatist group, the Norwegians turned a blind eye to that fact. And that the Norwegians to date maintain connections to many overseas ex-LTTE groups like the Transnational government of Tamil Eelam that sprung up even after the war ended. Could you address some of those allegations
Remember that during our many years in Sri Lanka, we never ever did anything which we were not asked to do by the government of Sri Lanka. We worked with the government and the Tamil Tigers. We did not come with a lot of Norwegian opinions because we realised that our knowledge of Sri Lanka is limited. I dont speak Tamil, I dont speak Sinhala. I am not a Buddhist, I am not a Hindu, how can I really understand Sri Lanka So what we could do is to see what the government wants, what the Tigers want and bring that together. That was our role.
Since you mention it, the leadership of the LTTE was Christian
Yes but the LTTE leadership was not really really religious and those who were, were Hindu. But I dont think religion was important to them. The driving energy for Mr Prabhakaran was his Tamil national view. He took the names of the Tigers from historical Tamil kings. And they really adored the Tamil language. Some of his advisors would often say that all the southern Indian languages be it Kannada, Malayalam or Telugu, were all versions of Tamil. So it was a very very strong Tamil nationalism. Of course, it was also based on the fact that Tamils have been enormously successful.The Tamil diaspora is the most successful anywhere in the world, stockbrokers, doctors, lawyers, they do very very well. Even in India, the state of Tamil Nadu is doing better than others. So the Tamils have a lot to be proud of and that was the driving energy for Prabhakaran and the LTTE, not a religion.
Indeed, that is another allegation.That there is a sizable Norwegian population of Sri Lankan Tamils in Norway and that they are the reason why the Norwegian government, and Erik Solheim, got involved in Sri Lanka. After all, you have been a politician in your country too.
To the contrary. We kept a very limited contact with the Tamil community in Norway for this very reason. Also because our main point of contact with the LTTE was their chief political advisor Anton Balasingham in London, whom I met every week. Simultaneously, our ambassador in Colombo would meet Chandrika Kumaratunga, Lakshman Kadirgamar and later Ranil Wickremesinghe every week too. Balasingham did not want us to involve the Tamil expat community. So the Tamil community neither had any influence on the peace process nor was kept in the loop. Indian leaders were -I went to Delhi all the time. But we did not inform the Tamil community in Norway for this reason.
I remember speaking to your successor, Jon Hanssen-Bauer, the evening the Norwegians decided to pack their bags and leave the peace process. What was the last straw for the Norwegians When you finally threw up your hands and said look were not touching this anymore
We actually never did that. We said until the last day that if we can be useful to the government of Sri Lanka, to the Tamil Tigers, we are there for you. And we were being criticised for that attitude. People were telling us you should have stayed, you should have done more, that we had the wrong attitude. Here is a small nation, trying to assist two communities, the Tamils and the Sinhalese, in a country where thousands are dying every month and every year, there is no way you can give up, you mustnt give up, as long as they want your support, you should support them. That was the one constant message from Delhi and from Washington (but Delhi was more important to us), please dont give up, please continue, never give up. Even if you cant do anything big, if you can do something small, please continue. I remember during my first visit to Delhi. Jaswant Singh was the foreign minister. After a long chat, he said: I have only one question. Are you patient I said, no, no, Im not patient, how can we be when people are dying in Sri Lanka every month Mothers are crying, children are dying, how can we be patient To that, Singh said: do you know the way to Indira Gandhi International Airport Go. Buy a ticket, making sure its a one-way ticket to Europe. Because if youre not patient, youll only run into problems here. If you take a 10-15 year perspective on the Sri Lankan conflict, then you may do something good. Of course, he was right, I was wrong. We learned our lessons and became patient. But still, the fundamental issues in Sri Lanka, the status of Tamils, and the influence of Tamils within the state of Sri Lanka are not resolved.
Q: Tell us more about your relationship with LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran. I remember you told me once that you went fishing together. Was it a friendship or more of a business relationship
What I regret with the benefit of hindsight is that we could not spend more time with him. I met him more often than any other foreigner did in the world because basically he just met Tamils, only once met a Muslim delegation in Sri Lanka, met with a few Sinhalese but nearly always just met with Tamils. If we had spent more time with him, we would probably be able to influence him more. We did try to establish a more personal relationship with him by speaking about issues he really cared about, he was interested in films for sure, in food, he was known to be a good cook himself, he took some interest in nature. But it was hard to build a personal relationship because we had limited time and were not allowed to go up to the warring North by the Sri Lankan government too often. Then there was also a language barrier  his speaking in Tamil meant we needed an interpreter. And finally, he was the kind of a character who was not obviously open. Charismatic, but more closed and cautious.
Q: But didnt the fact that the LTTE used child soldiers, practically invented the suicide bomb, didnt these facts disturb you while you were negotiating with him After all, you come from the European/ Scandinavian tradition which is so firmly embedded in human rights
Absolutely. But we also negotiated with people on the Sri Lankan governments side who committed huge war crimes and evil acts. Despite all that I used to just ask myself one question: what do the victims of the crimes want us to do I came to the conclusion that what the victims really wanted was for us to speak to these guys and put a stop to this war. So, more important than my feelings was the impact on the victims.Tens of thousands of Sri Lankans died, thousands of young Tiger cadres but also young soldiers from southern Sri Lankan villages and, towards the end of the war, tens of thousands of Tamil civilian victims. So, what did the victims want I feel that peace negotiators in Yemen, Syria and other parts of the world must also focus on that, what the victims expect of us, how can we put a stop to the war.
Why are Scandinavians and Europeans, and you all have constitutions embedded in the protection of human rights, so concerned about violations by the armies of other sovereign countries In the case of Sri Lanka, there were certainly alleged violations of human rights by the Sri Lankan armed forces and they are still being investigated by the Sri Lankan army. But what about the wars that western nations are themselves involved in, like in the Middle East, in Iraq, Syria where there are hundreds and thousands of human rights violations by your troops taking place on a daily basis Why do they go unnoticed Why do they not evoke that great an interest Is it because these nations, like NATO states, for instance, are involved in those wars themselves
If one has that perspective, it is obviously completely wrong. I went into politics to a large extent because of the war in Vietnam, a war where the US committed enormous crimes. A completely unnecessary war which achieved nothing. It merely killed 2-3 million Vietnamese, 55 thousand Americans. And of course today, Vietnam is a blossoming nation, rapidly moving economically  and  best friends with the United States! So at the end of the day, all those millions suffered or died for nothing. If the Americans had left Vietnam alone, this would not have happened. War crimes and all unnecessary wars by all sides should obviously be condemned and we should focus on the conflict entrepreneurs who start wars.The United States has started a number of unnecessary wars. Very few people today believe it was a good idea to attack Iraq. Even if Saddam Hussein was a most despicable, horrible dictator, the US war has created so many problems. If it werent for that war, we would probably not have the Islamic State today. So lets keep an equal focus on western and non-western wars and on terrorists and armies.
But I will persist. The EU and the US initially looked upon the separatist war in Sri Lanka as a  freedom struggle.  They offered refuge to many thousands of LTTE cadres. And these overseas Tiger sympathisers armed and funded the LTTE  K.Pathmanathan, their chief financier, told me this in an interview with WION earlier this year. Why do western countries sometimes live in La- La  land as far as faraway conflicts are concerned Hasnt the West made a mistake in nurturing and harbouring these groups
Lets accept that the public in many western countries has limited knowledge about other parts of the world and quite often make mistakes. For many years, I was in Myanmar. The western world kept up a boycott, sanctions on Myanmar which did not work. When I spoke to westerners, they said yes, we know sanctions do not work but we will still continue with them. So this ignorance, or lack of real concern, is definitely there.The answer to that is to try to understand more. And we should obviously find an amicable peaceful solution to any conflict. If the Sinhalese and the Tamil leaders had been able to do that in the 50s or 70s, the conflict would not have come. And of course, fighting for Tamil rights, I have a lot of sympathy with that but, I have no sympathy with suicide bombing or, killing Rajiv Gandhi or, planting bus bombs or attacking the holy temple of Sinhala Buddhism in Kandy. Tamil Tigers made such horrible decisions, killing people. But we should all have some sympathy with the Tamils in Sri Lanka. If you are a Tamil there and you want to go to the police, the police just speak Sinhala so you can understand, thats not easy.
Q: There are Eelam separatist organisations regrouping within Europe, they frequently raise the LTTE flag and that flag symbolises separatism, not merely Tamil rights. Why are your governments allowing this
European countries allow basic freedom of expression, some find that positive, others not so. But I agree with you. Part of it is naivet about what different groups want to do and that naivet must stop. But when we worked in Sri Lanka, we were constantly doing everything on the basis of what the Sri Lankan government wanted and what the LTTE wanted, we were concentrated within that and aware that our knowledge was limited. Thats why we consulted India all the time because Indian intelligence had much more information about what was actually happening on the ground in Sri Lanka than I could possess. So it was useful to tap into their deep knowledge of the conflict.
The most controversial aspect of your involvement in Sri Lanka remains shrouded in mystery to most people. I remember you spoke to me about it briefly at the time but the details remain largely shrouded. Would you care to tell us about the White Flag incident involving the killing of LTTE top brass Puleedevan, Nadesan and others, despite their willingness to surrender And the allegation that will not go away that you personally tried to save LTTE chief Prabhakaran and his family
It was on the 17th of May. It is also Norwegian national day so I remember it since I was on my way to our parade in Oslo. I received a call from Puleedevan, he was one of the nicest members of the Tigers. He was the chief of the LTTEs political wing. He told us they wanted to surrender to the Sri Lankan army and whether we could assist him. I did not speak to him directly but a Norwegian colleague told him that it was too late for us to intervene because the end of the war was very close. We pointed out that we had offered them opportunities in the past to give up the struggle at a time when it was still possible for us to intervene. But that it was too late now. But what we can ask you, we told him, is to hoist a big white flag, that s why its called the White Flag incident, and through loudspeakers and whatever means you have, make your intentions known to the Sri Lankan armed forces.We, on our part, will inform Sri Lankan leaders of your intention to surrender.
Q:And did you inform the Sri Lankan leaders
Absolutely for sure. We informed Basil Rajapaksa, the advisor to President Rajapaksa. We were not alone, the Tigers did the same through some key Tamil and also, I think with some Indian interlocutors to send a message to the Sri Lankan leadership.The day after, we were informed that Nadesan and Puleedevan were killed. The exact circumstances of the killing are still not known. I dont think they were with Prabhakaran at the time but I dont know this exactly. How Prabhakaran himself was killed, I do not know either.
The most challenging was, of course, the peace process in Sri Lanka. Because that was a matter of life and death for people. We knew that our acts may increase the killings if we did not get it right. During two years, there was not a single political assassination in Sri Lanka, which was considered huge progress at the time. Later, it went out of control and tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed. But the challenge to mediate between these two, the Tigers and the Sri Lankan leadership, and also being criticised for whatever we did which is normal in times of both peace and war, that was the biggest challenge.
Q:So you dont regret playing the role of mediator at all
I have no regrets.The only regret is that we did not succeed, because if we had succeeded, tens of thousands of people, who are now dead, would have been alive. Now when I look into the eyes of the women who lost their husbands or mothers who lost their children, whether they are Sinhalese or Tamil, I always ask myself, could we not have given them more. But if you ask what I enjoy the most, thats my present position. Because working for the global environment is in my view the defining issue of our time.

Q:Are you planning to return to Sri Lanka in the near future We hear youre writing a book on that experience...
Im not writing a book on Sri Lanka. I would be very happy to go back. But I will not go back in any way which is seen as a problem for the peace-makers, the reconciliators in Sri Lanka. I have so many friends there Chandrika, Ranil, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Tamil National Alliance leaders, the Muslim leader Rauff Hakeem, I want to see them all. But I will go at a time when it does not create problems for anyone.
Q: Did Sri Lanka become a kind of a second home to you
Absolutely. Its a place I care about the most other than my home country.
