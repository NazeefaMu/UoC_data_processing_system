Musicians and bilinguals have more efficient brains !
Playing a musical instrument or learning another language could protect against dementia, according to research. Scientists found that the process of learning as an adult trains the brain to become more efficient. Brain scans showed that musicians and bilinguals are able to activate different regions of the brain, which uses less energy.
These areas of the brain make use of different networks which means less brain activity is required to complete certain functions. As a result of the unique and energy efficient way these brains operate, they are less likely to develop dementia. The scans revealed that the brains of these people used fewer resources to memory test.
Senior scientist Dr Claude Alain, of Baycrests Rotman Research Institute in Toronto, said: These findings show that musicians and bilinguals require less effort to perform the same task, which could also protect them against cognitive decline and delay the onset of dementia. Our results also demonstrated that a persons experiences, whether its learning how to play a musical instrument or another language, can shape how the brain functions and which networks are used.
This study builds on previous research which has found that musicians and polyglots are better at retaining information. For example, this subset of the population are better at remembering a phone number, a list of instructions or doing mental arithmetic.
A reason why, however, was never found. This mystery has been solved by scientists at Baycrest. As the first study of its kind to use brain scans, it aimed to uncover how these activities boost different parts of the brain among individuals.
The study involved 41 young adults aged 19 to 35 who fit into three categories: English-speaking non-musicians, musicians who only spoke English and bilinguals who didnt play a musical instrument.
Brain imagery captured the thought process for each participant as they were asked to identify whether the sound they heard was the same type as the previous one.
Brain scans were done as each participant was asked to identify whether the sound they heard was the same type as the previous one. They were played a variety of sounds from musical instruments, the environment and humans. They were then also asked to identify if what they heard was coming from the same direction as the previous noise.
Musicians remembered the type of sound faster than individuals in the other groups, while bilinguals and musicians performed better on the location task. Bilinguals performed at the same level as individuals who spoke only one language and didnt play a musical instrument when it came to the tasks, but they still showed less brain activity when completing the task.
Dr Alain, added: People who speak two languages may take longer to process sounds since the information is run through two language libraries rather than just one During this task, the brains of bilinguals showed greater signs of activation in areas that are known for speech comprehension, supporting this theory.
Further research is planned to explore the impact of art and musical training among adults to see if this leads to changes in brain function.

Muslim womens painful wait for redressal
Eight years ago, Fathima Faika (45) lived out the story of a Hollywood blockbuster when she found her way to Malaysia to bring back her two sons, taken away from her by her ex-husband. Armed with no money, influence or power but simple raw determination packed in her tired little body, she brought them home. Her story captured the headlines and inspired all women out there.
But her biggest battle thus far has been fighting for maintenance of the children she rescued.
Living in a rented two-bedroom apartment in the interiors of Rajagiriya today, she trudges along from hospital to courts - the former to cure her own ailing body and the other to ensure that her children are given their due.
From dressmaking to selling used furniture, she has tried them all, she said. But having gone through a physically and mentally abusive marriage, her health is failing. She is too sick to work as hard.
Her ex-husband, Mohamed Shadath Naushad, she said, however, was doing very well for himself and lived a life of luxury.Thus it is only fair that he spends at least for the basic needs of his children, said Faika.
The only problem was that she was fighting against a system that was designed to oppose her. In the case of Muslims, cases of maintenance after a divorce are handled by the Quazi courts in Sri Lanka and since the inception of these courts, very few women have found justice in them.
Initially I did not want to file for maintenance, because my brother helped me financially. But thereafter, he too had to look after his affairs.
Case filed
On the brink of poverty, in April 2014, Faika filed a case for maintenance with the Borella North Quazi court.
A Quazi known as Lawyer Marzook was in charge and having fought for custody, she had been fearful that she might have to share custody of her children if she applied for maintenance. I spoke to the Quazi first and asked him whether I had to show the kids if I filed for maintenance. The Quazi assured me that custody was not a matter for his court but the district court, she said.
Having been thus assured, Faika filed for maintenance from her ex-husband, but when the case was called up, her husband did not show up in courts. Thus the case was postponed. Quazi Marzook thereafter had issued notice to the Wellampitiya OIC (police division of the husband) to ensure that he turned up next time around.
Faika recalled that she personally approached the OIC Wellampitiya to appeal to him to deliver the notice and ensure that the husband received the notice. This is not the first time she had to follow up. In Quazi courts, if a notice is sent to the husband for failing to make payments or show up in courts, it becomes the duty of the wife to ensure that he receives the notice, at times even paying stamp, registration and stationery fees.
When Faikas ex-husband did finally turn up in court, Marzooks stance, she said had magically changed. The once sympathetic Quazi asked that she not be stubborn and accommodate the wishes of her abusive husband.
He said the father was willing to give money and that I should allow him to have access to my children. He said he would recommend Rs. 30,000 per month for them. He also asked that I go to Dehiwela for marriage counselling, even though we were divorced. I am divorced, I dont need counselling.
Her case was postponed. Having no choice but to go for marriage counselling with her ex-husband, Faika returned more traumatised, but in the hope that she would get her maintenance payments.
Marzook postponed the case again and when I asked for the court proceedings, he said, Why do you need this Why are you coming here Go to district courts, she said, adding, But maintenance can only be heard in the Quazi court.
Marzooks Quazi court she recalled was like a fish market with people shouting at each other in filth. Marzook would move parents and women to tears with his language.
Maintenance
In 2015, the Borella North Quazi Court saw a new and kinder face in that of Khaled Moulavi. Faika once again explained to the new Quazi that she could under no circumstance grant access of her children to her ex-husband,
He is not a good influence on them. He gave me and other women he has been with, an STD. He is also known to be a criminal. How can I have him influence them
Once again, her ex-husband did not turn up for hearings, despite various notices being sent, preferring instead to have the case postponed, each time for a period of six months.
Khaled Moulavi asked me if I was finally agreeable to a lump sum and let things go, but I said I could not do that because the childrens expenses keep increasing, she explained.
Khaled Moulavi thus advised that whilst the ex-husband would have to bear all the schooling expenses, he would have to provide, in addition, Rs. 25,000 for the elder child and Rs. 15,000 for the younger child.
The children attended a well-known international school in Colombo, at the insistence of the ex-husband at the custody hearing earlier, but he had refused to pay the fee which accompanied such expensive schooling.
Despite the ruling however, Faika was not paid maintenance by her ex-husband. Given that Quazi courts have very little power to enforce their rulings, they are often not taken seriously.
As no money came in even four months after the ruling, Faika approached the Quazi courts once again, and this time, the case was transferred to the magistrates court. At the magistrates court too, her husband failed to show up and after going through two hearings with him not showing up, the magistrate issued him notice to show up.
My ex-husband keeps postponing the case for no reason. He keeps saying he did not get notice. He just likes to waste time. He has appealed the maintenance at the high court also. But does not show up.
At the high court, it was ordered that the husband pay up the Rs. 160,000 he owed her for four months, but since that amount, no other maintenance has come. She has to thus once again go to courts to get the rest of the money.
Maintenance cases should be finished as soon as possible. Children cant starve in the house, observed Faika. It took close to three years to get Rs. 160,000 and I had to spend Rs. 300,000 to get that.
Talaq or not
For the last 19 years, Faika has been struggling in the Quazi courts to have justice served to her and her children. She married in 1997 and her husband, having mentally and physically abused her, divorced her in 1999, but she later found that this too was not done properly by the relevant Quazi court and there was doubt with regard to her being divorced. The ex-husband had not uttered the word talaq (I divorce you) thrice as required, and her certificate did not have the judges signature on it.
This confusion led her to go back to him in 2002. Her second son was born in 2004. The abuse however continued and she left him once again. Her ex-husband, in the meantime, had married another woman in Kallady without registering the marriage.
He would say that we are married, when it suited him, and divorced, when he wanted to get another. He would not register the other marriages and those women find it hard to apply for divorce or maintenance of their children, because the marriages were not registered, said Faika.
MMDA reforms
Faika is not the first or last woman to undergo injustice at the hands of the Quazi courts. Countless women walk through its ill-equipped rooms and poorly led courts to find freedom.
In 2009, the Justice Ministry appointed a 19-member committee to look into reforms into the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Act (MMDA) (also MM&D Act). The Committee submitted their report in January 2018 - nine years later, with just 16 members left and opinion divided. The report has touched on the issues Faika has faced - from registration of marriages, divorces, maintenance and the appointment of qualified personnel to Quazi courts - so that the law is applied without prejudice. There is general consensus within the community that the Quazi court and Quazis should be brought into the mainstream of the Sri Lankan judicial system and the status of the Quazi court and Quazis should be enhanced, noted the report.
They recommend the following:
 The reduction of the number of Quazis from the current 64 to a number that may be considered adequate by the Judicial Service Commission, considering the volume of work.
 To make it financially viable to appoint permanent and full-time Quazis.
 To mandate that the primary function of the Quazi to be judicial and administrative with the reconciliatory function of the Quazi court being entrusted to trained counsellors and mediators.
 To have only attorneys-at-law with sound knowledge of Muslim law, appointed as Quazis.
 To empower the Judicial Service Commission to prescribe, by order published in the gazette, the qualifications and attainments necessary for appointment of a person as a Quazi.
 To renumerate Quazis sufficiently in keeping with the dignity of their office and to make it a permanent position and recognise it as a closed service with consideration for appointment into higher judicial office.
 Restructuring the Board of Quazis and making it more accessible to the provinces and having the chairman of the Quazi Appellate Court be a Muslim attorney-at-law with sound knowledge of Muslim law and possessed of such qualifications and attainments that may be prescribed by the Judicial Service Commission.
It was further unanimously recommended that the MM&D Act should also specifically provide that in making appointments to the Quazi Appellate Court, the Judicial Service Commission shall ensure that adequate representation is provided therein for men and women, and that any person who has previously held office as a member of the Board of Quazis or the Quazi Appellate Court shall be eligible for re-appointment to the Quazi Appellate Court for a fresh term of office.
To ensure greater gender equality in the law, they have also recommended:
(a) Ensuring adequate representation for Muslim men and women in the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Advisory Board as proposed in this Report.
(b) Removing the disqualification of women from holding office as Registrars of Muslim Marriage by deleting the word male in Sections 8(1), 9(1) and 10(1) of the MM&D Act dealing with the appointment of Registrars of Muslim Marriage, Temporary Registrars and Special Registrars.
(c) Amending Section 15(1) of the Act by substituting for the words male Muslims the word Muslim and expressly providing that in making appointments to the Quazi Appellate Court (Board of Quazis), the Judicial Service Commission should ensure that adequate representation is provided for men and women in the positions stipulated in the MMDA.
When it comes to registration of marriages, opinion has been split with regard to making it compulsory. Whilst the majority have asked that it be made compulsory, a minority section of the group has asked that a penalty be enforced instead on the husband if it is not registered.
The majority have also asked that the bride be allowed to sign the marriage certificate, signifying consent to the marriage.
Moreover, the Committee in general agreed to the following:
(1) Every Registrar of Muslim marriages maintain, in the prescribed form, a current index of the contents of every book and register kept by him, except where it is otherwise provided by regulation; and every entry in such index shall be made, so far as practicable, immediately after he has made an entry in the book or register.
(2) Every Registrar of Muslim marriages shall keep all registers, books and indexes until they are filled up and shall then forward them for record to the District Registrar.
(3) Except as provided in this Act, no person other than a Registrar of Muslim Marriages shall keep any book or register which is or purports to be a register of Muslim marriages maintained under this Act.
(4) The Registrar General may inspect or cause to be inspected, from time to time, the books and the registers required to be kept under this Act by any Registrar of Muslim Marriages and may entertain and hear any complaints against any Registrar of Muslim Marriages about his conduct or in respect of any such books or registers or entries therein.
(5) Where a Registrar of Muslim Marriages leaves the area for which he is appointed, or resigns his office, or where his appointment is terminated, he or, in the event of his death, his legal representative, shall forthwith deliver his records, books, registers, and indexes to the District Registrar and on failure of such delivery, the District Registrar shall take possession of them after following the due process.
When it comes to polygamy, one of the most contentious issues in the reform process, the Committee asked that the male Muslim be restricted from contracting a second or subsequent marriage without the prior approval of the Quazi.
They also recommend that the Quazi look into the following:
(a) whether the applicant is living with, and justly and adequately maintaining and caring for, his present wife or wives;
(b) whether the applicant is looking after his children born to his wife or wives in a just and equitable manner;
(c) whether the applicant is capable of dealing justly and equitably with his intended wife and his other wife or wives; and
(d) whether the applicant has the financial capacity to maintain and provide suitable and independent residence in accordance with his and her social standing for his intended wife, and any children that might be born to such intended wife.
The minority faction interestingly has also suggested that pre-nuptial contracts be allowed when certifying the marriage, so as to allow the woman to specify whether she is open or not to the man taking another wife.
Maintenance
A compensatory mechanism known as matata has been recommended by the committee where a marriage has been dissolved on the ground of any matrimonial fault of the husband.
They ask that the: (a) the means of the husband including his monthly income; (b) the social and economic standing and educational attainments of the wife; (c) the age of the husband and that of the wife; (d) the duration of the marriage; (e) the availability of other means of support for the wife; (f) the number of children falling within the custody and care of the husband and/or the wife; (g) the conduct of the parties to the marriage during the pendency of the marriage; and (h) any other circumstances that may be relevant in making a reasonable assessment of requirements of the wife after divorce be looked into when deciding on the matata.
Where there is any dispute as regards the means of monthly income of the husband, the burden of proving the same shall be on the husband. In every such case, maintenance, in accordance with the order, shall be payable from the date on which such claim was made.
A maintenance fund run by a Board of Management is also recommended for women whose husbands cannot grant maintenance.
Further they asked that wherever possible, to require the filing of proceedings in the Quazi court within the division in which the wife resides, and formulating service procedures which will ensure that the rules of natural justice will be strictly followed.
Greater powers of enforcement
To ensure that the orders to the Quazi are taken seriously, the Committee recommended imposing a duty on every police officer and grama niladhari to aid and assist the Quazi court and the Quazi Appellate Court in compliance with any order that might be made in the exercise of their jurisdiction and powers, particularly in regard to the service of notices, summons, or other process, or for the execution of any warrant of arrest that may be issued by the Quazi court or Quazi Appellate Court as the case may be under this Act, and for the Deputy Inspector General of Police and the divisional secretary who has jurisdiction over an area, to ensure that every police officer and grama niladhari of the area respectively, aids and assists the Quazi court and the Quazi Appellate Court in the exercise of their jurisdiction and powers under this Act.
The Committees report and recommendations however remain on the desk of Justice and Prison Reforms Minister, Thalatha Athukorale. Sources indicate that the Minister has directed that the Committee come to a unanimous view on all recommendations, despite the report having the support of the majority of members.
To have unanimous agreement on any issue is near to impossible in the country, and thus it is widely believed that the Minister will not be preparing any amendments to the MM&D Act any time soon.
Repeated attempts to contact Minister Athukorale on the report went answered.
On September 15, Faikas case will once again be taken up in theBoard of Quazisin order for the final judgement to be delivered, but Faika is not sure whether she would have justice served this time around too.
Muslim laws only seem to apply to women. When women talk, they say we are disgracing our culture but when we have to go through the suffering in court, no one is there, said a disappointed Faika, as she asked all those who objected to reforms to attend a hearing at a Quazi court to witness firsthand the suffering of countless Muslim women disadvantaged simply by the origins of their birth.

Nestle partners with Xiaomi to provide seniors better nutrition
Swiss food and nutrition giant Nestle announced the partnership with technology firm Xiaomi to support health through technology and explore digital nutrition to tap the increasing demands from the ageing population in the country.
Nestl Yiyang, a nutrition unit designed for consumers aged over 50, and MIUIs collaboration on digital nutrition and health will focus on the combination of an algorithm to evaluate dietary intake with smart technology, to help Chinese consumers improve their diet and bring concrete benefits to their health.
According to the Global Burden of Disease report 2016, dietary inadequacies are the number one risk to the health of Chinese people, especially the middle-aged and older group.
In China, people over 50 years old account for 28.3 percent of the total population, and this number is increasing at a fast rate. Addressing the needs of this aging population has become a severe challenge to the Chinese society.
Angelo Giardino, CEO of milk, ice cream and industry sales, Nestle China, said that Nestle is preparing to integrate its long experience and achievements in scientific research in the field of nutrition with modern technology to help middle-aged and elderly groups balance their diet to improve their nutrition in a convenient way. Giardinor said the efforts to embrace digital tools is to engage more with daily consumers among the middle-aged and elders in China as they are frequent users of internet and mobile devices for social, gaming and entertainment contents. The platform is also a two-way communication for Nestle to better understand their consumers through data collecting. A result of nearly one-year long efforts of both teams, the platform allows its users to click and input their Daily Meal Intake and import data about their weight, blood pressure, sleep and exercise through MIUIs smart wearable devices. Then, the plan is that by using of big data analytics and scientific algorithms, the platform will generate nutrition reports according to the individuals health.
Li Weixing, vice-president of MIUI, said that this cooperation is one of MIUIs attempts to meet the diverse needs of consumers. MIUI will use its own advantages in product clusters and strong technical capabilities to provide the right services at the right time and at the right place. According to the 320,000 users data that the platform has gathered to date, a first Peoples Dietary Nutrition and Health Report was published on the site, showing that the daily intake of food variety per capita is far below standard recommendations. Nestles Yi Yang and MIUI hope that this report will increase public awareness about the importance of a balanced diet and good nutrition.

Neuville top of the rally world after Portugal win
Matosinhos, Sunday: Belgiums Thierry Neuville clinched his second victory of the season Sunday winning the dirt road Rally of Portugal in his Hyundai after seeing a number of top rivals blunder.
The win lifted Neuville top of the championship standings after six of the 13 events on the annual calendar with the Rally of Italy in Sardinia next up in two weeks.
In Portugal Neuville was 40secs clear of second-placed Welshman Elfyn Evans in his Ford Fiesta and 47 ahead of Finlands Teemu Suninen, also racing a Ford.
Already a winner on the snow in Sweden this season, Neuville saw previous leader Kris Meeke barrel-roll his Citroen on the 12th special on Saturday.
This was fantastic, the car was perfect and the work of the team incredible, said Neuville.
We have also made a good move in the championship.
Five-time world champion Sebastien Ogier fell out of contention for victory on Friday after slipping off the course and into trees in his Ford Fiesta.
Sebastien Ogier, who trailed home in 21st place Sunday, had gone into the rally top of the standings with 100 points but has now slipped to second, 19 behind new leader Neuville (119). AFP

Pampered pooch!
The owner of the worlds most stylish dog has spent 28,000 on his pups beauty regime. Battle the dog is seriously glamorous. He has long flowing locks which he often wears in a ponytail.
Her owner, Kevin Chan, says the three-year-old Afghan Hound turns heads wherever he goes.
Marketing director Kevin, who lives in Beijing, China, has spent 100,000 Chinese Yuan (11,600) to date on grooming equipment and coughs up 4,500 CNY (525) a month on bathing products to keep his pups pristine floor-length mane perfectly preened.
The 29-year-old spends six to eight hours a week brushing the hairy hound and claims Battle is the most beautiful animal on the globe.
Kevin said, Since the moment I decided to take Battle home, he was already the most beautiful dog in the world. He is a family member now, so I dont mind spending time and money on him. I need to bathe him regularly every seven to 10 days  it takes six to eight hours to bathe and groom him every time. I do all the grooming myself and have spent about 100,000 CNY (11,600) to date on grooming equipment. I spend another 4,000 to 5,000 CNY on the best bathing products every month. Afghan hounds were born as models and have their own unique characters. I dont style him deliberately, I just follow my heart. I always tell people I didnt choose the dog but was chosen by him, therefore I have to try my best to give him the best treatment I can.
Every day, Kevin, who adopted Battle two years and eight months ago, sprays a nutritious solution on the poochs fur to smooth it before letting this sink in for one minute.
Then he uses a bristle brush to ease out any knots in his mane  using talcum or baby powder to remove tangles.
Not wanting to let Battles looks go to waste, Kevin has invested in a camera and has taken up photography lessons so that he can share photos of his pup on social media.
Kevin said: Every day, I spray a special nutritious solution on Battles fur and comb him. I have to brush him every day, to keep his fur from knotting together.
When he was younger it would take me two hours a day to groom him, but now I only have to do this for an hour a time. The only thing, which is the hardest, is to skilfully comb him  then you can get the nicest shots. I began to film and shoot him from the first day I got him because I wanted to keep every single moment. I even bought a camera and learned photography so I could record all the best moments.
Kevin adds that when people see Battle, theyre often shocked by how much hair he has.
Kevin adds, When people see Battle, their reaction varies. Some say is it a dog or a sheep, it must be very expensive to keep him, or you must be very considerate. Others ask what breed he is or say he is so pretty and want to have a photo with him. Metro

Residents of the Ihala Kadigamuwa Grama Niladhari (GN) Division in the Bingiriya Divisional Secretariat of the Kurunegala district had complained that they were inconvenienced as the newly-built GN office in the area, had not been opened yet.
The said office complex had been built at a cost of Rs. 2.3 million by the Bingiriya Divisional Secretariat, using public funds.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena and Kurunegala District United National Party Parliamentarian and Deputy Home Affairs Minister J. C. Alawathuwala had been allegedly invited to visit the GN office, in order to inaugurate it. However, it was alleged that they did not attended the opening ceremony and hence, the establishment's inauguration had been postponed. Bingiriya residents had requested authorities concerned to take immediate steps to open the Grama Niladhari office as they would have to travel a long distance in order to see their issues be solved at the Bingiriya Divisional Secretariat.
At present, there is no permanent GN for the Ihala Kadigamuwa division and about 34 vacancies are currently exist for Grama Niladharis in the Bingiriya electorate, former Bingiriya Divisional Secretary M. D. Somaratne said when he was contacted by the Daily News on May 19.

Russell decisions Diaz to keep  featherweight boxing crown
WASHINGTON, Sunday - Gary Russell Jr. retained his World Boxing Council featherweight title on Saturday, taking a unanimous 12-round decision over previously unbeaten Joseph Diaz in a showdown of American southpaws.
Judges awarded Russell the victory before his hometown supporters in suburban Washington by scores of 115-113, 117-111 and 117-111.
Russell improved to 29-1 while Diaz suffered his first loss after 26 victories in his first world title bout.
It was only the third time defending the title for Russell, who took the crown in 2015 by stopping Jhonny Gonzalez and waited just over a year to risk it each time.
Russell has won four fights since suffering his lone loss, falling by majority decision to Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko in 2014.
Russell's jab kept Diaz at bay early, but both fighters landed intense combinations in the second round to set the tone, Diaz working the body and Russell spreading the punishment round after round.
Diaz pushed Russell down to one knee in the 11th and 12th rounds, neither time costing the champion points, as the fighters intensified their pace with furious exchanges to the final bell. AFP

The SLFP Central Committee has decided to appoint a new temporary board of officials on June 3 to replace its present set of office-bearers party General Secretary and Emigration Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Speaking to the media after attending a meetings at Thambuttegama, Minister Dissanaayke said the partys Central Committee met as usual on May 17 and discussed party re-organisation work at length and decided to mark the Partys anniversary celebrations on September 2 with pride and honour after setting up party branches, Electoral and District organisations and re-organising the party machinery including the Samastha Lanka Karaka Sabha and the Executive Committee before August 30.
Dissanayake said even though they functioned as members of the SLFP, some of the partys office bearers are seated in the Opposition in Parliament.
Similarly, some persons calling themselves SLFPers who supported the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna and ensured its victory at the recent Local Government elections by even climbing on to its election stage were among the SLFP office bearers. As such the party could not be subjected to a complete re-organisation with such office bearers, Dissananyake added.
As such, we are getting ready to appoint a temporary board of office-bearers. A permanent board of office-bearers will be elected after a completing party reorganisation.
Dissanayake said that despite predictions made by certain people in the party that the SLFP would be doomed, it had never happened. But, it was the people who left the SLFP who were ultimately doomed and had to creep back into the party fold.

Some do not identify difference between soldier and terrorist: President Sirisena
President Maithripala Sirisena says our security forces have not been accused of war crimes in the resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as certain media and extremist parties falsely depict.
President Sirisena said that today such accusations are made by the parties who support the LTTE and living abroad and those who are against the government and security forces.
The President was addressing the participants at the National War Heroes Day celebrations held near the War Heroes Monument at the parliament grounds on Saturday (19).
It is a shame some have failed to identify the difference between the soldier and the terrorist, the President said.
President Sirisena said certain politicians and Non-govermental Organizations that are after money fail to identify the difference between the soldier and the terrorist. He invited everybody who respects the great local cultural inheritance and wants to work on behalf of the country, the people and the war heroes, to work together with him.
The brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives will always be hailed by the nation and the government will always work to give them the highest respect and gratitude they owe and also to look after the well-being of their families, the President said.
President Sirisena said that it is sad to see that certain government media channels have failed to portray the importance of soldiers. He said non-state media do not talk about the programs conducted by the government for the soldiers. The President asked to work towards reminding the public the great services done by the soldiers to the motherland and to give them the highest dignity they deserve.
President Sirisena admitted that the soldiers should not at all be a political victim, and they should not be used to gain political power, to change governments in power, or to organise political parties.
President Sirisena further stated that terrorism is now beaten in the war front, but yet it is not ideologically defeated, and that he would not let dreams of the extremists who want to make a separate eelam state to become a reality.
President further stated that it is with the collaboration of friendly states that the government made dedicated efforts to defeat the idea of breaking the country in to pieces.
The Annual National War Heroes Commemoration Day to celebrate the brave soldiers who fought for a free country was held gloriously. President Sirisena, who offered flowers to the War Heroes Monument honoured the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country.

Sri Lanka can create jobs, boost exports,  by moving brains: Prof. Hausmann
Many advanced nations from Singapore to the US have open policies that allow people to migrate easily bringing knowledge and skills to transform economies and create new jobs, top Harvard economist, Ricardo Hausmann, from the University of Harvard.
Allowing brains to move brings skills in faster, and tends to have a multiplier effect in jobs and economic activity, Hausmann, told a seminar organized by Colombo-based Advocata Institute and Echelon Magazine.
In the US, every foreign-born Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduate was found to help create 2.61 additional jobs, Hausemann said.
Technology is not limited to tools and codes/routines/procedures. These can all be easily transferred. What is difficult to transfer is tacit knowledge, knowledge embedded in the human mind through experience. Tacit knowledge includes insights, intuition and personal wisdom gained through experience. This is know-how and something that is difficult to extract and codify.
Know-how takes a long time to acquire, like becoming a skilled surgeon or an anaesthetist. To carry out a successful operation both were needed.
Camso-Loadstar factory
Producing complex goods requires different types of know-how which a single person simply did not have. In simple agriculture of a different age, a single farmer knew how to grow seed, cultivate, breed and look after buffaloes, make or repair his plough and produce his fertilizer.
But in modern agriculture where genetically engineered seeds, combined harvesters and fertilizer was used, he simply did not have the knowledge. An advanced society possessed a lot of know-how, but it was in the minds of many different people.
Scrabble Theory
To produce a good, a team of people had to come together, like making a word out of different letters when playing scrabble. While some letters may be available, other were not.
So if you are missing a letter, the other letters would become less valuable. So you would give a lot to have this other letter.
I like to say that an anaesthetist working on his own is not much better than a bad economics lecturer. The only thing he does is put people to sleep.
So if you bring different skills, you can make more things. They are complements, not substitutes. There are enormous benefits in different people working together.
In some sense the secret of development is to get more letters and express them in different words and longer words.
He says it is difficult to move know-how into brains. Author Malcom Gladwell had claimed that it took 10,000 hours (about 14 years) to learn, practice and acquire a world class skill.
So how do you move know-how How do you get more know-how to Sri Lanka We know it is difficult to put know-how to brains, Hausmann says.
It is much easier to move brains. It is a fundamental intuition.
Moving Brains
Brains moved through migration, foreign direct investment and diaspora networks, when people who had originally migrated out, came back.
Moving brains allowed a geographical region to move into entirely new products and keep boost productivity in established sectors, he said.
In Sri Lanka, Camso-Loadstar, now a global solid rubber tyre company was founded by a foreign national teaming up with a local partner.
US car companies Ford, GM and Chrysler were founded by people who worked for Oldsmobile. Oldsmobile was founded by a German who worked for Daimler-Benz.
Silicon Valley founded by 10 people who were hired from AT &T Bell Labs in New Jersey to Shockley Semiconductor. Eight broke away to form Fairchild Semiconductor.
Ex-Fairchild workers then founded a number of other companies including Intel. About 57 percent of Silicon Valley workers are now foreign born, 25 percent were out of state.
Only 18 percent were born in California, even though it has a population of 40 million, twice as big as Sri Lanka, Hausmann said. Silicon Valley would not exist if was based on locally grown talent.
Hausmann himself is originally from Venezuela.
Sri Lankas IT sector is small and not growing as fast as countries that had easier access to foreign talent.
Wage Differential
Wages were found to be lower in Sri Lanka than in India, he says.
However IT wages are higher than in other sectors in the island. IT graduates could find work easily suggesting that skills were in short supply.
Sri Lanka a net was exporter STEM workers, Hausmann says. About 23 percent of Engineering and Science graduates and 20 percent of computer science graduates leave the country to work abroad each year he says.
The low inflow of foreign workers does not compensate for outflow, he says.
Apparel manufacture in Bangladesh was pioneered by a Desh Garments in 1977, in a joint venture with Daewoo, who took 126 workers of various disciplines to train in their country. By 1988 ex-Desh workers had set up 56 companies.
Foreigners who move tended to create more jobs though the common perception was that they stole jobs.
In Singapore now 45 percent the of population was foreign born,
People say we want to be like Singapore, Hauseman said. But they would not have gotten where they were with only home grown letters. They had to attract letters. The foreign born population of Hong Kong was 40 percent, he said.
Stealing jobs or
creating jobs
It was not just obviously technological degree holders that transformed countries, he said.
Albania, an ex-communist state had at one seen large scale migration into Greece.
When the Great Recession credit bubble broke, hitting the Greeces deficit spending government and its economy, large numbers returned boosting Albanias workforce 5 percent. The people who went to Greece were supposedly low skilled.
The standard argument goes that, if the workforce increased unemployment would rise 5 percent. Or wages would fall.
Well, unemployment went down and wages went up, Hausmann said. And why The people who returned were not the same people that had left in terms of know-how they possessed.
Agricultural workers for example had worked in green houses.
They built green houses and hired neighbours, he says. And there was a boom in tomatoes and other agricultural exports.
Panama, had seen a spectacular boom in services, which was very skill intensive.
The country had built special economic zones with tax holidays. The country wanted to attract international headquarters.
Horrible Immigration Laws
But investors who wanted come wanted exemption from immigration laws.
So Panama has a horrible immigration policy as bad as that of Sri Lanka, Hausmann says.
They had closed the door on immigration but the opened two windows. People came in through the windows.
So foreigners came in and there was a boom in construction and everything else and wages of Panamanians skyrocketed, he says.
Prof. Ricardo Hausmann
Still only 4.7 percent of the population is foreign born in Panama.
It is one foreigner in 27. Not like one is 7 in the US, or one it two in Singapore, he says. And everybody complaints about that.
It doesnt matter what level of migration is. Australians are at 27 percent migration and they think it is too high. Panamanians are at 4.7 percent migration and they think it is too high.
Sri Lankans are at 0.1 percent migration and they think it is too high.
Sri Lanka could grow fast with immigration law reform, he says.
Though board of investment companies were allowed to bring some foreign workers, their spouses are not allowed to work.
Typically professionally qualified people married, qualified people. They also cannot choose a different job after they come.
There was no path to permanent residency or citizenship. It was much more difficult for a non-BOI firm to access foreign talent.
Approving vs Attracting Talent
Hausmanns team had done a comparative study reviewing immigration laws of Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. They had also looked at Saudi Arabia.
More economically advanced have sophisticated immigration system that have moved from being systems that strictly authorized the entry of foreign workers, talent, and capital, to systems that promote their entry, he says.
They had a wide variety of visas for skilled, semi-skilled, trainees, managers and entrepreneurs. There were talent visas.
He says immigration reform should be part of an overall effort to draw talent, foreign direct investment and export diversification.
More visa categories should be created. If here is a path to residency more skilled workers will come.
He says immigration reform is a low hanging fruit that can be implemented easily unlike infrastructure which needs lots of money.
Sri Lanka may have the talent and the people for the current economy, but does it have the talent and the people for the economy it wants to have, Hausmann says.
To get there, Sri Lanka will need to open up for more inflow of foreign know-how the way all prosperous countries have done already. This means more FDI, more return diaspora and higher inflow of foreign workers.
Sri Lanka is weird he say because there is no path to citizenship unlike countries that have become prosperous fast.
Analysts say Sri Lankas immigration laws are even more weirder than people realize.
Ricardo Hausmann is Director of Harvards Center for International Development and Professor of the Practice of Economic Development at the Kennedy School of Government. He also teaches a capstone course on the MPAID program. Previously, he served as the first Chief Economist of the Inter-American Development Bank (1994-2000), where he created the Research Department.

Await final decision from West Indies Cricket
Sri Lanka confident  Caribbean tour will go ahead
Sri Lanka Cricket was confident that the tour to the West Indies later this month will not be cancelled but will go ahead with a toned down itinerary.
In a rather sudden decision Cricket West Indies had informed SLC on Friday that they were going through financial difficulties hosting the three-Test series tour by Sri Lanka to the Caribbean that is due to commence next month.
However a final decision on the outcome of the tour was to be taken at a meeting of Cricket West Indies scheduled for Sunday.
We will know the outcome of the meeting only today because of the time differences, but we are confident the tour will go ahead, said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
We could still go ahead with the three Tests or with a lesser number of games.
We are awaiting a response from Cricket West Indies, he said.
De Silva said the 17-member team led by Dinesh Chandimal was due to leave for West Indies as scheduled on May 25 and there has been no alternate change of plans.
Sri Lanka are due to open the tour with a 3-day practice match at Trinidad starting on May 30 before moving into a three Test series at Port of Spain on June 6. The second Test is scheduled to commence on June 14 at St Lucias and the third and final Test which will be a day-night affair at Bridgetown starting on June 23.
Sri Lanka last toured the West Indies in 2008 where they drew the two-Test series 1-all and recorded their first-ever Test win in the Caribbean. Sri Lankas current schedule included a three-Test series in the Caribbean for the first time, but with the current change of events that may not take place. - ST

Sri Lankan man stabbed to death in London

A man stabbed to death in south London has been named.

Arunesh Thangarajah, 28, died after being stabbed between Upper Green East and Montrose Gardens in Mitcham on Sunday.

The Sri Lankan national, of no fixed address, was found with multiple stab wounds at 03:29 BST. He died at the scene.

A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody in a south London police station.

A post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course, police said.

Mitcham and Morden MP Siobhain McDonagh offered her condolences to the victim's family and said she would attend a police meeting on Monday about the killing.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was in touch with the Metropolitan Police about the investigation.

"They will do everything they can to bring the perpetrator to justice," he added.

There have been more than 60 murders in the capital this year, of which more than half were stabbings.

Earlier this month, an urgent investigation into the recent surge in violent crime in the capital was launched by members of the London Assembly.

On Tuesday, the Met's assistant commissioner said there were signs the spike in violence was "stabilising".

Standing for six hours may help lose those extra pounds
You might want to read this on your feet. A new research has found that standing instead of sitting for six hours a day could prevent weight gain and help people to actually lose weight.
The study examined whether standing burns more calories than sitting. The researchers analysed results from a total of 46 studies with 1,184 participants in all.
Participants, on average, were 33 years old, 60 percent were men, and the average body mass index and weight were 24 kg/m2 and 65 kg, respectively.
Senior author Professor Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, said, Standing not only burns more calories, the additional muscle activity is linked to lower rates of heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes, so the benefits of standing could go beyond weight control.
Participants were standing still, while in reality people make small movements while standing. The gap in energy expenditure between standing and sitting could be even greater than the study found.
Our results might be an underestimate because when people stand they tend to make spontaneous movements like shifting weight or swaying from one foot to another, taking small steps forward and back. People may even be more likely to walk to the filing cabinet or trash bin, said Professor Lopez-Jimenez.
The team concluded that replacing standing for sitting could be yet another behaviour change to help reduce the risk of long term weight gain. They suggest more research is needed to see whether such a strategy is effective and practical.
Professor Lopez-Jimenez concluded by saying, It's important to avoid sitting for hours at a time. Standing is a very good first step -- no pun intended -- to avoid this mindset of sitting interminably without moving. Who knows, it may also prompt some people to do a little more and take up some mild physical activity, which would be even more beneficial
The study was published in European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. ANI

Suraksha   Welcome relief for Schoolchildren
When 15-year-old Semalie Sashintha Senadeera fell off a balcony and injured her spine, her parents, who were from a middle class background, took her to a government hospital first, but the doctors there informed them that she needed a risky operation and that she would have to wait for a specialist team visiting from India to have it done.
It was then that her desperate father came across another doctor at the hospital who told him that if he brought the child to a private hospital in which he was working, he could get the operation done.
It would however cost him Rs. 2.5 million.
It was not a risk I wanted to take, said Senadeera* and he promptly moved his child to the private hospital where the operation was done successfully. She is doing well and is back to walking.
He was able to bear the cost through the recent Suraksha health insurance scheme introduced last year by the government, for all schoolchildren between the ages of 5 and 19.
It was then that I found out about the scheme and applied for it. Within two to three days I was able to get Rs. 100,000. I was probably one of the first people to claim it. Though the cost was not recovered 100 percent, it was something.
Suraksha was introduced in October 2017 to help children bridge the gaps in health costs during their school career. The insurance covers diseases, accidents, disabilities and the death of either the child or the parent. 
The insurance cover includes surgical and hospitalisation benefits of Rs. 200,000 per annum, as well as outdoor patients benefits worth Rs. 10,000 for seven selected ailments. Further, there is a personal accident insurance benefit provided to both student and parents: Rs. 100,000 - to be paid upon the accidental death of the student; Rs. 100,000 in the event of a total permanent disability of the student; and Rs. 50,000 in the case of partial permanent disability of the student. The insurance scheme also covers parents accidental death where a sum of Rs. 75,000 is paid to the student for such a loss.
In addition, there is a 20 percent deduction on the bill when obtaining in-patient treatment from private hospitals (excluding drugs) and a 20 percent deduction of expenses or charges of specialists and consultant doctors.
According to the Education Ministry, since the scheme was introduced last year, the government has paid Rs. 89 million in claims to 8,870 people (as of May 18, 2018).
Seven months ago, B.A. Rupikas (45) husband in Wattemulla met with an accident and passed away. She is now the sole breadwinner in her family. As she struggled to make ends meet, her childs school informed her that she could apply for a claim through Suraksha. The claim took 1.5 months, but she was able to get Rs. 75,000 for the death of her husband, It helped me a lot, she said.
According to the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, 3,101 persons died as a result of road accidents in 2017, but only 89 applicants were paid compensation through insurance schemes. Suraksha thus opens up a whole new avenue for compensation payments.
J.H.D. P. Indika Jayasunderas (44) son Vidura got dengue twice, as schoolchildren are one of the most vulnerable groups in terms of the disease. The first time, Suraksha helped meet part of the hospital bill, and the second time, we were able to recover the whole amount through Suraksha, he said.
People are always reluctant when you talk of an insurance scheme, but it is not that bad. We went to a private hospital because of the hassle we have to face in a government hospital. There are visiting times and you have to wait in line for tests, etcand the scheme helped us have that option with the private hospital.

Children are accident prone 
Ratnapuras St Aloysius Principal Sunil Rajapitiyas school is located in an area which faced frequent natural disasters. We are constantly having floods and landslides in these areas, so this insurance scheme is very good for the children, he said. Last year a student was killed by the floods. 
This is very valuable to my children because they undergo a lot of hardship when they are sick. We had a child die of cancer and the family struggled for a long time with the costs involved.
He explained that it was common for the schools and the parents in the area to band together to collect money whenever a child was grievously ill, as the costs were high even with a free healthcare system in the country. When a child at the Udugama school was sick recently, we sold tickets and had various fund-raising activities to collect the money needed.
The health insurance scheme, thus, he said was most helpful to children in the area.
If Rajapitiyas children in Ratnapura were having a problem, so were the students in the capital of the country, Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte.
On January 2017, Sri Jayewardenepura Maha Vidyalaya, Kotte, was the first school in the country to have a Cloud Smart Classroom, but according to its Principal, Major D.A.D. Wanaguru, many of his students come from economically poor family backgrounds, making healthcare one of the biggest costs in the family.
I have seen families split because of this. A child gets sick and the parents cannot afford the costs, said Major Wanaguru.
He appreciated the introduction of the insurance scheme, free to all students, whether they have money or not.
Schoolchildren are always prone to accidents. So the cost of child healthcare is there throughout a childs schooling career. This will help many.
He noted that similar to the difference made in the lives of schoolchildren through government schemes like free uniforms, textbooks and the mid-day meal, this scheme too would have a huge impact on the lives of the children. I remember when I was a teacher, children came to school just for the mid-day meal. So I know this too will solve a main issue in the country.
Children in his school, however, are yet to apply for a claim from the insurance scheme. Major Wanaguru said the idea was yet to sink in among the general public and that though they had conducted awareness sessions, many were still not aware of the specifics of the scheme.
The school alone cannot do this. The insurance company (Sri Lanka Insurance) should also take an interest in spreading the word, he said.

Improvements to the system
Lack of awareness is a common issue brought out by many in the school system. A school teacher in a government school in Matale said that there was a parent who desperately wanted to get the scheme for her sick child, but was unable to do so because she did not get the right information on time. It was too late, the child died, she said. She added that she did not even know what the scheme was all about and that the school took little interest in promoting it to the students or making the teachers aware of its contents.
A parent from a leading semi-government Muslim school in Colombo, in the meantime, found out that her childs school had not registered with Sri Lanka Insurance, when she called them up to ask whether her child was eligible for the scheme. 
The school just sent us a leaflet about it once, but thereafter they did not collect my sons information or tell us how we could apply for it, she said.
All private, international, semi-government and pirivena schoolchildren are automatically registered under Suraksha, but the responsibility of collecting the students information and registering them with the scheme and making parents aware of the benefits has been delegated to the school authorities by the Education Ministry.
Jayasundera in the meantime, said that though they had applied for the scheme, at first they were not aware of what exactly it covered. Admission charges to private hospitals are not covered. It is only when the child is going to be discharged that they tell us what is covered and what is not. They should inform the parents about this at the start, he said.
Further he highlighted that there were many delays when applying for claims, especially when it was applied through a branch office of Sri Lanka Insurance,
The first time we applied, we did so through the Kaduwela branch and we had to follow up so many times, because they told us that the claim has to be sent to their head office to be processed. The second time around, it took less time because we knew the system and applied directly at their head office.
The only reason Senadeera received his claim so fast was because he himself worked in the insurance profession and knew how the system worked.
They should have officers around the country to process claims and not have to send it to head office, said Senadeera. This, he said, would greatly cut down processing time, a must when you have a sick child in hospital.
He further asked that the amount given per day to the child admitted at a government hospital be increased. This scheme is most helpful to parents who cant afford healthcare. So Rs. 1,000 per day is not enough, it should be more.
Senadeera also explained that many poorer parents were reluctant to claim through Suraksha because either way they would have to foot the initial amount on their own and only later get it reimbursed. Many people cannot afford to put up that initial sum. So they dont bother with insurance. There must be a direct payment scheme where the insurance covers the cost without us having to pay it first. If you connect the hospitals directly to the insurance company, many more people will make claims.
Though government hospitals are meant to be free, in reality healthcare is not. There are many expenses people have to bear, from costs in care to tests, he added.
The Education Ministrys Director of Education, School Health and Nutrition Branch, Renuka Peiris when contacted by the Daily News said they had conducted an awareness programme for schools on December 7, 2017. We understand that there is a problem with the level of awareness about Suraksha in schools. Some schools are doing a good job whilst others are not interested, said Peiris.
She said that they were having discussions with Sri Lanka Insurance to have more awareness programmes conducted in schools. Further, they have also asked whether the Insurance Corporation can look at a scheme to directly connect their services with the hospitals. We were hoping that at least some hospitals could be selected to do this at the start and later it could be expanded to all others, said Peiris.
Sri Lanka Insurance is yet to agree to the proposal.
Overall however, the insurance scheme has been a welcome relief to many parents struggling to earn enough to cover the expenses of their children. Ideologically, whether health insurance is needed or not for a country which offers free healthcare, for the moment Suraksha has helped many deal with the realities of the system.

Svitolina lays down French Open  marker  in Rome
Rome, Sunday: Elina Svitolina underlined her status as a top favourite for the French Open by sweeping Simona Halep aside 6-0, 6-4 to successfully defend her Italian Open crown on Sunday.
In a repeat of last years final at the Foro Italico, Ukrainian Svitolina, seeded fourth, was up against Halep a day after the Romanian top seed had ousted Russian Maria Sharapova.
But Haleps hopes of overturning last years defeat to her 23-year-old opponent quickly evaporated in a completely one-sided encounter that saw the Romanian fail to produce a real challenge.
Svitolina, the world number four, has now successfully defended three career titles, in Baku, Dubai and also Rome; she also won in Brisbane and Dubai this season to take her 2018 title total to three. The win also marked Svitolinas 12th career title on what was her eighth final in succession.
It was a really good match, from my side, Svitolina said. I dominated. I was trying to put lots of pressure on Simona with my game, tried to really take the ball early and open the court.
Its amazing that I could do this here a second time and defend. 
The French Open at Roland Garros starts next Sunday, and Svitolina added: Roland Garros is still a week away, but this gives me confidence.
Last year, it was the first time for me going into the Grand Slam as a favourite. This year, its different, I was hoping I was one of the favourites.
Im going to take it as a challenge. Its very important to take one match at a time.
Roland Garros is what we are training for. And Im gonna give it the best shot.
Halep, who was broken four times and lost the opening set in 19 minutes, did not win a game until the start of the second, 24 minutes in.
The world number one saved match point before bowing out after 67 minutes.
I was a little bit too stiff with my body. I couldnt stay in the rallies, and I missed a lot, Halep, who was treated off court for a reported back injury midway through the second set, said.
She was solid. She is solid every time I play her. She deserved to win, for sure.
I want to go (to Roland Garros), to be ready, to feel good, and to win the first round. Because always the first round is the toughest.
Thanks to reaching the final in Rome Halep will take the top seeding for Roland Garros.
Rain rescues Rafa
Heavy rain came to Rafael Nadals rescue in the Rome Masters final on Sunday just when defending champion Alexander Zverev was pushing towards victory.
Nadal, bidding for an eighth title at the Foro Italico, took the first set 6-1 before his German opponent levelled by taking the second by the same score. Zverev was 3-2 ahead with a break when play was halted and the courts covered. AFP

Tharindu leads with engineering disciplines and values
Meeting point
Tharindu Atapattu is a dynamic young CEO at 39 years of age. Leading Mc Shaw Automotive Limited he is a practical, pragmatic CEO who is always accessible to his staff at every level. He believes in leading a humble life with a focus on transforming and empowering others. When he was in school, he excelled in studies and also won a gold medal (world prize) for mathematics.
Having studied at Richmond College, Galle, Tharindu entered the University of Moratuwa, where he obtained an engineering degree with a first class. He completed an MBA at the University of Colombo and got qualified as a Certified Management Accountant (Australia) and a Certified Global Business Analyst (Australia). Currently he is reading for his PhD in Marketing.
Last week, when we met him at his office, we noticed he had opened up the blinds to let the sunlight filter in, not using electricity, as he is deeply concerned about nature and sustainability. Excerpts from the conversation:

Q: Can you tell us the story of your successes, challenges, and major responsibilities 
A: Success: - My motto is Passionate for the Purpose of Doing Things. If there is any success in my life, it is simply because of the passion I have on what Im doing than anything else. Knowledge and experience comes next. Im learning something new on a daily basis simply because of that passion.
Challenges: -The main challenge that I see in the market is the passion deficiency. Lot of people are engaged in an activity than bringing their total passion and focus in to what they are doing. As a result, we see situational bottlenecks which need to be corrected then and there before a system collapses. It needs a lot of time; hence the patience. It is a consistent process.
Responsibilities:-I believe it is a responsibility of every manager (not only at the CEO level) to bring the whole person in to what they are doing and help them to inculcate passion. Once the passion is built within all the members, business will take off as every cell of the business is oriented toward the desired state of success.

Q: Why does Mobil/lubricant oil industry excite you so much 

A: Scientifically and practically Mobil is one of the best performing lubricant manufacturers in the world. I went in to details of the properties of Mobil lubricants and realized that it is the best in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we have to say only the truth to promote it among those who are still not using it. No need to articulate stories to market it. It matches with my engineering discipline and values very well. Therefore, it excites me every moment.

Q: How would you characterize your management style 

A: I believe in working with people and working for people. Im always open for comments and critics from all levels. I scrutinize every ones opinion with my own experience and knowledge to articulate the best decision for my company and people. I train people a lot to take them out of their silos to challenge me, as every challenge sharpens my experience and knowledge. It is absolutely an open culture than an authoritative black box.

Q: What challenges are you facing in the business right now 
A: Consumers are cluttered with a lot of noises and it is very difficult to convince them on what is good what is better and what is best.

Q: How does your professionalism contribute to a better society 
A: Im working with all members of my staff very closely and regularly. Im introducing new ways of performing routines to save time. Saving time on routines increases the quality time for real complex tasks and hence the accuracy. Finally, it helps people to achieve their personal and company objectives more effectively. Likewise, I expect them to practice it with the next level, and the cycle continues. It induces creativity on people to deliver good results, automatically towards a better society. Its chain effect as People who feel good about themselves produce good results.
In general, whenever I interact with fresh professionals even at interview level, I take about five minutes to explain what he or she must do differently to create competitive edge to succeed in their own career.
Q: What book do you think everyone on the team should read 
A: Beyond reading, I would recommend people to listen to empowering speeches of Simon Sinek, Sean Buranahiran and Gaur Gopal to balance their life with all the necessary ingredients such as determination, perseverance, persistence and resilience towards happiness. I feel happiness is a journey not a destination. It is people who make a difference in your life.

Q: How do you like to see Sri Lanka in 2020 

A: Today Sri Lanka is a $ 87 billion economy and Singapore is $ 300 billion and India is $ 2,200 billion but in 1970, Sri Lanka was 2.5 billion, Singapore was $ 2 billion and India was $ 60 billion. If you see Malaysia, the Philippines or Vietnam, very nation has grown exponentially. Sri Lanka is having the lowest economic growth for the last 40-45 years.
By looking at those numbers everybody knows what has gone wrong with Sri Lanka. We cannot expect any miracle to happen by 2020.
I would like to see an initiative which will motivate emancipated professionals to come on the decision making seats like Singapore to lead every sector of the economy towards prosperity without any political colours.

Q: What is the best lesson you have learned so far from one single person 

A: Do things only what you can explain to somebody else- from the Buddha.

Q: What is your formula of managing people and making a result-oriented team 
A: Its based on restorative justice where you train people than punishing them under punitive justice. I am a people oriented person. Todays scars are tomorrows trophies. My manthra includes, convincing team for an ambitious goal, tell team what to do next, do it with the team  on the job training, ownership - allow them to do it on their own, monitor results not the method and refine and redefine the process towards perfection.

Q: As a young CEO what do you like to share with the younger generation as far as their professions are concerned 
A: As Napoleon Hill said, whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can be achieved. So if your goal is genuine, nature supports you to achieve it. And Abdul Kalam has said, Have dreams which will not allow you to sleep. If you work to establish your brand right everything else will align and work for your brand identity than anything else.

Q: What should be the next step of your career 
A: Be a well-established business turnaround and re-engineering professional

Q: Tell us about your family 

A: My wife is working for the Ministry of Finance as an Assistant Director and she is a product of the University of Peradeniya. We have one son. My parents are retired government servants and products of the University of Colombo.

Q: Anythingelse you liketo share 

A: Every good leader needs to practice ten Is of leadership to be a real leader, who others will follow and respect. They are, Imagining Conceptualizing, Intelligent Realizing the reality, Innovating Out of the box approach, Initiating -Moving First, Introducing Creating the awareness, elaborative, Inspiring Making the team cheerful, Involving Contributing ongoing work as a team member, Instructing Directing and redirecting members towards the goal, Influencing -Pushing the team to the goal when necessary and Integrity -Ethical approach in all aspects.

US, China agree to  abandon trade war
CHINA: Washington and Beijing have agreed to abandon any trade war and back off from imposing tariffs on each other, Chinese state media reported on Sunday.
The announcement came after high-level talks in the US capital and followed months of tensions over what President Donald Trump has blasted as an unfair commercial relationship between the two economic giants.
Vice-Premier Liu He, who led Chinese negotiators in Washington said: The two sides reached a consensus, will not fight a trade war, and will stop increasing tariffs on each other, state-run news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday.
Liu called the agreement a necessity, but added: At the same time it must be realised that unfreezing the ice cannot be done in a day, solving the structural problems of the economic and trade relations between the two countries will take time. An earlier joint statement issued in Washington said Beijing would significantly increase its purchases of American goods, but offered few details. The apparent detente comes after months of increasing tensions that have set markets on edge over fears of a damaging trade war. Trump has repeatedly railed against his country's trade deficit with China, describing it as a danger to US national security and threatening to impose tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods.
US levies on $50 billion of Chinese imports could have come into effect as early as next week.
The talks in Washington were between delegations led by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Liu, who also met Thursday with Trump. The sides had met earlier in Beijing.
There was a consensus on taking effective measures to substantially reduce the United States trade deficit in goods with China, the joint statement said.
To meet the growing consumption needs of the Chinese people and the need for high-quality economic development, China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services.
Last year, the United States had a $375.2 billion trade deficit with China, with populist politicians blaming the Asian powerhouse for the leeching of American jobs over the last few decades. Washington reportedly had demanded the deficit be slashed by at least $200 billion by 2020.
However, the joint statement held no indication that China had assented to that target.
It said both sides had agreed on meaningful increases in US agriculture and energy exports. Liu said the new trade cooperation would extend to medical care, high-tech products, and finance, according to Xinhua.
They also agreed to strengthen cooperation on protecting intellectual property -- a long-standing source of US discontent.
The two countries, their economies enormously interlinked, opened the delicate negotiations a few weeks ago.
Trump had threatened China with tariffs on up to $150 billion of imports, prompting Beijing to warn it would target US agricultural exports, aircraft, and even whiskey.
The White House is wary of hurting largely Republican-voting farm states or damaging the economy before legislative elections this November. But Trump is also keen to appear tough on trade. - AFP

Maduro celebrated his re-election during a victory rally in central Caracas Sunday night, after the country's National Electoral Council president declared him the winner.

"I am a better prepared president and human being right now," he said to a cheering crowd outside Miraflores presidential palace.

"You trusted in me and I will respond. Thank you for giving me 68% of those votes."

Maduro, who first took office in 2013 after his predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez died, will govern Venezuela for another six-year term. The term officially begins in January 2019 and ends in 2025.

"This is my fourth victory in a row," Maduro said. "This is our [party's] 22nd victory in 19 years -- we have prevailed."

Amid widespread economic anxiety, Maduro also said the country will enter a "new phase" and fight against "the mafias" to revamp the economy.

The main opposition coalition boycotted the election, but Maduro was not without challengers.

Maduro's chief rival for the presidency was Henri Falcon, a former state governor and onetime loyalist of the ruling party who broke ranks in 2010. About 5.8 million votes went to Maduro and Falcon came in second with 1.8 million votes, according to National Electoral Council president Tibisay Lucena. These figures were based on 92.6% of the tallied votes.

Lucena said 46% of Venezuela's voting population participated in the election.

On Sunday, Falcon cited hundreds of complaints of election violations. Election officials said they would address the claims.

Many countries, including the United States, have called the election a "sham" and said they would not recognize the results of Sunday's vote.

Maduro said he would be open to dialogue with the "empire" of the United States.

"If the government of the United States wants to dialogue at some point, I am open to dialogue. If the other right wing countries that are supported by the US want to dialogue, I am open to that," he said.

Amid allegations that the election process lacked legitimacy, Maduro had said earlier in a Sunday news conference: "There has been a fierce campaign by the government of Donald Trump. In the United States there has been a fierce pressure to try to besmirch the Venezuelan elections -- and they couldn't."

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that he was watching the election closely. "Sham elections change nothing. We need Venezuelan people running this country ... a nation with so much to offer the world," he said on Twitter.

Former Cuban president Raul Castro sent his regards and those of the Cuban Communist Party, congratulating Maduro's "momentous electoral victory," according to a tweet from Venezuela's Minister for International Relations Jorge Arreaza.

Wave of influenza in  Southern Province
The wave of influenza that is prevalent throughout the Southern Province is seasonal.
It has been typically witnessed in the last few years between April and June and again from November to January, Southern Province Health Services Director Dr. G. Wijesooriya said.
A bacteria that causes a number of illnesses led to several deaths of children at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Dr. Wijesooriya further said.
The Provincial Health Services Director confirmed that about 15 children under the age of one, from the Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts died at the Galle Hospital.
The Provincial Director also said that the flu spreads from person to person through sneezing, coughing, or touching contaminated surfaces and seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in some high-risk individuals.
Pregnant women, the very young and very old, immune-compromised people and patients with serious medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease are at increased risk for contracting flu.
Dr. Wijesooriya also requested parents not to send their children to school if they have symptoms of flu and to seek medical treatment immediately.
Galle Regional Director of Health Services Dr. T.L.J.C. Siritunga said that the significant increase in hospitalisations at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital was due to patients being transferred from other districts of the province.
He also urged the public to follow the instructions given by the respective health authorities to minimise the progression of influenza into an epidemic.
We have to wait for the report of the Medical Research Institute to confirm the status of the influenza occurrence at present. In addition to the Teaching Hospital, there is an increase in the number of pediatric influenza patients admitted to the hospitals in Elpitiya Balapitiya and Udugama, Dr. Siritunga said.
When contacted, Matara Regional Health Services Drector Dr. A.D.U. Karunaratne said that there were influenza positive cases reported within the district, out of which number Matara General Hospital registered the highest number of 150 patients, while Kamburupitiya Hospital had admitted 40 patients.
Owing to the better health facilities available at these hospitals, there is an increase of patients admitted to them, he said.

Writers Fridge
Any discussion of my fridge in the current moment needs to begin with a discussion of who lives in my home: my husband and I, our nine-year-old daughter (who likes Lunchables but not the particular flavor of Lunchable that has been sitting in our fridge for the past week), and our three-month-old daughterwho, in her beautiful way, takes up much of the time that might otherwise be spent, say, cleaning out the fridge. Which is all to say: our fridge is actually a pretty decent portal into the acts of survival that constitute our daily life.
Witness: the Tupperware of beef stew that a good friend brought over when our baby was just a week old; leftovers from the takeout weve been living on but havent gotten it together to toss; corn we havent managed to cook; marinara sauce that looks graced by heavenly light; an apple that I placed in the middle of the bottom shelf to make us look a bit healthier than we actually are!
I look in this fridge and see aspirations alongside realities: the fresh mozzarella that never became part of a caprese salad, the forgotten strawberries, the saving grace of Brooklyn takeout. What impulse makes us save the rice from our last Chinese order, when everyone knows that rice gets hard almost immediately Its the impulse to use every part of the buffalo, to waste no portion of the meal we didnt slave overto express our gratitude for takeout by using every single last morsel of it, to take none of it for granted. So the rice goes uneaten, for days and days. And yet, theres a part of me that feels almost affectionate about the wilderness of our fridge, that wants to see: these are the holy days of getting by with our new baby, any way we could.
Once more, I see good intentions and disorder crowding the shelves. I see the three cartons of milk we bought because we never knew if our milk had already gone bad, and it was easier to just buy another one. I see cider purchased to celebrate my elder daughters report card. I see the stories of my younger daughters early life: the coconut water my best friend brought me in the hospital; the mango smoothie that my mother insisted on pouring for meover and over again, during the first days of my nursingand the beauty of being mothered by my mother, as I was learning to mother.

Gramashakthi  to battle real poverty
The recent revelation of alarmingly high malnutrition rate among children of Sri Lanka is indeed an eye-opener for economic policy planners, some of whom were complacent with the achievement of impressive progress in extreme poverty reduction and the success of reducing the proportion of the population in poverty bracket to 6%.
Although extreme poverty level was reduced successfully and even the poor are not in the starvation bracket, the fact remains that more than one-third of our population still in a pathetically low living standard as the rapidly increasing lower middle-class category is still in the poverty margin. Those in the lower middle-class category are highly susceptible to fall into the category of the poor if they face natural disasters such as floods and droughts.
The poverty figure of 6% has been reached by taking the number of people with less than US$ 1.25 as daily income. If one takes the limit as US$ 2.5, the percentage rises to 33% and more than half the population of Sri Lanka or 52% live on less than US$ 4 (SLRs 600) as daily wage. This tells us the magnitude of relative poverty in Sri Lanka.
The statistics show that the share of the total household income of the poorest 20% is 4.5%, while it is 52.9% for the richest 20%. The bottom segment of 40% receives only 13.7%. Those whose income is closer to the poverty line run the risk of falling back due to shocks of climate or other unforeseen changes.
Realizing the need for speedy action for the elimination of poverty by empowering the rural population, President Maithripala Sirisena launched the ambitious programme, Gramashakthi with the goal of poverty eradication by 2030 through empowerment of village. This is a programme that mobilizes the public sector and private sector together with the active participation of the people. The programme combines learning from successful elements of all key poverty reduction programmes of the country as a national effort of all concerned to reach the sustainable development goals ending hunger poverty and halving all forms of poverty by the target year.

Gramashakthiprogramme in Badulla 
Today (May 21), President Sirisena chairs the Provincial Steering Committee Meetings on the Gramashakthi programme in Badulla with the attendance of all regional stakeholders. The President will be directly involved in these progress review meetings of the Gramashakthi Peoples Movement which was launched by the State for the poor, last year.
Under Phase One, 1,000 underprivileged Grama Niladari Divisions have been selected for a pilot project. The project aims to cover 5,000 Grama Niladari Divisions by 2020. The Presidential Secretariat, with the coordination of relevant regional stakeholders, is currently undertaking the following projects for the socio-economic betterment of the people: National Programme for the Empowerment of Disabled and Elderly Population, Sustainable School Programme, National Child Protection Programme, National Environmental Conservation Programme, National Sustainability Discourse Programme, Pibidemu Polonnaruwa Development Programme, Sirisara Pivisuma District Development Programme, National Food Production Programme, National Agri Business Development Programme, National Drug Prevention Programme, Special Operations Unit for National Cultural Renewal and Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease.
Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1997 in an attempt to bring together in a composite index the different features of deprivation in the quality of life to arrive at an aggregate judgement on the extent of poverty in a community. That is, if human development is seen as enlarging choices and expanding freedoms to enjoy a decent standard of living, freedom, dignity, self-respect and the respect of others, then measures of poverty should look at the deprivation of these freedoms.

Increasing social unrest
Gramashakthi aims at empowerment of people and weans them away from dependency mentality of expecting everything from the government. Such negative attitudes result in loss of self-respect and discourage positive attitudes for innovations.
Women although comprise 50% of the population are not adequately represented in decision making in resource allocation. Plans for community development are prepared by those who are less sensitive to the realities of the suffering of the poor and such plans imposed on them from the top become less effective.
Savings of the poor are taken away to the urban centres and hardly reinvested to improve livelihoods of them or the place they live in. Access to capital is inadequate. The suffering of the poor 40% having difficulties to make ends meet in providing for the basic needs such as food, clothing healthcare and education and with less for fulfilling the growing needs of the families and their children increase social unrest in already divided into the lines of race, religion, caste and political affiliations.
With required policy support, capital resources and decision making power on resource allocation, the communities could effectively use such resources for development. Poor families face difficulties in making strong investment decisions as individual households. When such families are organised formally in inclusive and accountable institutions giving priority to the poor, to women and youth to collectively engage in overcoming poverty would be more effective.
Economic growth should be inclusive to benefit those who are left out of the markets and keeping away from benefiting and participating in the production of that growth. Interventions are needed to directly and positively affect the investment behaviour and interrelationships of individuals and enterprise in the micro-economy through micro-level economic institutions partnering with the organised private sector. The character and strength of the community platforms of the workforce is the basis for such inclusive growth. Gramashakthi movement aims to build such platforms for inclusive growth for poverty reduction.

ICT Sector to become US$ 5 bn industry by 2022
The National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) said that they are working with the key stakeholders of the ICT industry to make it a US$ 5 billion industry as envisaged in the Vision 2022 of the Government.
Secretary General of the NCE Shiham Marikar, , said that ICT sector also has the potential to become, a 200,000 direct job providing sector and also to enable the launch of 1,000 startups.
The National Exports Strategy (NES) which is to be presented to the Cabinet shortly for approval has also identified the ICT Sector, among six key sectors for development to achieve the National Export Development and Economic Development Targets set by the Government.
Further, the National Budget for 2018 of the Government under its IT initiative will provide Rs.3 billion to the sector over the next three years by way of grants, equity investments, credit facilities, mentoring and technical support, for local startups, to attract foreign startups, create an enabling environment to support the establishment of incubators, as well as to enable SME IT companies to double their revenue in three years.
Also an allocation of Rs 300 million has been made for 2018 to implement various activities through the Export Development Board (EDB).
He however added that Sri Lanka is far behind other Asian Countries in terms of digital marketing and E-Commerce. During this forum the reasons for this, as well as benefits Sri Lankan enterprises could gain by transforming them in keeping with the present digital era, as well as the benefits that a company could gain through E-Marketing will be emphasized.
The Secretary General further stated that for export oriented companies in Sri Lanka their growth related to digital marketing is considered to be vital compared to all other marketing techniques. He also announced that the Chamber will conduct a forum related to the ICT sector on June 6, at the Hotel Galadari, in collaboration with the key stakeholders in the sector, to highlight these factors.
The Chief Guest at this forum will be Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe and the Guest of Honour will be Prof. Rohan Samarajeewa Chairman of the Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) who will deliver the key note address.
The Secretary General also stated that there will be other professionals who will speak on the subject of E-Commerce and digital marketing.

Man with the golden arm makes his final donation
In 1951, 14-year-old James Harrison from Australia awoke from a major chest surgery. Doctors removed one of his lungs and kept him hospitalized for three months. During this difficult time, Harrison learned that he was alive largely due to a vast quantity of transfused blood he had received. Then and there, he vowed hed become a donor himself. Former Australian laws required blood donors to be at least 18 years old, so the boy had to wait 4 more years. But Harrison kept his promise. Donating regularly to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service for 60 years, the organization estimates that Harrison saved millions of lives.
Soon after Harrison became a donor, doctors told the man that his blood might solve a deadly problem. In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didnt know why, and it was awful, Jemma Falkenmire of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service told CNN. Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage. We now know that the cause of these terrible things was rhesus disease, a condition where a pregnant womans blood starts attacking her own unborn babys blood cells.
Rhesus disease occurs when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive), inherited from the father. If the mother has been sensitized to rhesus-positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an rhesus-positive baby, she may produce antibodies that destroy the babys foreign blood cells. The doctors discovered that Harrison has a rare antibody in his blood and in the 1960s they worked together extensively, using it to develop an injection called Anti-D. Anti-D prevents mothers with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies during their pregnancy.
Doctors are clueless as to why Harrison has this rare blood type. Their best guess suggests it might have something to do with the transfusions he received when he was 14. The blood service also says that there are no more than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies. Every bag of blood is precious, but James blood is particularly extraordinary. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James blood. Falkenmire said.
And more than 17 percent of women in Australia are at risk, so James has helped save a lot of lives. -Bored Panda

A joint programme will be launched in the Ratnapura district, to combat child abuse and prevent children from getting addicted to drugs, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake said. This will be undertaken with the active co-operation of the Sabragamuwa Provincial Council, Divisional Secretariat, police and civil organisations, she added.
She was addressing a conference held at her office on May 18. Ratnapaura District's Head of Sexually Transmitted Diseases Unit Dr. Kanchana Upasena who attended the meting, said that a high incidence of child abuse had been reported in the Ratnaprua district.
The main cause for this is drug addiction among a large number of schoolchildren in the Ratnapura, Embilipitya and Balangoda Education zones, Dr. Kanchana Upasena said. He said that it was imperative for parents to have tabs on the activities of their children. He said so far, 30 cases of child abuse had been reported in the district, this year.

Sri Lanka hub in Silk Road strategy
Sri Lanka would be a hub in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative as per Chinas strategy, said Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions (GZAR) Director of Department of Commerce Diao Weihong addressing the launch event of 2018 Guanxhi Product Exhibition and China Guanxhi Brands Silk Road series in Colombo.
This is the largest product exhibition to be unveiled in Colombo by the provincial government of Guanxhi Zuang Autonomous Region (GZAR), with more than 60 companies from GZAR taking part. GZAR enjoys a very important position in the OBOR while previous Chinese travelers recorded that Guangxi had ties with Sri Lanka way back-2000 years ago.
We both are people close to each other. Over the last few years China-Sri Lanka strategic partnership has been getting into the prime area and we are closer than ever before. Especially in OBOR, Sri Lanka is a hub as per our strategy. We believe we can bring prosperity to both our countries, Weihong said.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the event, said, Sri Lanka is considered as a destination in the OBOR. The large scale port city initiative which is progressing at great speed is expected to enhance Sri Lankas hub status in South Asia. Even though this is a 25 year long project the development work is moving at a fast phase, he said, and added: Sri Lankas trade with China has been on a growing trend. Last years China Sri Lanka total bilateral trade was at $ 4.4 billion.
This is a huge, 46% increase in comparison to the trade total five years ago which was at $ 3 billion in 2013. With the completion of the proposed FTA with China, I am sure that these trade levels will grow in strength. As for the FTA, I am pleased to say that the consultations are progressing smoothly. China has also become a major FDI provider to Sri Lanka. In 2017, China provided more than 32% of Sri Lankas annual FDI.
Chinese investments are mainly in infrastructure projects and strategic development projects. I am sure that with this week announcement that China will be providing US $ one Billon for our central expressway project Chinas leading position as a major development partner of Sri Lanka is re-affirmed again.

ADB and SL Government sign US$ 210 mn  loan agreement
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Sri Lanka today signed a $ 210 million second tranche loan agreement for the Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program to assist Sri Lanka complete its ongoing drive to deliver surplus water from the Mahaweli river basin to its dry zone, where scarce supplies undermine agricultural output and household incomes.
Completion of the Mahaweli Development Program is a key priority of the government and this will maximize the productivity of the Mahaweli River Basin water resources by transferring available water to the northern dry zone of Sri Lanka for irrigation, drinking and commercial purposes, said Sri Widowati, ADB Country Director of the Sri Lanka Resident Mission.
This availability of water will contribute to accelerating local and national economic growth.
Widowati signed the loan agreement on behalf of ADB while R.H.S. Samarathunga, Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, signed for the Government of Sri Lanka.
The dry zone is home to nearly a third of the countrys population, with 70% of rural dwellers dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. However, the zone receives less than 1,500 millimeters of rain per year, and droughts are common, which severely affects agricultural output.
As a result, average household incomes are around 10% lower than other parts of the country, and this situation is expected to worsen as the population grows and rainfall in the region diminishes further due to climate change.
ADBs Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF)  totaling $453 million will finance more than 250 kilometers of new and upgraded canals, reservoirs, and other irrigation infrastructure, in addition to conducting studies on improving water management and delivery systems.
The first tranche loan of $150 million was made in 2015, and this is the second tranche of the MFF, which will finance the construction of the Kalu Ganga-Moragahakanda Transfer Canal, a part of the Upper Elahera Canal, two new reservoirs namely Mahakithula and Mahakirula, and the Inlet tunnel of the Mahakirula Reservior.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.

Bathing at Anuradhapura  tanks to be banned
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has conducted a comprehensive study on impacts from uncontrolled human activities in reservoirs during religious seasons and festivals in Anuradhapura.
Anuradhapura has several large tanks, used mainly for the water requirement of humans, fish and wildlife and also for flood control.
The NWSDBs monthly analyses of water sample of the Tissawewa, Thuruwilawewa, Nuwarawewa, Nachchaduwawewa and Rajanganewewa tanks finds that that the E. coli count in the water from Tissawewa increases significantly during the middle of every year. The percentage of E. coli has been increasing gradually from 2013, when the NWSDB started testing the water samples.
The reason for higher values of E. coli towards mid-year can be attributed to the intensive human activities related to the tank during the Poson festival in Anuradhapura. During this period, a large number of devotees visit Anuradhapura and use water from these tanks for bathing. The data very clearly indicates a midyear trend of increasing E. coli count.
The NWSDB has recommended that human activities around the tanks are restricted as water from these tanks is used for consumption after being treated. The Tissawewa tank has the highest risk of pollution due to its smaller size.
At the recent Anuradhapura national Poson festival steering committee meeting, it was decided to ban bathing at Nuwarawewa and Tissawewa during the forthcoming Poson festival to prevent water pollution.

## Title: Bedside Manner

Bedside Manner
Once upon a time in Sri Lanka people became doctors because they wanted to help people. But today all this appears to have changed. It seems that a good many of them simply want to help themselves. Medicine is different today. Time was when your family doctor with a heartwarming bedside manner recommended you to a medical specialist only when he thought it was absolutely necessary.
But now many Sri Lankans often become their own GPs. They make a mad dash to consult a specialist at the drop of a sneeze and are prepared to cough up the moolah. Whatever happened to personable old family doctors of the past, those extraordinarily gifted physicians who attended to your medical needs with a captivating bedside manner
Many GPs in our little universe have been replaced with the new clinical specialist who knows more about organic chemistry than human interaction. They approach their patients with the cold objectivity of a scientist watching an experiment.
But what actually is a bedside manner It is the expression used to describe the deportment and disposition of medical professionals as in the manner they treat their patients. More often than not the term is used in a constructive way only. Customarily when a doctor is labelled as one with a bedside manner it means he or she is a good communicator, while one without one may cause offence by being overly abrupt with patients. The term can also be described as good or bad. Ah yes, but I have encountered some physicians with the most horrendously hostile demeanour while attending to patients.
Opinions differ on whether bedside manner can be taught. Some think it can be taught, to an extent. But again they surmise it does depend quite a bit on the raw material. Certainly, some skills can be taught, others are born with those admirable attributes that go to make up a great bedside manner. For example, physicians need to be reminded to eliminate medical jargon and check to make sure patients understand what they are being told.
For many of us simply visiting the doctor is stressful enough even if it is just for an annual check up. Anyone in the medical profession should learn good bedside manners. Surely medical professionals must be aware that they are dealing with people who are decidedly not looking to buy a kitchen appliance. Their services are being sought by people who are laid up, or worried sick about someone who is ill. It takes a special kind of training to put them at ease. Patients are looking for help and they are looking for doctors who understand the physical, financial and emotional stress of their medical condition. They want to know what is happening to them and why. Most of all they are looking for some understanding and concern on the part of the healer.
Many doctors are always in a rush. They always have a long day and are mostly pressed for time. However, that should never be an excuse to take it out on the patient. Sure, doctors are human and they do get overly weighed down with too many patients. Some doctors complain that their workload is more than they can handle. This is especially true in Sri Lanka. They have to work fast to make a living. But then we patients are human as well and while they make a living off our illnesses we pay for their services in the hope of making us feel better or keeping us alive. Any type of rushed medical course of action affects patients to a large degree as they are hurried through a procedure. When patients finally get into the office, usually after an exasperatingly long wait they are often examined perfunctorily. Certain doctors hardly give them time to even explain the basic symptoms.
Many medical professionals do not answer their patient's questions adequately. Nor do they elicit sufficient information themselves to determine if the patients understand what is being said to them. They don't even care to explain how the procedure is done. They don't discuss options or even pre-testing preparations.
Although patients should be responsible enough to explain in detail their issues, many doctors seem to think that patients should be armed with an MBBS themselves, judging by the way they go about spewing out medical jargon that has to be decoded. While some others patronisingly imagine that all patients are bimbos and are too ignorant to understand anything at all.
Many patients complain that their doctors simply do not listen to them. I once called back a house officer after he examined my wife in a hospital room and was walking out of the door without exchanging a single word with her. He was arrogant and reticent and I told him that he would not be allowed to leave the room unless he gave us at least a half answer. I also told him that unless he improved his bedside manner I would insist that he does not attend to the patient during the rest of her stay.
He at least had the grace to apologise and was the epitome of good manners during his every subsequent visit. Certainly we are all aware that doctors are pressed for time. But then arent we all Is our time not equally important to us too
All of us have to take time off from work, from busy household schedules chores and everything else we have to do in a day to see them. Think of the poor mother who has to haul several of her offspring along with her for every medical appointment. Is she not worthy of being given proper medical attention in an equitable amount of time
We all sympathise with overworked doctors who have to deal with death on a frequent basis. Such distressing setbacks can be emotionally stressful to the doctor as well. As a result some distance themselves from their patients so as not to be vulnerable to an emotive breakdown. They wear a sort of defensive outer armour which actually isolates them from their patient. The end result is that the doctor-patient relationship is lost.
Listening to the patient and attempting to give voice and comfort is one of the most important people skills I believe that a doctor should have. Concern over how medical professionals interact with their patients has increased in the past few years. That is because patients have been complaining about inconsiderate, impatient medical personnel who are discourteous to a point of obnoxiousness.
All medical personnel should really have the ability and sensitivity to connect and empathise with patients. That is part of the healing process that is today not given sufficient priority. Even if you are hard pressed and dont have time for a friendly chit-chat you can express kindness and concern in so many other ways. You can touch a child's hand, offer a benign smile, make eye contact or acknowledge their emotions in 30 seconds.
Basically speaking, all it takes to put a patient at ease is a little compound of kindness consideration and care. The most efficacious remedy to combat chronic pain and suffering is altruism and compassion. That would be the first therapeutic booster to cure any illness.

Constitutional egalitarianism  for permanent peace
My one time student now leads the Sri Lanka Army -the fifth in the line of Anandians to do so. Assisting him is another military personality also my student commanding the east -Major General Dhammika Pananwela. If past tutelage did not attract me to these children in later life, certainly their intellectual vibrancy did, for I do not suffer from the restricted constraints of club and school mentality besides ethno / religious / socio / political bindings, which leanings make us keep dropping catches in seeing what is not perceived reality. If the system could endure and implement their intellect, well and truly good. If not, they are surely not the losers. What makes the present Army bigwig Mahesh Senanayake above board How does he differ from very many army guys despite the horrendous ethnocentric ideals he was exposed to of which I was a witness at Ananda which ran contrary to the lofty and sublime in Buddhism not to forget the high degree of such ideals in all ethno /religious schools. Sri Lanka suffers from the rigours of ethnocentricity and a pluralistic whole can only come off from schools that are devoid of such segregation.
Shedding his institutional legacy of label Buddhism, Mahesh clearly stands out as a practising Buddhist thanks to his home and has included into his official as well as personal regalia an all-inclusive approach which we clearly see in his Dambana visit. Not even rarely that a military man would take time off to spend the day with a peripheral community  the Veddahs, now better termed Aadivaasis. The Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake did just that recently which report was covered by the Daily News, truly a story of developmental journalism when all that the people are given by way of news to chew and taste are elitist and sensational concerning royal births and nuptials, of bombs how many wounded and the number of women and children killed among other stuff. This is not to undermine the importance of the latter needless to speak of the insignificance of the former but the absence of journalism - the kind that fosters social well-being is to be regretted.
Social whims and fancies of status 
Mahesh fills a lacuna. Though not a journalist he has inspired my membership into social good. Forsaking his gun and moving out of his uniform even for a while, Mahesh broke protocol and fast-tracked into Dambana the Veddah terrain to chat to them and look into their grievances and bring relief to this community it so richly deserves.
If there is a territorial claim to this land, certainly it is only the Aadivaasi clan who could do so and none other for it is a historical fact that the rest are migrants from alien countries. When the former Veddah chieftains son graduated from the Colombo University, his choice preference was not on upward social mobility of class, wealth and social status but the continuity of his pure consciousness and his decision to get back to his acclimatized vocation of farming - not far from wrong for he saw the futility of pandering to social whims and fancies of status, wealth, luxurious living and a system serving job which lures only mediocre minds. He was aware of the conditioned mind that came off the education he received and the resultant loss of intellect  the herd instinct, the rigid compelling inbox thinking that has increased the deadly effects of a tangled web into which the entire social whole has got trapped with nothing positive in sight except the breakdown of the social fabric. Certainly, he is better off than being a servile slave of a system that warrants a persistent Aye Sir that denies independent thinking, creativity and loss of intellect.
Only a chosen few find liberation from the constraints of rigid conformity in the system serving and to rest on his laurels is certainly not for Mahesh. Believing in the undeniable fact that the Aadivaasi people are the original sons of this soil, he passionately speaks out for them and is persistent that great care should be taken to preserve for posterity their identity, traditions, customs and culture. Striking an all-inclusive chord he aligns himself with the ideal that they are as important as Sri Lankas hills, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, trees, forests, waterways and wildlife. The army had much interaction with them at the height of the war and this institution in return owes a well of gratitude to the oldest inhabitants of this land when their knowledge and expertise were there for the asking to treat the wounded soldiers.
Mahesh to this day is overcome with emotion as he gratefully remembers how they ungrudgingly gave their best in emergency treatment when no alternative was at hand other than the traditional medicine. Rather passionate over ethno /religious unity, Mahesh in my tte--tte with him almost always recalls how with the donning of the uniform these divides become dysfunctional. Being part of military training, the all-inclusive approach to keeping off all forms of bias is uppermost his mind. But unfortunately for Mahesh, his lofty thoughts of egalitarianism, social justice and social development collide with a biased majoritarian based constitution. He is not unmindful of the conflict of interest the legislature and military bear. All I can do is within the parameters of the military and cannot transcend into parliament, he disclosed.
Constitutional provision 
True, Maheshs role is finite though an out of the box thinker. He sees the larger picture yet not for him the outstretched wings. Understandably so, for that which entails constitutional provision is not even remotely connected to the military domain - the two being distinct elements. But knowing him as I do, Mahesh is all out at least to inspire future constitutional architects into delivering constitutions that align with natural law. As he quite rightly proclaims, I am not the Army Commander of only the Sinhalese but of all communities including the Aadivaasi people. I want to see all communities living in peace. Instead of pandering to jingoism, he believes in the utmost for the best be given in constitutional amendment to efface the imbalance therein in to bring about a permanent peace. This writer recalls how changes to the constitution were on several occasions met with stiff opposition - a notable crier being Wimal Weerawansa, an outstanding ultra nationalist -for that is where his vote base holds.
Mahesh believes the Adivaasis to be a people with their own way of life, best left untampered. The continuity of their culture and traditions are all part of our heritage and makes our history all the richer, he emphasised enabling his former teacher to find similarities in the pronouncements of R. Sampanthan who in an interview with this writer many moons ago when asked why he should not join President Rajapaksa in his northern developmental efforts said: We the Tamil people of this country have our own culture, traditions, customs, beliefs and preferences. No amount of houses, roads, schools, bridges and hospitals will make us happy unless and until we are allowed to live in the way that we want without us being told what we should have, what to do and what not to do.
A constitution contains the wishes and aspirations of a nations people and if any segment of that population remains disgruntled, that constitution becomes ineffective which knowledge the present Army Commander is not in short supply. I see in Mahesh more of an intellectual and less of a warrior. He does not have in him the element of control. In fact, he unfailingly would offer his junior officers to be seated as he gestures with a vertical line and exclaims, Equality, thats Buddhism.
Buddhist concepts 
The striking high moral ground he believes that it is always the human being that is right because morality springs from being human. The divisive tendency this country suffers is far removed from being human who does not go down well with scholarly Buddhist concepts. All else is temporary. Therein again is Buddhism, he says. But call it fate, Allahs will or Gods, the finest of such military men may come and go but unless synchronized with constitutional regularity of egalitarianism or equality where one race or one religion is not upheld and given pride of place, we fall short of the moral clout to the much sought after peace in this country. Going by the Buddha words of even his body not being his own, the writer asked the army commander how come then we have a Budunge Desaya. His colossal room reverberated with fits of laughter, a reply was not to be. Only later I realised may have driven him up the wall with a firmly held glass ceiling.
While conscious of the fact that the Tamil communitys rights have been overlooked, he does not see war as a solution to bring redress. True we admit that the Tamil community has been wronged but the LTTEs war theory is no ideal solution to those wrongs. There is always a refined, more polished way out.
This brought to writers mind how the Indians on independence eve led by Mahatma Gandhi resorted to a rail track snooze insisting on Swaraj that penetrated into British good sense. Preferring the moral imperative and drawing world attention to the unjust of British colonialism, they renounced whatever was bloodthirsty and no doubt made Nehrus independence rendition of stroke of the midnight hour a stunning reality.

Designing Disney dreams
Looking at these magical Disney scenes its hard to believe that these are actual paintings and not digital illustrations. They're the work of American artist Thomas Kinkade, who was the master of chiaroscuro, a painting technique using light and dark contrasts to create a sense of drama and the illusion of volume. That's why it looks as though your favourite childhood characters could come alive any second and step through the painting to greet you.
The detail in each piece of artwork is amazing and the longer you look at it the more you'll find. The late Thomas Kinkade illustrated Disney worlds better than anyone I've seen - Id say even better than Disney itself.
He stated that his goal had been to create inviting worlds that draw people into their depths and encourage them to seek a better, brighter, more hopeful existence. Bored Panda

Dilemma like no other
Everything is abnormal in our society.nobody knows how to act-not only in the most difficult situations, but even in the simplest Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-81) in conversation with Aleksey Suvorin (publisher and journalist)

Peter, middle-aged Canadian, is a friend and regular visitor to Sri Lanka. He finds the country fascinating, even quaint, and willingly endures the long- haul flight at least once a year for an experience like no other.
It was in Toronto, where he met several new immigrants from Sri Lanka that Peter first engaged with the distant culture. At a glance, they look Sub-Continent Indian, but with the closer association, I realised they were different. In the Indians I met in Canada there was a sense of impenetrability, they were an end product; there was nothing more to do or become. Their thoughts, beliefs and actions were generally predictable. From their encounter with the new country, there was nothing to learn, it offered only an opportunity to earn more dollars, a better life, something they did not have in their country. They continue with all the old ways in the adopted country. On the other hand, in the Sri Lankans, I saw freshness, an adaptability which held out a potential.
It is not only the fascination for a different culture that repeatedly draws him to the tropical island in the faraway Indian Ocean. On his first visit to Sri Lanka, Peter realized that he could holiday during the winter months in a warm climate, at a cost less than half of what he would spend at home. He has made friends and found places where a comfortable stay is assured. Spending his time leisurely; moving from city to the beach, the city again and then to a more rural setting, Peter has gained a sharp insight into the country and its beat of life.
By and large the Sri Lankans are welcoming and hospitable. This is true, anywhere in the country, rich or poor. I find that a very attractive quality, he said sipping his coffee.
Confusion between technology and etiquette
But one thing that I find difficult to handle is their general disregard for your space. You are in a queue and the guy behind will be uncomfortably close, almost rubbing against you. Coming to the body like as your famous Tarzie Vittachi would have it! Get on a bus and one of the passengers will have his personal radio going full blast. He does not think I have a right to my peace and quiet. In our part of the world, my personal space is not to be violated. As to queues, there seems to be an idea in this culture that waiting in line to be served diminishes your standing in society. The higher the guy rises in a hierarchy, less his inclination to stand in a queue!
There is this confusion between technology and etiquette. Use of advanced technology does not mean disregarding common courtesies. In my culture, it will be rude to let a third party interrupt a conversation or a meeting, uninvited. But in Sri Lanka, a personal discussion, a meal or even a meeting may be interrupted by a mobile call; nobody thinks it rude to let that happen. To receive a mobile call while engaged in a conversation may even be considered an indication of how busy or important the person is. He is using advanced technology! Yet, the mobile call reduces his counterpart to a secondary status; the man has more pressing matters with another. If Prince Harry had his wedding in Colombo, most of the guests would be looking at their mobile phones while the ceremony was happening! 
Not to be critical, but Sri Lankans can ask any question, Are you married How much do you earn Which school did you attend Is she your girlfriend In our part of the world, such matters will be considered personal and sensitive.
What other objectionable but common habits have you noticed I probed.
There is this confusion between technology and etiquette. Use of advanced technology does not mean disregarding common courtesies.

If Prince Harry had his wedding in Colombo, most of the guests would be looking at their mobile phones while the ceremony was happening!
The way you guys name your roads can be very frustrating. They have such long and sometimes overlapping names like FR Senanayake and DS Senanayake near or even crossing the other, which is so confusing. Robert Gunawardena Mawatha seems a very popular road name in this country. I thought the purpose was easy identification and passage for the users. Your impossibly long road names certainly do not make it more convenient or efficient; they only compound the endless chaos on it. Imagine reporting a fire on a street with a name with ten syllables! The message here seems to be, dont send me any letters and dont ever try to find me!
I am not certain whether the people these roads are named after had anything to do with their construction. The naming of roads after eminent persons may be an effort to preserve their names, lest we forget. It is another matter whether naming a road after a person, where such mayhem reigns all day, is necessarily an honour done to him!
After struggling with the incredibly long road names you finally arrive at your destination, which could be an apartment complex, hotel, restaurant or even the office of a private company. Now the opposite; these invariably have English or European sounding names with a heavy bias towards British Royalty or empire connections. Mind you, this country was not an empire builder, but only a colony! There is also no modesty when it comes to naming; references to superlatives like icon, elite, paradise, pinnacle, abound. It is as if by asserting the title, you become that. In reality, these are concepts far removed from the Sri Lankan performance and even experience!
It will be a mistake to think that those living down Bagatelle or Shrubbery Gardens are very English or even worldly. Often, only after an effort do I make myself understood to the residents due to the language barrier. The name of the road only leads to an illusion of an English connection.
Underdevelopment and corruption 
A company may occasionally import sub-standard lentils from India. It may call itself Universal Imports and Exports. A restaurant may advertise their fare as Western food, but only serve greasy fried rice and an uninviting vegetable stock, described as a soup. A new set of elite (prabuwaru) is brought forth with every regime change; half-done men; sleazy, unscrupulous rising to high positions only because their society is in the grip of an unrelenting malaise. Titles without meaning- elite, icons, paradise, respectable; misnomers that only mock.
Presumably, the Sri Lankan immigrants Peter met in Canada qualified for Canadian citizenship through a difficult elimination process. Unlike those who gain entry through Visa lotteries or family reunion basis, others need to prove they would be adding value to that country. The immigrant Sri Lankans left a good impression on him. But it is different when he visits Sri Lanka, their country of origin. Our chat was primarily on common etiquette or even racial peculiarities, at a conversational and light-hearted level. But Peter cannot be unmindful of the underdevelopment, the corruption and the visible decay all around. He sees a country only distinguished by its mediocrity, veering from one predicament to another. The leadership in nearly every field of activity in this country, while declaring themselves distinguished, iconic and elite, is not only incompetent but also patently diminished and of uncertain moral calibre.
The paradox Peter observes, a people performing creditably outside of their country while their own is in an abysmal state, is not limited to the Sri Lankans immigrating to Canada. In the preceding decades, many Sri Lankans have moved to Developed countries with the hope of finding a better life. By and large, they have not only done well but have also contributed to the adopted country, assimilating with the host culture. In changed circumstances, in a different culture, they have performed well, working with the best and often in the most advanced systems.
However, in their own country, it is very different; a poor performance, only getting worse with time. A people capable of doing much better, accepting a falsity as their standard. Herein perhaps lies the dilemma of our time.

The government spent Rs. 8,000 million to develop educational sector and it sees grand developments now, Education Minister and UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was addressing the gathering at the opening ceremony of the preliminary learning resource centre of the Batticaloa Koddaimunai Kanista Vidyalaya under the theme, Nearest school is best school at a cost of Rs.17 million on Saturday (19). The Minister also participated in the foundation laying ceremony for the three-storey administrative building at a cost of 35 million for the Batticaloa Teachers College.
He said that previous government spent only Rs. 8 million on the education. Today, the Eastern Province alone received a much higher allocation. Trincomalee received Rs. 2,400 million, Ampara Rs. 2,800 million and Batticaloa Rs. 2,800 million, the Minister said.
We have established 2,000 educational zones, 300 smart class rooms and 10,000 schools. Many of them have electricity facilities. We have appointed 4,000 principals, 852 SLEAS Officers and 1,296 graduates. Within three and half years, we accomplished a great deal of development activities in the sector, the Minister said.
He said Tamil and Muslim people in the north and east suffered untold hardships during the war. The President and the Prime Minister were aware that the two communities are supporting the Good Governance Government and they must be helped achieve their goals in life, he said.
Education in the country declined very much within the last three decades.We have now put it back in progress. The department has taken measures to train graduates in teaching before appointing them to schools. They will be recruited as assistant teachers. Over Rs. 8,000 million was allocated to provide labs for 3,000 schools and Rs 700 million to provide library books for Eastern Provincial schools.
The Minister said 26 subjects were taught now at schools and Science and Math were made compulsory. Our educational system is in line with international standard now. If the Good Governance Government continues, the educational sector will improve very much. GCE (A/L) students will be provided with laptops. Drinking water facilities were provided for 26,000 schools and 6,000 school building were constructed, he said.
The Minister was honoured with a memento by Government Teachers College Principal B. Paramesweran.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Deputy Minister Ali Zahir Moulana, Batticaloa District TNA Parliamentarians G.Sirinesan, S. Yogesweran, and S.Viyalendran, Batticaloa Government Agent M.Uthayakumar, Batticaloa Mayor T. Saravanapavan, and Batticaloa District UNP Organiser S.Mahesweran were present.

Emerging Acute Respiratory infection
This week Director General of Health Services, Dr. Anil Jasinghe speaks about the Acute Respiratory Tract Infection (Influenza) which had been reported from few areas of the Southern Province recently.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, there is no reason for the public to panic at all. During last one month the health authorities have experienced increased number of pneumonia cases among children in Matara and Galle districts. The laboratory findings provided evidence which suggested of pneumonia outbreak mainly due to influenza virus. During the past few years Sri Lanka has experienced increased illness due influenza during the months of May, June and July. This is a regular common phenomenon.
Arrangements have already been made to reduce the number of visitors to the relevant hospitals where the patients with respiratory infections are being kept and treated. At the community level public awareness programmes are conducted on preventive measures, he said.
The general public is encouraged to take general personal hygienic measures to prevent the spread of respiratory infections which includes covering mouth and nose with a tissue/handkerchief while sneezing and coughing when having flu, washing hands with soap and water frequently, avoiding touching face, avoiding overcrowded public places specially when having flu and seeking medical attention for flu if in a high risk group or when feeling ill, Dr. Jasinghe added.
If a child has flu like illness, the health authorities advise not to send them to pre-schools, schools or tuition classes. Children less than two years of age, pregnant or lactating mothers, anyone with chronic lung, heart or renal and other co-morbidities and elderly people are considered as high risk categories. If they develop flu like illness, they are advised to seek medical care without delay and without applying home remedies
(1) To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* In absence of such an item, at least they should cover their face with the help of their palms.
(2) Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. The people should refrain from smoking.
(3) Should not touch eyes, nose or mouth, especially while traveling and in public places.
(4) Everyone should avoid spitting in public.
(5) Wash hands regularly with soap and water or a clean hand with alcohol-based hand rubs is essential.
(6) The used tissues should be disposed carefully and the used handkerchiefs should be washed carefully with germ killer soap/liquid etc before re-using.
(7) Surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections at home, school and office. Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses.

Five dead in adverse weather
Five people were reported dead due to adverse weather conditions with the Meteorology Department predicting landslides and floods if the heavy rains persist in the country in the next few days.
An advisory for heavy rains, strong winds, lightning and rough seas was issued by the Natural Hazards Early Warning Center yesterday, as heavy monsoon conditions set in over the island.
According to warnings, heavy rain falls of about 150 mm can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa, Western, Uva, Central Provinces, Galle and Matara districts.
There may also be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The Disaster Management Center and the Meteorology Department requests the public to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightening activity.
The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) issued a landslide warning for seven districts for the next 24 hours, including Kalutara, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Galle and Kurunegala.

Future of fiction
Bret Easton Ellis is dogged in defending his positions: he is for aesthetics over ideology; freedom of expression, and art that disrupts and disturbs. He asserts that a culture built on the need to be liked  driven in no small part by the approval mechanisms of social media  has created a cultural rot. When I first interviewed Ellis for VICE in 2014, he and I discussed his term Generation Wuss (which he coined on Twitter to refer to those largely falling into the millennial bracket). That conversation caught the publics attention as a clash of the generations. Now, and in light of the Trump election and the #MeToo movement, I wanted to know how his ideas had shifted.
Nathalie Olah: Youve recently finished editing your first book in eight years. Can you tell us a bit more about it
Bret Easton Ellis: Its actually something that my publisher and my agent have wanted me to do for a long time, and thats a non-fiction book. Initially they wanted a collection of whatever essays Ive published  I dont think Im an essayist, so I did not want to do that  then they talked about publishing some of my podcast rants. Those are not really written, those are kind of based on notes. But if I could take some of the podcast rants and their themes and sort of do this pseudo-memoir that is primarily about cultural things that influenced me growing up  what it was like living in New York in the 1980s, and then skipping all over the place, theres a chapter about horror movies in the 1970s, theres a long chapter about Richard Gere, a strange confluence of things that led to writing, say, Less Than Zero or American Psycho, then that could work. I write about how 9/11 made Lunar Park come into clarity for me (that summer I was living in New York), after two years of not knowing how to do that book, and I also write about the election, and how that affected a disillusioned Gen X-er like myself. Its sort of a lament from a disillusioned Gen X-er. And I know a lot of disillusioned Gen X-ers, who feel kind of lost because, well, theyre a tiny generation compared with the massive boomers and massive millennials. It might be very niche, I dont know. But it happened really quickly. In December I started putting it together and then I finished it like a week ago and now my editor is going through and well see what happens. We dont even have a publishing date for it. Yet.
NO: Would it be fair to say that youve abandoned fiction
BEE: I was reading something just today, just before you came here asking why there isnt a Great Millennial Novel. Or The Great Millennial Novelist or The Great Millennial Short Story Writer. Sure, there are things like the Cat Person story in the New Yorker, which sort of captured the zeitgeist for a minute. But it was something that Ive been increasingly aware of in my own life and in conversation with people. No one really talks about novels anymore. I know a couple of people who published novels in the last year and they did nothing and the contracts were cancelled.
I love writing fiction. The love of writing is definitely there. But Lunar Park and definitely Imperial Bedrooms were kind of meta-novels anyway. The last fully-fledged one I wrote was Glamorama, which was an eight-year process of really making up this crazy, surrealistic, epic, ambitious novel that I thought was going to make this huge connection, and it didnt. I mean, there are fans of it, but Knopf would love to see that book break even and it hasnt, not yet. It was an exhausting experience, but one that was pleasurably exhausting I guess. Imperial Bedrooms, on the other hand, started out as a commentary on Less Than Zero and was written at a time in my life when I was having a terrible midlife crisis, much like the character in the book. It became a gory noir, but that was 100 per cent accurate in terms of where I was. Three years of my life compressed into a 160-page novel that was a complete pain to write, absolutely hellish. This is all a very long answer to a simple question. I love fiction and I love reading novels. I always have one or two going at all times. I just finished reading The House of Mirth, which I had tried reading as an eighteen- year-old college boy and just didnt get. Now at fifty-four, its crushing. Absolutely crushing. And the writing is just stupendous. I also love Age of Innocence and The Custom of the County. Just going to Edith Wharton every morning was fantastic and blew away any television or movie that I could find online. I looked forward to it the night before. Id get excited to make my coffee, wake up in the morning and just start reading. And even with a book I didnt expect to like, which was George Saunderss Lincoln in the Bardo, which Im reading now, its kind of magical. Its poetry in a way. But I love reading fiction. Very few people I know now do. And Im talking about writers. I was at a dinner with two very well-known writers about a year ago . . .
NO: Can you say who
BEE: [Jay] McInerney and Mark Danielewski, who wrote House of Leaves. I asked them if theyd read the recent Pulitzer Prize-winner, The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead, which I had read because it had won the Pulitzer Prize and thats something I would do. Im interested in whatever wins the prize. And they hadnt read it. When I asked them why, they said they werent really interested. Now regardless of the idea that they believed it won for reasons that were ideological and not aesthetic, and kind of resented it for that reason, I still found it interesting that they wouldnt want to read the Pulitzer Prize-winner, because after all, its part of the narrative of where were at with books, and with the novel.
But that trend has rapidly dissipated in my crew and I dont find I have conversations with anyone who reads novels anymore. Is there a correlation between that and me not really wanting to write long-form fiction I dont know. Theres a book Ive been working on, on and off, set in the years before Less than Zero is set. Sometimes I get excited looking over the pages, and then other times, I feel more inclined to want to direct, focus on my podcast and create television. I dont agree with them, but many people argue that the television series is the new novel. Im talking about educated people in their fifties, sixties, seventies, who are watching television as if its a novel.
NO: Your novels may well serve as vehicles for social commentary, but would you agree with the assessment that entertainment was always the primary objective
BEE: I do agree that it is masked heavily, but there is social criticism thats very earnest in American Psycho, Less Than Zero and Rules of Attraction. Which I try to avoid, but you just cant get away from the fact that Patrick Bateman is this sort of symbol of greed. But actually I say that because thats how its been taken, when really it was a very personal novel. I was going to nail myself there, but its true. And certainly, how do you get away from the title of earnest satirist when youre attacking the media, the fashion world, how silly and vacuous it is, how soulless Wall Street is, how soulless American teens are in Beverley Hills I sort of look back on it and think: God, you were quite the little moralist. But also in a way that was very dark.

Glitter swimwear is all the rage
Some things are more hassle than theyre worth; glitter swimwear might just be one of them.
Swimsuits and bikinis adorned with bucket loads of glitter are the outfits of choice for many a festival goer at the moment and seem to be having a moment on Instagram. And it might look pretty cool on the gram but if youre spray-painting the glitzy stuff on your body, how long is it going to take to rub off
But thats exactly what some girls are doing; using glitter to cover their bits instead of you know, just wearing a swimsuit. The results are pretty dazzling though, using rainbow coloured glitter to cover their modesty, with some even decorating their whole body with it.
One of the brands encouraging the trend to become all the rage is Go Get Glitter, who shared snaps of people showing off the look.
The account has received mixed reactions from followers, commending them for their creative ways i.e using diamontes to cover the nipples, but also some criticism.
Some asked how the women could be comfortable essentially being naked, other than wearing a thin layer of glitter. Most agreed though that although it looked pretty, it would be one hell of a task taking it off.
Anyone whos dealt with glitter, on your face or body, knows how fiddly the stuff can be  youre pretty guaranteed to find random bits on yourself pretty much for the rest of your life.
One thing is for sure though, at least you wont have to pack much if youre wearing it on holiday or to a festival. Metro

Gotabhaya trying to throw country into Vipath Maga: Mangala
Former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who could be considered the most corrupted and dangerous public officer ever appointed in Sri Lanka, is now talking like a child after rebirth Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera in a special communique yesterday said.
Minister Samaraweera said Rajapaksa siblings are engaged in an untiring effort to throw the country again into Vipath Maga the destructive path, to sweep their improprieties under the carpet. Samaraweera said that Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was responsible for ruining the country by allowing his family relatives and cronies to plunder the countrys economy.
While pointing out that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa unleashed terror through the white van culture while he was the Defence Secretary in the ex-regime, Minister Samaraweera raised the question why Gotabhaya is not proving himself of his innocence before Courts against several charges against him including the corrupt MIG deal, plundering public money to construct memorial museums, assaulting and enforcing disappearance on journalists and maintaining illegal armory depriving the government of its due income.
Minister Samaraweera questioned as to why Gotanhaya Rajapaksa, who recently said that the rulers and the public officials should be free of corruption, has retained leading lawyers to obtain anticipatory bail orders against the charges filed against him.

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who invented white van terror in Sri Lanka that attracted world attention, has said recently that the rulers and the public officials should be free of corruption. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who could be considered as the most corrupted and dangerous public officer ever appointed in this country, is now taking like a child after rebirth. Several Cases being heard in Courts and investigated by Police against him at the moment
Not only such charges against him are being investigated, charges of the kind are being investigated against the other members of the Rajapaksa family as well. It is crystal clear that Rajapaksa siblings have been endeavouring to grab ruling power once again by misleading the public because they are impatient to put these legal cases against them under carpet and exploit the national resources once again, and it is not for their special love for the country, Minister Samaraweera in the special communiqu further said.
Minister Samaraweera urged the general public to defeat the Rajapaksas attempts to regain power by throwing the people into Vipath Maga, the destructive plan and to rally round the government to build a strong economy and a prosperous country by the year 2025.
Full statement:
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is responsible for ruining the country by allowing his family relatives and cronies to plunder the countrys economy and, his siblings, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who unleashed terror through the white van culture that isolated the country internationally now seem to be engaged in an untiring effort to throw the country again into Vipath Maga, the destructive path.
Gotabahaya Rajapaksa, who invented white van terror in Sri Lanka that attracted world attention, has said recently that the rulers and the public officials should be free of corruption. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who could be considered as the most corrupted and dangerous public officer ever appointed in this country, is now taking like a child after rebirth. Several Cases being heard in Courts and investigated by Police against him at the moment.
The corrupt MIG deal, plundering public money to construct memorial museums and name them after his parents, unleashing assault on journalists and enforced disappearance some of them, instigating corruption and terror and maintaining illegal armoury thereby depriving the Government of its due income, are some of them.
Instead of proving himself his innocence before Courts against such chargers that have already been levelled against him, he had retained leading lawyers to obtain anticipatory bail orders against those chargers. Not only such chargers against him are being investigated, charges of the kind are being investigated against the other members of the Rajapaksa family as well. It is crystal clear that Rajapaksa siblings have been endeavouring to grab ruling power once again by misleading the public because they are impatient to put these legal cases against them under carpet and exploit the national resources once again, and it is not for the country.
Not only that, they have been envious of this Government as well wee able to strengthen the local economy despite many challenges after 2015 and they have also been fabricating statistics and distorting the truth in an attempt to mislead the public.
Even in the face of such challenges, the government has been able to strengthen the economy of the country and its administration batter than in the past.
When there was an economic development program supported by the private investment in the 1990s, the export earnings were 30% the Gross Domestic Product. But they never say that our government was compelled to take over an economy with a dwindling export income of 12 percent in 2014. Not only that, they do not say that our government took over a debt-ridden economy.
Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa has charged the Unity Government has to make the highest recorded debt repayment of US$4.2 billion in 2019 in the history due to the debt crisis crated by the Yahapalana govt. the following fact file would help Mahinda Rajapaksa to restore his already lost memory and regain his mindfulness.
Soon after this Government came to power, it pledged the public servants to increase their salaries by 10,000 rupees because their salary was not increased by at least one cent since 2006. This Rs. 10,000.00 increment has been transformed according to 1.4 scale thereby the salary of all public servants will be increased by 107 percent in 2020 to that of their salaries in 2014
After Independence in 1948, the highest amount of foreign deb has to be paid in 2018. The total foreign debt to be paid this year is US$ 2,845 million and of which US$ 1,789 million has to be paid for foreign debts which were borrowed before the year 2015. Only an instrumental of US$ 1,056 to be paid for the foreign loans borrowed after 2015. Accordingly, 63 percent debt installment to be paid this year are repayments of debts that had been borrowed during Rajapaksas tenure as finance minister. It was at the level of 75 percent in 2017.
This crisis will further worsen next year. US$4,285 million have to be paid in 2019 and of which UD$3,315 or 77 percent of the repayment are for the debt obtained during the tenure of the Rajapaksa regime.
Another US$3,768 million will have to be paid as loan instalments and the interest in 2020 and of which 77 percent or US$2,905 million is the debts that were borrowed before 2015. Only US$863 million have to be paid for the debt that was borrowed after 2015. In 2021, 83% of the foreign debt installments will have to be paid to repay the debt taken before 2015. in addition, even in 2030, 73% of the repayments will go to pay the debt that wee obtained during Rajapaksa regime for the waste, fraud and corruption committed by the oligarchies of the Rajapaksas. The loan installment to be paid in 2019 includes a US$1,000 million which was obtained on January 6th, 2014 at 6 percent interest to be paid within five years and, a US$500 million obtained on April 7th, 2014 at 5.1 percent interest to be paid within five years. As these two loans that amounts to US$1,500 million that have been obtained at commercial rates will be matured in 2019 and the entire loan should be repaid in bulk with full interest at one stretch.
The Mahidna Rajapaksa regime obtained these loans in a hurry in 2014, not for the development work but for the election where they lured unsuspected voters thereby distributing cheap items such as Sil Redi.
After this Government was voted to power, it has obtained foreign debts of US$ 12 billion the last three years and, 6 billion out of which was from International donor Agencies and under bilateral agreements at concessionary interest rates. They have been spent for various projects. These loans wee taken neither under commercial basis nor for consumer purposes as Mahidna Rajapaksa attempts to interpret to shoulder such a heavy debt burden in 2015, has been able to take steps to implement development activities at a fast pace than that of the Rajapaksa regime there by assuring more direct benefits to the people.
The allocation made by this government for education, health and housing are the best proof to such claims.
Although 1.8 percent of the GDP was spent for education in 2014, it was gradually increased up to 1.9 percent in 2017. It will further be increased up to 6 percent in the next few years. The allocation for health will be increased up to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next few years. The allocations for public welfare have been increased to 265 billion rupees in 2017 from 165 billion rupees in 2014. It is an increase from 1.6% to 2. percent of GDP.
Soon after this Government came to power, it pledged the public servants to increase their salaries by 10,000 rupees because their salary was not increased by at least one cent since 2006. This Rs. 10,000.00 increment has been transformed according to 1.4 scale thereby the salary of all public servants will be increased by 107 percent in 2020 to that of their salaries in 2014.
Comparing to the prices of powdered milk, domestic gas and fuel in 2014, they are still at a lower level and, when public servants salary is increased by 107 percent in 2020. I reiterate that it will help people to increase their income and maintain the cost of living at la low level. Althoug prices of diesel, petrol and kerosene were increased recently, people do not forget that even the current prices of such items are lower than that of the prices prevailed during the Rajapaksa regime.
The economy during the previous government, handled by their cronies and henchmen didnt have any proper system in place to implement the economic development in a manner that would bring direct benefits to the people. The Rajapaksa siblings who ruled this country under such a background have been attempting to regain power by throwing the people into Vipath Maga the destructive path. Therefore, we urge the people to defeat such attempts and rally round the Governments agenda to build a strong economy and a rich country by the year 2025.

Harry and Meghan shake up Royal tradition
UK: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tied the knot at Windsor Castle on Saturday in a royal wedding like no other, mixing British pomp and African-American culture in front of a celebrity congregation and cheering crowds.
The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex exchanged vows in St. Georges Chapel in a historic ceremony, sealed with a kiss, which brought the biracial US TV star into the heart of the British monarchy.
As more than 100,000 people packed the sun-baked Windsor streets and millions watched worldwide, Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family were joined inside by stars including Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams, Elton John, George Clooney and David Beckham.
The couple held hands throughout and exchanged vows in a Church of England service modified to reflect the brides heritage and strong sense of independence.
Firebrand US pastor Michael Curry delivered a full-throttle address invoking slaves and the power of love, and a gospel choir sang classics Stand By Me and This Little Light of Mine.
Markle began her walk down the aisle alone with her 10 bridesmaids and page boys walking behind her flowing white silk dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller at the French fashion house Givenchy.
Her father had been due to meet her half-way but after he pulled out due to heart surgery, Harrys father Prince Charles stepped in to escort her to the altar.
Markles mother, Doria Ragland, looked visibly moved during the wedding.
With the words I will, 33-year-old Harry, and US former actress Meghan, 36, declared they would love, comfort, honour and protect each other.
Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby declared them husband and wife -- sparking huge cheers from crowds watching on big screens outside.
The newlyweds later toured Windsor in an open-topped carriage, waving and smiling to the thousands of flag-waving well-wishers lining the streets.
The brides father Thomas Markle followed the wedding on television and voiced regret he was unable to attend, TMZ reported.
My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there, he told the US celebrity news website.
For the evening reception at nearby Frogmore House, attended by 200 close friends and family, Meghan changed into a sleek lily white halterneck silk crepe gown by Stella McCartney.
On her finger she wore an emerald-cut aquamarine ring formerly owned by Harrys mother Diana, a gift from her new husband.
Harry drove his bride to the party himself in an open-top E-Type Jaguar with the number plate E190518 -- the wedding date.
In another of the numerous personal touches, the prince hand picked flowers for Markles bouquet from their home at Kensington Palace.
Her five-metre veil also contained floral designs from her native California and all 53 Commonwealth countries. You look amazing, Harry told his bride as she arrived.
He and his brother Prince William -- his best man -- wore the blue doeskin frockcoat uniform of a major in the Blues and Royals, the regiment Harry served with in Afghanistan during his 10 years in the British army.
The couple grinned during Currys dramatic address about the power of love, in which he quoted civil rights icon Martin Luther King.
Im talking about some power. Real power. Power to change the world, the African-American preacher intoned.
There were no political leaders among the 600 guests but many celebrities, including Idris Elba, James Blunt, Tom Hardy and James Corden.
Some of Markles former co-stars in US hit television series Suits attended, as did Harrys ex-girlfriends Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas.
The newlyweds kissed on the chapels West Steps after the wedding before starting their procession, to the delight of the crowds.
Its been a historic, epic day, said Leslie Owusu, from nearby High Wycombe.
Its a union of different cultures, youve got America and England and a fusion of two people that love people and life.
Hundreds of street parties and public screenings were held around Britain where the wedding is a welcome respite for a country still burdened by austerity and divided over Brexit.
Revellers also packed into bars to watch as far afield as Sydney, Hong Kong and Markles native Los Angeles, for what is likely to be the last big British royal wedding for a generation.
In Windsor, thousands of fans bagged their spots by dawn, bearing rugs and picnics, Union Jack flags and patriotic paraphernalia, and the bubbly was flowing freely.
It made me really emotional when I saw them coming past, said Helen Oliver, 50.
The queen hosted a lunchtime reception at the castle, where Elton John performed, Charles and Harry made speeches and the guests ate pieces of lemon and elderflower cake.

How to run storytime without boring everyone to death
For eight years I worked Storytime at a public library. When I mention this to people I get very mixed reactions. Sometimes, theyre impressed. Theyll ask about the crafts and the kids; they tell me it sounds like a rewarding experience. Others get a look on their face like they bit into a raw onion. Oh, theyll reply, grimacing. How was that
I mean, I get it. Its a tough gig. I have to say, its easier looking back at Storytime with a sweet sense of nostalgia than when I was doing the actual work, peeling dried Elmers glue off my only good work pants and singing Raffi at nine in the morning to a bevy of screaming toddlers. Working childrens services sometimes means dealing with a bunch of sugared-up kids who got into a box of Lucky Charms cereal (I recognize that lookI also eat Lucky Charms to get amped). But it also means thinking on your feet and getting way outside your comfort zone. By that I mean youll probably have to kneel on the floor, and if youre wearing a skirt, everyone is gonna see your underwear and four different kids will point it out loud enough for everyone in the library to hear.
When it comes to childrens programming, you quickly learn what will fly and whats going to completely bomb. Most things dont go over so hot. The notion of sitting in a rocking chair while a bunch of dimple-cheeked kids rest quietly at your feet is a lovely dream, but the odds are they will have already heard the book youre reading, and theyll decide it would be a cooler time to get up and play a game of tag or throw crayons at each other. When I first began planning Storytime programs, I chose books with beautifully detailed pictures and sweet plots about baby animals. This backfired spectacularly.
You dont know how long a page can drag on until you hear a kid in the front row yell Im BORED at the top of their lungs when youre one paragraph into a 25 page book. You start speed reading. Youve never read so fast in your entire life. Is the book funny Is the story compelling i.e. does it talk about garbage or something gross Does it involve using the bathroom Youd better pray it does.
I learned a lot about creativity by dealing with kids who were difficult to please. It forced me to think outside the box, and I mean that literallywe did puppet shows on a shit budget, where I turned a refrigerator box into a stage and created puppets from old stuffed animals by pulling out their insides and jabbing popsicle sticks inside their floppy limbs. It makes you think fast. Its hard work, and its definitely not for everyone.
Parents bring their kids to Storytime for several reasons: theyre trying to get out of the house, they genuinely like the programming, and they want to spend time with other parents whove got the same deer-in-headlights look. Its an opportunity for them to commiserate and make friends.
On those rare occasions when everything came together, the Storytime programs I ran allowed everyone to unwind and enjoy themselvesincluding the parents. I told stories that were a mix of new and old, ramping up the nostalgia so parents could go home and try it out for themselves. I made a flannel board of 10 Little Monkeys where the doctor was David Tennant, and one dad laughed at that every damn week. Connecting with a multi-generational audience meant thinking broadly and trying out really weird stuff: like crossover events where Pet Shop Boys and Frank Sinatra were the background music to finger plays and puppet shows.
Sometimes these mashups didnt work, but a lot of times they did. When a mom cried after her kid made her a bouquet of egg carton roses for mothers day during one of my programs, I teared up, too. It was cool to see something work, to see it affect others positively. (Dont tell anyone I cried).
And the creativity that Storytime required flooded other areas of my library work. I brought it to circulation: getting rid of the dusty, outdated pamphlets everyone ignored and creating program bookmarks to slip inside checked out materials. I also planned giveaways of stuff we never used, effectively cleaning house while making patrons happy because they got free stuff (patrons love freebies). My work with the kids helped when it came to dealing with dwindling budgets and answering truly bizarre reference questions, and it allowed me the patience to deal with patrons who acted like babies when they were told theyd have to pay their fines before they could check out that DVD of Mrs. Doubtfire. It provided insight into dealing with grumpy coworkers and with frustrated employees.
It also helped me shape our collection through selecting more relevant materials, items that stimulated a wider degree of interest, and it helped me visualize how I could make the library more inviting to patrons. Make it more inviting to ME. Most of all, it allowed me to start using a lot more glitter. The parents hated this, it got all over everything, but the kids loved it and you know what, I fucking loved it, too. I love glitter. Let me live, okay Storytime showed me it was okay to be silly about things. Its alright to be dumb and truly enjoy it.
Working Storytime even helped my writing. Id read my work aloud and really listen to it, asking myself: Is this boring someone Is it boring me Would it hold the attention span of a 5-year-old, or would they start screaming and somersaulting on the rug Most of the time, it would notbut my work definitely improved by asking the question.
I can also clean cookie guts out of anything now. And that is a truly priceless life skill.

Mondays losses were reversed as index heavy-weight CTC gained ~3.31% and contributed 13.6 points to ASPI following its earnings release (CTC recorded ~17% earnings growth supported by a surprise volume growth).
Although markets moved to positive territory over the week, activity levels remained relatively dull during the week as the turnover dropped to Rs.2.6Bn from Rs.3.2Bn a week ago and average daily turnover fell to Rs.0.52Bn (cf. Rs.1.0Bn year to date).
HNI and institutional investors remained on the sidelines over the week, with crossings accounting for just ~29% (Rs.0.8Bn) of the weekly turnover (cf. ~40% last week, and ~44% year to date weekly average).
TJL (Rs.0.5Bn) accounted for ~63% of the block purchases while Distilleries accounted for ~19%.
Foreign investors meanwhile, recorded a net outflow of Rs.0.46Bn for the first time in last 5-weeks reflecting the broader global pattern of declining inflows to EM/FM markets since Feb18.
The outflows widened the YTD net outflow position on the Bourse to Rs.0.8Bn in (including strategic sale of LOLC for Rs.12.8Bn).
Higher Rupee depreciation continues to remain a major concern for foreign investors, particularly given the LKRs ~3.4% depreciation so far this year.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the corporate earnings for Mar18 quarter and further political and economic developments.
LKR depreciates for sixth consecutive week
The LKR continued its slide for the 6th consecutive week, hitting a record low of Rs.158.51 against the USD on Thursday to record an 0.1% depreciation over the week.
The LKR has lost ~3% against the USD so far this year (notably higher than the 1.8% depreciation recorded in the comparable period last year) as a strengthening USD coupled with low exporter dollar conversions, greater security market outflows and lower CBSL intervention has added pressure on the LKR.
This years USD strengthening in particular has impacted EM/FM currencies across the board and the LKR remains no exception.
However, recent pressure on the LKR has been notable, prompting the CBSL to assure markets about the currencys stability.
The CBSL noted that the current pressure on the LKR is unwarranted as underlying fundamentals remain robust with gross external reserves totaling a healthy $9.1Bn and the Real effective exchange rate indices indicating a competitive currency.
The CBSL noted further that foreign inflows over the next few weeks (IMF tranche, final payment for Hambantota port & syndicated loan proceeds) are expected to further boost the countrys reserve position up to $11Bn by mid-June.
The Wall Street Journal meanwhile, noted that despite the LKR coming under pressure from an appreciating USD, the LKR still supports a sound investment in the equity market.
The Journal noted that although the LKR remains vulnerable to further dollar appreciation, Sri Lanka may suffer less than most as it tends to be among the economies least affected by changes in the USDs value.
The Journal also quoted analyst views that despite its challenging macroeconomic and political picture, Sri Lanka has all the ingredients to be a break-out economy which is attractive at its current cheap valuations.

INDO, SINGAPOREAN FASHION EXTRAVAGANZA
Threads of Time, an Indo, Singaporean fashion extravaganza will be staged by Anita Dorai and Kavita Thulasidas bringing the best of Western and Eastern chic in a collection of exquisite designer wear.
The designer, Singaporean Kavita Thulasidas who is of Indian origin is the Creative and Managing Director of Stylemart Bridal Collection since 1999. She studied in Perth Western Australia at Prebyterian Ladies College and moved to live in France till she returned to Singapore in 1998. In 1999, Kavita formally took over the management reins of Stylemart.
The show is being presented by Anita Dorai, also a Singaporean of Indian origin who has long been an ardent fashionista. Anita who is now residing in Sri Lanka has plans to stage many fashion and other spectacular productions on a regular basis.
Threads of Time will see both Sri Lankan and foreign models on the ramp, while the show will be choreographed by Brian Kerkoven and produced and managed by Anusha David of Headlines PR and Imran Saibo of Funtime.
To date we have Seylan Bank, Porsche and South Asian Textiles on board as sponsors while the Hilton will be our partner hotel and Ramani Fernando Salons our hair and beauty partner, said Anita.
Over 100 exclusive outfits will be showcased on September 2 at the Hilton ballroom with all of them being on sale the next day, while choice wines, canaps, and a gourmet dinner will be served at the show which is strictly for invitees only.
According to Anita their decision to limit Threads of Time to invitees was to ensure the exclusive nature of the event and showcase Kavitas designs to those who would genuinely appreciate her work.
Once she took over the reins of Stylemart, Kavita quickly identified the need for a change in the management strategy, and the need to create a new niche in the market. Within a year, she established Stylemart Bridal Collection Pte Ltd. Focusing on an area of specialization, Kavita started catering to a growing demand in the bridal segment. Today Stylemart is a high end fashion label, thanks to Kavitas tireless focus on branding, customer service and her personal charisma and creativity.
Born, brought up and educated in Singapore, Anita did her degree in Sales and Marketing in Singapore where she ran a successful business dealing in high end Sports cars for 12 years, prior to which she worked at Price Waterhouse.
I have always been interested in fashion and grooming. How we carry ourselves is largely dependent on what we wear and what we wear is very much influenced by both the media and our personal experiences.
Having lived in Sri Lanka over the last five years, I have observed how many women desire the stylish and elegant synergy between the eastern exotic and western chic, yet are cloistered and restricted due to the limited fashion scene.
It is for this reason that I picked Kavita Thulasidas as the designer for this fashion show. Kavita's styles have appealed to both Indians and non-Indians alike. She combines comfort with class and style with sophistication.
She advocates staying rooted to the Asian culture through the detailing in her clothes, yet is modern and progressive in her fabric and cut - a concept I can truly identify with, Anita said.

Influenza outbreak in South under control,  samples sent to Hong Kong - Dr. Jasinghe
People should not panic over the acute respiratory infection (Influenza). It is now under control.
Samples had been sent to Hong Kong for further investigations, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe told the Daily News yesterday.
Dr. Jasinghe said the number of patients seeking medical treatment has decreased now, compared with the recent past. All possible measures to control the spread of the disease has been taken by health staff of the Karapitiya Teaching hospital and the Matara General Hospital.
Adequate amounts of anti- viral drugs (Tamiflu (Oseltamivir)), medical equipment (ten nasal high flow oxygen machines) and personal protective equipment are available at the relevant hospitals. Visitors to those hospitals have been restricted.
Health authorities experienced an increased number of pneumonia cases among children in Matara and Galle districts in the past month. At the moment around 600 patients are receiving treatment.
According to laboratory findings, there is evidence to suggest an outbreak of pneumonia mainly due to the influenza virus. During the past few years, the country has experienced increased influenza like illnesses during May, June and July, he said.
If a child has flu like illness, we advise not to send them to pre-schools, schools or tuition classes. For influenza like illness, children less than two years, pregnant or lactating mothers, anyone with chronic lung, heart or renal and other co-morbidities, elderly people are considered as high risk categories. It they develop flu like illness, they are advised to seek medical care without delay, he said.
Public are encouraged to take general personal hygienic measures to prevent the spread of respiratory infections such as covering mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief while sneezing and coughing when having flu, washing hands with soap and water frequently, avoiding touching face, avoiding overcrowded public places specially when having flu and seeking medical attention for flu if in a high risk group or when feeling ill, he added.

Janashakthi records Rs 9.2 bn profit in 1Q
Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) recorded a profit of Rs. 9.2 billion for the three month period ended March 31 2018.
A significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was returned to shareholders in the form of a Rs. 11.7 billion share buyback, yet another reflection of Janashakthis commitment to its stakeholders.
Gross Written Premium (GWP) grew from Rs. 705 million to Rs. 764 million, a year on year (YoY) growth of 8%. Janashakthi also continued to stand by its policyholders, paying out Rs. 294 million in net benefits and claims, a YoY growth of 5.4% over the Rs. 279 million recorded for the same period last year.
I am happy to report that we have kicked off FY 2018 on a positive note with a steady growth in premiums, said Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PLC. This will be a year of transition for us at Janashakthi as we focus on growing our Life Insurance business into a key player in the segment.
The first half of 2018 will be a period of transformation and we are optimistic that the foundations laid during the previous year together with our singular focus on Life Insurance and ongoing efforts to rebuild an efficient distribution system will strengthen the Company and yield results in the future.
Investment income has increased by 26% YoY, from Rs. 325 million to Rs. 408 million. The total assets of the Company stood at Rs. 18.5 billion due to the share buyback, wherein substantial revenue reserves of the Company were returned to shareholders with its completion in March 2018.
This year is truly a year of change for us at Janashakthi, and we are eager to strongly establish our fundamentals to set up a robust Life Insurance business. Having embarked on restructuring our Life distribution network in 2017, we are reviewing our branch network and re-aligning our presence in the marketplace post the exit from the General Insurance segment.
We hope that this, together with the renewed focus on the Life segment, will help us strengthen our core to deliver business growth in the coming year, said Jude Fernando, Director / Chief Executive Officer of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.

JVP too must answer
Questions continue to be asked if it is correct to speak of the JVP in the same breath as that of the LTTE. No doubt, there will be different points of view on this depending on one's sympathies. Some say the LTTE waged war with the sole aim of creating a separate state in this country while the JVP, on the other hand, was a patriotic organisation and commanded the support of the majority Sinhalese and thus there was a world of difference between the two outfits.
Here, the JVP has an unlikely ally in Joint Opposition MP Dilum Amunugama who claims that the LTTE cannot be treated on par with the JVP contrary to the assertion by Health Minister and Cabinet spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne who saw no difference between the two groups. Responding to journalists at the weekly Cabinet news briefing, the other day, Dr. Senaratne opined that if the JVP is allowed to commemorate its fallen cadres in the twin insurrections of 1971 and 1989-90 he saw nothing wrong with the parents of those killed in the war in the North similarly remembering the dead.
Amunugama, though, begged to differ. Speaking to the media the young MP said it was wrong to compare the JVP's commemorations with that of the LTTE."A lot of people who died during the JVP insurgency were killed by paramilitary groups and went onto make insinuations against Dr. Senaratne. He also was critical of Senaratne for hinting that the security forces may have killed civilians.
JVP spokesperson and MP Vijitha Herath too took strong exception to the Minister's view saying that the JVP was a political party that stood for the people's rights, their day-to-day issues and for justice and that the party was suppressed by those who could not tolerate its rise in popularity, and banned it in 1981.
Be that as it may, it could not be denied that both sides waged war against the state and one is as guilty as the other in this respect though their causes were different. However making a difference between the two groups where the killing of members of the armed forces are concerned won't be accepted by most. The JVP, like the LTTE, was also responsible for killing of members of the armed forces and police though the numbers differ vastly. Both fought for their respective causes with equal determination. Why, politicians in the South, particularly those of the JO speak more tolerantly of the JVP and don't wish to compare it with the LTTE is purely based on race. It is the Us vs. Them syndrome that has come to be associated with politics of the South. That is why those practicing the Rajapaksa brand of politics want to keep alive all issues associated with the North, as it affected the majority community. This is why politicians of the calibre of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, ably assisted by the pro-Rajapaksa media, keep on harping on commemoration events in the North ad nauseam. This is also why any perceived slight or insult on members of the security forces deployed in the North are blown out of proportion.
One cannot recall even a single so called nationalist making any noise when the JVP killed members of the security forces (and even members of their families). Where were the Gunadasa Amarasekaras and other vociferous monks who are weeping buckets today against the government's alleged maltreatment of members of the armed forces, read war heroes Dilum Amunugama says that he had not approved of the arrest of former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. "I am critical of how he acted after the war but the fact remains that he led the army. He played a great role and his arrest was wrong".
Amunugama may have been critical of how the Rajapaksas treated Sarath Fonseka but his protest, if indeed he protested at all, was remarkably muted indeed. One cannot recall the MP rushing to the media to register his protest as he is doing today with such alacrity. This is a clear demonstration of how members of the JO are using the ranaviruvas in their political games. None of the Buddhist monks who are vocal in their criticism of Dr. Senaratne for his comments on the security forces raised even a whimper of protest when the war winning army commander was dragged away like a common criminal and thrown behind bars. Nor did they raise a voice when the JVP killed soldiers and members of their families. Nay, they were silent when the rathu sahodarayas gunned down bikkhus such as Ven.Kotikawatte Sri Saddhatissa and Wellethota Hamuduruwo, the latter decapitated after being shot.
Soldiers, to be killed by the JVP is par for the course for the JO types. To be killed by the LTTE is what constitutes a national crime. Similarly releasing land to their original owners in the North too is unacceptable to them. Yet they claim that the country was united under Mahinda Rajapaksa by ending the war. Then why not make common cause with the people of the North

Kolkata clinch third playoff spot, Bangalore bow out
HYDERABAD, Saturday - Kolkata Knight Riders became the third team to make the Indian Premier League play-offs on a day when Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore bowed out of the Twenty20 tournament.
Australia's Chris Lynn helped Kolkata outplay table-toppers Sunrisers Hyderabad by five wickets on Saturday to finish the league stage with eight wins in 14 games.
Lynn's 43-ball 55 helped two-time champions Kolkata chase down their 173-run target in 19.4 overs at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.
At the end of the day, we strive for a playoff spot, skipper Dinesh Karthik said after the win.
It's good to see we are pulling back games. Touch wood, I'd like to think we're peaking at the right time. Feels good to be here (in the top four).
In the first weekend game, Bangalore suffered a 30-run loss -- their eighth defeat in 14 games -- against Rajasthan Royals, who are still in the race for the final-four.
Chasing 165 for victory, Bangalore were bowled out for 134 despite a gritty 53 from AB de Villiers, who ended the tournament with 480 runs, including six half-centuries.
Kohli, who amassed 530 runs in 14 matches, slammed his team's middle-order.
We wanted to strengthen the middle-order which hasn't happened, it hasn't been our strength and we need to do that going into the next few seasons, Kohli said of his side which has not won the IPL since its inception in 2008.
The responsibility cannot be taken up only by AB all the time. He certainly scored runs, but others need to contribute around him, and didn't show enough composure, he added. AFP

Mangala takes MR to task over  foreign debt payment statement
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday took former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to task for alleging that the foreign debt payments due in 2019 is a result of the doings of the present government.
Minister Samaraweera contradicting Rajapaksas claim, pointed out that 77% of the USD 4,285 mn foreign debts which is due in 2019 was debt obtained during the tenure of the Rajapaksa regime.
Minister Samaraweera also observed that 48% of the total foreign debt obtained after 2015 have been used to repay the debts that were borrowed by the Rajapaksa regime.
According to Minister Samaraweera, the loan installment to be paid in 2019 includes US$ 1,000 million which was obtained on January 6, 2014 at 6% interest to be paid within five years and, a US$ 500 million obtained on April 7, 2014 at 5.1% interest to be paid within five years.
These two loans amounting to US$ 1,500 million that have been been obtained at commercial rates will mature in 2019 and the entire loan should be repaid in bulk with full interest at one stretch, the minister explained.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime obtained these loans in a hurry in 2014, not for development work but for the election where they lured unsuspected voters thereby distributing cheap items such as Sil Redi, the statement pointed out.
Minister Samaraweera in his special communiqu yesterday stated that After Independence in 1948, the highest amount of foreign debt has to be paid in 2018.
The total foreign debt to be paid this year is US$ 2,845 million and of which US$ 1,789 million has to be paid for foreign debts which were borrowed before the year 2015. Only an installment of US$ 1,056 is to be paid for the foreign loans borrowed after 2015. Accordingly, 63% debt installments to be paid this year are repayments of debts that had been borrowed during Mr. Rajapaksas tenure as finance minister. It was at the level of 75% in 2017.
Minister Samaraweera also pointed out that US$3,768 million will have to be paid as loan installments and the interest in 2020 and of which 77% or US$2,905 million is the debts that were borrowed before 2015. He also revealed that only US$ 863 million have to be paid for the debt that was borrowed after 2015.
In 2021, 83% of the foreign debt installments will have to be paid to repay the debt taken before 2015. In addition, even in 2030, 73% of the repayments will go to pay the debts that were obtained during Rajapaksa regime for the waste, fraud and corruption committed by the oligarchies of the Rajapaksas. Minister Samaraweera in his statement further said.
Minister Samaraweera also stated that the present government has obtained foreign debts of US$ 12 billion during the last three years and, 6 billion out of which was from International donor agencies and under bilateral agreements at concessionary interest rates.
They have been spent for various projects. These loans were taken neither under commercial basis nor for consumer purposes as Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa attempts to interpret, he pointed out.

The Meghan effect
The world witnessed admiringly as they exchanged vows. A much awaited union has finally been sealed with the sacred words, the golden rings and a joyous kiss. Prince Harry wedded Megan Markel on a sunlit morning, last Saturday, 19.
Upon his wedding, Prince Harry was handed the title Duke of Sussex by Queen Elizabeth II, making his bride the Duchess of Sussex.
Harrys and Meghans wedding was the most diverse major event in the Queens 66-year reign with heavy influences from the US and Meghans mixed-race background, the Daily Mail notes. The story of Harry and Meghan has become a metaphor for the state of multicultural Britain itself. For some black Brits, theres a sense of pride that a woman of colour is joining the royal family, writes the Time. Megan Markel and Prince Harry are carrying on Princess Dianas legacy of service and humanitarian work, the head of the Diana Award Tessy Ojo has told the UK Express adding that Meghan is redefining what a princess means.
The wedding
Around 7 a.m. on the big day, as the crowds watched excitedly, Megan arrived at the sun-washed Windsor Castle, probably impatient to stand by her groom.
Dressed in a pure white work of art and wearing a diamond bandeau on her veiled head, the beautiful bride is walked down the aisle by the grooms father, Prince Charles.
The declarations are made, Harry and Meghan declare their love and faithfulness, and an address by the Most Reverend Michael Curry is made. Bishop Curry is the first African American to preside over the Episcopal Church.
Adding a real strain of Americaness, of the African American experience, to this service, Stand by Me, by Ben E. King is sung by Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir.
The vows are exchanged, the couple is pronounced husband and wife and after the English National Anthem is sung, they walk through the floral arch, pause and exchange a kiss as their admirers gently cheers.
The rings they exchanged, according to Kensington Palace, were made by `Cleave and Company. Markles ring has been fashioned from a piece of Welsh Gold, gifted by Her Majesty The Queen. Prince Harrys ring is a Platinum Band with a textured finish.
They board the Ascot Landau carriage and the father-and-son Windsor Grey horses began to pull them out into the town on the much awaited procession to appear before the public as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.
The wedding dress
Meghan Markles wedding dress was designed by British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director at the French fashion house Givenchy.The fashion house tweeted that the dress was inspired by all 12 signs of the Zodiac, the Zodiac Signs collection features artisanally carved rings and earrings to convey the wearers character. What was most noticeable [about the dress] were all the things that the dress was not. It was not a Hollywood red carpet statement. It was not a Disney princess fantasy. It was not a mountain of camouflaging tulle and chiffon. The dress was free of extravagant embellishments. It was not covered in yards of delicate lace. It did not have a single ruffle  no pearls or crystals. Its beauty was in its architectural lines and its confident restraint. It was a romantic dress, but one that suggested a clear-eyed understanding that a real-life romance is not the stuff of fairy tales. The dress was a backdrop; it was in service to the woman, wrote Washington Post fashion critic Robin Givhan.
Bridesmaids
Meghan Markle chose not to have a maid of honor in her bridal party, so as not to have to choose between her best girlfriends, says Harpers Bazaar. The bridesmaids and page boys, aged between two and seven included the Duke and Duchess of Cambridges two older children, Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three.
A star-lit occasion
Among the famous guests were Oprah Winfrey, Sir Elton John, Tennis star Serena Williams, American actor George Clooney and wife, David and Victoria Bekham, Abigail Spencer and Priyanka Chopra.
Breaking the tradition
Born to an African-American mother Doria Ragland and a white father Thomas, Meghan is the first mixed race person to marry into a family that for generations has been almost entirely white European, according to The Mirrors royal correspondent.
Journalist Constance Grady wrote on Vox.com that the address of Bishop Michael Curry a black American Episcopal from Chicago  during the wedding was a break with royal wedding tradition. Markle may be the new English Duchess of Sussex, but her black American heritage was central to the royal wedding.
Humble beginnings
Rosie Fitzmaurice of Business Insider UK writes that the fact that Meghan isfrom humble beginnings smashes traditional royal stereotypes.
Markles LA upbringing was far humbler than Harrys, she writes. Her mother is a yoga teacher and social worker, and her father a former lighting director. Although Markle did attend private school from a young age, its still a far cry from Harrys Etonian education.
Encouraging Charity
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are incredibly grateful for the goodwill they have received since their engagement, a representative of royal residence Kensington Palace said on Twitter prior to the wedding. They have asked that anyone who might wish to mark the occasion of their wedding considers giving to charity, instead of sending a gift. The couple have personally chosen seven charities which represent a range of issues they are passionate about, the palace said.
Specifically, those charities are: Street Games, a sports-focused charity aimed at helping those in disadvantaged communities; The Myna Mahila Foundation, a charity that provides personal and professional support for women in the poorest parts of Mumbai; Surfers Against Sewage, a national marine conservation and campaigning charity; The Wilderness Foundation UK, which aims to preserve wild spaces and promotes the benefits and enjoyment of nature; Crisis, a program that offers education, employment, housing and other services for the homeless; The Childrens HIV Association, which offers support to young people living with HIV across the U.K. and Ireland; and Scottys Little Soldiers, a charity for children who have lost a parent serving in the British Armed Forces.
An elegant end of a sweet beginning - and now, its their happily-ever-after. A royal love story  still being written  and a humble love, all too human, binding their worlds together.
