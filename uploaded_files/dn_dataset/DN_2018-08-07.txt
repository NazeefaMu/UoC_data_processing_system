False promises, false alarm
The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it is reported has warned foreign countries not to accept any asset offered by Sri Lankan government and that when his party comes to power he would take back such assets.
We as voters who have been misled by all political parties, giving false promises at the time of elections now have to face the misdeeds and pay for them. Will the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tell the voters why he sold (not leased) the most valuable asset, ten acres where Army Head Quarters was
Will he take back that land, if he comes back to power and also the 256 acres of reclaimed sea land in Galle Face to China

Coconut: Lankas source of sustenance
Coconut remains a prime and valuable crop to Sri Lankans and its uses are many and varied. They include coconut milk for cooking purposes, timber for house-building and furniture, the leaves for thatching roofs, fibre for making ropes and firewood.
While the world identifies coconut as a superfood, we Sri Lankans consume it as a food staple and aptly we call the coconut tree as the Kapruka. It is closely interwoven with our traditions and culture. The term Kapruka is full of meaning as it sustains human society, providing many of its daily needs.
The available information confirms that Sri Lankan polity consumes 150 million of coconuts per annum or 70 per cent of the total production and coconut related industry requires 100 million on a yearly basis. Around 30 per cent of the total production is used for export processing. Coconut is the second largest agricultural export product, next to tea.
The Plantation Industries Ministry claims that in terms of export earnings from coconut products, it amounts to Rs. 91 billion and about three million people depend either directly or indirectly on the coconut related industry for their sustenance and livelihood.
The demand for coconut and its value-added products keeps increasing exponentially with the growing acceptance of coconut water, virgin coconut oil and coconut butter as health supplements. The future of the Sri Lankan coconut industry is heavily dependent on its global market share.
The Coconut Development Authority (CDA) a vital organisation tasked with promoting the coconut products globally. The Authority assists the growers to become the producers of value-added kernel products by facilitating the export marketing.
The CDA still needs to broad-base its promotional activities to attract the emerging markets, cater to the ever-changing needs of the existing consumers and attract the new consumers entering the market looking for new and exciting products.
National policy on coconut cultivation
Other coconut-growing countries claim to collect more than 12,000 nuts per hectare whereas the figure is just 7,000 in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas productivity is lower in comparison to the other coconut growing countries. Yet the country has the much-required potential to compete with those coconut growing countries, by adopting standard management practices.
Efforts are being made to change this situation with the coconut growers scattered across the country. They formed the Coconut Growers Association of Sri Lanka in 1994.
The Association, with its 1440-membership, protects and promotes the common interest of the growers. The Association also interacts with related agencies of government and contributes to the drafting of a national policy on coconut cultivation, development and export of kernel products.
The Association, while endeavouring to represent and serve the needs of the growers continuously and relentlessly, has formed its branches in all major coconut-growing districts and areas with a high density of coconut plantations: Gampaha, Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala, Chilaw/Puttalam, Northern, Eastern and expanded into the Southern regions.
The branches in the respective localities would help members to exchange ideas, share their experience and problems, learn from each other, and forge a common agenda with the Board to bring about favourable policy changes.
The institutes linked to the Ministry such as the Coconut Research Institute, the Coconut Cultivation Board and the Coconut Development Authority dedicated to looking after the interest of growers. The institutes have offered low-interest credit for infrastructure, investment and development such as electricity, irrigation, machinery and equipment.
The Association has sought a favourable government policy to further spur the entrepreneurial activities such as value addition and transition to export agriculture. Active involvement of the Coconut Development Authority in establishing connections to the niche markets is vital.
Statistics show that Sri Lanka produces 2,800  3,000 million nuts annually. But this number came down to 2,400 million in 2017, as a result of the prolonged drought.
This situation demanded the consumers to pay the exorbitant price of Rs. 120 per nut, more than ever before. The present price is floating and now it is between Rs. 60 to 80 per nut in the open market. The Association is all out to bring down the consumer price of coconut and to ensure reasonable farm-gate price for the coconut growers.
Quality coconut product exporter
This unprecedented scenario compelled the government to permit the import of frozen coconut kernel to mitigate the rising price for the edible coconut. In respect of the import of frozen coconut kernel, the Association had shown great concern, over the possibility of getting tarnished the good name of Sri Lanka, as a country of quality coconut product exporter, if the country were to keep importing substitute and re-export as Sri Lanka produce.
It is very pertinent to recall here how the coconut lands in the country suffered heavily with the setting up of the Land Reform Commission, in 1972, under the Sirimavo Bandaranaike-led United Front Government. The fragmentation of vast acreage of land is a threat to the coconut triangle which is within the Western and North Western Provinces, resulting in economic repercussion and the ever-rising demand of land for urbanization, expansion of human settlement along with the fast-growing industrial and recreational facilities.
It is also on record that over 300,000 coconut trees were felled and destroyed with a view to controlling the Weligama Wilts. The coconut grown lands have been consumed for the - aforementioned purposes, has added a further loss to the national economy.
The coconut lands in both North and East also suffered heavily owing to three-decade long internal strife. It is heartening to note those areas are now in the process of being re-cultivated and rehabilitated. Taking this phenomenon into consideration, the Coconut Growers Association has requested the government to release at least 50,000 acres of land suitable for coconut-growing and to encourage the value addition process to meet the world demand.
The Association membership has also requested the Plantation Ministry to coordinate budget proposals beneficial to the coconut growers. They seek assistance to construct deep wells, submersible pumps with irrigation system in addition to a subsidy scheme as a part of the investment and the balance are provided to the membership as a concessionary loan through the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) and commercial banks.
The Association has also forwarded a request to increase the fertilizer subsidy which will enhance the productivity. The other proposals have been forwarded to the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) and the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) to carry out a national level programme to control, prevent spreading of pest and the diseases affecting the coconut cultivation.
Plus, the Association recommends the hybrid coconut seed garden which could be materialised on about 250 acres. This could be operated as a public and private partnership project between Sri Lanka Army and Coconut Research Institute.

The clash between parliamentarians Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Kumara Welgama is evident that a deep rift is forming within the Joint Opposition on fielding Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as their Presidential Candidate
Kalutara District parliamentarian Kumara Welgama, an ardent supporter of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, lashed at his colleague Mahindananda Aluthgamage saying that the latter was a coward and man without a backbone.
Welgama hit out at Mahindananda Aluthgamage at a event held in Kalutara and parliamentarians Namal Rajapaksa and Rohitha Abeygunawardena were on stage.
Mahindananda has told a newspaper that I am a joker. But he did not have the backbone to say it to my face when we met at the central committee party last week, Welgama said.
He said Mahindananda Aluthgamage did not have the guts to take part in the Nugegoda rally after Mahinda Rajapaksa fell out of power. Aluthgamage was in hiding those days, he said
He said they do not want a presidential candidate not involved in politics, showing his opposition to the presidential bid by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya.

Identified as a future star with Kusal Mendis
Dhananjaya de Silva deserves a permanent place in the team
PALLEKELE, Monday: Two years ago when Dhananjaya de Silva made his Test debut against Steve Smiths Australians and in only his third Test scored his maiden hundred he was spoken highly of as one of the bright sparks of the Sri Lanka team along with team mate Kusal Mendis.
Following that success De Silva also made it to the Sri Lanka ODI side and started to contribute in that format as well. However due to circumstances he has not been able to hold onto a permanent place in the national eleven especially in the ODIs although he has been a member of the overall squad.
With the 2019 Cricket World Cup less than ten months away it is imperative that a player in the calibre of De Silvas class is given a permanent slot in the ODI team so that he can establish himself for the battles ahead.
In the ongoing five-match ODI series against South Africa, De Silva was overlooked for the first two matches and when the selectors finally decided to slot him into the third game played at Pallekele on Sunday he responded with a career best knock of 84 off 66 balls.
Where the top order batsmen failed to take advantage of a good batting pitch De Silva showed his team mates what they had missed out on by carving out a magnificent innings that had all the hallmarks of a class batsman.
When I came to bat at no .7 my main focus was on how to get close to the big target that South Africa had set us with their bowling attack. I was down to play at 6 but because the team wanted a left-right combination batting I had to come at 7. I wanted to bat as long as possible, said De Silva.
There was nothing wrong with the wicket it was a 350 plus wicket. I think because we lost early wickets the target became difficult for us to achieve, otherwise it was a wicket that we could have got those runs if we had wickets in hand, he said.
De Silva said if he had come to bat higher up the order he could have scored more runs and added: I have to play according to the teams requirements but whichever position I play I try to score as many runs as possible.
De Silva admitted that not being given a permanent place in the ODI team puts pressure on him as a player.
There is some pressure on me because I know if I dont score runs that I will be dropped from the team. It is part and parcel of Sri Lanka cricket but we as players must know to grab whatever chances that comes our way and make the best use of it. I have been told that my position in the ODI side is 6 or 7 so I practice accordingly and wait for the opportunities to come, said De Silva.
The fluent 26-year-old right-hander regretted missing out on scoring a maiden ODI hundred when he was dismissed for 84 after hitting two sixes off three balls from Andile Phehlukwayo.
I am very disappointed because youll never get such opportunities to score a one-day hundred. I tried to score as many runs as possible like around 15 runs an over before they brought back Rabada and Ngidi. Rabada is really good. He is no. 1 ranked at present and with his skill and the way he thinks for his age is good. It is not easy facing upto him, said De Silva.
One of the finest innings that De Silva has played in his budding career is the Test hundred he scored against India at Delhi last year.
I gained a lot of confidence scoring that hundred. A hundred against any country is not easy. To score a hundred in India in the fourth innings gave a lot confidence to me and the team. I am hoping to score more runs in the future, De Silva said. I do not have big goals but try to make use of the opportunities that come my way.

Donkeys in chic trousers
When it comes to animal fashion, dogs tend to get all the attention. During the winter, every little pooch seems to have its own jacket. Owners spend thousands on outfits, make them Instagram famous and outfit them in headpieces, feather boas and badges.
But did you know that some donkeys also have their own special sartorial style
It turns out that in certain parts of the world, donkeys are dressed in custom-made trousers in a bid to stop pesky flies from biting their legs.
Theres still the unanswerable question of what the right way for four-legged animals to wear trousers but well leave that one for now.
At the Donkey Sanctuary Of Canada, volunteer Sheila Zanyk made Ben a pair of trousers to stop the flies from bothering him. And it seems as though other animals are now getting something similar.
"It took a few tries but its working well now," she tells CTVNews.ca.
"The first time we put them on him, he was really proud of himself. He walked around the whole barnyard  just look at me, look at me."
After getting used to the sound of the velcro  which startled him at first  Ben now has two pairs of trousers and will be wearing them both until the winter season, when the flies finally buzz off. And no doubt, the trend will spread to donkeys in other countries in the near future.

Despite her character being killed-off off-screen, Streep revealed that she is a huge fan of the sequel.
Talking about her reaction to seeing the movie, she beamed that she hopes the audience has the exact same response.
I just hope they [fans] get the feeling I got two nights ago, which is elated.
I want them to come out as happy as I was when I saw it, because I think delivering happiness is something thats very rare in this world.
And the fact that this gang of people came together to do it
If we deliver joy, thats all I ask.
The multiple award-winner also heaped praise on co-star Amanda Seyfried, who plays her daughter Sophie.
I think Amanda brings something to this particular incarnation of Mamma Mia thats very special, she said.
Shes the heartbeat of the film. Her emotion carries the whole story forward and she really moved me.
I think shes magic. Plus, shes got a cracking voice and she gets to use it more in this one. One of the two songs Streep sings on in the sequel is Super Trouper - which, it has been revealed, was only added at the last minute.

Du Plessis injures right shoulder  may miss fourth ODI
South African captain Faf du Plessis who injured his right shoulder while fielding during the third ODI against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Stadium on Sunday is currently receiving treatment according to Lerato Malekutu, media manager of the team.
Du Plessis had to leave the field midway during the Sri Lankan innings after attempting a catch at square leg offered by Thisara Perera in the tenth over and the captaincy duty was entrusted to wicket-keeper/batsman Quinton de Kock.
Du Plessis underwent surgery on his right shoulder late last year before the Indian series.
With South Africa already having secured the five-match series with a 3-0 lead there is a likelihood that they would not want to risk playing Du Plessis and may rest him for Wednesdays fourth ODI  a night game which will be played at the same venue.
South Africa are also likely to give a match to some of the other players in the ODI squad who has not had an opportunity in the series like Junior Dala, Hienrich Klaasen and Keshav Maharaj.

The Earth song
Great philosophers understood that music is essential to human happiness thus they said `without music, life would be a mistake. Music becomes his passion and he pursues the happiness music brings without hesitation. Not merely making people happy with his singing, he takes every effort to save the planet Earth.
Alston Koch, is a Sri Lankan  born Australian singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, international recording and television star. Koch is probably the only Asian entertainer, singer-songwriter, producer and actor to be awarded "World Artist of The Year" at the "Global Officials of Dignity Awards" presented at the United
Nations in New York and also received a certificate of special commendation from the US Congress and US Senate for improving the lives of the communities in America. Alston Koch is still the only International award winning recording artist from Sri Lanka to have been signed to R.C.A and SONY Records with International hit songs and music videos to his credit. 
Currently I am involved in a huge protect to save the planet from plastic. We recently heard even in Sri Lanka how plastic brought death to an elephant. Plastic is one of the greatest invention but it is high time people shift into using degradable plastic, he said.
Koch launched his song, A Symphony for Change to raise awareness of the problems caused by plastic waste in the environment, on the World Environment Day which was celebrated in Mexico City on June 5, this year.
The new theme song is backed by almost every organization. They believe in changing the world through singing, he added.
Koch migrated to Sydney, Australia where he was most successful in the entertainment and professional music industry while recording for RCA/Laser Records and the Australian TV Network Channel 9's "Living Sound" recording label. In Australia, he formed his band Dark Tan and recorded three international hits on the RCA label. He has performed internationally with Dark Tan, S-witch, and as a solo artist. One notable appearance was during 'The Stars & Stripes Concert' in 1976, performing under the Sydney harbour bridge on a floating pontoon for Radio 2SM.
Koch has often been lauded in the Australian and Asian media as "Asia's King of Pop" or "Pop King of Asia" after gaining international success in the late 1970s. He has performed worldwide including Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka among other places. Since 1975 Koch has released 21 singles and 4 albums through record labels such as RCA, BMG, EMI and Sony.
I started off singing with Jet Liners here in Sri Lanka in the 60s. Since then on my journey I have been blessed to meet and collaborate with world famous song writers, musicians and artists including Elton John and Neil Diamond. They think I am unique because I dont stick to the rules, Koch said adding that he never writes music for his songs but only writes the lyrics.
In 1986 Alston Koch was selected and commissioned by the Australian Task Force to write, produce and perform the America's Cup album, The Kookaburra Connection with the theme song "Kookaburra" released both as a single and music video broadcast during the race. His first self-written major hit, "Disco Lady", earned him his first gold record. The song also won him and Dark Tan the 'Best New Talent' at the 1979 International Disc Jockey Association Awards and that same year Dark Tan won Australia's Observer newspaper's 'Best Disco Band' award.
Koch received his first ARIA (Accredited Award) for Melissa 'Read My Lips' (1990). He is also the recipient of three Gold Awards and one Platinum Award from ARIA (accredited).
In 2008, I wrote a song about climate change for a United Nations WTO presentation in London. The song was also presented by Geoffrey Lipman Chairman of ICTP at the 'Live the Deal Climate Change' conference in Copenhagen to all the World's leaders. I was the Goodwill Ambassador for the campaign, and the song has been promoted globally by ICTP in their campaign for green growth. Barbara Follet (Minister of State for Great Britain) certified it as 'A gift in song to the world suffering due to Climate Change' and the song received a standing ovation, Koch recalled.
Koch was commissioned by Cricket Australia to sing the National Anthem at the One Day International Cricket matches and the important Boxing Day Test. In 2009, he was appointed to the committee for the Cricket World Cup 2011 tournament staged in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and was the Official 'Goodwill Ambassador' for the tournament. Koch wrote and performed an official song for The Sri Lankan cricketer and world record holder and world champion Muttiah Muralitharan in the year 2007.
I have never played cricket but I believe it is the only sport that helps Sri Lanka take a claim anywhere in the world, he said.
Since 2007, Koch has been the Ambassador for Tourism for Sri Lanka and launched the song `Land like no other for this purpose. I am also the Ambassador for Climate Change for Sri Lankan Airlines. With my songs I take the message of green initiative across the world. It gives me immense pleasure to see my music video on flights, Koch added.
He also played the Lead Actor in the film According to Mathew opposite Bollywood star Jacqueline Fernandez.
It was a privilege to be a part of this movie which could take the country to the world. I see this film as a possible step into Hollywood and it was wonderful working with Jackie, Koch explained.
I am also being featured in a Hollywood film as Alston Koch which is a big milestone for me, said Koch amused at being chosen to give life to his own character in a film. Wherever this singer, song writer, producer and actor roam his motherland Sri Lanka always takes a prominent place in his heart.
Whole reason Sri Lanka is called the paradise because the country is blessed and people around the world know that. We own a culture which goes back 2,500 years. I think Sri Lanka is not a pearl but a diamond which is more precious. Anywhere I go I wave Sri Lankan flag and do a lot of work to support the country, he said with much patriotism.
My grand uncle Roslyn Koch was the Minister of Public Administration in the first Government of Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and I have had family who served the Government here from Secretary to the Governor General to advisers in the administration during the time of the British and as administrators of the Dutch Forts in Galle and Jaffna. So I am very much a part of the culture of the country, he said.
Looking out of the window where his eyes fall on Port City he utters, It is amazing how Sri Lanka is growing. It is gratifying to see the country developing. We are in the right path and moving in the right direction. This is what the country needed. I hope to do a big show here one day.

Economy on path of digital renaissance
The government is working on formulating a strategy for digitizing the economy which will usher a new era in the digital landscape of the country.
The Digital Strategy will be present for Cabinet approval in the end of August, said Secretary to the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Wasantha Deshapriya. Speaking to Daily News Business on Thursday in Colombo he said the study was carried out by Makinsey & Company and upon receiving approval it will be put in for implementation.
He said under the strategy they have identified 13 projects in various sectors and the three key sectors that have been identified were agriculture, tourism and manufacturing with plantations, fisheries also coming into the scene.
These 13 projects will be facilitated by setting up a global logistics centre and having a number of export villages connecting it where people should be able to export their products seamlessly and expeditiously. He said there were a number of impediments in the legal area which were hampering the growth of especially the digital export industry. To overcome this, the government was going to introduce the Data Protection Act where the data in the electronic platform of whoever involved in export will be protected.
Deshapriya said that they were also trying to streamline the regulations involved in the Customs procedures. Although a single window platform has been set up there were still rough edges which were to be smoothened in the export and import industry. The Secretary also said there were a number of projects in line to improve the utilization consumption of digital technology which will enhance the exports of the country. We want all the small and medium scale companies to use digital technologies and we expect digital consumption to go up at the same time, especially in the area of export.
He said fish exports, plantation and agriculture products will also come into the fore and the government will facilitate and support the exporters to improve their exports through digitalization.
Deshapriya said they also plan to introduce e-passports with bio-metric information and also e-gates at the immigration. He said De La Rue has been selected to implement the e-passport project and the company was working with the Immigration Department and in the first quarter of next year the people could see the e-passport.

Englands Anderson escapes injury after being struck by golf ball
LONDON, Sunday: England fast bowler James Anderson got a taste of the chin-music that he is more used to dishing out, courtesy of a golf shot gone horribly wrong, but emerged from the incident on Sunday with his smile intact.
Playing with his fellow paceman Stuart Broad at the 27-hole Stoke Park golf course in Buckinghamshire, Andersons miscued shot in the rough rebounded off tree roots and caught him straight in the face.
Broad, who filmed his team mates self-inflicted blow from a few metres behind, reacted in shock to the ball hitting Anderson.
However, on finding that his bowling partner was alright, Broad posted the video on his Twitter and Instagram accounts with a series of laughing emojis, reassuring England fans. Anderson later retweeted the clip and made light of the freak incident saying that it had not put him off golf and he had not lost any teeth. Englands players are enjoying some rest ahead of the second test against India at Lords on Thursday.
The hosts lead the five match series 1-0 after their thrilling 31-run victory in the first test.

England cricketer Stokes lost control in street brawl, court told
BRISTOL, Monday: England cricketer Ben Stokes lost his self-control and knocked two men unconscious in a street fight last September, a court heard on Monday as his trial for affray began.
Stokes, acting in "revenge, retaliation or punishment", was involved in a "sustained episode of significant violence", prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis told a jury at Bristol Crown Court in southwest England.
Stokes, 27, who starred on Saturday as England beat India at Edgbaston, is being tried alongside 27-year-old Ryan Ali and Ryan Hale, 28. They each deny the charge of affray.
They had all been drinking inside a Bristol nightclub. The fight took place outside after 2:00 am on September 25 last year, the prosecutor said.
They were all involved in threatening and/or using unlawful violence towards each other, it is alleged.
Corsellis said only the defendants knew how the fracas began and it could have been stopped very quickly.
"During the incident, Mr Stokes lost his control and started to attack with revenge, retaliation or punishment in mind. Well beyond acting in self defence or defence of another," he said.
"He knocked Mr Hale unconscious and then -- after time to pause for thought, to calm -- he did exactly the same to Mr Ali.
"Mr Ali received significant injuries included a fractured eye socket and required hospital treatment."
ONLOOKERS SHOCKED
Wearing a blue suit and red tie, Stokes sat in the far left of the dock, Hale in the middle and Ali on the far right.
"This was not a trivial moment of unpleasantness. It was a sustained episode of significant violence that left onlookers shocked at what was taking place," Corsellis said.
"A bottle was used at the beginning by Mr Ali and a broken street sign brought into the fray towards the end by Mr Hale."
The prosecutor said the three defendants were all young men of promise.
"Ben Stokes, is a professional cricket player who has reached the top of his profession and represented his country," Corsellis said.
"Equally, Mr Ali has worked for the emergency services and Mr Hale has served his country in the armed forces.
"It almost goes without saying, but past success, fame or good deeds does not absolve you from your duty -- and the law -- to behave yourself."
Stokes missed the Ashes series against Australia after being suspended from playing for England. Without him, England lost the series 4-0.
He has since played in the Test series against New Zealand and Pakistan. He starred in England's first Test victory over India last week.
The trial is expected to last between five and seven days.
The second Test between England and India, at Lord's in London, starts on Thursday.  AFP

Epic for the fallen hero
Silence reigned in that doomed dungeon-like abode. The officers donned in the military attire question the most dangerous criminal in the country. Arrested when he was taking a shave, Attanayake had to reveal his true self to Sri Lankas military. He was Rohana Wijeweera who manifested one whole episode in the Sri Lankan chronicle with a hearty laugh.
Until the 2019 Oscar long-list nominations were announced, no one knew that a film was yet to be produced on that saga. Titled The Frozen Fire, a biopic on Rohana Wijeweera, this is the first Sri Lankan film to enter the mainstream Best Picture category of Oscars 2019 according to its officials. The previous Sri Lankan movies that entered the Oscars were under the Best Foreign Language Film category.
The Oscar long-list is handled by the All Lights Film Services (ALFS), a leading film consultancy company in India.
Anuruddha Jayasinghe
The Frozen Fire divulges the life and times of Wijeweera and his close associates who stood courageously for his ideology. The work runs across the period spanning between Wijeweeras release from jail and his mysterious murder towards the late 1980s. Literary materials are abundant on the turbulent times of the late eighties, but surprisingly no one took the initiative to introduce it into the widescreen. This phenomenon prompted Anuruddha Jayasinghe to seize the opportunity.
Most filmmakers have opted for distant historical events. But none of them was concerned about the recent events of the history. What happened in the 1988 and 1989 is a recent historical event. But they are interested in distant historical events, Jayasinghe said.
History attracts filmmakers. The World War II still generates themes for films. Hitler, for instance, still looks a fresh subject for creative artistes. As Jayasinghe noted, a period when 60,000 youths were killed counts as a serious episode in any countrys history.
Why didnt a single filmmaker make a film on this period We need to go beyond the fantasies.
We have seen enough films on the colonial rule and the Sinhalese rebellion. Comparatively, it is easy to find sources and information as this is a recent era, Jayasinghe noted.
Probably because you are not supposed to fly the losers flags over the winners. In the eighties saga, the government could successfully crush down the youth resurrection. Wijeweera and his organisation did not have the opportunity to emerge triumphantly. Someday in history, they will remain backstage as losers and traitors. No epic will be written in their memory.
Remember, those who joined the resurrection, Jayasinghe added, did not expect ministerial perks. They did not look forward to car permits. What they stood against was the Indian expansionism. They were disturbed by the major events such as the IPKF presence and the shocking silence of the government and the military.
Jayasinghe did not have the disadvantage which affects most other history-based filmmakers. His sources were abundant. A few of those who offered shelter to Wijeweera the fugitive knowingly or unknowingly are still alive to relate interesting narratives.
Wijeweeras period spent masquerading as various personalities is quite significant and interesting. Especially because this much sought-after fugitive lived in hiding shifting from one place to other thanks to his masquerading talents.
Elaris Ralahami was one name given to Wijeweera during this brief spell. His carer, however, discovered his identity because of his signature placed on a book. Many such interesting incidents have coloured the film that eventually reached the Oscar sphere.

Evening of Music with Dr. Manella Joseph
Allince Francaise de Ceylan popularly known as Alliance Francaise de Colombo the presents an Evening of Music with Dr Manella Joseph on August 11 at 6.30 pm.
Dr Joseph will be backed by a bunch of talented and experienced musicians Nihal Jayawardena (Guitar /Saxophone/Harmonica), Sudesh Fernando (Piano /Keyboards), and Denver Barnes (Base Guitar). Isuru Senanayake (Acoustics Guitar-Percussion). The evening line up will include her original songs as well as some popular songs.
Dr. Joseph, a consultant pathologist, believes in a life of service and significance and not in a mere circumstantial existence or a preoccupation with the usual mundane concerns of the professional classes. This is reflected in her attitude to her work and to her music. Nurtured in western popular music at home and light classical music in school she went on to sing Sinhala songs composed by Clarence Wijeywardene as the leader of the Winslow Six along with her five siblings. She now focuses on a solo career.
Dr. Joseph is a prolific songwriter and lyricist in both English and Sinhala, having 30 original songs to her credit some of which have been composed in her teens. These range from songs about aspects of love  romantic love, disappointment, unrequited love and about burning social issues and philosophical and spiritual matters, as well as filial love and gratitude to ones parents. Some of these songs have been inspired by her own experiences, some by those around her. English is the lingua franca and music itself is a universal language. One can reach out to many through English songs. It can also bond and bind many ethnicities in a country like ours she says. She maintains her Sri Lankan identity even in the musical arrangements.
Dr. Joseph believes that the 60s and early 70s were the golden age for popular music because there were fewer conflicts in the world then, less anxiety and more hope and this fact was demonstrated in the songs of that time which were lighthearted and sentimental exemplifying the values of that period and the uncomplicated relationships which existed between men and women.
She continues to sing cover songs knowing full well that all audiences have their special favourites and would like to hear them sung by a competent and talented singer. But she would dearly love our local audiences to be more open to the infinite variety that could be offered to a discerning audience. Naturally they are about universal themes but in a unique and definitive idiom and style which is truly Sri Lankan instead of an imitative rendering however good it may be. Most of her songs reflect distinctive Sri Lankan cultural values which she would like to encourage and promote. Entrance is free by invitation. You can pick up your invitations at Alliance Francaise at 11, Barnes Place, Colombo 7 (near Colombo Town Hall Eye Hospital Junction). Tel 2694162 / 2693467

Finance Ministry on MP pay imbroglio: JUDGES, A UNIQUE CATEGORY
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry yesterday categorically refuted claims that the salaries of MPs and ministers should be increased on par with the judges salaries.
The ministry revealed that the Cabinet on January 9 this year had taken a decision that the judicial officers be treated as a unique category when determining their salaries and other facilities.
The Cabinet on the same day has also taken a decision that the Attorney Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department should be re-organised as unique departments, in view of the role assigned to those Departments and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining officers in those Departments.
The salaries of judges which belong to judiciary and of the officials of the Attorney Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department were increased making them separate three unique services.
The reason is that the officers who are working in these three services have ample opportunity for enough revenues if they are working in their private capacities. In order to attract them and retain their services, these judicial officers were given the unique salary scale which cannot be claimed by other officials in the public sector, the Finance Ministry sources explained.
The Ministry pointed out the arguments as to MPs and Ministers salaries should be increased on par with the judicial officers salaries as per the 2006 Resolution adopted by Parliament are no more valid after this Cabinet decision.
The Ministry states it is due to these reasons Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera outright rejected the idea of any salary increase to MPs and Ministers.

Fitch affirms Abans at BBB+(lka): Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based retailer Abans PLCs (Abans) National Long-Term Rating at BBB+(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
The affirmation reflects Fitchs view that Abans will continue to make meaningful progress towards improving its net leverage, defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR, to around 6.0x by the end of the financial year to March 31, 2019 (FY19). We expect this to be supported by a recovery in profitability because the company will be better able to pass through costs to customers, as well as operating efficiencies and moderating capex and investments.
Abans net leverage improved significantly to 6.8x in the 12 months to end-June 2018 from 7.2x at FYE18 and 7.7x at FYE17. However we may take negative rating action in the next six to 12 months if Abans deviates from its deleveraging trend.
Abans rating also reflects its strong market position in consumer durables retail in Sri Lanka, its extensive brand portfolio supported by a wide distribution network and a well-managed hire-purchase (HP) business, which are partly offset by its investment in a large real estate project.

Studying at Eton College in Windsor, Berkshire, he made his mum a promise, which has now been revealed.
In his book, A Royal Duty, Diana's close friend and butler, Paul Burrell, revealed William vowed to help Diana reclaim her title.
In his book, Paul revealed how William had said: "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am king."
However, Diana - by then Princess of Wales - died three years later in Paris.

Improved infrastructure plays major role in real estate values  JLL Report
With the recent announcement that the much-anticipated Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) project is all set to proceed with Phase 1 following the green light from government ministries, there has been widespread speculation on its effect on the price of property within close proximity to the line.
Taking into consideration various factors and an accumulation of relevant statistics, leading global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL) has evaluated the relationship between this new infrastructure development and the value of real estate in Colombo.
Construction of the LRT is scheduled to commence as early as 2020 at a cost of USD1.7 billion - funded by Japanese government loans, and re-payable over 40 years, at 0.1% interest, and with a 12-year initial grace period.
The first line -travelling from Fort/Pettah to Malabe- is projected to begin commercial operations in 2024 and promises a considerably reduced travel time of approximately 30 minutes between the two termini. Phase 1 is reported to be fully elevated, with a total of 16 stops over the 15.3 km length of the line.
As is expected, with any major commercial development promising to bring with it added convenience and ease of travel, property prices en route are expected to spike.
In an attempt to assess the impact of the projected LRT terminal on real estate values, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. has considered both, history, and global case studies, for similar infrastructure improvements, in other geographies around the world -namely those in cities such as London and Dubai.
The correlation between real estate values and improved infrastructure is not a new phenomenon, and it was in London with the opening of the first Metropolitan underground line in 1863, that this was first observed.
Infrastructure has subsequently become the lifeblood of prosperity and confidence, driving sustainability, and, by upgrading inadequate systems, removing transport bottlenecks, with significant lifestyle improvements for those who benefit.
However, with half the worlds population now living in urban areas, and, this set to increase by 50%, from 4 billion to 6 billion, over the next 15 years, the speed and scale of urbanization poses enormous challenges for local governments.
Closer to home in the monocentric city of Colombo, the urban population currently accounts for approximately 48% of the total population which is projected to increase to 72% by 2033.
This rapid pace of urbanization underscores the need for discovering alternate channels to leverage the citys workforce and increase efficiency, thereby improving the standard of living of its citizens on par with the rest of the worlds leading metropolises.
However, in the case of Colombo where commercial activity is restricted to a single CBD, the pressure on existing infrastructure is more intense, and the cost of construction and disruption during the construction phase is much higher. As a result, sustainability is driving urban planners to move towards a polycentric model, where cities have multiple commercial sub centres -perhaps best illustrated in the model of new cities, such as Dubai, which in addition to the Sheikh Zayed/DIFC CBD, has numerous sub commercial hubs including Business Bay, The Marina, Jumeirah Lakes and Jebel Ali.
If Colombo is to alleviate chronic congestion issues and move towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly, polycentric model with the intention of improving living standards for residents and driving commercial efficiencies for businesses, an integrated LRT system will prove to be vital to these goals.
The suburb of Malabe, according to online data, already enjoys projected, year on year, land price increases of 16%, with per perch prices already approaching Rs.1 million.
This is partly due to good access to the southern expressway, and the proliferation of high tech IT and business parks providing excellent employment prospects for graduates from nearby educational institutions.
In this evaluation, the Thunen Rings Principal -the first mathematical model to explain agricultural land values in relation to distance from population centres, developed by Johann Heinrich von Thunen in 1826- has proven useful. Developed further by the American, William Alonso, in 1960, to become the Bid Rent Theory, land values, in relation to distance from a CBD or major infrastructure improvement, can now be quantified.
Slope A demonstrates that proximity to a major infrastructure improvement has less impact on the value of residential property, although the radius of influence is wider. Commercial property values rise higher than residential, although the radius of influence is narrower (slope B). In certain circumstances, where the infrastructure improvement may be a source of noise and air pollution, such as a major road, slope C demonstrates that there is an optimum distance from that source, for maximum value increase, too close and values may fall, due to adverse effects, too far and values begin to slide.

JVP condemns assassination attempt on Venezuelan President
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, issuing a statement yesterday, condemned the assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
It is with concern we came to know about the failed cowardly assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. According to the media, the assassination attempt was made using several drones loaded with explosives while President Maduro was delivering the closing speech on the 81st Anniversary of the National Guard, the statement said.
Assassination attempts on progressive leaders when they cannot be overthrown democratically, economically, politically, and militarily is the last attempt by imperialist conspirators who would not hesitate to deploy the extreme rightist opposition in the country to carry out their schemes, Dissanayake stated.
We, as the JVP, vehemently condemned the cowardly attack and are relieved that no harm has come to President Maduro, who we are sure, would be more determined to continue with added vigour the progressive process he is heading in Venezuela.
"The JVP always stands with progressive and left forces and their leaders and condemn all attempts by imperialists and their lackeys to deny the cause of progressive social transformation of its front-runners, he added.

KAMAL  believes  in espionage films
Connecting his love for espionage films to a family member, Kamal Haasan said, I always believe in an espionage film. My eldest maternal uncle was in the police department and moved on to the Intelligence Bureau, so the stories that we heard from him were absolutely on the other end of the spectrum as compared to the James Bond films. We all wanted to join MI6 and he trained with MI6, and the stories that he used to tell were something else. So, I always wanted to get that feeling into films.
As a matter of fact, when we made Nayakan... we decided (that) our bad guys will not wear checkered shirts and scarves on their necks; theyll be such that you wont be able to differentiate them from common people; but they will be indulging in the darkest of deeds, he said, adding: So, thats exactly the direction we went in.
Vishwaroopam 2 is the sequel to Kamal Haasan embattled Vishwaroopam, which released in 2013. Haasan reprises the role of RAW agent Major Wisam Ahmad, who is on a mission to capture Omar Qureshi (Rahul Bose), who escaped in finale of the first film.

Kuznetsova saves four match points, wins Washington WTA title
WASHINGTON, Monday: Two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova saved four match points and rallied to defeat Croatias Donna Vekic and win her 18th career WTA title Sunday at the Washington Open.
The 33-year-old Russian, ranked 128th in the world, defeated 44th-ranked Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-2 for her first WTA title since 2016 in Moscow.
It was also Kuznetsovas first title since left wrist surgery that had sidelined her earlier this year.
I know Ive been a little bit lucky today, Kuznetsova said.
Kuznetsova, winner of the 2004 US Open and 2009 French Open, claimed a second Washington title to go with the one she won in 2014, her only other appearance.
Theres something going on with Washington, Kuznetsova said. I never lose here. I played two times and I won both.
Vekic, 22, won her only WTA titles in 2014 at Kuala Lumpur and last year at Nottingham.
Missing out on another after coming so near left her wiping away tears on the court as she accepted a runner-up trophy following only her second final in three seasons.
Sorry for what happened today, she told coach Torben Beltz. Hopefully we can have some more finals together.
Tennis is not an easy game. Its not easy when you lose with match points up. But I love this sport. Hopefully I can be in some more finals and win some more titles.
A sympathetic Kuznetsova offered condolences, praising her effort and saying, Im sure your victories will come.
Tennis is a little bit difficult sport. When you lose its really bad and when you win you have everything.
Vekic had two match points in the 10th game of the second set but Kuznetsova denied her to reach a tie-breaker. Kuznetsova gave the Croatian two more match-point chances in the tie-breaker but saved each with a forehand winner before forcing a third set. Kuznetsova rolled through Vekic in the final set, leading 5-0 and breaking her in the final game to claim the crown after two hours and 31 minutes, jumping for joy in celebration.  AFP

Lankan heart surgeons train in Bangalore
Apollo Hospital Bangalore hosted surgeons from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh for a workshop and training session in minimally invasive cardiac surgery, recently. The programme was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Satyaki Nambla of Apollo Hospital.
The Sri Lankan surgeons included Dr. Priyanga Ratnayake and Dr. Santusht Perera. Two surgeons from Bangladesh, Dr. Sohail Ahmed and Dr. Zakir Hossain also attended. The programme was facilitated by General Sales Manager of Johnson & Johnson, India Manu Dixit.
Participants said the programme was well-organised and helpful in improving their clinical practice. Dr. Ratnayake said minimally invasive surgery is the future in clinical medicine and as Sri Lanka did not have a dedicated programme for minimally invasive heart surgery, this programme could motivate local surgeons to establish a similar unit.
Dr. Perera said despite the procedures steep learning curve and need for specialized instruments, it would benefit patients in Sri Lanka if a heart centre decided to pursue such a programme.
The benefits of minimally invasive cardiac surgery, performed through the left chest (rather than a mid-line frontal chestincision), are many. The length of stay following the surgery is usually three to four days (as opposed to 8-10 days with conventional heart surgery).
The pain following the heart operation is markedly less than conventional surgery which helps patients get out of bed and start walking the day after the procedure. The blood loss during minimally invasive heart surgery also tends to be less than that with conventional heart surgery.
This programme at Apollo Hospital has hosted several surgeons from Sri Lanka in the past.

Love for Narcissus still echoes
The Greek myth revolving around the character called Narcissus tells us a story of an individual who fell in love with his own image and rejected the love of a beautiful fairy in the woods (nymph), called Echo.
The term narcissism thus denotes an excessive degree of self-esteem or self-involvement, a condition that is usually a form of emotional immaturity. According to the myth, the rejection from Narcissus had made Echo fade away with great pain in her mind until all that was left of her was her voice.
Echo's hopeless love for Narcissus who fell in love with his own image is reflected on the contemporary society to great extent.
The launch of the music video Mama Donkarayayi (I am Echo) based on a song written by Asoka Handagama, composed by Chitral Somapala and sung by Indika Upamali was held at the NFCs Tharangani cinema recently.
The event was graced by scholars, fans and a gamut of celebrities who added much glamour. The song, I am Echo based on two mythical characters, Narcissus and Echo from Greek-Latin mythology, is set in the contemporary society.
The discussion around the song was triggered by two speeches by Saman Wickramaarchchi and Deepthi Kumara Gunarathne. Featuring Indika Upamali and Chitral Somapala, the cinematography and art direction of the song in the music video are by Channa Deshapriya and Upul Chamila Bandara.
Mama Donkarayayi has been written and directed by Asoka Handagama. In his speech Saman Wickramaarchchi said Face book addicts in the modern world depict narcissistic indulgence of people in contemporary society.
He talked of pros and cons of using Face book and shed light on the dangers it poses to individuals who get excessively involved with it.
Posting Selfies of oneself constantly on face book to attract attention of people portrays Narcissistic nature of individuals. People who roam in Face book and social media become self centric and the world is rapidly moving towards producing Narcissuses, he said.
Wickramaarchchi said the concept of Asoka Handagama to bring Narcissuss story to fore being a constructive move will serve a social purpose in the country at this juncture.
The music video is made with a soothing manner and performances of Chitral Somapala and Indika Upamali in it are super.

Mahinda Wijesinghe
He was a scribe I always held in awe and was one who would call a spade a spade or go against the grain or what have you, he challenged the best of them at the highest of places in England. In his armoury he had the intelligence, the cheek and the backbone to spot shortcomings and point out to them. All his tedious efforts however were earlier put in the backburner by the ICC. He lamented due to the fact that the stiff upper-lipped Suddhas at the ICC never wanted a brown man from a far corner of the earth to get his name into their books. But he succeeded not once but thrice.
He was none other than Mahinda Wijesinghe, who was an accountant by profession but gave up his career to become the first Executive Secretary of the Sri Lanka Cricket Foundation in 1981 and was doing wonders, including the planning of the Indoor Cricket Nets at the NCC grounds until the usual Cricket Board politics intervened and he was forced to quit. As the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake stated: National politics is easier to handle than Cricket Board politics.
I was privileged to meet Mahinda at his residence at Battaramulla. He was charming as ever and put me at ease from the word go. He wrote a column called Cricket Cavalcade from 1970-80s in the Island news paper which was very popular. He played for Bloomfield as a batsman for a number of years and in the 1963/64 P. Sara season under the captaincy of old Anandian all-rounder, Noel Perera Bloomfield won the Sara Trophy. Mahinda was the vice-captain. In fact, it was a unique feat since the club did not even have a ground of their own.
Mahinda noted that Bloomfield was indebted to the bowling attack of pacemen Norton Frederick, Ranjit Malawana and Noel Perera. Anandian Dhanasiri Weerasinghe was one of the most brilliant cricketers he saw but was a bit laid back. He recalled that Dhanasiri scored a brilliant hundred vs NCC - a crackerjack side and Mahinda went in at No.3 when they were 2 for 15. Mahinda too went on to score a workman like 69 and in a partnership of 149 runs enabled Bloomfield to a facile victory.
Mahinda started as a 15 year old left arm spinner at Royal in 1955 in a third term match. In that game he performed so well, and as a result, the Royal skipper F.B. Crozier asked him to lead the team out. Little Mahinda was over the moon. The newspapers referred to him as the 15 year old pint sized left arm spinner. But surprisingly he was not selected for the next match! He was utterly dejected and did not continue going for practices.
However in the next season skipper Michael Wille assured him that he would play right through the season with off spinner/vice captain E.L. Pereira which surprised Mahinda.
He had a sensational season that year. First match in the first-term was against Ananda at Campbell Place. Sonny Yatawara was bowling at his fastest. Sahabandu and Mahinda the last pair were at the crease. Yatawara had his tail up, as the first ball went past Mahindas nose like a tracer bullet. Ananda skipper Polonowita realised that Mahindas nerves were jangling and immediately crowded him with a close in-field, and when Yatawara was about to bowl the next ball Bandu cheekily put his hand up and stopped the paceman midstream which made the bowler frothing mad, then meekily came across to Mahinda and whispered dont cross over. Bandu was shaking like a fig leaf and Mahinda had a quiet chuckle to himself.
Royal were all out. Ananda had to get 70 odd runs for a win. Yatawara opened the batting. The first ball was square cut for 4, next a cover drive screamed for a another 4 and the next delivery Bandu bowled him as he shouldered arms to show the crowd that Bandu was bowling wide, the ball swung in and bowled Yata all ends up. Mahinda was then brought on to bowl with the score at 45 for 3. With the first ball, Polonowita was caught in the gully by Lorenz Pereira, next ball Nimal Ekanayake was out caught by D.I.de Livera, then S.P. Ekanayakes stumps were rattled - it was the hat-trick ball, and then A.P Jayasinghe the stone-waller who had scored 86 in the first innings played forward and his off bail was clipped. It was 4 wickets in 4 balls and the board now read 45 for 7 and deadly silence in the crowd prevailed. The game was drawn.
S.P. Foenander the internationally acclaimed journalist  referred to as The Wisden of the East confirmed Mahindas feat as a Ceylon record. In the very next match he captured 12 for 35 against Zahira and at the end of the season he along with Michael Dias was selected for the combined schools.
In my short association with Mahinda I found him to be meticulous in his work as a scribe and he makes the best of us look run of the mill.

Miracle birth
In a rare case, doctors discovered that Jennifer Ashwood had two wombs  and had become simultaneously pregnant in both.
The odds of the phenomenon are 500 million to one, with fewer than a hundred examples ever recorded worldwide, and just a handful in Britain.
Most pregnant women with the condition known as bicornuate uterus, carry one baby on one side. Ashwood, 31, had daughter Millie, now eight, without finding out. The care worker and her husband Andrew, a fireman, learned they were expecting twins in December. Later, doctors discovered an abnormality, and they revealed in February that she had two wombs, with one baby in each. The condition, which developed when Helen was herself in the womb, does not cause extra problems with conception but there is a slightly higher risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Ashwood, from Camborne, Cornwall, went into labour at 34 weeks and gave birth to son Piran, 5lb 10oz, and daughter Poppy, 5lb 3oz, via caesarean. The twins came home after two weeks, following treatment for jaundice. Speaking about it, she said, To have the two [wombs] is rare in itself, but to have an egg in both, then those to be fertilised, and then for both eggs to be in the right part ... it's a bit of a miracle. You think you know your body well, but it turns out you might not. PTI

That MP pay hike
All citizens of this country, particularly those finding it difficult to make ends meet, would applaud President Maithripala Sirisena for firmly putting his foot down on plans to increase the salaries of all MPs. Reviving a proposal made as far back as 2006 that MPs salaries should be brought on par with that of judges of the higher courts it had been suggested that an MPs salary be raised by a staggering 215 percent. This is in keeping with the recent pay hike granted to members of the judiciary. The media went to town with the story, which, no doubt, would have raised the hackles of the general public not only at the enormity of the proposed increase but also the callousness displayed by our peoples representatives in granting themselves ANY salary increase at a time the people were reeling under the massive cost of living burden.
This is more so given that the MPs perks, and other allowances had been on the ascent periodically. Their parliament attendance allowances were increased several fold recently (though they were elected by the voters for just that purpose - attend parliament) and each MP was given Rs. 100,000 to better serve the people in their electorates. MPs also enjoy heavily subsidized meals of their choice (with one former fair member even insisting on including Australian Golden Syrup in the parliament breakfast menu). There is also the all paid for foreign junkets with spouses and progeny and the little matter of duty free vehicle permits, which, according to a lawsuit filed by civil activist lawyer Nagananda Kodithuwakku, nearly 90 of the MPs have sold to third parties for profit running into several millions of rupees each.
Not only that, even the Provincial Councillors and Local Government members too, it was reported, were planning to follow suit and the enormity of the financial burden on the public could be gauged by the fact that we now have an additional 10,000 LG Councillors, in terms of the newly enacted Local Government Elections law, making it carnival time for all our erstwhile peoples representatives.
Had the proposal gone through, the siblings and progeny of sitting members of parliament, which form the bulk of the Provincial Council membership, too, would be beneficiaries of the 215% pay hike since they, no doubt, are next in line to enter parliament once their papas or mamas hang up their boots, which would be a gross injustice on the superiorly educated public servant who toil for a pittance.
Several MPs from both sides of the political divide have overtly expressed their opposition to the proposed pay hike although there had been no opposition at the party leaders meeting to this, according to reports. Hence, it is most apt that the President has in unequivocal terms put the lid on the whole issue. Speaking at an event in Polonnaruwa, the President said he would not approve any increase in the salary of Members of Parliament. The President said he would not permit a salary increase of MPs by even 5 cents. satha pahakinwath vedikaranna denne ne. Even the Speakers office has issued a statement, in response to the reports, that no final decision has been taken on the matter.
Be that as it may, it was late President J.R. Jayewardene who wanted MPs salaries increased so that this may keep them out of corruptions way. However, the salary increase did not stop Ministers and MPs feathering their nests by other means. Politicians who entered parliament with modest means soon ended up leading super-luxury lives, even educating their children abroad. The situation has not changed since. If at all, the opportunities presented today are much more than during the time of JRJ. Hence the blood sport that politics has descended to today, with politicians even resorting to murder to enter Parliament.
Most would argue that our peoples representatives dont deserve even their present salaries. Parliament is more often than not without a quorum and MPs are found in deep snoozes during important debates. The language used by our MPs too leaves much to be desired and very often we find MPs who place questions in the Order Paper affecting their constituents not present in the House during question time. They also run amok in Parliament, running away with the Mace and engage in fisticuffs in the Well of the House.
In other countries MPs take voluntary pay cuts during times of crisis and themselves resort to tightening their belts before requesting the public to do so. Even in this country there were politicians, in the immediate post Independence era, who were the epitomes of propriety and did not live on the fat of the land like some of the present day politicians who do not hesitate to ladle themselves with the gravy, given the slightest opportunity.
President Sirisena should walk the talk and ensure that MPs salaries remain at the present level during the course of his Presidency. If at all, he should persuade them to let off some of their privileges and monetary rewards, until the country stabilizes economically. This will set a precedent for parliaments after this one.

Nations Trust Bank closed the six months period ending June 30, 2018 with a post-tax profit of Rs.1,875 million and a pre-tax profit of Rs.3,882 million underpinned by good growth in business volumes and improved operating margins.
Despite increased impairment charges slowing the bottom line growth, the Bank recorded a resilient performance in the back drop of industry witnessing tightening of market liquidity, moderating credit growth and increased non-performing loans during the first half of the year.
Net interest income increased by 35% mainly attributable to growth in volumes with a marginal improvement in NIMs. Interest income recorded a faster growth of 26% over interest expense growth of 20% due to the higher drop in cost of funds over the previous period.
Non fund based income including fees, commission and other operating income increased by 18% with trade and transactional fees contributing to a larger portion of the increase. Net trading losses, which mainly comprise of cost on funding swaps, remained at previous year reported levels as there had been no material movement in the SWAP book and forward premium rates in comparison to the previous period. Customer FX income reported a moderate growth of 16% with the volume growth. Impairment charges for the current year increased due to cash flow stress witnessed in selective portfolios which is also reflected in the increase in the NPL ratio to 3.06% from 2.29% reported in December 2017, mirroring industry trends. Industry NPLs stood at 2.50% in December 2017 increasing to 3.30% by end May 2018.
Expenses recorded a growth of 20% which is partly due to the front loading of certain expenses particularly related to branding, marketing activities and investments made on up-skilling of knowledge, employee engagement and culture building. Investments made in technology and digital platforms during the second half of 2017 also had a direct bearing in expenses growth in the current year. Expenses pertaining directly to business volume growth were well managed at 9%. Notably, the Bank reported a higher growth in revenue of 30% to commensurate expenses growth resulting in the Cost: Income ratio decreasing to 48.6% from 52.8% reported in the previous period.
Loans and advances recorded a growth of 12% primarily driven by corporate portfolio lending. Deposits recorded a growth of 16% while CASA grew by 15%. CASA mix was maintained at 28%.

The One Galle Face together with the No Kunu campaign team recently participated in cleaning the surrounding areas of the Beira Lake.
The campaign was initiated by retired engineer and activist for sustainable solutions, Sumi Moonesinghe in collaboration with the Gangaramaya Buddhist Temple.
The Galle Face Green and the surrounding area was allocated by the No Kunu movement for the staff of One Galle Face for cleaning purposes. Other organizations located in the vicinity contributed towards cleaning of an area of 12 km leading up to the Beira Lake.
Speaking about the campaign General Manager, Shangri-La Hotels Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Callie Yah said, maintaining an unpolluted environment is important. This is a good initiative, which should be carried forward. I want to thank the No Kunu team for giving us this opportunity and the staff of One Galle Face and all other organizations who participated in this initiative, she concluded.
The garbage crisis over the years has increased largely in the country, affecting lives on a daily basis. Oceans and lakes are polluted with plastic and toxic waste, causing harm to marine life and humans. Years to come if preventive measures arent taken the adversities will be severe and too late to find a solution.

Opposition Leaders post: Speaker to make announcement this week
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is to make an announcement in Parliament on the post of the Opposition Leader this week following receipt of UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweeras official reply.
The Speakers Media Secretary Chaminda Gamage told the Daily News that the Speakers Office was expecting the reply letter of the UPFA General Secretary yesterday.
The Speaker, following the receipt of a letter signed by eight Joint Opposition (JO) members asking to grant the Opposition Leader post to JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunwardena, wrote to the UPFA General Secretary on August 2 inquiring the official stance of the party with regard to the request.
Following the formation of the Unity Government by the UNP and the UPFA, the Opposition Leader post went to the TNA as it held the next highest number of MPs (16).
TNA Leader R. Sampanthan holds the mantle of Opposition Leader of the Eighth Parliament. The JO group which submitted the letter argued that they have the support of 70 MPs and therefore the mantle of Opposition Leader should be given to their nominee. However, JO sources said the name of MP Kumara Welgama has also been proposed by some JO members and they are divided over their nominee.
In the meantime, Minister Mano Ganesan pointed out that the JO cannot claim the Opposition Leader post as it is not a recognised party in Parliament.
There are only six recognised political parties in Parliament and no such party called the JO exists in Parliament, he told the media.
All UPFA party representatives were called for a special meeting last evening to take a final decision on the matter. Amaraweera said the UPFAs take on the Opposition Leader post was to be presented to the Speaker last evening.

Pepper cultivators in Divulapitiya, Mabodala, Badalgama, Walpita, Withanamulla, Dungah and Kotadeniyava are facing difficulties to sell their products as they do not get a competitive price for their products.
Pepper farmers complain that the reason for this decrease is due to pepper being imported to Sri Lanka from other countries.
Due to this crisis the Agricultural Department has taken steps to stop the importation of pepper and this will help the local pepper cultivators to achieve a good price for their pepper products in the future.

PRIME CHALLENGES BEFORE IMRAN KHAN
Our nation plays a key role in the developing story of the twenty-first century. What happens in Pakistan-socially, politically and economically in the coming years not only will help decide the outcome of the global war on terror, it will shape what the future will look like for both Islam and the West. I am determined that the future be peaceful and prosperous-not only for Pakistan but for the entire international community. That vision is possible only if the Muslim world and the West, led by the United States, strive together towards resolving the issues before us.
- General Pervez Musharraf- The President of Pakistan in 1990s- In the Line of Fire, published in 2006
The call for the creation of Pakistan was made by a British-educated lawyer, M. A. Jinnah in 1940, the unchallenged leader of the Muslim League. Arguments for the creation of Pakistan was mainly based on the elections results of India held in 1937, under the Government of India Act of 1935. It was pointed out by Jinnah and his keen supporters that the Congress Party failed to do well in the separated electorates reserved for minorities. By using these election results and controversial figures, this group agitated that Muslim did not want to be ruled a Hindu-dominated Congress. Between 1940-1945, a very tensed and volatile situation emerged in the Indian political scene, because of the iron-willed campaign led by Jinnah and his followers to carve-out a Muslim opinion for a separate state. The cunning British rulers saw a grand opportunity for their MANTRUM -divide and rule-and established an independent nation-state on August 14, 1947, on the Indian soil.
Linguistically diverse population
The creation of Pakistan was a catalyst to the largest demographic movement in recorded history. Nearly seventeen million people-Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs- are reported to have moved in both directions, between India and two wings of Pakistan (The eastern wing is now, Bangladesh). Sixty million of the ninety-five Muslims on the Indian-sub continent became citizens of Pakistan. However, thirty five-million Muslims accepted India as their motherland and became Indian citizens, making it the largest minority, in a non-Muslim state.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who fought for the division of the country died in 1948.
During its short history, despite the shared religion of its overwhelmingly Muslim population, Pakistan has been engaged in a painful and difficult struggle to define a national identity and evolve a dynamic political system for its linguistically diverse population. Pakistan is known to have over twenty languages and over 300 distinct dialects. Although Urdu and English are the official languages, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashtu, Baluchi and Seraiki are considered as main languages.
These social and linguistic differences have generated chronic regional tensions. Although a nuclear power, recent political events have witnessed several wars with India, gravely damaging its economy and social fabric. Its north-western frontier is strategically open to enemy attacks. Because of heavy and overburden military expenditure, economists point-out, that various political leaders, as well as military rulers who have governed the country during the last six-seven decades, have failed to address the social and economic problems of Pakistan and also have failed to allocate its scarce economic and natural resources in an equitable manner.
Political instability
The dawn of Bangladesh as a separate state became a reality in 1971 mainly due to the military defeat of Pakistan at the hands of India. This was due to the breakaway of its eastern territory. Further, Pakistans political instability is also due to the various schisms that have sprung up in the smaller provinces of Sind, Baluchistan and the North-Western Provinces.
There is also allegation against the Panjabi community from certain quarters alleging that this community enjoys benefits, which are denied to others. It is their opinion that there is a monopoly by the Panjabi majority of the benefits of power, profit and patronage. Adding fuel to this burdening situation, there is also a continuing ideological debate about the form of government it should adopt, Islamic or secular. In the absence of any nationally based political organisation, which can command the respect of the majority of people, ignoring caste, creed or other regional and ethnic differences, Pakistan authorities rely on the civil service and the power-hungry army to maintain the status-quo of the country.
Imran Khan, who has exhibited his fine skills as an all-rounder of the cricket world and brought the prestigious World-Cup to his loving Motherland in 1962 has claimed victory at the recently held controversial general election, will be sworn in soon, as the 19th Prime Minister of Pakistan. This marks a radical departure, for a politically and religiously conservative country dominated by the wealthy Bhutto and Sharif family dynasties.
Khan, now 65, grew up in a middle-class household in Lahore and was educated at Aitchison College, considered the Pakistani equivalent of Eton, before sending to England to study at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe and then to Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.
Khans supporters will hail his achievement as the dawn of a new age, symbolizing the end of politics- as --usual and the perceived elitism, cronyism and corruption associated with Shehbaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN) and Bilawal Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party(PPP).
Khan has already promised a fresh start, appealing in particular to younger people among the 106 million voters, out of a population of 207 million people. However, the former superstar in cricket will have to carve out his own political image and convince his countrymen who have fallen into deep and troublesome waters, that he is a worthy, honest and credible winner who can bring democracy, peace and political and economic stability to his motherland.

Rampant Namibia on verge of World Cup spot
JOHANNESBURG, Sunday - Namibia moved closer to a sixth straight Rugby World Cup appearance by scoring eight tries in a bonus-point 58-28 triumph over Zimbabwe in Bulawayo this weekend.
Uganda went on a scoring spree in another qualifier for the 2019 global showpiece in Japan, recovering from conceding an early try to trounce Tunisia 67-12 in Kampala.
Namibia lead the six-nation African qualifying competition with maximum points from four matches and their final fixture is at home to closest rivals Kenya on August 18.
Even if Kenya achieve an expected win over Tunisia in Nairobi this Saturday, they will trail Namibia by at least three points and must win in Windhoek to snatch first place.
Given that Namibia have averaged 73 points in four matches under Welsh coach Phil Davies, it is probably asking too much of Kenya to win in southwestern Africa.
The Kenyans do boast a perfect record from three outings, but failed to secure even one bonus point when overcoming Morocco away and Zimbabwe and Uganda at home.
Namibia have 20 points, Kenya 12, Uganda five, Tunisia four and Zimbabwe and Morocco three each with two matchdays remaining in the single-round mini-league.
The team finishing first goes into Pool B at the World Cup with defending champions New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and the repechage tournament winners.
Marseille hosts the repechage during November with Canada, Germany, Hong Kong and the African runners-up, almost certainly Kenya, competing for the final place in Japan.
The repechage winners also go to Pool B, creating the possibility of three of the five contenders for two quarter-finals places being African, including twice world champions South Africa. Namibia made a hesitant start in southern Zimbabwe city Bulawayo with Australia-based Connor Pritchard scoring for the hosts after Lesley Klim had put the visitors ahead.But as the first half progressed the Namibians gradually took control and led 27-7 by half-time with South Africa-based hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld impressive. Zimbabwe needed to score first in the second half at Hartsfield stadium to have any hope of a comeback, but it was Namibia who stretched their lead instead through Wian Conradie.
Although the outcome was obvious long before the end, Namibia only secured the bonus-point seventh try with four minutes left when Louis van der Westhuizen dived over in the corner. Fly-half Cliven Loubser top scored for Namibia with 16 points from five conversions and two penalties while there were eight different try scorers.
In Kampala, Uganda full-back Philip Wokorach starred at Kyadondo Stadium, scoring 37 points from three tries, eight conversions and two penalties. - AFP

After the completion of training, the nurses can be directed to the foreign job market as many vacancies for trained nurses exist in the UK and USA. All sections of the health sector will be turned into separate professions similar to the profession of doctors, the minister said.

Rs. 33 bn for fertiliser subsidy
The government has allocated Rs. 33 billion for the fertiliser subsidy this year, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said.
The State minister was speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate an irrigation development project in the Galewela Pradeshiya Sabha in Matale under the governments initiative to develop 1,000 irrigation tanks covering 1,000 villages.
The State minister said it was a weakness of the government that it could not effectively communicate to the people the positive work the government has undertaken for the peoples welfare over the past three and half years.
This government initiated an insurance scheme for all farmers in the country.
This is a huge achievement for the farming community. No former government had come up with such a scheme, he said.
The State minister said paddy will be purchased at a stable price during the Yala season.

In order to guide them in the right direction, we need to equip them with necessary infrastructural support, so they may reach their fullest potential at school. We are humbled to support this program which has allowed us to repair and provide essential facilities to rural schools that are often neglected or overlooked from the authorities due to budget constraints, Gamika De Silva Head of Marketing and Sales of Seylan Bank PLC commented.

SIGNIS to focus on youth vitality
SIGNIS Salutation Tele - Cinema Awards 2018 will be held with much grandeur on August 25 at the BMICH, with the theme, The Proud Display of Youth Vitality in the Global Motion Picture Discourse.
This 41st edition of this SIGNIS Salutation Ceremony in Sri Lanka will be held under the auspices of Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, and SIGNIS International Chairman, Helen Osman.
This time around the Award Ceremony is organised under the patronage of Revd Fr Lal Pushpadewa Fernando OMI, President - SIGNIS Sri Lanka and Media Spokesperson for the Catholic Church Sri Lanka.
This years theme for the event offers an opportunity for the young film directors of today to step into the limelight.
These resourceful young filmmakers, while following the footsteps of the cinema genius, Dr Lester James Peries have responsively accepted the very challenging leftist political cinematic expressions of the veteran filmmaker, Dr Dharmesena Pathiraja.
The Keynote Address of SIGNIS 2018 will be delivered by experienced film personality, Jackson Anthony.
At a press conference to announce the event, Revd Fr Lal Pushpadewa Fernando said, This years programme will comprise a short film competition under the title Director Tomorrow. SIGNIS will encourage young filmmakers to thereby consolidate their positions in the arena of filmmaking. SIGNIS paves way for youngsters to produce a radical and a decent cinema, he said.
A short film festival comprising 10 best short films shortlisted from over 100 will be held at NFCs Tharanagee hall on August 4. We will invite these 10 young filmmakers for the SIGNIS 2018 event on August 25 and felicitate the best three young directors there, he added.
Veteran media person, film critique and author, Edwin Ariyadasa said, standards of appreciating cinema and cinema review writing has deteriorated in the country.
Presently the art of effective cinema criticism does not exist in our country. We lack resourceful critiques. We also need a segment of viewers who appreciate new cinema and new concepts. Experimenting young filmmakers must be encouraged and looked after by the authorities and the society, he said.
He added, To coincide with the Salutation Awards Ceremony, SIGNIS 2018 will conduct competitions on film critique, upholding the tradition, focused on cinematic literature. Accordingly, Jayawilal Wilegoda, Cinema Review Competition for novices will be conducted this year too.
The Life Time Achievement Award is offered to artistes whose contribution to cinema and television industry has been unique, significant and noteworthy.
At SIGNIS 2018, the lifetime award will be presented to veteran actresses, Kanthi Lanka, Sumana Amarasinghe, and to film conserver, Tissa Nagodawithana.
Fr Earnest Poruthota pioneered to stage the OCIC awards in Sri Lanka four decades back.
OCIC conducted the only professional cinema course held in the country. Over the decades it identified budding cinema personnels and groomed them to become experts.
The International OCIC (OCICSIGNIS) has done immense service for the development of the Sri Lankan cinema and the wellbeing of its artistes. Many filmmakers, who commit themselves for the development of the film industry in Sri Lanka, are products of the OCIC Movement.
Prasanna Vithanage, Asoka Handagama, Sudath Mahadivulwewa, Inoka Satyangani, Dr Nuwan Nayanajith Kumara, Ajith Galappaththi are few people who came to the field by following the OCIC course. Dr Lester James Peries, Tissa Abeysekera, Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja and Cyril B Perera have contributed as resource persons for the OCIC courses.
OCIC that was dedicated to cinema was eventually evolved to UNDA to recognize television and radio. UNDA become SIGNIS in 2001 making a paradigm shift to recognise artistes in all three spheres, cinema, television and radio.
Fr Lal Pushpadeva currently dedicates himself towards adding value to SIGNIS with more innovations.
The purpose of SIGNIS culture is to enhance the quality of local cinema and television productions via diverse and innovative projects.

Six held over Venezuela drone attack
FRANCE: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has pointed the finger at Colombia following the alleged assassination attempt on him during a military parade in Caracas at the weekend.
Early investigations, according to Maduro, also point to financial backers who live in the US state of Florida.
Meanwhile the Colombian government has put the blame at the door of the ultra-right wing -- its term for the opposition.
Washington on Sunday denied any involvement in the alleged assassination attempt.
President Donald Trumps National Security Advisor John Bolton insisted there was no US government involvement and even suggested that the incident may have been a pretext set up by the regime itself.
While denying any US role, he said that if Venezuela had hard information of a potential violation of US law, we will take a serious look at it. Meanwhile, Russias Foreign Ministry on Sunday condemned the assassination attempt on its ally Maduro.
We consider using terrorist methods as a tool for political struggles to be categorically unacceptable, the statement said, adding it is obvious that such actions are aimed at destabilising the situation in the country. Moscow sided with Maduros regime after his government faced international isolation when close to 130 people were killed in anti-regime protests last year.
Nicaraguas Foreign Minister Denis Moncada said the assassination attempt against Nicolas Maduro undermined the democratic, progressive and revolutionary governments of Latin America and the Caribbean.
President Daniel Ortegas office said the attack was the work of obscure forces on the right, full of hate, trying to destroy the libertarian framework.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and his predecessor Raul Castro strongly condemn the attempted attack against President Nicolas Maduro, the Cuban foreign ministry said on its Twitter account.
Both leaders expressed their full solidarity and unconditional support for President Maduro, it said.
Tehran decried a step towards causing instability and insecurity in Venezuela. This can only benefit the enemies of the people and of the government of that country, said Bahram Ghasemi, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman.
Syria called for respect of the countrys sovereignty and no interference in its internal affairs.
The foreign ministry in Damascus condemned in the strongest possible terms the assassination attempt... which aimed at undermining the security and stability of the country.
Spains Foreign Ministry on Sunday condemned all kinds of violence used for political ends and called for a peaceful, democratic resolution to the serious crisis in Venezuela.
Germany said it was closely following developments on the ground, while Portugal opined that the crisis in Venezuela could be overcome by dialogue and national consensus in line with democratic principles.
Last year, the European Union hit the Venezuelan vice-president and 10 other officials with sanctions over rights abuses and irregularities in the re-election of Maduro, which the bloc condemned as neither free nor fair. - AFP

From crisis to sustenance  Part 37:
Sky is not the limit - because you set that limit
Effective marketing starts with a well-considered, well-informed marketing strategy. A good marketing strategy helps you define your vision, mission and business goals, and outlines the steps you need to take to achieve these goals.
The ultimate goal of any marketing strategy is to help you grow your business and increase your brand awareness; cementing trust with current clients is a nice by-product as well. How does it work Developing awareness of your brand - who you are, what you do and why you are uniquely qualified - should in turn help you generate leads which, through education and dripping on prospects, will lead to more clients.
Your marketing strategy affects the way you run your entire business, so it should be planned and developed in consultation with your team. It is a wide-reaching and comprehensive strategic planning tool that: (1) describes your business and its products and services
explains the position and role of your products and services in the market, (2) profiles your customers and your competition, (3) identifies the marketing tactics you will use and (4) allows you to build a marketing plan and measure its effectiveness.
A marketing strategy sets the overall direction and goals for your marketing, and is therefore different from a marketing plan, which outlines the specific actions you will take to implement your marketing strategy. Your marketing strategy could be developed for the next 3 to 5 years, while your marketing plan usually describes tactics to be achieved in the current year.
If your marketing strategy is well-developed, it will help you realise your businesss goals and build a strong reputation for your products. It will help you target your products and services to the people most likely to buy them. It usually involves you creating one or two powerful ideas to raise awareness and sell your products.
Developing a marketing strategy that includes the components listed below will help you make the most of your marketing investment, keep your marketing focused, and measure and improve your sales results.
Clarify your business objectives
These will focus on how you increase sales by getting and keeping customers. To explain how to do this, experts talk about how best to package your products and services, how much to charge for them and how to take them to market.
A marketing strategy will help you tailor your messages and put the right mix of marketing approaches in place so that you bring your sales and marketing activities together effectively in an effective marketing plan.
Unfortunately, there is a tendency for marketers to try to create a one size fits all approach for a portfolio of brands or, alternatively, to want to create complicated models to formulate marketing objectives. However, most businesses can be adequately captured by evaluating just three metrics: awareness, sales and advocacy (i.e. customer referral). Some brands are not widely known, others are have trouble converting awareness to sales and still others need to encourage consumer advocacy. While every business needs all three, it is important to focus on one primary objective or your strategy will degrade into a muddled hodgepodge.
Know your customers well
A successful marketing strategy depends on understanding your customers, what they need and how you can persuade them to buy from you. Theres no substitute for knowledge.
Experience and regular two-way communication will tell you a lot about your customers. But targeted market research will build a more detailed picture of customer segments with similar needs. It will help you understand how to target these people so youre not wasting time on people who arent interested in your offer.
But youll also need to understand how your market works - where do your customers find out about your offer, for example Your strategy should even tell you how you measure up against the competition and what new trends to expect in your market.
Make a good marketing plan
Your marketing plan  the written description of your market strategy  should (1) detail specific activities you intend to undertake; (2) Identify the audience each activity is targeted to; (3) Specify how youre going to measure success; (4) Be flexible enough to allow adjustments as necessary; and (5) Stipulate who on your team is responsible for each activity. There are couple of other components, too.
State your marketing goals
Define a set of specific marketing goals based on the business goals you listed the plan. These goals will motivate you and your team and help you benchmark your success.
Examples of marketing goals include increased market penetration (selling more existing products to existing customers) or market development (selling existing products to new target markets). These marketing goals could be long-term and might take a few years to successfully achieve. However, they should be clear and measurable and have time frames for achievement.
Make sure your overall strategies are also practical and measurable. A good marketing strategy will not be changed every year, but revised when your strategies have been achieved or your marketing goals have been met. Also, you may need to amend your strategy if your external market changes due to a new competitor or new technology, or if your products substantially change.
Research your market
Research is an essential part of your marketing strategy. You need to gather information about your market, such as its size, growth, social trends and demographics (population statistics such as age, gender and family type). It is important to keep an eye on your market so you are aware of any changes over time, so your strategy remains relevant and targete.
Use the 7 Ps of marketing
Identify your tactical marketing mix using the 7 Ps of marketing. If you can choose the right combination of marketing across product, price, promotion, place, people, process and physical evidence, your marketing strategy is more likely to be a success.
Test your ideas
In deciding your tactics, do some online research, test some ideas and approaches on your customers and your staff, and review what works. You will need to choose a number of tactics in order to meet your customers needs, reach the customers within your target market and improve your sales results.
Emerging opportunities
Marketing executives are busy people. They need to actively monitor the marketplace, identify business opportunities, collaborate with product people and run promotional campaigns. It is unreasonable to expect them to keep up with the vast array of emerging technology and tactics, especially since most of it wont pan out anyway.
Therefore, it is essential to have a team dedicated to identifying emerging opportunities, meeting with start-ups and running test-and-learn programs to evaluate their true potential. Of course, most of these will fail, but the few winners will more than make up for the losers.
Once an emerging opportunity has performed successfully in a pilot program, it can then be scaled up and become integrated into the normal strategic process as a viable tactic to achieve an awareness, sales or advocacy objective.
Decouple strategy and innovation
Unfortunately, in many organizations, strategy and innovation are often grouped together because they are both perceived as things that smart people do. Consequently, when firms approach innovation, they tend to put their best people on it, those who have shown a knack for getting results.
Thats why, all too often, innovation teams are populated by senior executives. Because innovation is considered crucial to the future of the enterprise, they also tend to have ample resources at their disposal. They are set up to succeed. Failure, all too often, isnt an option.
However, strategy is fundamentally different from innovation. A good strategy is one that achieves specific objectives. Innovation, however, focuses on creating something completely new and new things, unfortunately, tend to not work as well as standard solutions (at least at first). The truth is that innovation is a messy business.
So failure must be an option, which is why technologically focused venture capital firms expect the vast majority of their investments to fail. However, failure must be done cheaply, in order to keep the resources to a minimum.
Modern skills
Companies need to take advantage of the modern way in which people learn and shop. And that means being online where increasingly people search for information and services. However, its more than simply having a website. You must have compelling content that you share and get as many people talking about it as possible.
One type of content that more firms are using is online video. Its a great way to communicate what you offer, as well as what its like to work with you. But if you dont do it well, it can have a detrimental effect. A poorly crafted video can actually reduce your perceived value and leadership status, putting downward pressure on profits and deal-flow.
Equally important as creating remarkable content is determining your target market. When you have a solid specialty and a defined target market, you have a unique niche-a position in the marketplace that allows you to become the go-to expert. In addition, your marketing efforts are more effective and you avoid the labour-intensive work of attending dozens of networking events or cold calling.
Your engagement with prospects and clients can also be improved via cloud computing services such as Google Apps. By employing such technology, companies can spend less attention on IT and more attention on clients and growing the company. Such applications also allow companies to engage with clients, consultants, and the broader community using next-generation sales and marketing techniques.
Not all of these new techniques and technologies are for everyone or every company. Each has its pros and cons, and your customers and prospects may respond better to certain tactics over others. But theres no denying that companies must innovate and try new tactics if they want to survive.

SL misses boat to World Rowing Junior Cships
Sri Lanka has missed the boat to take part in the World Rowing Junior Championships 2018, which takes place from August 8 to15 in Racice, Czech Republic as the local federation has not sent entries to the sport's international governing body, FISA.
According to World Rowing Federation (FISA) sources more than 750 rowers from 38 countries have sent their entries and are preparing to race at the 2018 World Rowing Junior Championships in Racice.
By the time entries closed for the junior rowing championships on July 9, Sri Lanka had not submitted its list of rowing athletes to FISA.
Asked about this lapse, sources close to the federation said, this was the result of selectors not performing their role.
Asked if the federation had any issue with finding suitable rowers to participate in the event, they said the federation has a junior rower with ranking at the World Rowing Junior Championship.
The Ministry of Sports had assisted these rowers at the international regatta organized by FISA in 2016 and 2017.

SLMC: GMOA writes to President
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has written to the President requesting him to intervene immediately to save the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that Health Minister plans to issue an extraordinary gazette notification and dissolve the SLMC and set up a competent authority which obeys him.
This will destroy the entire health sector of Sri Lanka as well as its future.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the Health Ministry is trying to dissolve the SLMC because the SLMC bravely decided not to allow registration of foreign MBBS degree holders who did not obtain relevant qualifications to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka, does not recognize foreign MBBS doctors who did not obtain relevant qualifications according to the requirements of their own country and does not support registration of SAITM students who do not have basic educational qualifications.
Dr. Aluthge said that the GMOA will launch the biggest-ever struggle in the Sri Lankan history against this conspiracy along with the support of all trade unions, parents unions, patients unions, and university students. The Health Minister is supported by Prof. Colvin Gunaratne and certain NGO henchmen who depend on foreign dollars and who promoted SAITM, the GMOA said.

This would ease the lives of Polonnaruwa residents as well as visitors to the historic city. Almost all projects are infrastructure developments. The fact that none would generate new employment opportunities or increase production capacities should not be harped at this happy moment. Infrastructure projects take long to pay dividends and hence they wont be immediately benefitted by the residents of Polonnaruwa. However, they have a high showpiece value and are sure vote attractors at elections.
The benefits of Hambantota development of a similar nature during the last regime was not felt by the ordinary public. The poor peasant there continues to be poor and embroiled in a death trap. Carpeted wide roads, magnificent new buildings and conference halls, cricket grounds etc., have not brought any tangible relief. We are yet to produce a Sangakkara from Angunukolapelassa or a Muralitharan from Dambulla.
People-friendly approach
Developed land in Hambantota has been grabbed by the rich outside the region. The same fate awaits Polonnaruwa.
Look at the disparities.
While the Western Province contributes 44 per cent to the countrys GDP, North Central Province contributes only five per cent, according to a UNESCO report in 2011. Uva and the Northern Province contribute four per cent each. That means the development there is only one-tenth or only a decimal of the development witnessed in the Western Province. The contribution of Sabaragamuwa and the Eastern Province is 6 per cent each.
The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 shows the disparities in mean household income. For example, it varies from Rs. 32, 631 in the Eastern Province to Rs. 57,514 in the Western Province.
The same survey revealed that the mean household per capita income ranges from Rs. 11,259 in the Eastern Province to Rs. 21,665 in the Western Province, the latter being almost double the former.
It would have been much better and better appreciated by peasants in Polonnaruwa and elsewhere if the Government - instead of the 180 development projects - increased the guaranteed purchase price of paddy by a Rupee or two, a measure justified by the high depreciation of the Rupee. Keeping the sale price of bulk rice unaltered, it could also compensate mill owners and traders by giving fuel at subsidized rates for the transport of paddy/rice so that market prices do not rise. What is missing is a people-friendly approach.
The Government seems to rely on several easy paths to offset its financial difficulties such as increasing indirect taxation (custom duties, VAT etc), taxing public servants and mandatory price increases. The IMF-blessed crude oil adjustment formula is also applied for the same purpose. Whales and sharks evading taxes enjoy privileges while small and medium tax-payers are allegedly harassed with vengeance.
No genuine effort is made to reduce public expenses that could be easily dispensed with.
For example, the Government spends millions to place full-page advertisements in the print media and costly commercials in the electronic media to disseminate common knowledge that could be dispensed with a press release at no extra cost.
No effort is taken to reduce wastage and corruption in public services or rectify obvious defects and shortcomings. Abhorrent ostentation is rampant in high places. To make matters worse new proposals are sought to increase salaries of legislators.
Manpower issues in agriculture
The only sphere in the national economy which has any hope of early recovery is agriculture. A lot of the peasantry has to be improved and problems of agriculture such as manpower shortage, low productivity, low productivity of land and low technological base have to be addressed soon. For example, one-third of production is wasted or lost in transport.
A significant portion of the agricultural harvest is consumed by animals. Lack of adequate storage facilities is another urgent problem. These issues are never discussed in the Legislature or sufficiently brought up by the mass media and are not the subject matter of urgent development agendas. Building amusement parks reclaiming the sea and providing entertainment to white-skinned visitors take precedence over food security for the frequent natural and population.
Labour shortage threatens all sectors of the economy  agriculture, industry and services. Meanwhile, nearly a million workers have emigrated overseas for employment. Brain drain also continues.
At present, it is imperative that development of human capital, an increase of productivity, enhancement of technology and preventing wasteful expenditure should receive priority attention. In view of frequent natural manmade disasters ensuring food security of the population also becomes a priority.
Economic development must be based on national planning with a holistic approach. It should be conducted within a democratic framework with popular participation.
Wherever possible, masses should be mobilized for economic activities. For example, there are such areas as rainwater harvesting, urban gardening and home gardening that could be developed on such lines.
Planning has become a taboo with the political authorities and certain officials embracing the worn-out neo-liberal credo on the free play of market forces. As long as the objective is to look for successful foreign recipes to make Sri Lanka a second Singapore or China, it would elude us. It is a homemade realistic plan that is realizable. To do so we must give up our servility to international financial agencies whose prescriptions may not always benefit us.

Ant Man and the Wasp
A turning point in Marvels universe
The 20-film-long Marvel Cinematic Universe is made up of dramatic male superheroes with mythic backstories and fantastic powers. When it comes to Marvel, big, macho stories seem their recipes for success.
On the other hand, Ant-Man aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is an average man who fights crime haphazardly, often ant-sized. The newest film in the series, Ant-Man and the Wasp takes another step forward, pairing Rudd with actress Evangeline Lilly, introducing, for the first time in the Marvel Universe, a female lead in the title.
Ant-Man and the Wasp is couched between two other Marvel movies-the storyline progresses two years after Captain America: Civil War and dovetails with the apocalyptic ending of Avengers: Infinity War. Unlike the rest of the Avengers cohort, Langs actions have real-world consequences. Ant-Man and the Wasp starts with Lang under house-arrest, after he and several Avengers broke the Sokovia Accords, (that require them to get UN approval before using their powers), in Civil War. In real-person fashion, Lang accepts his two-year sentence, using the time to focus on being a good father to his daughter, Cassie.
However, just three days before the end of his sentence, Lang is reconnected with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the inventor the Ant-Man suit, and to Pyms daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Van Dyne, who was introduced in the first Ant-Man as Langs love-interest and fighting coach, slips naturally into the role of the Wasp. In addition to the Ant-Man powers of shrinking to the size of a bug and beyond, van Dynes suit includes wings and blasters. Her extra powers are indicative of the fact that the Wasp as no mere sidekick. She proves herself not only a capable, elegant fighter, but also a humorous character addition to a series that relies on personality. When Dr. Bill Foster (a scientist and contemporary of Hank Pym) and Scott Lang compare their experiences expanding in the Ant-Man suitMy record, twenty-one feet. You Sixty-five feet. Sixty five!van Dyne mocks their excessive masculinity, asking if they are finished comparing sizes.
The plot of Ant-Man and the Wasp centres around the characters search for Pyms wife and van Dynes mother, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who was known to be lost forever in the subatomic realm. They realise that when Lang slipped into the subatomic realm in the first film, he and Janet van Dyne experienced a quantum entanglement. Their connection through time and space allows the characters to locate Janet van Dyne in the subatomic realm, and attempt to rescue her.
The main villain of Ant-Man and the Wasp is the semi-corporeal character Ghost, aka Ava (Hannah John-Kamen). After suffering an atomic-level catastrophe as a child, Ava is able to pass through matter, and because of them, she worked for years as a government assassin under the alias Ghost. But her powers are a vulnerability as well, slowly killing Ava and causing her immense, unyielding pain. Weeks away from disintegrating herself, she dons her identity as Ghost, and steals Pyms technology to restore her molecular structure.
Despite its superficially complexity, the films plot feels a bit stuffy and anti-climactic. The characters are less than multi-dimensional, and the film works best when it falls back on the Ant-Man series unique formula of humour and mini-tech. Seeing the Hot Wheels cars expand and shrink is endlessly entertaining, and the concept of the rolling-suitcase-laboratory was particularly inventive.
While the Wasp character is given some excellent action scenesincluding one where, bug-sized, she dodges knives, meat tenderisers, and smashed vegetables in a kitchen fight-scene-for such a hyped-heroine, the Wasp feels like a dramatic appendage to Ant-Mans everyday life.
Ant-Man and the Wasp provides the levity that the Marvel Universe so often lacks. It was a welcome reprieve after the intensity of the Avengers: Infinity War conclusion. But perhaps the film was not chosen as the Infinity War successor for that reason alone. In the final scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp, Lang explores the subatomic realm once more for particles to heal Ava. Pym and the van Dyne women are outside of the quantum tunnel, directing Lang. Suddenly, Pym and the van Dynes become piles of dust, just like half of the Avengers in Infinity War, and meanwhile Lang remains safe in the subatomic realm. Possibly, Langs survival offers a clue to the future of the Avengers series, and the survival of the characters turned to ash. For this reason, it seems likely that Ant-Man will play an important role in the next Avengers movie.

UNP backbenchers against MP salary increase
The UNP backbenchers are against a salary increment for MPs, UNP MP S. M. Marikkar said yesterday. He said there is no proposal to increase MPs or ministers salaries.
MP Marikkar said UNP backbenchers will voice their objection with reference to the subject at the meeting of the governing party.
MP Marikkar added that political leaders must be an example for the people having a difficult time due to taxation, debts and cost of living.
When people are struggling with all these difficulties, it is only right that politicians too cut down their expenses and be exemplary to the people, Marikkar pointed out.
MP Marikkar was addressing a press briefing at Sirikotha, UNP headquarters, yesterday morning. The UNP backbencher also said the Joint Opposition is hiding behind controversial stories circulating in main stream and social media.
If you pay attention, you would have seen that the JO had lost about 800,000 votes compared with the last Presidential Election and the recent Local Government election. They are having various struggles within their own group. Recently, JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage was extremely critical of MP Kumara Welgama. It is obvious that they have many issues to resolve before anything else. But the JO hides behind stories like these to divert attention, MP Marikkar said.
He also observed that the role of a parliamentarian should not be tarnished by the actions of a few. MP Marikkar, referring to the trade union action launched by the Government Medical Officers Association against the Sri Lanka-Singapore Trade Agreement, said they are operating according to a political agenda. He said the government should be held responsible for not being strict in taking action against groups that use people for their own political betterment.
The government should be strong and show that it has a backbone to begin with. There are times that it has bowed down to groups like these. We cannot allow rough-doctors to take decisions for the government. However, there is a good side to this. I am a backbencher and I criticize the government. If a backbencher did the same under the previous regime, that MP wouldnt have survived, Marikkar added. Marikkar also questioned whether Sri Lanka is to survive on foreign exchange earned by mothers who are working like slaves in Middle Eastern countries.

Virat Kohli tops ICC Test ranking for batsman
India skipper Virat Kohli today topped the ICC Player Rankings for Test Batsmen, riding on his brilliant century against England in the opening Test at Edgbaston.
Kohli thus became the seventh India batsman and first since Sachin Tendulkar (in June 2011) to be ranked the number one Test batsman in the latest ICC ranking released today.
Kohli scored 149 and 51 in Indias 31-run defeat and has gone up by 31 points, which have helped him to end Steve Smiths 32-month reign as the top-ranked batsman and reach the top of the summit for the first time in his 67-Test career.
Kohli now leads Smith (who had held the top spot since December 2015) by five points, but will have to maintain the form in the remaining four Tests to finish the series as the worlds highest-ranked batsman.
Tendulkar had joined South Africas Jacques Kallis in number-one position in January 2011, but had dropped to second spot following the Jamaica Test in June 2011 after he had missed the three-Test series against the West Indies.
Apart from Kohli and Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Gautam Gambhir, Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and Dilip Vengsarkar are the other India batsmen to have achieved number-one rankings during their careers.
However, at 934 points, Kohli has become Indias highest-ranked batsman, 14th overall, on the all-time tally of points.
Kohli had entered the Edgbaston Test on 903 points, 13 points behind Gavaskar, and is now ahead of the ICC Cricket Hall of Famer by 18 points.
If Kohli can deliver another strong performance in the second Test at Lords, then he can break into the top-10 by leapfrogging Matthew Hayden, Kallis and AB de Villiers, whose highest points tally was 935 each.
Donald Bradman (961) and Steve Smith (947) are the two batsmen sitting on top of this exclusive list.
Kohli, who powered India to the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup title in 2008 and then won the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for ICC Cricketer of the Year in 2017, is the 76th player to top the Test batting rankings.
He is also the number-one ranked ODI batsman, but is ranked 12th in T20Is, 220 points behind number-one ranked Aaron Finch of Australia.

A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding was signed at the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage to enable 4500 young masons in Sri Lanka to be awarded an internationally acceptable vocational accreditation.
The three parties to the MoU are the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) and INSEC cement.
The young masons who would have already received a basic traditional training under master masons will be selected from all over the country. They will be put through a very brief programme of further formal training.
Thereafter those who pass a qualifying test will be made eligible to sit the examination conducted by NAITA to award the National Vocational Qualification Framework (NVQ) Level 3 accreditation examination. Those who are successful will be awarded the NVQ Level 3 certificate which is an internationally accepted vocational qualification.
NAITA which will award the certificate is an organization under the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage. This programme has been inaugurated by NAITA with the support of the other two institutions under the Ministers new initiative of an accelerated programme of vocational training for Sri Lankan youth. The MoU was signed by the Heads of the 3 institutions, in the presence of Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.

Wadduwa party deaths still a mystery
The fourth person admitted to the Panadura Hospital after becoming seriously ill during a beach party held in Wadduwa had died yesterday (6). The deceased was a 28-year-old from the Pothuhera area, Police Media Spokesmans Office said.
The Panadura Division OIC told Daily News that the post-mortem examination on three deceased was conducted and an open verdict was issued.
Four people were admitted to the Panadura Hospital after a party held at a hotel in Wadduwa on August 4.
Three of the four persons had died by Sunday (5) and it was suspected that they died after they ingested a poisonous substance.
According to the Panadura Hospital medical authorities, the three bodies indicated abnormal high temperature and heart rate.
An employee of the hotel said the heat in the hall where the party was, was very high and only two big fans functioned. The hotel authorities said they provided the hall and a private company organised the rest.
Police sources said the three deceased were 37-year-old Eranga Kumara from Kesbewa, 21-year-old Melan Chamika from Divulapitiya and 31-year-old Viduranga Deshan from Moronthuduwa,Kalutara.
Two victims passed away Sunday morning (August 5) and the other in the afternoon of the same day.
The party had commenced on August 4 evening and continued until wee hours of August 5, the sources said.
The Police Spokespersons Office said the party organised by a private event management company had been attended by about 2,000 people. The company had widely advertised the event through social media and attracted many youngsters from around the country. A renowned Israeli performer was scheduled to perform at the event, the sources said.
An eye-witness said the hall where the party was, was very hot and people were drenched in sweat. He said that towards Sunday morning, many were sprawled on the floor. The post-mortem examination was carried out yesterday (6) at the Panadura Hospital. The Panadura Division OIC told Daily News that body parts of the deceased were sent to the government analyst. The OIC said that scene of the incident was sealed off until the government analyst is brought there to inspect the location.
The post-mortem examination of the 4th person was still carried out by late yesterday evening.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said that police sniffer dogs had also employed to carry out a search operation to determine if any drug had been used at the function. But no trace of any drug was found, he said
The IGP has instructed to take every possible measure to determine what had caused the deaths of the four youths. The Government Analyst will be visiting the venue today (7) to examine the premises. The post-mortem was held and an open verdict was issued pending further investigation, SP Gunasekara said.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said the government will curb the drug menace in the country and island-wide raids are conducted to arrest drug smugglers. He said that many of these drug smugglers and drug rings are coming to light with the strengthened government effort to curb the menace. He said the government will carry on its onslaught on the narcotic operations and those responsible and found guilty would not be spared.
Police said they had not come across any evidence to suggest that the participants in the party had used drugs. The Police Spokesman said that this does not rule out the possibility.
He said that if the excessive heat was the cause of the death as suggested, then there should have been many other casualties. He said it was doubtful the excessive heat caused the deaths.
He said reasons that caused the deaths were not found yet and a definite reason be determined only after investigating all possibilities. He said the event management company is a reputed and registered company. We have not detected anything illegal or suspicious so far and we have to wait until all the investigations are complete, SP Gunasekara said.

Why you should never pat a dog on the head
Most of us find it quite hard to resist going for a little stroke or a belly rub when we meet an adorable dog.
It might be a tiny little pug or a playful Labrador, but there is something about them which just makes us want to go over and say hello. And for many people the automatic reaction is to give the dog a pat on the head - but it turns out this is actually very rude in dog language.
Sarah Bartlett, qualified international dog training instructor, has shed some light on why you shouldn't pat a dog on the head. With a little help from her miniature dachshund Moss (which you can watch in full in the video above), she explains: "The wrong way to approach a dog is to walk up to them head on and just lean straight over them and go down and [stroke them].
"That for a dog is quite threatening. Moss says I'm not quite sure about this, his head goes quite low. Dogs don't like you going over their head. It's quite a threatening gesture for them, as is going straight forward into them." But don't worry, she's not telling you to avoid those lovely doggies and has explained what to do instead.
Sarah, who runs Hound Helpers Ltd , says, "The best thing is to approach them from the side and then go down. Keep your own bubble and their bubble, and it's then the dog's choice whether then encroach into your bubble. I'm crouched down sideways and all I'm going to do is offer my hand out."
If the dog sniffs your hand, you should then give them a little scratch under the chin or the ear.
Great news! But according to Sarah patting a dog on the head isn't the only thing we need to be careful about. She says, "Another thing to think about is if a dog rolls onto their back and shows their belly, we all love to give them a belly scratch. But what we all tend to do is maybe be a bit firm with it, but for most dogs this is too much. Just be very gentle. Slow, steady, very light pressure strokes. Dogs enjoy that a lot more than the tickle we all tend to do, and they're likely to do a lot more."

Wimals corruption case fixed for November 2
A corruption case filed against former Minister and National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa was yesterday fixed for November 2 by the Colombo High Court.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order regarding an indictment filed against Wimal Weerawansa for the alleged unlawful acquisition of money and assets, estimated at Rs.75 million within a period of six years while serving as a Minister, during the former regime.
Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for the accused sought a long date to present their stance regarding the computer evidence of the case. This case will be taken up on the next date as a calling date.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014. The indictments were filed under 39 incidents based on monitory and property transactions estimated at Rs.75 million.
The Director General alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully made 26 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased lands and vehicles in contravention of section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commissions Director General further alleged that former Minister Weerawansa had owned these properties-deemed under the provision of the Act to be property acquired through bribery.

Maharagama upgrade still on
Twenty large-scale development projects, 206 small-scale development projects and 1,500 mini development projects will be undertaken by the Megapolis Ministry, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
The minister was speaking at the launch of the Boralesgamuwa Wewa development project yesterday. The project costs Rs. 321 million and is being coordinated by Maharagama Urban Councillor Dhanushka Ramanayake. The Land Reclamation and Development Authority and the Irrigation Department will implement the project which includes a jogging track, 2.4km-long granite wall around the tank and street lamps.
Minister Ranawaka said that initially the tank was cleaned. The rest of the project will be completed in the next one-and-a-half years. Some people thought that development in Maharagama would come to an end. But the truth is that we will implement all the projects. We have already commenced the construction of the Nawinna bus stand and car park. The construction of the Kottawa bus stand and Nawinna - Kottawa commercial centre will also begin this year.
The minister said the Megapolis Ministry has commenced all the projects that it took over. If the Colombo Port City project continued without an environment assessment certificate and if ownership of land was given to foreigners as the previous regime decided on, it would have been a threat to Colombo.
It is pointless to place flowerpots along the roads in Colombo. We need to repair the 160-year-old sewage system in the city, Minister Ranawaka said. During the previous regime, the sewage pipes in Colombo were diverted to the Beira Lake. Now we have to clean the lake.
He also said that the cleaning of the Beira Lake would be a priority project. We have been able to evacuate the slums around the lake without forcible eviction and also without sending white vans.
The minister said that the Urban Development Authority was in a debt trap of Rs. 39,000 million by 2015. However, by end 2017, the UDA could save Rs 23,000 million. This amount would be invested in the development of Battaramulla administrative city, to provide housing units for the shanty dwellers.
He also added that the monorail project would begin next year.

He was removed from his position on March 2 by Governor K. C. Logeswaran, on the recommendations of the Presidential Commission, appointed to probe into the Meethotumulla tragedy.
The decision was taken by the Governor after receiving instructions from President Maithripala Sirisena to take appropriate action according to the report which was submitted by the Presidential Commission headed by Justice Dr. Chandradasa Nanayakkara.
President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the one-member committee on April 26, 2017 to investigate into the garbage collapse in Meethotumulla which occurred on April 14, 2017. The report revealed that the tragedy was the result of the Colombo Municipality having failed to carry out a proper method of garbage disposal and by failing to implement the recommendations in this regard.

The Knowledge Sharing Program (KSP) on policy consultation, supported by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) to set up a master plan for the establishment of an advanced automated taxation system for the Colombo municipality, was successfully carried out from February to July. The final dissemination seminar was held on July 26 in Colombo with the participation of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) officials, including Deputy Municipal Commissioner Thamara Mallawarachchi, according to a press release from the Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka. Colombo is the economic centre of the country experiencing rapid urbanization and land development, resulting in higher tax rates imposed on land and buildings which account for 28 percent of the CMC total budget. However, due to the existing manual taxing method, the CMC is facing serious challenges such as uncertain data on taxable property, missing to charge tax, inefficient administrative procedures, etc.
Considering this need to build a strong tax information system, especially for the Colombo city which generates a considerably high amount of tax, this consulting program produced policy recommendations and a framework to promote the development of the future CMC tax administration system by capitalizing on the experience of establishing the advanced tax information system in Seoul, South Korea, the release stated.

Bangladesh seal T20 series with 19-run victory over Windies
LAUDERHILL, Monday: Bangladesh withstood a withering assault from Andre Russell to complete a series-clinching 19-run victory on the DLS Method over the West Indies in the rain-affected deciding final fixture of their three-match T20 International Series on Sunday.
Russell smashed 47 off just 21 deliveries with six towering sixes and one four to keep the Caribbean side in with a chance of surpassing Bangladesh's formidable total of 184 for five at Central Broward Stadium.
However his dismissal at the start of the 18th over, giving left-arm seamer Mustafizur Rahman his third wicket of the innings, effectively sealed the result in favour of Bangladesh.
Russell's departure at 135 for seven off 17.1 overs was immediately followed by a sharp shower which ended any further prospect of play although there was little chance of the West Indies getting anywhere close to the target off a full 20 overs with all their big-hitters gone.
Having been thrashed in both Tests at the start of the tour, this T20 series triumph follows on the 2-1 success in the One-Day International contest for the Asian side.
Their formidable total was set up by a career-best effort from Liton Das.
Das set the tone at the top of the order for his team after captain Shakib al Hasan chose to bat first with a blistering innings of 61 off just 32 balls with six fours and three sixes.
He earned the Man of the Match award and stole the show from his more experienced and prolific opening partner, Tamim Iqbal, in an opening stand of 61 off just 4.4 overs.
Along the way the pair registered the fastest-ever fifty by Bangladesh in T20 International cricket off only 21 deliveries as they tore into the spin of Samuel Badree and Ashley Nurse before also putting the pace of Russell to the sword.
It took the introduction of captain Carlos Brathwaite to engineer the breakthrough when he had Tamim caught at short fine-leg for 21 while Keemo Paul removed Soumya Sarkar cheaply for the second consecutive match to pull the West Indies back into contention. Brathwaite also accounted for Mushfiqur Rahim while Kesrick Williams ended the rampaging knock of Liton as the Bangladesh innings stuttered when it seemed a total in excess of 200 was assured.
However an unbeaten 32 from Mahmudullah and an unbroken 38-run sixth-wicket stand with Ariful Haque ensured that Bangladesh got up to a competitive total.
West Indies replaced out-of-form opener Evin Lewis with the hard-hitting Chadwick Walton at the top of the order in their only change for this match but it failed to have the desired effect. Walton and opening partner Andre Fletcher fell cheaply, as did the experienced Marlon Samuels, who was bowled by a shooter from Shakib.
This was a tremendous team effort and will give us a lot of confidence moving forward, said a delighted Shakib, who was named Man of the Series. Now we need to build on this performance, in both the ODI's and T20's, when we return home to be more consistent and competitive against the big teams. Wicketkeeper-batsman Denesh Ramdin put on 45 runs for the fourth wicket with all-rounder Rovman Powell but it was the arrival of Russell at the fall of Ramdin's wicket which revived a flagging West Indies.
He threatened to win the match off his own bat even with wickets continuing to fall around him but a miscued straight hit off a Mustafizur full-toss resulted in the catch at long-off by Ariful and the subsequent Bangladeshi celebrations.
I didn't think it was our smartest batting effort, said Brathwaite in assessing his team's performance in the run-chase. Our bowlers pulled it back very well when it looked as if they would have gotten to 220 but we just couldn't execute with the bat as a team when it mattered. - AFP

Bouncing baby buckaroos in rip-roaring rodeo fun!
In the late 1950s, when us Ole Timers were somewhat younger, we frequented the matinees at the local cinemas. We pint-sized rapscallions had the privilege being allowed in at half rates  meaning 50 cents in the Rs. 1.10 seating area.
At the matinees we watched all of those Cowboy Heroes who helped form our childhood ideals of the Code of the American West. What great screen legends they were. And my, what flashy outfits they wore! On screen they rarely missed a shot from the hip and they were faster with a six gun than the meanest gunslinger.
My fascination for the Wild and Woolly West goes back a long way to when I was knee-high to my grandfather and living in his suburban country estate. In proximity to the expansive home was the placid Bolgoda Lake and various intriguing channels that fed the surrounding paddy cultivations.
There were happy cries of children intermingled with the rhythm of frolic in a sprawling plantation. The rapture of little boys in those bucolic surroundings is easy to understand. To us it was a complete and sheer fantasy world where we played and gamboled to our hearts content.
During the vacations, when my brothers and numerous cousins would visit we would organise all kinds of outlandish games. We were all attracted by the mystique of the cowboy. So we played Giddy up Cowboy a game celebrating the rodeo! To get in on all the hoof-stomping, mud-slinging fun was easy. Well we had the space and the livestock was always there grazing in the vast plantation. So all we had to do was corral the calves in a large outdoor pen and prepare for the fun.
And we werent spectators viewing it from the comfort of a chair, mind you. We were rough-riding participants enjoying the action bareback on the back of a calf. Yes bareback, saddle-less, bridle-less with only a coir rope around its neck. Its all fun and games until you are bucked off. And then you find youre skidding on your backside across the gravel driveway or the grassy meadow.
Believe me I tried it as a kid and its just not any load of bull. They may only have been calves but they sure did make a bum steer of most of us. And darn Sir Isaac Newton and his gravity tree when you found yourself plunged neck deep in some herbaceous border.
Calves, like the boys who dream of riding them, are unpredictable creatures. They can start out shy and skittish then suddenly turn cantankerous. There was this rebellious young bull named Percy. His father was a monstrous one-eyed brute we christened Cyclops. Percy was far bigger than the other calves and was the most fearsome of the herd. In essence, he was a true blue maverick with a black heart.
He was an independent bovine and did not tolerate a gang of young bucks attempting to make a spectacle of him for their ridiculous rodeo performances. We admired him for his free spirit but he could act revengefully cranky when rounded up with the rest of the calves.
No one had managed to stay on his back for more than three seconds. And as I said he had a horribly mean disposition. Oh, yes, with Percy in the fray it was a violent sport alright. The city boys might have crashed on their pushbikes and thought it an adventure for life. But there is one big difference here. If you fall off your bike, its not going to chase after you with murderous intent. But Percy would and did with his nostrils breathing fire and his cloven hooves ready to stomp you.
The last time I had ridden Percy and was bucked off in two seconds I lay completely winded. Frozen, I held my breath for what seemed like ages. I knew that son of a Cyclops was scanning the meadow for me. His horns were just beginning to form and he tried to gore me. I kicked him in the snout. He moved sideways and kicked back. Some sidekick he proved to be!
It certainly wasnt a sport for the faint-hearted, but we were cowboys through and through. Yes, through bumps, through bruises and through bashed bodies. But it was the bravado, the adrenaline rush and the atmosphere that kept us constantly coming back for more. It was not a question of whether or not you were going to get hurt. It was when and how badly.
With Percy it was a case of a 40, or 60 pound child versus 200 pounds of raging bull-calf, capable of twirling and tossing riders through the air like a paper plane. A little blood, we knew, came with the territory. We knew it was dangerous and fortunately there were no serious injuries to any of the competitors. We thought there was more fun and glory in it than injuries.
Still no one wanted to ride the formidable Percy until that fateful day when a five-year-old cousin Errol volunteered. The previous experience he had had was on his nursery rocking horse. But here the rocking bull calf was very real.
Our little cousin stepped forward confidently saying: I can do that. I can ride him! We all yelled at him in chorus: No you cant! Youll get yourself killed if you try and ride that monster. Errol didnt listen. He climbed on the crude paddock fence, leapt smartly onto the bullocks back and yelled: Watch this! Open the gate! The young bull froze for a moment then thrashed wildly, up and down, from side to side, around in circles but still a grim-faced Errol clung to its neck rope.
After ten seconds which seemed like an eternity Percy was bucking almost vertically and spinning until the child was just a blur. He leaped up and spun around, bucked forward and kicked back, his legs so high behind him that he almost flipped end over end.
Errol clung on for twenty seconds more until the bucking bull slowed down. He then casually dismounted smartly while Percy broke loose and took off as if a little devil from Hades was after him. Errol had created a record that would go into the annals of family history. Acknowledging the cheers of his kinsfolk and with an airy wave of his little hand Errol moved away.
We surrounded the bouncing baby buckeroo and asked: Where in tarnation did you learn to ride a bucking bull like that He eyed us for a moment before explaining: Remember three months ago when I had whooping cough Every time I rode my rocking horse I could never stop!

Breathtaking bridge in Vietnam
A bridge outside Da Nang in Vietnam is wowing visitors with its elegant design  seemingly being held aloft by two giant stone hands.
Known as the Golden Bridge, it stands 1,400m above sea level above the Ba Na hills, offering majestic views of the surrounding countryside. The gold-colored walkway is lined with purple Lobelia Chrysanthemums and extends for almost 150 metres, curving around in an elegant design. But it is the sculpted hands that give it the true wow factor.
The design for the bridge came from a company called TA Landscape Architecture, and while the hands look like they are carved from stone, they are actually not.
We designed the skeleton of the hands and covered them with steel meshes, a representative of the company told Bored Panda.
Then we finished with fiberglass and added the theming on it. The entire construction of the bridge took about a year. Vietnam has experienced a tourism boom as more and more people discover the beauty of this remarkable country, the structure is part of a $2 billion investment to bring even more than the 1.5 million visitors the area receives annually.

Cabinet has not received any proposal on MPs salary hike- PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday affirmed that the Cabinet of Ministers has neither received any proposal for a salary hike of Parliamentarians nor has he received such a proposal.
The Prime Minister was addressing the UNP Parliamentary Group at Temple Trees yesterday.
The Prime Minister added that a request had been made at the Party Leaders Meeting several months ago to take appropriate action citing that office expenses of Parliamentarians have increased .
The Prime Minister at this point had informed that a decision can be made with regard to their request after consulting the Treasury if a fair proposal is made. However, no proposal was made with regard to this issue though the party leaders met on several occasions after that.
He said UNP Parliamentary Group requested him to make a statement on the media reports on the Parliamentarians salary hike.
Premier Wickremesinghe insisted that no proposal on the Parliamentarians salary hike was made to him or to the Cabinet.
Only the newspapers have carried the news item that the salaries of Parliamentarians will be increased, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said he inquired from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya whether any proposal for a salary hike of Parliamentarians had been made to Parliament.
The Speaker told me that the Party Leaders had discussed this issue but no final decision has been made with regard to salary hike of MPs.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he cannot make any statement over the salary hike of Parliamentarians merely on newspaper reports.
I can make a statement if a formal proposal has been made over it, the Premier Said.

Cable car service wont be at Sirigiriya
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday said he, as the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka National Commission for UNESCO, will not allow any activity that damage Sigiriya.
The Minister said that no permission was granted for a cable car project at Sigiriya.
He said several media reported a proposal to start a cable car project with the permission of the Central Cultural Fund officials. He said the Central Cultural Fund and the Archeological Department were under him and the project would damage the status of the world heritage site of Sigiriya.
Now the Central Cultural Fund and the Archeological Department are vested with Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Any proposal for a cable car project would come under the Minister and he will look into the report that a Chinese company has conducted a feasibility study for cable car project at Sigiriya. He will defiantly reveal the truth about the incident later.
Minister Kariyawasam said that some elements are trying to use this incident to create a conflict between him and Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. They try to show that the government is conspiring to destroy the world heritage sites.
I categorically condemn this kind of dirty politics and media manipulation. The government is committed to protect world heritages sites and will not allow anyone to destroy them, the Minister said.
Today we have to face adverse consequences of the illegal and haphazard constructions built during the Rajapaksa regime to gain political mileages, he said.
