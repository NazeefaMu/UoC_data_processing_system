Certain media institutions  playing to a political agenda
The peoples real issues and information that matter to them have got sidelined as many media organisations are immersed in a political agenda, Home Affairs Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathuwala said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, the Deputy Minister complained that there is a chasm between what the media reports and the ground reality in the country. He pointed out that certain media institutions have deliberately forgotten their social responsibility in their attempt to cater to the political agenda of the Joint Opposition(JO).
There was a lot of media hype over the JOs recent protest in Colombo, but it was the most unsuccessful protest by an opposition party in recent times.
There was a huge publicity stunt prior to the protest, spending millions of rupees, but it proved to be a flop. Consequently, the allegation that the UNP was behind distributing contaminated milk packets to the protesters was given huge media publicity, but that too was proven false. Then the media recently highlighted a news story which said that a drought-stricken family in Anuradhapura was surviving on drumstick (Murunga) leaves for days. This was again found to be untrue. This type of media behavior raises concerns on media ethics, Alawathuwala explained.
The Deputy Minister pointed out that the fake news of Murunga leaves was planted by certain media organisations with the vicious intention of creating a bad impression that the people starve to death under the incumbent Yahapalanaya Government.
Some media organisations allocate about 75 percent of their air time to news that favours the JO. Because of this type of media behavior, people hardly get to know about things that really matter to them. For example, our Ministry recently provided the facility for any person living in any part of the country to obtain the birth, death and marriage certificates within five minutes. This news matters to the peoples lives, but, no media gave prominence to it. Similarly, the good initiatives of the Government such as the Suraksha Insurance Scheme and Enterprise Sri Lanka programme did not get the due media publicity, the Deputy Minister noted.
We are not asking the media to and publish the news that only favours the Government, but report the peoples real issues and the initiatives taken to move the country forward.
"When that does not happen, we together with the public have the right to ask questions about unbiased reporting, he remarked. He also accused the media of trying to give the false impression that the UNP was behind the alleged plot to assassinate the President. The CID is conducting a thorough investigation into it. We, in the UNP, brought President Maithripala Sirisena to power and we are committed to protect him, Alawathuwala commented.

## Title: New visa process to Qatar

New visa process to Qatar
Government of Qatar will soon be simplifying the migrant work visa application process that will expedite the visa processing for the Sri Lankan migrant worker. This service which will first be introduced in Sri Lanka and then rolled out in other key South Asian cities will be made available through Qatar Visa Centers, which is directly supervised by the Qatar concerned authorities and managed by Biomet Visa Services Lanka, a subsidiary of Biomet Services PTE. LTD, a service provider authorized by the State of Qatar.
The new visa process will be transformative for aspiring migrant workers. Henceforth, once the initial visa approval is issued by Qatar authorities, migrant workers can complete the medical test and biometric enrolment requirements within their country of origin within a shorter period. The old visa process in Qatar requires medical testing, done at accredited laboratories plus a host of other requirements that could take sometimes weeks to get completed.
According to reports, the Sri Lankan worker remittance in Qatar accounts for US $ 400-500 million, out of $ 7.16 billion worker remittance was recorded in 2017. Also Sri Lankas remittance earnings from Qatar will likely double over next few years, statistics show.
This means that local aspiring employees will enter Qatar in many numbers. To quantify, the number of Sri Lankan migrant workers in Qatar is expected to reach 300,000, from the current 140,000, in the next couple of years.
The Sri Lankan and Qatar governments have identified many areas for collaboration between the two countries which will also see more growth in employment and remittances.
Qatar, as usual has set the trend for cutting-edge visa processing and biometric enrollment solutions, providing a clear, simple and effective solution to enter the State. The convenience that biometrics can bring to this ecosystem is unprecedented, said Suhail Shaikh, Business Head, Biomet Services.
Medical tests, a key component of the visa procedure that was conducted after the migrant worker reached Qatar will be available in-house at the Qatar Visa Center as part of the visa application processing and biometric enrollment regime. Some of the key medical tests that are provided include essential medical check-up, various types of blood tests & x-ray and administration of vaccinations as required by Ministry of Public Health, Qatar. State-of-the-art healthcare facilities and equipment will be deployed, authorized by Qatar government and certified by local healthcare authorities, backed by a team of highly qualified healthcare professionals with internal systems and processes based on the latest medical standards and best practices.
Efficient recruiting is a critical part of a successful company since hiring the wrong person may cost plenty of money and time. Hence, improving recruitment process could benefit the employment process, cut off exploitative practices and help establish a more transparent and accountable procedure.

Railway technicians clarify:
Nothing against youth who assisted repair
Sri Lanka Railway Technical Trade Union said yesterday that they have nothing against the youth who had assisted in the repair of the Colombo-bound express train from Jaffna which stalled in Mahagalkadawala, Galgamuwa, recently.
Although there were reports on several websites that Railway technical officers were against the action of the youth Janith Dimantha, there is no truth in such allegations, Sri Lanka Railway Technical Trade Union Secretary B.S. Kamal Peiris said.
We appreciate the youths action at a time when passengers and Railway workers were facing inconvenience, he said.
Generally, when a technical fault occurs, Railway technicians undertake the repair, but the assistant technician was absent on this occasion. Under the normal Railway law, outsiders cannot assist the repair of a trains engine or compartments.
If something goes wrong during the repair by an outsider, the relevant technicians have to take the responsibility ultimately and not the outsider, Peiris said.
Meanwhile, Railways General Manager Dilantha Fernando said that he has not received any letter of protest from any Railway union in this regard. However, an independent inquiry is being held by the Railway authority on the Galgamuwa incident, he said.

Political parties meeting  will decide on PC Elections
An agreement on the Provincial Council Elections will be reached after meeting all political parties, Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said the Cabinet has approved the proposal by the Prime Minister to hold a meeting of all political parties to come into an agreement on the PC Elections.
A five-member committee headed by the Prime Minister was appointed to review the delimitation report and submit a report to the President in two months, the Minister said.
Parliament cannot give it additional two months without changing the laws, he said.
There is no need to ask for two more months to submit the report since eight weeks is sufficient for the purpose, he said.
Minister Samarasinghe said the need to introduce a mixed electoral system was officially made known in the policy statements of the President and the United National Party (UNP).
The LG election can be held under the new mixed electoral system - the Proportional Representation System and the First Past the Post System, he said.
The new electoral system was the foremost requirement of the SLFP for them to support the 19th Amendment, he said.
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Council also proposed to hold the General Election under a mixed electoral system, the Minister said.
Since the government decided to hold the Provincial Councils Election under the mixed electoral system. Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha appointed a delimitation committee and its report was defeated in Parliament.
Several groups wanted to hold the LG elections under the old system only for this time. The idea of a new electoral system came to fore after the shortcomings of the previous system were identified, the Minister said.
The SLFP never say to postpone the PC Elections. They could be held in January, he said.
Six PC elections could be held without delay. The SLFP has made a policy decision to hold PC elections under the new system, he said.

Amazon raises minimum wage to US$ 15
Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it would raise its minimum wage to US$15 per hour for U.S. employees from next month, giving in to critics of poor pay and working conditions at the worlds second most valuable company.
The increase pushes Amazons lowest wage above that at Walmart Inc and Target Corp. It is almost US$3 shy of the average for a non-management worker in warehousing in the United States.
The online retailer also said it would now lobby in Washington D.C. for an increase in the federal minimum wage and urged its competitors to follow its lead as the union-led Fight for Fifteen movement pushes for higher remuneration.
Amazons move comes when U.S. unemployment is at a near two-decade low as retailers and shippers compete for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season. Several companies, including United Parcel Service and Macys, have announced hiring to staff stores and handle holiday sales and delivery.
We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead, founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement.
The pay increase, effective from next month, will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees in the United States as well as over 100,000 seasonal employees who will be hired across the country this holiday season, the company said. Christine Owens, executive director at advocacy group National Employment Law Project, said Amazons call for changes at the federal level was a significant move.

Ambassador to Qatar carries Rajapaksa sons bags
Sri Lankas Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage was seen welcoming Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Rohitha Rajapaksa, the two sons of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when they arrived in the country this morning.
The gesture is not in line with any diplomatic protocol as the Rajapaksa sons do not hold any positions in the government. Liyanage was seen welcoming them and carrying their bags when the CH Rugby team arrived in Qatar for a match. While Ambassador A.S.P. Liyanage was seen carrying Rohitha Rajapaksas bag, Sri Lanka Embassy official and Minister Rajitha Senaratnas close associate Ruwan Dananasooriya was pictured pushing a trolley containing Yoshitha Rajapaksas bags.
The Ambassador drove them to Mercure Grande Hotel where they were staying. They were Chauffer driven Ambassador in front seat with two sons at the back. Liyanage, a billionaire businessman, claims to be a close friend of the Rajapaksa family. After the former President fell out of power in January 2015, he even offered his Colombo house, the Peacock Mansion, to the Rajapaksa family.
Despite his questionable links with the Rajapaksa family, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed him as the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar raising many an eyebrow.
Liyanages appointment recently came under fire in Parliament with some Parliamentarians calling him a mad man who was ruining Sri Lankas image overseas.
UNP Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana slammed Liyanage for getting involved in the operations of the Stafford Sri Lankan School in Doha, without discharging the duties of his diplomatic posting.

To Beliatta by train, a reality in 2019
With the commencement of the tamping of the Southern Railway extension from Matara to Beliatta recently, travelling to Beliatta by train will become a reality.
The Railway extension to Beliatta is expected to be opened early next year. China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) is the main contractor for Phase One of the Southern Railway extension project.
Tamping the ballast under the railway line to make it more durable and correct the alignment of the rails is the final phase of the railway construction process. Test runs could be done only after the track is tamped twice. Before the introduction of mechanical tamping machines or ballast tampers, the task was done manually. Commencement of tamping was held up for a while as the machine owned by the Sri Lanka Railway was being repaired.
The 26.75km railway extension from Matara to Beliatta is the first phase of the proposed Matara  Kataragama Railway extension and has cost the government more than US$ 278 million.
Phase Two will extend the Railway line from Beliatta to Hambantota which will be beneficial to the Hambantota Port and the proposed Industrial Promotion Zone.
In the third phase, the railway line would be extended from Hambantota to Kataragama, enabling the public to travel to the sacred city by train.

Eight petitions fixed for support
Eight Fundamental Rights petitions which were filed seeking interim relief staying or suspending the implementation of the Sri LankaSingapore Free Trade Agreement signed on January 23,2018 were yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court.

These petitions had been filed by Secretary of Mawbima Lanka Padanama, Kapila Gamage and seven others naming Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama, Secretary to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade Chandanie Wijayawardhana and cabinet of Ministers as respondents.
In his petition, Attorney-at-Law Kapila Gamage alleged that Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) was neither considered nor approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and therefore, no force or effect in law.
He further alleged that the SLSFTA was not disclosed to the Public, in spite of several requests made by the interested parties, including professional activists.
The petitioner stated that the State would be placed in danger of weakening its authority to maintain control over the economy and security and thereby to protect the economic and other rights of the domestic individuals, entities and industries when liberalizing trading and access to domestic market though Free Trade Agreements with States having strong economies and legal framework.
The Petitioner states that the SLSFTA shall have a direct and adverse impact on the Public Finance of Sri Lanka and therefore requires the prior sanction and approval of the Parliament pertaining to the scope and mandate of negotiations, signing and implementation of the SLSFTA. However, in the absence of such approval the SLSFTA is lacking of constitutional mandate and therefore illegal and null and void.
The petitioner maintained that the executive actions relating to the commencement of negotiations, signing and implementation of SLSFTA shall violate Articles 148 and 157 of the Constitution and also amounting to alienation of the Legislative powers of the Parliament.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva, Ali Sabry PC, Sanjeewa JAyawardane with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners.

Former President should worship PM  for saving him from electric chair: Thalatha
Expenditure on fan fare projects that had not brought any financial dividends by the previous regime, created a financial crisis in the country, said Justice and Prison reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorala.
She made this observations, while addressing a meeting at Embilipitiya, following the inauguration of the Embilipitiya Padanangala mammoth water supply project. 
She also said that the previous regime had set up a sea port without ships and an air port without planes, but never concentrated on providing water, the most essential commodity to the people.
"The Buddha Sasana was protected for the past 2,500 years due to the efforts of the Maha Sangha as such our interference is not essential," the Minister said.
"If the necessity arises, we would intervene," she said. She also said that there is an allegation that our heroic soldiers are meted out step motherly treatment by the present regime which is a baseless allegation. "Prior to attending to other duties, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, should have worshiped a picture of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for having saved him from the electric chair," Minister Atukorala said. 
The minister debunked speculations that the country's economy was collapsing and requested the citizens of the country not to panic, because the Central Bank could handle the country's current exchange rate and the debt situation.
A sum of Rs. 345 million has been allocated for the water supply project, while five hundred families would be benefit as a result.

Gamata Technology to Empower rural youth, promote entrepreneurs
Gamata Technology, an accelerator platform initiated by youth-tech entrepreneurs covering every corner of Sri Lanka is a nation-wide initiative is Co-Chaired by Dr. Ashan Perera, UN SDG Action Award Winner 2018, Youth Advocate, Social Entrepreneur and Founder of The Road to Rights Youth-Led Organization.
Gamata Tech is an independent national initiative collaborated with The Road to Rights Youth-led Organization and Mithuru Mithuro Movement supported by Bannercuts.com. The platform is aimed at supporting technology experts, youth entrepreneurs in rural areas who lack opportunities, within an entrepreneurial environment that encourages collaboration, fosters job creation and provides connections to local and International resources.
Gamata Technology will embark on October 14, 2018 at Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre with the presence of young entrepreneurs, leading tech companies, renowned personalities and Locals covering 19 Districts over Sri Lanka. The event will be a cultivated Dialogue on Digital Sri Lanka with the participation of erudite speakers of the industry as is targeted to attract over 1000 individuals from all parts of the country.
Dr. Ashan Perera, Co-chairperson of the Gamata Technology platform said, The main aim of Gamata Technology is to provide people with a comfortable platform to engage with the rapidly growing and changing technology landscape and helping communities to realize the value of what technology builds. We are working towards bringing the concept of Digitalization in Sri Lanka to higher standards and increasing the crowd accepting and engaging in this digitizing process. This will help the government in its way to digitalizing the public and other sectors.
Digitalization opens up new opportunities to influence and transform various fields in a country such as business models, organizational patterns, legal and policy measures, economical structures and most importantly cultural barriers.
Co-Chairperson, Dr. Ashan Perera said, But sadly, this has mostly been limited within the walls of urbanized and industrialized areas. Often citizens in rural areas are not reached with technology due to various difficulties they face in using technology. This has affected the development of the country as a whole because digitalization of the public sector cannot be fulfilled, as the common public is rather uncomfortable with it. But recently the private sector has focused on this issue and has acted upon changing this. They have introduced various services, which include the use of technology to fulfill ones day-to-day activities. This method has proved to be more efficient and helpful to its users.
On the positive light, the Sri Lankan market is very conducive to and very adaptive to new technology. With the revolution of Technology Sri Lankan technological system is starting to gear up with the ongoing tech World. With that eruption many youth from urban to rural have paved their way by using maximum of the modern technology. Gamata Technology will be a debut of such talented entrepreneurs who will showcase their knowledge and talent in technology at the forum.
The platform is projected to provide exposure and advancement to technology to rural areas, so that people can communicate effectively, overcome the limitations of time and space, empower themselves by providing information and knowledge, provide income generating and learning opportunities, increase transparency and efficiency and enable people to express their concerns and to actively participate in decision making processes. Its role is important for the development of economy in enhancing the effectiveness of market, productivity, competitiveness as well as creating better quality of life for the public.
The event is supported by Bannercuts.com as well as I.C.A.N Advertising; a grassroots initiative which has made an impact on lives of people in over 15 districts through tech-based platforms. I.C.A.N has been engaged in the technology and advertising industries for over three years and with a team of experts in this field for over six years.

LAUGFS Rubber recently marked the completion of a number of key initiatives as part of a company-wide project launched to enhance operational excellence by minimising the environmental impact. These initiatives are expected to minimise energy consumption and wastage at the LAUGFS Rubber factory in Horana.
In collaboration with LAUGFS Power, a grid-tied rooftop solar PV system was installed at the LAUGFS Rubber factory, generating 40% of power required for factory operations. It is expected to generate 490 MWh of clean energy to the national grid on an annual basis, while offsetting 350 MTs of CO2 emissions to the environment.

Dust collectors have been installed within the factory premises to remove contaminants, while strict noise limits are maintained when operating factory machinery to minimise noise pollution.
The rubber mixing, transportation and other production processes have also been assessed to identify and effectively address any environmental impacts. LAUGFS Rubber has also received the ISO 14001: 2015 certification for its environmental management system and processes.
The company has further received the ISO/TS 14067: 2012 Product Carbon Footprint certification, where the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been transparently calculated across the industrial solid tyre manufacturing process.

Leishmaniasis is caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. It appears in several forms. The most common forms are skin or cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and internal or visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually the spleen, liver, and bone marrow). It can cause ulcers in nose, mouth, or throat (which is known as mucosal leishmaniasis).

Minister hopeful of agreement with all parties on PC polls
We are hopeful that we would be able to come into an agreement on the Provincial Council Elections after the meeting of all political parties, Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing the media yesterday, the Minister said the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal submitted by the Prime Minister to hold a meeting of all political parties to come to an agreement on the Provincial Council Elections.
Responding to a question by a journalist about the governments response to the request by the five member committee headed by the Prime Minister, which was appointed to review the Delimitation Report, to give an additional two months period, for the preparation of the evaluation report, Minister Samarasinghe said that Parliament cannot give an additional two months without changing the laws.
But according to the law, a five member committee headed by the Prime Minister was appointed to review the Delimitation Report and submit the report to the President within two months.
There is no need to ask two more months to submit the report since a period of eight weeks is sufficient for this purpose, he added.
Responding to a statement by a Minister at the Cabinet Media Briefing claiming that apart from the SLFP, all other parties had expressed willingness to hold the next elections under the previous system, Minister Samarasinghe said the need of introducing a new mixed electoral system was officially introduced to the country for the first time though the policy statements of the President and the UNP.
So we would be able to hold the Local Government election under the new mixed electoral system consisting of the Proportional Representation system and the First-Past-the-Post System, he said.
The SLFP took the decision to extend its support to the 19th Amendment only after being promised that the 20th Amendment will be introduced for a new mixed electoral system. There were other reasons also. But the new electoral system was the most important requirement of the SLFP,the Minister said.
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Council also proposed to hold the General Election under a mixed electoral system.
Since the government decided to hold the Provincial Councils Election under the mixed electoral system and Local Government Minister Fizer Mustapha appointed a Delimitation Committee. But, the Report of the Delimitation Committee for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils was defeated in Parliament, Minister Samarasinghe said.
There is no argument with the new electoral system since it was introduced as a solution for the issues related to the previous electoral system. Some groups wanted to hold the local government election under the old system only for this time. It is a joke. The necessity of introducing a new electoral system rose after identifying the shortcomings of the previous system, he added.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party never proposes to postpone Provincial Council election. The Provincial Council election could be held in January.
The elections to six provincial councils could be held without any further postponement. The SLFP has taken a policy decision to hold Provincial Council Elections under the new system and we do not want to get any political advantage out of this.

Ministry clarifies reason  for students suspension
A place worship for students of all religious denominations has been established at the Vavuniya Campus affiliated to the Jaffna University, said the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry and the University Grants Commission, in a press release issued yesterday.
All students have been given freedom to observe the religion of their choice subject to university rules and regulations, the statement said. However, a minor group of students had made an attempt to build a Budu Medura opposite the student hostel by surreptitiously placing a mandapa (wooden structure) for placing a Buddha statue without the sanction of the Dean of the Faculty and Chief Administrative Officer, the release said.
When the Dean of the Faculty and the Administration pointed out to the students that they should use the common place earmarked for their religious observances, they had acted violently resorting to threats and other acts of indiscipline before the administrative authorities.
When such violence and acts of indiscipline take place, the Jaffna University Senate had the legal powers to take the final decision about university discipline relating to the Jaffna University and the Vavuniya campus. Therefore, this action had not placed any restriction on religious observances in the campus.
These students had been suspended from classes due to an act of indiscipline, in order to maintain university discipline in a transparent manner, the statement said.

NEC highlights need for long term policies
The need for a long term economic policy which will ease local businesses while facilitating exports in the backdrop of a rupee depreciation was discussed at the National Economic Council (NEC).
State and private sector stakeholders participated at the meeting. National Economic Council Secretary General and Chief Economist Prof. Lalith Samarakoon said views were expressed on the depreciation of the Rupee against the Dollar and mechanisms by the state and private sector in response to this.
It was discussed that if we used our foreign reserves to defend the rupee hastily, the country may run the risk of running out of funds to pay off debts in the next few years, he said. Many had agreed that the government needs to have a long term economic policy which protects and insulates the operation of local business along with both short to medium term objectives that gives imports an impetus.
Trade liberalisation of various sectors was cautioned as it would have a negative impact on local sectors.
If people do not support such initiatives, any effort to liberalise trade will be futile and it would collapse, he said.
He referred to the liberalisation of the shipping sector, where it was discussed that shipping agents bring in 800 million USD and if the sector was liberalised, this would be lost. Various stakeholders had discussed that investor confidence was dipping in the backdrop of corruption, instability and a struggling economy. Private sector stakeholders had mentioned that the taxes were too high and that the government should incentivise it if it was going to increase exports.
Others had said that the construction sector was collapsing because contracts were mostly handed to foreign companies and there is a need to prioritise local companies in these processes. The inefficiencies of the government in managing its resources were discussed as being another drawback, there was a widespread recognition that implementation across the board was weak.
Some argued that although the country had signed free trade agreements, it had not made significant trade between those nations that it entered into FTAs with, and neither was there any plan to promote this.
The upcoming budget will be key in solving structural problems, tax reforms, trade deficits, State-owned-enterprise reforms, clamp down on government expenditure, Samarakoon said.

POLICE DEFEND OICs ACTION
The Police defended the actions taken by the Thebuwana police Officer In Charge in releasing the lorry transporting sand and said that the said lorry had a valid permit for the transport of sand.
A lorry transporting sand had been taken into custody by the Sergeant on September 28. however, the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Thebuwana Police Station had released the lorry the following day, stating that the vehicle had a valid permit to transport sand.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara addressing a media conference in Colombo yesterday said the lorry had been taken into police custody around 4 am on October 4 and stood by the OIC claiming that his actions were justified.
The OIC had taken the advice of the ASP and based on his advice too he had taken measures to release the lorry carrying sand.
There is nothing wrong in the action taken by him to release the lorry having gone through the routine checks, SP Gunasekara said.
He said the sergeant had used his service weapon and shot into the air at the Thebuwana junction. Action to be taken against him would be done based on the provisions of the Establishment Code. He was produced in court and was later interdicted.
When asked by a journalist if this indicates the mental pressure that the lower ranked Police officers were under, the Police Spokesman said that there is no way that a police officer could be allowed to act in this manner, even if he is under pressure. An officer, who is on official duty serving the people, cannot act in this manner under any circumstance. His behaviour cannot be condoned or accepted. This sergeant is now in remand custody and measures have been taken to call for a mental assessment of this sergeant as well, he added.
He was arrested on the charges of behaving in an unruly manner in a public place using a weapon.
The Sergeant had claimed that he had notified the OIC several times but that he had not paid attention. However, the Police Spokesman said an investigation was launched and as the lorry had a valid permit to transport sand, it was released as there was no grounds to take it into custody.

70th World Maritime Day
Port of Colombo achieves global standards on safe Maritime, Trade and Shipping
It is a delightful fact. The passing of several milestones by overcoming various challenges throughout her rich history, the Port of Colombo has achieved the global standards on safe Maritime Trade and Shipping Industry. No doubt, this immense contribution to the Maritime Trade is enriching the nation. It is remarkable and astonishing.
As we have featured here in this issue the first half of the year, the Port of Colombo has recorded the highest container growth Port in the World. This courteous achievement is the result of the collective commitment by all human resources supporting the Port of Colombo utilized and managed through unparalleled professional skills of the current Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority as well as the governing political leadership on the subject in the country.
At the same time, globally, we celebrated the seventieth World Maritime Day on September 27 under the theme of our heritage  better shipping for a better future. Objective of this years day, we as a common community are focusing internationally on, an opportunity to take stock and look back, but also to look forward, addressing the current and future challenges for maritime transport to maintain a continued and strengthened contribution towards sustainable growth for all.
Issuing a statement for World Maritime Day, International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Secretary General Kitack Lim observed and predicted that IMOs heritage over 70 years has been to drive improvements in shipping to achieve a better world today. Our challenge for the years to come remains to work in collaboration with all stakeholders to create better shipping for a better future.
What we have learned from history is that the safe maritime trade is all about genuine collaboration and collective efforts in achieving desired goals together. It is all about committed teamwork.
It is needless to explain as Sri Lankans, the importance of maritime and the potentialities we as the centralized nation within the mainstream maritime routes have earned. Being geographically an important strategic location and also the safest from all sorts of threats including weather condition and natural uncertainties, Sri Lanka and her juridical sea area is nuclear to safe maritime trade.
Today, the Port of Colombo is witnessing the genuine path to prosperity of the nation and the paving of the way to understanding the importance of overcoming challenges prevailing due to the high waves of the seas.
As Aristotle Onassis known as Ari, one of the best-known shipping magnates, once said, We must free ourselves of the hope that the sea will ever rest. We must learn to sail in high winds. We believe that the secret behind the achievements that the Port of Colombo gained is because of her genuine commitment in learning and professional capacity in implementing the strategies to sail in high winds for the benefits of the people in the country.
As a country that overcame from one of the most deadly civil wars on the planet, Sri Lanka has stepped forward and is proving the potentiality as the nation in developing and achieving goals aimed towards enriching the general public.
No one can deny that the maritime trade as the lifeline of the nation is playing a pivotal role. Hence, the Port of Colombo as the central port in the island is substantiating the unprecedented caliber in safe maritime trade while deepening confidence in the stakeholders.
The present management of Port of Colombo has affirmed by action the importance of collective collaboration while placing the professional virtue in all concerned, to stand on common ground confidently. This import step has cleared the dark clouds in the sky to make visible the stars of hope in maritime trade in Sri Lanka.
Recently all three Container Terminals, Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT), and Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT), operating in the Port of Colombo committed themselves to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to act together to aggrandize the common goal towards a vibrant future.
In his remarks about the event, Dr Dissanayake, Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority said that, this is like a shipping alliance. We will compete with each other; but we will also cooperate with each other in order to ensure a better service for clients. So this is moving from competition to co-competition.
Despite all the challenges and the growing competition of the region, the Port of Colombo would be able to achieve historic volumes, he said. As the chairperson correctly predicted, the Port of Colombo is witnessing the growth of container handling by the terminals in the Port while shining in the maritime trade.
Meanwhile, steps have been taken by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in adopting the anti-corruption and zero-tolerance policy aimed at cleaning up the trade. The meeting was co-chaired by SLPA Chairperson Dr Dissanayake and Director General of Sri Lanka Customs P. S. M. Charles, focused on issues like the anti-corruption and zero tolerance policy and detained containers, introducing a digital signature and electronic delivery order system.
One single step towards vanquishing the bad practices that are tarnishing the reputation of public institutions is not only revolutionary but also the registers a memorable contribution as a lesson to be learnt by generations to come.
Apparently, there is a long route to sail. The prevailing challenges are immense. As an American Author John Shedd penned in his work titled, Salt from My Attic, a ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.
The head of IMO said, challenges in major aspects of international shipping, including ship design, construction, equipment, crewing, navigation, operation, and disposal are adverse in current situation. Challenges prevailing in these areas have to be addressed adequately to be overcome through collective commitment.
Moral and ethical responsibilities for healthy shipping and Maritime Trade are vested upon every stakeholder from a fisherman who is fishing in the Palk Strait or elsewhere to shipping agent who is the driving force behind the loading and unloading, not millions but billions of containers. So then every nation bounded by Maritime Trade shall not only engage in healthy and environmental protective Shipping and Maritime Trade but also be the core partner of protecting and promoting each others heritage. The Port of Colombo is booming while maintaining these notions to enrich not only the nation but also Maritime Trade as the most important subject on the planet.
Lets protect and promote our heritage while engaging in better shipping for a better future for all humanity.

A strategy to complete the process of absorbing SAITM students to the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) will be in place soon concurrent to the KDU Act passed in Parliament recently.
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) media spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the GMOA Executive Committee met President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the latest developments of the SAITM issue and this decision was taken during the meeting. Higher Education Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, Presidents Secretary and KDU high officials were present at the discussion.
Dr. Ananda said the Supreme Court judgement given recently in connection with SAITM clearly states that it can be solved according to the KDU Act passed in Parliament.Therefore there is no conflict whatsoever between the KDU Act and the Supreme Court judgement given, he said.
The Parents Union of the State Medical Students Wasantha Alwis said media reports published on SAITM students demanding Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) registration was inaccurate because only a very few SAITM students out of the 83 had gone to the SLMC to check whether they can obtain registration according to the judgement which is now not relevant at all because of the implementation of the KDU Act.
