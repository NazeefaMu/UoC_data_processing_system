SL geared to upgrade intellectual property regimes
Sri Lanka is committed to upgrade intellectual property regimes to move beyond traditional domains of copy rights and patents,Sri Lankas Permanent Representative in Geneva, Ravinath Aryasinha said.
It will particularly foray into new areas such as innovation and branding to bring it in line with international standards,he said speaking at a seminar on protection of Intellectual Property Rights of traditional knowledge and cultural expressions in association with G-15 country grouping and WIPO.
Under the ten point action plan of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Sri Lanka Cooperation launched following the visit of Dr. Gurry, Sri Lanka has focused on making its own stakeholders aware of unique IP rights associated with traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and enhancing expertise on international dimensions associated with these rights.
Commenting on G-15 country grouping, Aryasinha noted that during Sri Lankas chairmanship, the group has made strategic re-orientation while the group continues to articulate the common positions of mutual interests at important global forums.The G15 has evolved into an organization that is also striving to achieve greater South-South cooperation and building capacity among its members.
As a grouping of developing countries, G-15 has also witnessed many changes in the global sphere.In this regard,the group has identified intellectual property as one of four areas of focus in 2013.
This resolve has further strengthened by the opportunities presented through the 2013 agenda of development which is developing countries pooling their resources and expertise for the common good.
He further added that in the realm of intellectual property rights,the G 15 countries share many interests especially in multi-lateral platform such as WIPO , among them the protection of IP rights associated with free trade is of paramount importance to all member countries.

Cabinet nod for MoU with India
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe arrived in India having secured Cabinet approval to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian government over the Oil Tank farm in Trincomalee.
It is only a political decision. No specific agreement or venture was discussed, Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Minister Chandima Weerakkody told the Daily News.
The Cabinet Paper seeking approval to enter into a possible MoU was presented to Cabinet yesterday by the Prime Minister himself.
The proposal to develop the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm which consists of 99 oil storage tanks built by the British during World War II has seen several setbacks over the last few days as Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) unions protested against any agreement with the Indians over the China Bay Oil Tank Farm.
In 2003, the government signed a tripartite agreement to develop the oil tank farm with India and tanks were handed over to LIOC for use for a period of 35 years. At present however, the LIOC uses only 14 of the 99 tanks.
Interest in the farm was reignited in 2015 when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka and discussed of a possible joint venture to develop the Upper Tank Farm at Trincomalee.
Two years later, as Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pays a visit to India, it was expected that a final deal would be worked out and ready when Prime Minister Modi visits Sri Lanka once again as the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day celebrations this year.
This process however was hampered by the recent strike action launched by the CPC unions which had the Prime Minister issue a written assurance that no agreement would be signed regarding the China Bay farm during his Indian tour.
He had also assured the trade unions that the tanks will only be discussed with the Indian authorities after talking to the unions.

## Title: Check email in 20 minutes a day

Check email in 20 minutes a day
I recently did a challenge with my friend Jesse of Samovar Tea: check email just twice a day (at 10am and 4pm) for 30 minutes a session.
In addition, we couldnt check email in the morning unless we did an hour on a specific project that morning. It ended up that on most mornings, I couldnt do an hour of that project, so I only checked email in the afternoons.
What amazed me is that I only needed about 20 minutes a day to process email, if I focused and worked efficiently. Id like to share how to do that, if youre interested. (Im continuing the challenge for at least another week, btw.)
To start with, this isnt about being hyper-efficient. Its not about optimizing our life or becoming productivity masters. Its not about rushing through things.
Its about limiting our distractions (for me, email is one of my go-to distractions) and when we do allow them, it is purposefully. And with focus and mindfulness.
Email is necessary in my life, so I dont want to cut it out. I do want to keep it to a minimum, so it doesnt expand to fill my day, or become something I run to.
OK, with that clear, lets dive into the how to. How to Limit Email Checking
It used to be that I would check email first thing in the morning, before getting out of bed. But I realized that this was a procrastination method that felt productive, that was a way for me to postpone meditating and important work.
Email also was something Id check whenever I was bored, didnt want to work on something hard (but still wanted to feel productive), or just had an itch to see what people were writing to me about.
But Jesse asked me a good question: What would happen if you didnt check email for a week (My projects would fall behind and customers would think Im unresponsive.) What would happen if you just checked once a day (Nothing bad, probably.)
So we made a challenge: just check twice a day, at specific times. If you messed up, youd have to pay the other person $1,000 (!). That was a ridiculous amount for such a trivial thing, so it was guaranteed that we wouldnt check email.
There was a small caveat: if you needed to send an email (to get a report to someone, for example), you could send the email only, but would have to pay $1,000 if you checked any other emails.
So I recommend a similar challenge. Try it for a week. Find an accountability partner, promise to pay a really big amount, set specific terms, and see if you can limit your email checking. This wont work for people in customer service, for example, who need to check email all day long to do their job, but for most of us, email just seems like something we need to check often, but nothing bad happens if we dont.
Try it, see if you can limit yourself to twice a day. Or be bold, and do once a day! How to Process Email in 20 Minutes
The 20 minutes is actually relative to whatever volume of email you need to process, of course. Some people will need 30 minutes. But most people can do it in less, and if you find yourself going beyond 30 minutes, its possible you need to do a couple things: Unsubscribe from as many newsletters, promotional emails, notifications and other fluff as you can (if it has an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email, use it). Get those out of your inbox, so you can just focus on the important stuff.Decide that youre not going to get to everything today, just the important ones that you can do in 20-30 minutes.
Let go of the rest  getting to empty isnt more important than other things you need to do.
OK, with those two key ideas in mind, heres how to process your email in 20 minutes: Set a timer for 20 minutes. Set your container, and work within it.Process email top down, and completely deal with each email.
One email at a time. Deal with it completely (see next two items) before you allow yourself to move on to the next.
Dont put it off, dont say, Ill deal with that later.Take one of three actions. You only have three choices: a) delete (or archive), b) reply right now (and/or take care of the task it requires right now) if it will take 2 minutes or less, c) put it on your to-do list or calendar if it will take longer (see next item) and file in a to-do email folder. Basically, do what it takes to get the email out of your inbox.
And again, unsubscribe whenever you can. Put longer tasks on your to-do list. If it will take longer than 2 minutes, put the item on your to-do list. Or if its a link that you need to read, put it on a read-later list.
Sometimes Ill reply to the person to let them know Ill try to work on it today (or by a certain date), and then put it on my to-do list or calendar.Be mindful as you work. Its easy to get into the do this as quickly as I can mode.
But theres also a mindfulness you can bring to the activity. As you send this email, are you being helpful, kind, clear, truthful, compassionate How is your body feeling Are you sitting upright Can you smile and appreciate this beautiful moment
When the timer goes off, find gratitude that you had that time to communicate and take care of important tasks. Let go of the rest (for now), close your email, and resist the urge to check it again later.
Refocus yourself on something important.
Breathe, and meet the rest of your day with joy.

GMOA doomed forevermore
I fully endorse the recent statement of the Health Minister Rajitha Senarathna that doctors affiliated to the GMOA do not have any sort of discipline and their only objective is to topple the Government. I would like to go a little further and say that these doctors do not have hearts. If not they will never penalize the poor patients by striking, who go to the hospitals for treatment.
I think they have struck work many days citing the SAITM issue as a cause, causing tremendous hardships to the patients. But on striking days they never miss private practice after 4 pm visiting private hospitals/ clinics to earn. There too they cannot do their duty perfectly because they cannot examine a patient in 5 or 10 minutes but they do since they lack time for the waiting queue to attend. This is the worst quandary the patients of Sri Lanka face. As patients, their human and fundamental rights are being violated. They cannot access easily to a doctor in a Government hospital too because they have to wait long hours in a queue.
It is a commiseration in Sri Lanka that doctors are considered as an elite and dominant class whereas the patients are treated as miserable and hapless. Although the doctors clamour for their dignity, prestige and lordliness they should never forget their entire education has been funded by the poor mans wallet. At this juncture I request the Minister of Health to bring in legislation in parliament to protect the fundamental rights of the patients ensuring their rights to medical treatment when they visit a hospital.
The unethical and despicable behaviour of the GMOA of staging protests and agitations against the Government and the Judiciary clearly indicates that they are under the influence of a powerful political party which motivates them to cause chaos in the country to destabilize the Government.
As learned intellectuals the GMOA should think and understand the Government has come to power with the ballot, the peoples consent which is endowed for five years. Before the completion of five years a Government cannot be toppled undemocratically, holding protests or strikes or agitations by the GMOA or any of the trade unions found in Sri Lanka.
Thus, it is advisable for the GMOA to stop all this nonsense without being cursed by the poor patients.

In close rapport with reconciliation
The National Unity Government, formed in the year 2015, has already taken many progressive steps within the course of last two years for alleviating the hardships of the war affected Tamil community in the North and East of Sri Lanka. Restoration of democratic governance is one important dimension of the reconciliation process. In this direction, several important legislative enactments have been made by Parliament. Out of them, passing the 19th Amendment of the Constitution which provided for the appointment of independent Commissions is a very important step taken by the government. By a resolution, Parliament has constituted itself as a Constituent Assembly and also as a Steering Committee comprising of representatives of all political parties in Parliament.
The Constituent Assembly and the Steering Committee were empowered to deliberate and draft a Constitution. The Constituent Assembly has already received the reports of the six sub-committees who dealt with different aspects of the constitutional reforms. The Public Representations Committee also has submitted its report.
The National Unity Government is an alliance of the two main political parties in the country, the UNP and the SLFP. The joining of these two political parties to form a government is a power sharing arrangement between the two main political parties, marking a very significant and positive change in the political culture of this country. The main feature of the political culture of this country has been the perennial struggle or competition between these two political parties for capturing and retaining political power representing themselves as two rival parties.
National Unity Government
The forming of the National Unity Government marked the end of a state of rivalry between these two political parties whose power base was the Sinhalese community in the South. The objective of the alliance of the two main political parties was to form a strong government for achieving the objective of accelerated economic development and achieving reconciliation among the ethnic communities and permanent peace.
The government has made commendable progress in implementing the measures undertaken by co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution No.30/1 in October 2015 and a further period of two years has been granted for completing the tasks undertaken by the Sri Lankan government. This resolution deals with the issues such as the Transitional Justice Process, missing persons, detainees in prisons and constitutional reforms.
When we consider the highly controversial and sensitive nature of the issues that the government has undertaken to deal with, there will certainly be all sorts of obstructions preventing the speedy attention to such issues. For example, legislation is now in place for the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons authorized to ascertain what happened to the missing persons. But the victims of disappearances and their families are still impatiently waiting for the implementation of the law.
The role played by extremist nationalist political parties and civil society organisations in politics of Sri Lanka is the most significant factor that has contributed to the slow progress of the reconciliation process. In this article I attempt to discuss the obstructionist role played by such spoilers.
The main Tamil political alliance in Parliament, the Tamil National Alliance under the leadership of R. Sampanthan representing the majority of the Tamils in the North and East has expressed its willingness to extend all possible support to the government for going ahead with the constitution making process aimed at bringing about a political solution within the framework of a single undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka. Sampanthan has very clearly stated that what the Tamil community needs is to live as equal citizens in dignity with other communities enjoying the same political, economic, social and cultural rights.
The Tamil National Alliance cooperating with the Sri Lankan government in formulating constitutional proposals is a very desirable and positive development. However, it is very unfortunate that there is a formidable section of parliamentarians who oppose all steps and initiatives taken by the government for achieving reconciliation and a durable political settlement. Most of them are a section of MPs from the SLFP who preferred to remain in the Opposition.
Constitutional reforms
This anti-government political formation led by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is strictly opposed to the policy of cooperating with the UNP. They cannot just tolerate a section of the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena working together with the UNP under a power-sharing arrangement. This ideological position of a section of the Opposition in Parliament poses a serious threat to achieving the goal of formulating a constitution acceptable to all communities in Sri Lanka. For amending or changing some provisions of the present Constitution, not only the approval of a two-third majority in Parliament but also the approval by a majority of voters at a referendum is necessary.
The anti-government Opposition led by the former President has engaged in a propaganda campaign against the government led by the President and the Prime Minister projecting the national reconciliation process and the proposed constitutional reforms as an anti-national project which poses a very serious threat to the sovereignty of the state and the national security.
The propaganda campaign of the anti-government Opposition is seeking to create an impression in the mind of the Sinhalese people that the present government has agreed with the Tamil leaders to grant a federal constitution, which means according to them, a separate government for the Tamils in the North and East. The anti-government faction of the SLFP is supported by some extremist Sinhala nationalist parties such as Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), National Freedom Front (NFF) and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU). They represent themselves as the Joint Opposition within Parliament and have adopted an obstructionist attitude towards the government.
There are also some retired military officers who support the Joint Opposition propaganda campaign which is a very unfortunate development. Some steps that the present government has decided to take in response to the Resolution No. 30/1 of the UNHRC in Geneva, such as the returning of private land occupied by the armed forces to the owners, investigation of cases of disappearances during the course of the war or replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) by another law conforming to the required international standards for the protection of human rights of persons in the custody of law enforcement authorities, are viewed by them as a very serious threat to the security of the nation. There is a strong resistance to the undertaking given by the Sri Lankan government to hold a credible investigation of allegations of serious violations of human rights amounting to war crimes and humanitarian law during the last stage of the Eelam War IV.
The nationalist extremists go to the extent of arguing that the delegates of the Sri Lankan government who represented Sri Lanka at the sessions of the UNHRC in Geneva should have objected to the adoption of any resolutions against Sri Lanka and adopted a confrontationist approach to the UNO interventions in the Sri Lankan affairs. But, the critics of the government policy have forgotten that the resolution No. 30/1 co-sponsored by Sri Lanka is not only an undertaking given to the UNHRC but it is also an undertaking given by the government to address some burning issues of a section of the Sri Lankan citizens affected by the war.
There are also some organisations of Buddhist priests such as Pavidi Handa and Bodu Bala Sena who are opposed to the holding of any investigations against the Sri Lankan armed forces.
It is perhaps, after considering the adverse effect of the serious objections expressed by the Joint Opposition to the implementation of the relevant provision in the Resolution No. 30/1 of the UNHRC, may have in shaping the opinion of the Sinhalese electorate that the Prime Minister and the President made statements recently to the effect that both of them are opposed to the establishment of hybrid courts for investigating allegations of war crimes and violations of humanitarian law.
There is another obstructionist voice emanating from the Tamil community refusing to accept the guidance and leadership of moderate Tamil leaders in the TNA.
Some Tamil extremist nationalists in the North and some Tamil diaspora organisations that support them have adopted an anti-government attitude similar to the attitude of the Joint Opposition of Sinhalese extremists. Some newspapers reported recently that there was a call by two former members of Parliament for the Jaffna District, V. Ananda Sangaree of TULF and Suresh Premachandra of EPRLF for TNA and Opposition leader R. Sampanthan to resign as leader of Opposition.
An impartial observer of the history of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka would find that the main reason for the failure of the peace talks at different stages of the development of the conflict was the inability of the leaders of the two communities to deviate from the extremist nationalist ideologies by which they were guided and reach a compromise regarding a pragmatic political settlement taking into consideration the ground realities.
But, it is the hope of all moderate thinkers such as R. Sampanthan had stated in the course of his speech at a conference held in New Delhi recently that another opportunity is now available for the framing of a Constitution based upon a substantial and reasonable consensus amongst political parties and peoples in the country.

Colombo city to be cleared of beggars
Steps will be taken soon to clear the Colombo city of beggars which is an eyesore in the metropolis, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
He was addressing a press conference in Kandy.
He said there were nearly 3,500 persons engaged in begging in the city on a full time and part-time basis.
Among them, nearly 600 remained in the city day and night engaged in full time begging while the rest amounting to nearly 3,000 left the city at night after engaging in begging during the day on a part-time basis.
The minister said the full-timers were fully destitute or disabled without anyone to depend on. A systematic programme would be implemented for their benefit.
The government had paid attention towards the possibility of rehabilitating part-time beggars. The minister added that there were nearly 16,000 stray dogs roaming in the city.
He would request animal-friendly societies to render assistance to the government towards the reduction of the density of stray dogs in the city.

Empowering communities through citizenship training
Active Citizens is a global programme conducted by the British Council. The ethos behind this programme is Globally connected, locally engaged and so far it has created 130,000 Active Citizens in 40 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe.
In South Asia, Active Citizens works through civil society organisations, governments youth development organisations and universities to engage local volunteers and deepen trust and understanding within and between communities. The vision of Active Citizens is A world where people are empowered to engage peacefully and effectively with other cultures in the sustainable development in their community.
The Active Citizens five day residential workshop held from 20 to 25 of March 2017 in Kundasale was collaboration between British Council and their delivery partner, International Youth Alliance For Peace (IYAP) a local youth led volunteer not-for profit organisation.
There were more than 30 participants representing Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities from all over the country. The programme develops Active Citizens who are potential change agents in their community.
Through this workshop young people acquire a wide range of skills in leadership, communication, advocacy, citizenship, social responsibility, volunteering, fundraising, partnerships, and network building skills which contribute to community-led social development through Social Action Project delivery.
During the workshop, the participants were taken on a learning journey, referred to as the the river, which starts by building self-awareness and confidence and culminates in the planning and delivery of social action.
From building relationships with others; learning how to use dialogue as a tool for building empathy, trust and understanding through to practical and interactive sessions between Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim participants like Forum theatre. Hold your assumptions lightly, not tightly was one of the most popular sessions which engaged the participants in activities regarding assumptions and debates whether assumptions are good or bad.
One of the main topics of the workshop was improving and understanding communities.
What is a community What are different communities around you How communities can be empowered Practical activities such as the power walk addressed: What is power How the centre of power can be influenced
The workshop also focused on the biggest challenge in the journey of an Active Citizen; to change and empower their communities; developing an understanding of how the community works; learning how to identify stakeholders and interventions for addressing community issues and improving the motivation to act.
A cultural show was also organised by the participants with the help of the facilitators. They did combined events proving that language barrier is not a problem if you are willing to challenge something and proving that his workshop actually did make an impact on them. Participants used this event to showcase their diverse culture through song, dance and drama. It was undoubtedly one of the most successful sessions of the workshop.

Fairytale prisoner by choice: US First Ladys photographic eye
Why wont the first lady show up for her job Why I became obsessed with this question and eventually looked to Melanias Twitter history for answers. I noticed that in the three-year period between June 3, 2012 and June 11, 2015 she tweeted 470 photos which she appeared to have taken herself. I examined these photographs as though they were a body of work.
Everyone has an eye, whether or not we see ourselves as photographers. What we choose to photograph and how we frame subjects always reveals a little about how we perceive the world. For someone like Melania, media-trained, controlled and cloistered, her collection of Twitter photography provides an otherwise unavailable view into the reality of her existence. Nowhere else<U+200A><U+200A>certainly not in interviews or public appearances<U+200A><U+200A>is her guard so far down.
What is that reality She is Rapunzel with no prince and no hair, locked in a tower of her own volition, and delighted with the predictability and repetition of her own captivity.
Why not move to the White House Lets see.
There is a striking passivity to the Trump Tower view photographs. She never changed the composition of these landscapes, she placed no personal mark on them. The time of day changes, she takes a photo, thats it. There is a calmness, a kind of safety, to this approach. The earth moves around the sun but the photographer is stable, in the exact same position, day after day. We all have a tendency to repeat the same imagery in our photography. Its part of having an eye. But, knowing what we know now, that these photographs were taken by a woman who is shirking the responsibilities of first lady in favor of suing the Daily Mail over the damage theyve done to her brand by claiming she was once an escort, a woman who has the nerve to refuse to leave her home, even though that refusal comes with a $50 million annual government handout for her security costs, these photographs take on a darker edge. - www.medium.com

Fall of the bipeds
When I met the cyborg Neil Harbisson, in Barcelona, he looked like any local hipster, except for the black antenna arching impressively from the back of his skull over his mop of blond hair.
It was December, and Harbisson, 34, was wearing a zippered gray shirt under a black peacoat, with narrow gray pants. Born in Belfast and raised in Spain, he has a rare condition called achromatopsia; he cannot perceive color. His antenna, which ends in a fiber-optic sensor that hovers right above his eyes, has changed that. Harbisson never felt that living in a black-and-white world was a disability. I see longer distances. Also I memorize shapes more easily because color doesnt distract me, he told me, in his careful, neutral English.
Cybernetic enhancement
But he was deeply curious about what things looked like in color too. Having trained as a musician, he had the idea in his late teens of trying to discover color through sound. After some low-tech false starts, in his early 20s he found a surgeon (who remains anonymous) who was willing to implant a device, a cybernetic enhancement to his biological self.
The fiber-optic sensor picks up the colors in front of him, and a microchip implanted in his skull converts their frequencies into vibrations on the back of his head. Those become sound frequencies, turning his skull into a sort of third ear. He correctly identified my blazer as blue and, pointing his antenna at his friend Moon Ribas, a cyborg artist and dancer, said her jacket was yellowit was actually mustard yellow, but as he explained, in Catalonia we didnt grow up with mustard.
When I asked Harbisson how the doctor had attached the device, he cheerfully parted the hair at the back of his head to show me the antennas point of entry. The pinkish flesh was pressed down by a rectangular plate with two anchors. A connected implant held the vibrating microchip, and another implant was a Bluetooth communication hub, so friends could send him colors through his smartphone.
The antenna has been a revelation for Harbisson. The world is more exhilarating for him now. Over time, he said, the input has begun to feel neither like sight nor hearing but a sixth sense.
The most intriguing part of the antenna, though, is that it gives him an ability the rest of us dont have. He looked at the lamps on the roof deck and sensed that the infrared lights that activate them were off. He glanced at the planters and could see the ultraviolet markings that show where nectar is located at the centers of the flowers. He has not just matched ordinary human skills; he has exceeded them.
He is, then, a first step toward the goal that visionary futurists have always had, an early example of what Ray Kurzweil in his well-known book The Singularity Is Near calls the vast expansion of human potential. Harbisson hadnt particularly meant to jump-start Kurzweils dreamhis vision of the future is more sylvan than silicon. But since he became the worlds first official cyborg (he persuaded the British government to let him wear the antenna in his passport photo, arguing that it was not an electronic device, but an extension of his brain), he has also become a proselytizer. Ribas soon followed him into what is sometimes called transhumanism by having a seismic monitor in her phone connect to a vibrating magnet buried in her upper arm. She gets real-time reports of earthquakes, allowing her to feel connected to the motions of the Earth and interpret them through dance. I guess I got jealous, she says.
We will transcend all of the limitations of our biology, Kurzweil promised. That is what it means to be humanto extend who we are.
Desirable genes
Clearly Harbissons antenna is merely a beginning. But are we on the way to redefining how we evolve Does evolution now mean not just the slow grind of natural selection spreading desirable genes, but also everything that we can do to amplify our powers and the powers of the things we makea union of genes, culture, and technology And if so, where is it taking us
Conventional evolution is alive and well in our species. Not long ago we knew the makeup of only a handful of the roughly 20,000 protein-encoding genes in our cells; today we know the function of about 12,000. But genes are only a tiny percentage of the DNA in our genome. More discoveries are certain to comeand quickly. From this trove of genetic information, researchers have already identified dozens of examples of relatively recent evolution. Anatomically modern humans migrated from Africa sometime between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago. Our original genetic inheritance was appropriate for the warm climates where we first evolved from early hominins to humans, from knuckle-walkers to hunters and gatherers. But a lot has happened since that time, as humans have expanded around the world and the demands posed by new challenges have altered our genetic makeup.
Genetic variant
Recent, real-life examples of this process abound. Australian Aboriginals living in desert climates have a genetic variant, developed in the past 10,000 years, that allows them to adjust more easily to extreme high temperatures. Prehistorically, most humans, like other mammals, could digest milk only in infancywe had genes that turned off the production of the milk-digesting enzyme when we were weaned. But around 9,000 years ago, some humans began to herd animals rather than just hunt them. These herders developed genetic alterations that allowed them to continue making the relevant enzyme for their whole lives, a handy adaptation when their livestock were producing a vitamin-rich protein.
In a recent article in the Scientist, John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the University of WisconsinMadison, wrote how impressed he was at the speed with which the gene was disseminated: up to 10 percent per generation. Its advantage was enormous, perhaps the strongest known for any recent human trait.
Similarly, the ancestors of all non-Africans came out of Africa with dark skin. Indeed even 10,000 years ago, according to researchers, European and African skin looked much the same. But over time humans in darker northern climates evolved less heavily pigmented skin, which helped absorb the suns ultraviolet rays and synthesize vitamin D more efficiently. The Inuit of Greenland have an adaptation that helps them digest the omega-3 fatty acids in fish far better than the rest of us. An indigenous population near the Argentine town of San Antonio de los Cobres has evolved to be able to drink the high levels of arsenic that have occurred naturally in their groundwater.

Food for happiness
A wonderful attempt has been fulfilled in the collection of the teachings of the great Thai monk leader named Ajahn Chah (1918  1992) titled as Food for the Heart (Wisdom, Boston 2002). Most teachings of Ajahn Chah had been lying scattered in various places, as recorded sermons, dialogues, discourses and essays so far not translated into English from Thai. The compilers responsible are Jack Kornfield (with a forward) and Ajahn Amaro (with an introduction to the collection of 38 teachings).
Some of the teachings are translated from the original Thai sources and some other culled from the already available sources and printed for free distribution from such places as Amaravati Forest Monastery in the UK and other venues all over the world.
The reader comes across various types of expressions of the great monk scholar inclusive of his parables, dialogues, epigrams and interpretations. For the sake of better classification and clarity, the compendium is subdivided into three broad headings.
1. Conduct: where the explanations on virtue and world senses are taken into consideration.
2. Meditation: where the theory of practice is explained.
3. Wisdom: on the path to the ultimate goal.
Kornfield says that it is hard to know how to best introduce the wisest man he has ever met. The person he refers to is Ajahn Chah in whose presence he believes was the utmost aliveness, tranquility, wisdom and simplicity, truth-telling, dignity and intimacy, humour and serious discipline, heart-breaking compassion and spontaneous freedom.
Perhaps the compilation is a result of contemplating on all these aspects. Kornfield believes that the entire life span led by Ajahn Chah was packed with the essence of teachings of the Buddha in the simplest form possible not only to the dispensation of monks but also to the laymen around the world.
In part one, dealing with the aspects of conduct, Ajahn Chah takes into conduct the broad titles like Living in the world with Dhamma, Making the heart good and Understanding the concept of Vinaya or discipline. All these aspects are analysed and interpreted in the simplest possible means enabling the listener, or the reader, gripped into a single point.
In part two, the main topic of discussion is the theory and practice of meditation. As a starting point, Ajahn Chah explains why an inner peace is needed for a human being. He terms this as inner balance. Then he goes on to explain the various ways in which mind could be trained to achieve a certain degree of happiness which under normal stress could never be gained. He maintains the idea that the mind full of fickle thought, untrained, begins to give way to undue unhappiness. As such, meditation has to be learned and practiced. He states that it is a key to liberation. Although the term Mindfulness is used quite often in the modern context of living, it could never be achieved sans meditation.
In 16 segments, Ajahn explains the concept of wisdom. In the dialogue that is titled as What is contemplation the reader comes to know that wisdom is a state that lies beyond the plane of mere thinking, and gaining knowledge on various subjects. It is explained as the highest state of contemplation that surpasses Samadhi or concentration. He states that we use thinking as a tool, but the knowing that arises because of its use is above anything beyond the process of thinking, (for) it leads to our not being fooled by our thinking anymore. Then he says that you recognize that all thinking is merely the movement of the mind, and also that the knowing is not born and does not die; wisdom is achieved at a moment that cannot be explained by words.
In this manner, the state of the mind and its functions are xplaiend in the best possible manner. He goes to extent of supplementing with examples from the lives of those who attempted to train the mind for a purpose, devoid of mere use of words. The reader comes to feel that that practice is not just a matter of talking about mind, but a process of training.
The term, paccattam, is used in the context, for he says that the Dhamma is not understood because somebody else tells you about it, but you must see it for yourself. As a reader, I felt that the discourse that goes as the nature of Dhamma is packed with a greater vision than one could fathom. Ajahn says:
Everything is Dhamma, not only the things we see, with our physical eye, but also the things we see in our mind.
A thought arises, then changes and passes away. It is called Nama Dhamma, simply a mental impression that arises and passes away. He lays down several poetic phrases that go as the insight to the nature of Dhamma as follows.
Where is the Buddha The Buddha is in the Dhamma.
Where is the Dhamma The Dhamma is in the Buddha.
Right here, now!
Where is the Sangha
The Sangha is in the Dhamma.
He concludes that the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in our minds. But he cautions that we have to see this clearly. Some people just say casually: Oh the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha exist in my mind. Yet their own practice is not in accord with the truth. It is thus not possible to find the Budhda, the Dhamma and the Sangha should be found in their minds, because the mind must first be that mind that knows what Dhamma is. Only then will we come to know that truth does exist in the world, and that it is possible for us to practice and thereby realize it. All in all not a single page is dull. Each sentence carries a sense of liveliness.

Ranawaka was addressing a meeting after opening the renovated Bodhiraja Mawatha in Habarakada, Homagama on April 22. The RDA and the UDA had spent Rs 9.5 million to renovate this road by carpeting it.
Ranawaka said garbage collected from Colombo had been dumped in a land belonging to the UDA notwithstanding their opposition. Last February too they warned about a possible tragedy if this process continued unabated. However, Minister Faizer Mustapha requested that they be allowed to continue it until an alternative location was found. The Western Provincial Council and the CMC had also been thrice notified to desist from dumping garbage at Meethotamulla since 2015. Minister Ranawaka said given this situation it was futile to point the accusing finger at them after the tragedy had already occurred after their repeated warnings.
He said now the houses built by his Ministry for the Greater Colombo storm water drainage project had been allocated to those families which lost their houses in the Meethotamulla tragedy in double quick time. But people who lost their houses in a landslide in Bandarawela during the Rajapaksa regime had still not received alternative houses.
This is the difference between the Yahapalana government and the Rajapaksa regime.
The government had now undertaken the task of rehabilitating the Meethotamulla garbage mountain. It had been planned to introduce a scientifically managed garbage dump and find a technological solution to the whole problem. All political parties should rally round to make this effort a success treating it as a national responsibility disregarding political differences. Those who tried to make political capital out of the garbage problem would be taught a bitter lesson by the people in future.
Provincial Minister Gamini Thilakasiri and opposition leader of the Western Provincial Council Manju Sri Arangala were also present.

Garbage politics vs political gimmicks!
If things were a bit slow in the political world before the Sinhala and Tamil New year, a series of events that happened at a dizzying pace right after the New Year galvanized political figures representing every hue to point fingers at each other. The blame game began in earnest after the Meethotamulla tragedy, which grabbed the headlines for nearly two weeks.
It was undoubtedly one of the biggest tragedies that Sri Lanka experienced in peacetime apart from the Indian Ocean Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 (technically, this happened when there was a ceasefire in effect). While the two death tolls cannot be compared, there was a certain sense of dj vu in that. We were essentially not prepared for the two disasters despite having some knowledge of what could happen.
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa was naturally one of the first to criticize the Government over the Meethotamulla tragedy. He berated the Government for not following up on his Governments plan to use the clinker quarry craters of Puttalam for storing garbage. This drew heavy flak from the Government side, with the question as to why he could not do it during his tenure. The former President responded that he could not go ahead with the garbage disposal issue as he concentrated more on the war. However, many commentators have since pointed out that he went ahead with many less important projects in spite of the war.
In fact, it was pointed out that dumping garbage in Meethotamulla actually commenced during his tenure in 2009 after the closure of the Bloemendhal Road garbage dump. This Government too continued the practice. Experts had already warned that the garbage dump could give way due to simple laws of physics coming into play, but these warnings were ignored. Just last month, a similar garbage dump in Ethiopia gave way, killing a number of people. At least this incident should have propelled the authorities to take action on Meethotamulla.
It is an undeniable fact that many politicians profited from the goings-on at Meethotamulla. Most houses around the garbage dump were unauthorized constructions undertaken with political patronage. Many politicians had also hired tippers and trucks for garbage transport, from which they apparently earned handsomely.
The time has come now to end the political bickering over the matter. Meethotamulla should be cleaned up and a new method should be found for garbage disposal. We do not have to look far  several local bodies, including an award-winning initiative in Balangoda, already turn trash into compost or other useful articles. Some countries already import garbage from nearby countries to power their waste-to-electricity facilities. We can learn from those experiences. In the meantime, the President has declared garbage disposal as an essential service. This also means that no one can disrupt the disposal of garbage, as we witnessed in several areas.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka too weighed in, saying no politician should be allowed to make use of the tragedy to score political goals. The Government, which initially came in for criticism due to what many said was a slow response, sprang into action. Several houses had already been distributed and compensation arrangements were fast-tracked. A group of Japanese experts have surveyed the site and already produced a preliminary report in addition to reports by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO). However, there is a lot more to be done in terms of responding to the tragedy as well as finding a solution to the garbage problem.
Forthcoming May Day celebrations
Meethotamulla is likely to be a hot topic at the forthcoming May Day, although it is not a workers problem per se. This is because the May Day has been highly politicized in this country, veering away from its focus on the working class. All parties consider it as a Mid-year occasion to show their might and woo the electorate. This year looks rather interesting due to the combination of venues selected by and for the various parties.
The biggest headache is faced by the Joint Opposition, which has the daunting task of filling Galle Face Green. They probably never expected the Government to accede to their request, but now that it has been given, filling it is no easy task as many parties have discovered earlier. MP Bandula Gunawardane was lampooned by cartoonists over this comment of filling the Galle Face with two million people. Without probably knowing about this blunder, his colleague from the Flower Bud party MP Basil Rajapaksa gave a much saner figure of around 120,000 after calculating the size of the Galle Face Green. As one political commentator noted, the organisers will need around 20,000 buses (with each bus carrying 100) to reach the two million mark.
It must be an excruciating experience for those MPs and others sitting on the fence thinking whether they should go the SLFP May Day Rally at Getambe or to the Joint Oppositions one at Galle Face. The SLFP has made it clear that stern action would be taken against SLFP MPs who go to Galle Face. Political circles were abuzz with a rumor that at least three prominent members of the JO would get on to the SLFP stage at Getambe. On its part, the JO too expects a new face or two at their own rally.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, addressing a recent political rally, said no true SLFPer could desert the party at this crucial time. They should extend their fullest cooperation to President Maithripala Sirisena who is also the leader of the SLFP, he said. The Minister said he expected a record crowd to Getambe. Organisers say they have planned for only two processions, but if the crowd is above their expectations, a third procession could be in order.
The UNP, led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has stuck with the traditional Campbell Park for its May Day rally. Last years rally there was a huge success and the organisers are confident of pulling off an even better show this time. Several other parties are set to join the UNP tomorrow. The JVP too has not shown any inclination to move away from their traditional May Day location, but face intense competition from the breakaway Peratugamis, led by Kumar Gunaratnam, now a Sri Lankan citizen.
Weerawansas fast theatrics
Amidst all this, many have forgotten about MP Wimal Weerawansa, whose fast theatrics have not apparently gone down well with his party seniors and rank and file. He has been unusually silent since his release on bail, apart from an interview to a Sinhala newspaper where he has denied that he engaged in a fast in order to secure bail. This comment was widely ridiculed on social media and even in some sections of the mainstream media. However, Weerawansa is expected to make a May Day appearance. Even as the Government was somewhat relieved after the hue and cry created over SAITM and the garbage mountain died down a bit, it faced another crisis. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Workers launched a strike demanding a halt to the alleged sale of the Trinco Oil Tank farm to India, with many under the impression that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was leaving for India to finalise such a deal. This was a classic case of the Governments message not having the right effect  the Prime Minister has earlier explicitly stated that there would be tripartite cooperation (Sri Lanka-Japan-India) on this site and that there would be no sale of the facility to any party. However, this message did not reach the workers and the public in a correct way and thus a wrong interpretation took the upper hand. The strike was grossly unfair given the true situation. Long queues at the filling stations did not do the Government any good, but sanity finally prevailed as the union leaders accepted the Governments stance. This should be an eye-opener to the Government that it should be more articulate, transparent and communicative on crucial matters such as power and energy.
Prime Ministers India visit
The Prime Ministers main purpose of going to India is to make the initial preparations for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka for the UN Vesak Day celebrations next month. However, his proposed visit has already run into a storm with the hardline party Hindu Makkal Katchi protesting against it, saying that Hindus are being discriminated against in Sri Lanka. The leader of Hindu Makkal Katchi, Arjun Sampath, on Saturday accused the Sri Lankan government of suppressing Hinduism and following a policy of Buddhist chauvinism. Unlike Superstar Rajinikanths volte-face on his proposed trip to Sri Lanka, Indo-Lanka relations are so good at Head of State level that there is no likelihood of a cancellation. Modi, a great admirer of Buddhism, has already confirmed his participation in the Vesak events in Colombo.
The two weeks leading up to Vesak will not be pleasant for many who fear that President Sirisena will keep his promise of making changes at the top in many Government institutions before Vesak. Many say his reference is to a Cabinet reshuffle as well. A Cabinet reshuffle was speculated on several previous instances, but has so far not materialized.
Latest reports from Siri Kotha say that there is stiff opposition in the UNP to any Cabinet reshuffle. They fear that only UNP ministers would be targeted in a Cabinet reshuffle, leaving the SLFP portfolios intact. However, the President has given no such indication. He has previously warned all ministers found wanting that their portfolios could be on the line. In any case, further discussions between the President and the Prime Minister are likely on this issue once the latter returns from India, before any concrete decision is taken. They will have to take into account the widespread feelings in society about the lethargic attitudes of certain ministers and their institutions. Corruption allegations too have been levelled against some ministers.
There was good news for the Government on the economic front, after all the gloomy predictions made by the Joint Opposition. The IMF, which just concluded its annual meetings in Washington, had encouraging words for Sri Lanka and so did the World Bank. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake led the Sri Lankan delegation to the meetings. (Incidentally, the World Bank and the IMF have pledged to send a team of solid waste management experts to Sri Lanka in the wake of the Meethotamulla tragedy). The American Chamber of Commerce has also agreed to further expand investment in Sri Lanka due to the country's economic transparency, Finance Minister Karunanayake said. The Minister addressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, DC on April 21.
The IMF praise followed a surge in the Colombo Bourse spurred by foreign activity. The Benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI) recorded consistent gains over the month of April, crossing the 6,500 mark on Thursday the 20th. Consistent foreign inflows have been a standout feature of the performance of the market in recent weeks, with net foreign inflows for 21 consecutive trading days by the end of trading on April 21. Foreign investor activity in 2017 so far, has marked a net foreign inflow of 14.3 Billion Rupees. Non-CSE foreign direct investments too are improving. The authorities are hoping that this trend will continue.
The agitation for the local body election seems to have faded, but expect this demand to figure at May Day meetings of every party. Three provincial councils will also reach an end to their terms, so there could potentially be two types of election this year. All political parties are gearing up for the Local Government elections which could be called at any moment. May Day could well turn out to be the start of a long election-oriented campaign trail for all the major parties which have not been tested at the hustings since 2015. Local elections will enable them to read the pulse of the people accurately and prepare for 2020.

Guru.lk partners ComBank, Microsoft to create 65 smart schools
Guru.lk has joined with Commercial Bank, Microsoft and the Provincial Education Ministry to prepare schools for digital learning
Guru.lk, Sri Lanka's leading eLearning portal, announced the completion of a multi-stakeholder initiative to convert 65 schools in the Western Province into Smart Schools capable of deploying digital learning protocols.
The company collaborated with Commercial Bank, Microsoft Sri Lanka and the Western Province Education Ministry over a six month period to complete the transformation of schools, including training and helping the teachers to embrace technology for the use ofthe hardware and software required for digital format education.
The project involved providing the schools with content to use on computers, a learning management system, Microsoft Office 365 licenses, technical support and training on working with technology for education, the company said.
The objective of the project was to expose traditional classroom based teachers and students to the latest digital based learning technology and systems, stimulating wider use of existing IT infrastructure in schools. This would enable students to make the best use of tablet computers proposed to be introduced to the government schools system in the near future.
The Commercial Bank supported the project by funding the creation of the Sipnena website registered under the .lk and .com domains, and hosted free on guru.lk servers.
The website offers students free access to content selected to support their educational needs in line with local curricula, via more than 170IT labs donated by the Bank to schools around the country.
Microsoft Sri Lanka provided its world class software to schools free of charge and also invested on teacher training for the project.
Guru.lk and its owning company Headstart (Pvt) Ltd. provided the student Learning Management System free of charge, provided content, conducted teacher training and coordinated the implementation of the project. The company was also responsible for monitoring progress and activation at ground level in the 65 schools in the Western Province.
Commenting on the successful creation of 65 Smart Schools, Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi said amalgamating technology for learning is a challenge as many teachers belong to a generation that did not use computers for their day-to-day activities.
Commercial Bank's Chief Financial Officer and Trustee of the Bank's CSR Trust Nandika Buddhipala said they have provided 170 computer laboratories to deserving schools and institutions during the past few years.
Microsoft Sri Lanka Sri Lanka and Maldives Country Manager Brian Kealey said Microsoft was happy to support the smart schools project because there is immense potential in digital format education to increase examination pass rates, reduce the cost of education, and provide expanded options for learning.
According to Guru.lk, the process of transforming schools under this programme has resulted in teachers learning more about the Internet and email and handling computers confidently, selecting learning content available on the Internet, creating learning courses for students with tools like MS Sway, and teaching students with tools such as interactive white boards which are essential to keep pace with technology. Teacher competitions were held and each teacher achievement was rewarded with Microsoft badges which enabled them to compete with regional countries.
Any digital education initiative, irrespective of the technology, needs to be supported by teachers for it to be successful. Making teachers comfortable with technology is a challenge we confronted and successfully overcame, which is evident by the achievements of schools, which were awarded at the closing ceremony recently, the company said.
Headstart (Pvt) Ltd. has been developing content for the ICTA/Ministry of Education on school curricula since 2009. The company was a tech start-up with a project named Vidunena under which the GCE A/L Science curriculum was provided to schools in an E Learning format, through an ICTA grant.
The company now owns the largest e-learning content portal www.guru.lk in Sri Lanka with more than 235,000 learners and 1,000 plus lessons to choose from.
The content knowledge pool includes university academics, teachers, business leaders, corporate trainers and soft skills trainers, and is the largest such education-related talent pool in Sri Lanka.

## Title: Ignite your child's curiosity
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, April 26, 2017 - 01:00
Ignite your child's curiosity
It is important for children to learn all the basic and traditional academic skills at school such as maths, science and languages. You should also encourage them to develop their ability in critical and analytical thinking.
Then there are other skills for example creative skills, etiquettes and problem-solving abilities which should be nurtured while at school. Certainly at the school, there is good emphasis on the development of such abilities. Creativity is the freest form of self-expression. There is nothing more satisfying and fulfilling for children than to be able to express themselves openly and without judgment. The ability to be creative, to create something from personal feelings and experiences, can reflect and nurture children's emotional health. The experiences children have during their first years of life can significantly enhance the development of their creativity.
Importance of the Creative Process
All children need to be truly creative is the freedom to commit themselves completely to the effort and make whatever activity they are doing their own. What's important in any creative act is the process of self-expression. Creative experiences can help children express and cope with their feelings. A child's creative activity can help teachers to learn more about what the child may be thinking or feeling. Creativity also fosters mental growth in children by providing opportunities for trying out new ideas, and new ways of thinking and problem-solving. Creative activities help acknowledge and celebrate children's uniqueness and diversity as well as offer excellent opportunities to personalize our teaching and focus on each child.
Opportunities for Creativity
Children need plenty of opportunities for creative play and creative thinking. Start by providing activities that are based on the children's interests and ideas. This means learning how to listen intently to what children are saying. It is very helpful to tape record and transcribe children's conversations as well as take notes and review them with your co-teachers.
Be sure to offer children a wide range of creative materials and experiences. Being creative is more than drawing or painting. There's also photography, music, field trips, working with wire, clay, paper, wood, water or shadows. The possibilities are endless. It's important to provide children lots of time to explore materials and pursue their ideas. This includes time to think about how to plan, design, construct, experiment and revise project ideas. Don't forget to build in time to talk these ideas over with other people - both teachers and children.
Varieties of Experience
Look for ways to provide multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and other community experiences for children. Activities such as field trips, celebrating holidays and activities with other ethnic groups, and encouraging children to bring visitors to school enhances the creative process. The more varied experiences children have in their lives, the wider the range of creative expression. The more personal experiences children have with people and situations outside of their own environment, the more material they can draw on to incorporate in their play. Our challenge is to try not to be intimidated by the variety and diversity of artistic expression in our classroom.
Fostering the Creative Process
Encouraging children to make their own choices is important. Children should be permitted frequent opportunities - and lots of time - to experience and explore expressive materials. Put your emphasis on the process of creativity and not on the finished product. What children learn and discover about themselves is vital to their development. Show your support for the creative process by appreciating and offering support for children's efforts. Independence and control are important components in the creative process. This is especially true when working with children with disabilities.
Creative Play
One of the most important types of creative activity for young children is creative play. Creative play is expressed when children use familiar materials in a new or unusual way, and when children engage in role-playing and imaginative play. Nothing reinforces the creative spirit and nourishes a child's soul more than providing large blocks of time to engage in spontaneous, self-directed play throughout the day. Play is the serious business of young children and the opportunity to play freely is vital to their healthy development.
Even as early as infancy, play fosters physical development by promoting the development of sensory exploration and motor skills. Through play and the repetition of basic physical skills, children perfect their abilities and become competent at increasingly difficult physical tasks. Play fosters mental development and new ways of thinking and problem solving. Through block play, children are confronted with many mental challenges having to do with measurement, equality, balance, shape, spatial relationships and physical properties.
One of the strongest benefits of play is the way it enhances social development. Playful social interactions begin from the moment of birth. Dramatic play helps children experiment with and understand social roles. It can also give them countless opportunities for acquiring social skills as they play with others. Through dramatic play, children gradually learn to take each other's needs into account, and appreciate different values and perspectives.
Through play, children are able to express and cope with their feelings. Play also helps relieve stress and pressure for children. They can just be themselves. There's no need to live up to adult standards during play. Play offers children an opportunity to achieve mastery of their environment. They control the experience through their imaginations, and they exercise their powers of choice and decision-making as the play progresses.
Play helps develop each child's unique perspective and individual style of creative expression. Play expresses the child's personal, unique responses to the environment. Play is a self-expressive activity that draws on the child's powers of imagination. Play is open-ended, free-form and children have the freedom to try out new ideas as well as build on and experiment with the old. Play provides an excellent opportunity for integrating and including children with disabilities in your program. The opportunities play provides for control and independence are important issues for any child but are especially important for these youngsters.
Express abilities
What are some of the ways we can encourage play in our classrooms As caregivers, we must be careful to avoid dominating the play ourselves. Play should be the result of the children's ideas and not directed by the adult. Through play, we should try to foster children's abilities to express themselves. We should also try to help children base play on their own inspirations - not ours. Our goal is to stimulate play - not control it - and to encourage children's satisfaction in playing with each other.
Pay attention to play, plan for it, encourage it. Learn how to extend children's play through comments and questions. Stimulate creative ideas by encouraging children to come up with new and unusual uses of equipment. Try to remain open to new and original ideas, and encourage children to come up with more than one solution or answer. Be careful about over-restricting equipment and make sure to have play materials quickly available when children want them. Buy and use equipment in ways that encourage the use of imagination. Avoid toys and activities that spell everything out for the child and leave nothing to the imagination. Provide children with a good range and balance of equipment, and keep equipment exciting by changing it frequently or changing its location.

India releases seven Sri Lankan fishermen
Seven Sri Lankan fishermen held on charges of trespassing into Indian waters were released and sent back along with their boat on Monday.
Indian Coast Guard ship Vaibhav apprehended these fishermen, hailing from Puttalam, 58 nautical miles off Tuticorin port on April 4. They were brought to Tuticorin on April 6.
Ramanathapuram Judicial Court remanded the fishermen in judicial custody. They were lodged in Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai while their fishing boat was retained in Tuticorin.
On April 21, a Ramanathapuram court ordered their release, and they were brought to Tuticorin.

JDR praised government for its prompt remedial measures
The Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) Expert team, which presented a report to the President on the Meethotamulla garbage dump on Monday, has said that the Government authorities have been taking prompt action on disaster risk reduction and measures to stabilise the garbage mound following its collapse.
The Japanese Embassy in a statement on the JDR Expert Team findings yesterday noted that the team observed that the Government mobilised relevant stakeholders in disaster risk reduction and waste management jointly and took immediate measures for stability of the garbage mound.
The JDR Expert team presented their technical views for safety management and prevention of secondary disaster, to stabilise the site, and for future waste management plan. The team noted of the media reports on the dump site were not based on the data and findings observed by them at the site. They said they intend to present a more detailed report and hope that it will be effectively used by the Government.
The team thanked the Sri Lankan side for the support given.
The Japanese Embassy said the Government of Japan decided to dispatch the Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) Expert Team to Sri Lanka upon the request of the Sri Lanka Government, in response to the damage caused by the collapse of a garbage mound at the disposal site in Meethotamulla, Colombo.
The team stayed and conducted activities in Sri Lanka from April 20 to 24.
The team has reported their findings to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on April 24, the statement said.

Knowing the law before needing the law
In his inaugural speech as Chief Justice of Sri Lanka, Priyasath Dep argued that citizens must be educated on Sri Lankas laws and by extension, its judicial procedures. In his estimation, the average person has but a meagre understanding of their rights and the countrys laws and processes. Creating awareness of the law among citizens is important. Citizens must know of his or her legal rights and the remedies available, Dep said.
The Daily News spoke with various people in the legal profession and each of them wholeheartedly agreed with Deps pronouncement. Conversations with citizens also bore out his claims, as most people admitted to having but a sliver of knowledge on the countrys laws and procedures. Furthermore, several of them confessed their ignorence all of their Fundamental Rights.
Clearly, those consulted knew that it is illegal to rob and murder, but the finer points of the legal codes were often lost on them.
But why, exactly, are people so ignorant of the law
There are several factors, but one of the foremost is that, for most folks, they do not have to know the law until a situation arises where they come into contact with it.
There is a big gap between everyday life and Sri Lankas legal system, said Dr. Deepika Udagama, Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.
Most people never learn about specific rules and regulations, because they do not have any reason to do so. As one lawyer put it: You do not need to know the law until you need to know the law.
I have never dealt with lawyers before, but my family is trying to sell a plot of land and we are unaware of the proper procedure for transferring a property deed, said A. Sudarshana, a trishaw driver.
I guess we will learn all about this once we consult a lawyer, he added.
Others confessed to being ignorant of their rights during a traffic stop, as one young man stated that he thought it compulsory to pay a traffic ticket immediately once the citation is issued. He later admitted, however, that he had never been stopped on the road.
One can easily function in society without understanding the details of laws and legal knowledge becomes very important only at a critical moment when one needs it most. Because of this, it is necessary, according to several experts, to improve the publics legal understanding so that they can use it when necessary.
Though it is certainly necessary to know the law, it is also important to know the legal procedures themselves. Most people, according to Saliya Peiris, former Deputy President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), lack this knowledge as well.
People dont know the nitty-gritty details of the procedures. They might know that you have to consult a lawyer if you have a legal issue, but our processes are mysterious to the average person, he said.
U.R. de Silva, BASL President and former Legal Aide Commissioner, added that gaps in knowledge often discourage people from utilizing available legal resources.
Some people think they cannot go to courts. They think that they will not be able to get anything done if they do not have money. Access to justice, they think, is a difficult task, he said.
Former BASL president Geoffrey Alagaratnam added that most people fear the law and try to avoid it. The law, he said, is not people friendly, which makes people reluctant to engage with it.
But outside of peoples lack of information, several experts pointed to the governments and the medias inability to spread information on the law as a crucial factor in citizens legal ignorance.
Dep, in the same speech, argued that laws themselves are often inaccessible to the people.
The other issue is to be aware of various acts, ordinances and amendments. Unfortunately most of the amendments are not available. The Bar Association, the Justice Ministry and the Government should publish these documents and make them available to the people, he said.
Several lawyers noted that the average person is completely ignorant of new laws that are passed in Parliament. They complained that, though laws are made in parliament, they are not publicized sufficiently. Only if they are particularly controversial do new laws make it into the public consciousness.
Another problem that citizens run into when trying to learn and interpret laws is the very fact that the legal code is laden with jargon and Latin that make it unnecessarily complicated. Every one of the lawyers that the Daily News consulted for this article complained of the laws needless complexity.
If you look at the wording of laws, even those concerning a simple thing like a deed or a gift or transfer of funds, there is a tendency to use a lot of legal jargon. To the average person it is a bit mystifying, said Pieris.
Even if people are knowledgeable about the law, another issue they face is the daunting complexity of procedures and language. The legal code should be written in simple language and not in complex terms. Goal should be for everyone to easily understand the countrys laws and procedures and we are making this
more complicated than it needs to be, said Udagama.
The intricacies of the law, as well as the lack of its dissemination, have contributed to shortcomings in Sri Lankas rule of law. This is not to say that there is widespread chaos in the country, but rather that people often unknowingly break the law due to ignorance.
How to Improve one's Legal Knowledge
One staple of legal education is the Legal Aid Commissions (LAC) clinics targeted at people who might not be very knowledgeable on the law.
These are vital resources, but unfortunately a lack of funding has curtailed their effectiveness.
At the moment the government cannot give a lot of money to legal aid processes, whether they are for litigation or community education. If the Legal Aid Commission were to get more donations or access to more funds, there is no doubt that it would work to enhance citizens understanding of the law, said de Silva.
Alagaratnam argued it should be the responsibility of the media, the Legal Aide Commission, Divisional Secretariats and GN Divisions to impart knowledge and awareness of the law.
These groups are best equipped to disseminate information. It would be great if they could publish small booklets with vital information that equips people with basic knowledge of legal procedures, he said.
He noted that these booklets should provide vital information on procedures such as how to file RTI requests, get a permit for construction and how to apply for a passport or national identity card.
People need to know who they should contact in order to solve their problems, Alagaratnam said.
But outside of increased engagement with civic society on the part of the LAC, the experts advocated for schools to include legal education in their curricula. This way, they claimed, everybody would benefit later in life by having some essential legal knowledge.
Law is a natural corollary to civics and some officials argued that these two subjects could be taught together.
Information on the legal system ought to be given from a very young age at schools and that ought to be combined with civics education, said Udagama.
Pieris reasoned that law, civics, and the basics of the constitution should be folded into one class so that young people grasp the basic concepts of the law.
De Silva, for his part, noted that children must be taught what constitutes a crime.
As far as children are concerned, they must know that the law is there to protect them. How are they going to report crimes if they are not taught how We can teach them in schools and the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice should get together with the BASL to prepare the curricula, he said.
Another option some of the experts pointed to was to increase dissemination of legal information through the Internet.
Though many citizens still do not have access to the web, others could benefit from a system that groups all ordinances, acts, and amendments into one website.
These possible solutions are not yet being put in place, but it is safe to say that those in the legal profession are keenly aware of the publics dearth of legal knowledge.
Through increased effort and better planning, I am sure we could educate the public on these matters, said de Silva.

Landmark to long for
We had only walked about 100 meters into the seaside district of Colombo known as Fort, as far as the colonial clock tower, before having to turn around and walk back out. This neighborhood, the oldest and most historic in the city, has been a militarized zone since 1996, when a bomb-laden truck exploded in front of the Central Bank, killing 91 people and wounding over 1400.
Fort was the first neighborhood we visited in Colombo. After a marathon 36 hours of travel, we still had few hours to kill before we could check into the hotel. The lack of sleep was affecting our powers of reasoning, and we decided to go out exploring, instead of finding a cafe in which to rest. This is going to be great! We were running on fumes; the excitement of being in a new country. Hahaha! We can rest when were dead! Lets go! The nearly manic level of energy would last for about fifteen minutes.
Fort is the financial center of Sri Lanka, where many of the islands banks are headquartered. Its also home to Colombos modern architectural landmark: a pair of twin towers which shoot into the sky, dwarfing the neighboring buildings and dominating the skyline. Hmm conspicuous twin towers in the nations financial capital. On seeing a big sign boasting their name, I thought the sleep-deprivation must be causing hallucinations.
Gripped by the urge to quickly distance ourselves from these towers, we soon arrived at the doors of Cargills, a red, block-long brick building which had been the islands grandest department store back in colonial days. We stepped inside, encountered a paltry assortment of desks selling things like notebooks and knockoff handbags, and stepped right back out. The building is impressive from the outside, anyway.
By the time we arrived at the citys harbor, on the northern end of Fort, we were full-fledged zombies. The harbor was another area barricaded behind militarized security, and totally inaccessible. Gargh, I remarked to Jrgen. Care Jrgen considered and, after a moments contemplation replied, No care. Gargh! Jrgen want rest! Well said, and I was in total agreement. Luckily, we were right next to the Grand Oriental, an historic hotel established in 1837. The fourth-floor bar offered an incredible view over the harbor, and cold, life-restoring beer. It was a great place to end our tour through Fort, which must be among the strangest neighborhoods of Sri Lanka.

A LIFE FREE FROM SUFFERING
Is a life free from all physical suffering possible I came across a statement Physical pain is inevitable but the suffering from it optional. What a statement!! Unfortunately, the writer does not tell how one could arrive at such a state. Physical suffering is something which we all have to undergo at some stage in our lives and we all know only too well the agony of such suffering. I will try to present some ideas on this issue.
I think we all accept that all physical suffering occurs to our bodies. When that happens we say I am in pain. If you connect the two statements, you will see that there is an underlying assumption I am the body. Please note that, it is an assumption. As such, the entire question of physical pain rests on the validity of this single statement. If it is true, no matter who says what, there is no escape from physical suffering. The inquiry into the validity of this statement has been generalized by framing the question Who am I which is the corner stone of a meditation known as Atma Vichara or Self Inquiry. The culmination of this inquiry apparently is, the total disappearance of all thoughts and consequently the body and the world which are creations of the thought process leaving, the sole reality Pure Consciousness. My interpretation of the beautiful statement BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM is just that.
In ancient time, the wise men of India got together and posed themselves this question What is it when known, everything else is known The answer they came up with Yes, the answer to the question Who am I
You may say, Ok, so it is all very nice but has anyone ever come to a state free from all physical suffering The answer is Yes!! As far as I know only one man has come to such a state. He is Ramana Maharishi. The incidents that happened in this context in his life are so incredible that one would never believe them if not for the fact that he lived only about 70 years ago and every incident in his life is documented almost on a daily basis and is available for anyone to see at his Ashram at Tiruvannamale.
Personally speaking, no matter how much you know, with all due respect to scientific knowledge, as long as you dont know the answer to the only relevant question, experientially verified of course Who am I so long you will be living a life on a false basis and suffer untold physical pain as a consequence.
As the ultimate prize, the realization of the answer to that one single question would, in my view, terminate the Rebirth Process and lead to the ending of Samsara and consequently to the ending of all suffering forever.

Minister resolves foreign tennis coachs issue, for now
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara called upon a meeting with the Sri Lanka Tennis Association officials at the Sports Ministry yesterday to sort out the controversial sacking of Dutch coach Eric Pietersz by SLTA before his contract termination.
Pietersz was contracted for two years by SLTA and his contract is due to expire at the end of December 2017.
Pietersz was contracted for a national level program by SLTA and the problems erupted when SLTA decided to terminate his service midway citing that he failed to meet their expectations and also on a disciplinary matter.
The Minister made several recommendations to sort out this dragging problem between the SLTA and a group of parents whose children are training under Pietersz.
The Minister requested SLTA to extend Pieterszs services for another two-three months and evaluate his progress.
He also appointed a ministry representative to coordinate issues between parents and SLTA. The Sports Minister assured SLTA that his Ministry would continuously fund Rs 200,000 per month for Pieterszs coaching and recommended an increase of 25 percent on players fee to be borne by the parents to continue the coaching program. The Minister also met some parents who were present soon after the meeting and apprised them of the decisions taken.
After the meeting SLTA vice president Sohan Patrick said, on the request of Sports Minister, SLTA will sign a new contract with Pietersz for the evaluation period and continuation of the program will depend on how successful his coaching will be as there has been a gradual decline of students over a period.
We thank the Minister for reducing SLTAs burden by increasing parents share of the fees and help us reach an amicable settlement on this issue, said Patrick.

New defense post for Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka

Cabinet Co-spokesperson Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today there was the possibility that Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka would be appointed to a post that would allow him to oversee all of the defense establishments in the country.
While the Cabinet Co-spokesperson declined to offer more details on the powers the post would be vested with, he did say the President has broached the subject with the Regional Development Minister, who had shown his acquiescence.
Dr. Senaratne said the move was with the idea of instilling more discipline in the light of continued protests over varied issues.
If Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka takes up the post he will be charged with overseeing the tri-forces, including anti-riot squads and the Special Task Force.
Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka, who was Army Commander during the final stages of the civil war, was briefly appointed Chief of Defense Staff in aftermath, in 2009.

NFF, JO to hold joint May Day rally
National Freedom Front would hold its May Day Rally jointly with the Joint Opposition at the Galle Face green, said former NFF Parliamentarian Mohammad Musammil.
He said they would support the four struggles; the struggle of the working class, the struggle of the farmers, and the struggle for protecting the motherland that have already been initiated against this government. He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the NFF party Head Office in Battaramulla.
Musammil said they would work together with the main aim of toppling this government which attempts to betray the energy security of this country to India and sell the natural resources and the public assets.
"The UNP government would attempt to hand over the Oil Tank Farms in Trincomalee to India although it has promised the trade unions not to do so," Musammil said. "The energy security in a country is as important as its defence. But this government attempts to hand them over to India as they agreed before the January 8 election," he said.
He added that the government has not been able to provide reasonable compensation to the victims of the Meethotamulla tragedy as well as they had failed to provide reasonable compensation to the victims of the blast at the Salawa armoury.
"Today the farmers are facing a critical situation due to the lack of water. Even if they cultivated, they would not be able to fetch a proper price for their harvest. But the rice price in the market is very high," Musammil said.

Nimali determined to give better display in second leg
Sri Lankas Nimali Liyanarachchi who gave a disappointing display in the 800 metres event of the Asian Grand Prix first leg in Jinhua is determined to make amends and win a medal in the second leg which will be worked off in Jiashen, Eastern China on April 27.
Nimali finished a disappointing fifth with a time of 2 minutes 08:47 seconds in the first leg.
It was a huge disappointment for Nimali who had won the 800 metres event in the Asian Grand Prix on three successive occasions. She set up a Sri Lanka record in the 800 metres events in the National Sports Festival held in Jaffna finishing the event in a time of 2 minutes 03:50 seconds but she was unable to improve on it at recent meets.
Nimali said that she needed time to get accustomed to the cold climate in China and is confident of winning the Gold medal in the 800 metres event in the second leg by overcoming Chinas Wang Chen who won the gold medal in a time of 2 minutes 03:25 seconds in the first leg and Indias Luca Tinto who won the Silver medal in a time of 2 minutes 03.59 seconds.
Nimalis coach Sujith Nilantha said that Nimalis poor display in the first leg was due to lack of practice and her inability to get accustomed to the cold climate but she should come off with flying colours in the second leg on Thursday.
Meanwhile, short distance runner Himasha Eshan who won the Silver medal in the mens 100 metres event is confident of winning the Gold medal in the event in the second leg on April 27.

Ninety percent of local doctors oppose GMOAs actions: SB
Almost 90 percent of local doctors oppose the irresponsible activities of the GMOA, said Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake.
Addressing a press conference held at the Wattegama Vocational Training Institute for the Disabled, the minister said that President Maithripala Sirisena had given a proper solution to the SAITM issue. Accordingly, SAITM students will gain clinical training at Homagama and Awissawella hospitals, and will be called upon to sit for a special examination after passing out, he said.
The Neville Fernando Hospital would be taken over by the government and its ownership will be board-based, he added. SAITM agreed to this solution. The minister said the GMOA had opposed this solution too.
The objective of the GMOA was to prevent students passing out from private medical colleges from practising in the country. Sri Lankan students go to universities abroad to study medicine, paying millions of rupees, but some of these foreign universities lack facilities available in our schools, leaving aside SAITM.
The GMOA conducted campaigns against SAITM, fearing that students passing out from it would pose a threat to their private channelling practice, minister Dissanayake said.

UPFA Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga yesterday said no Joint Opposition (JO) parliamentarian will go to Getambe for the SLFP May Day rally but instead will head to the Galle Face Green for the rally to be held under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Speaking to the media in Colombo Ranatunga said JO members were already active in the provinces to bring large crowds to the Galle face from all corners of the country.
Ranatunga said the JO rally will go down in history as one of the most successful held by an opposition group.
He said JO members will not fear threats or intimidation and will head to the Galle Face in their numbers on May 1. Ranatunga said he does not see the possibility of JO and SLFP members in the government teaming up together for the May Day in the current context.
He said the SLFP members in the JO knew the desire of the party members and supporters and were always willing to make any sacrifice to fulfil their expectations.

Pentagon chief warns of tough year for Afghanistan
AFGHANISTAN: US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned of another tough year in Afghanistan as he arrived on an unannounced visit Monday, hours after his Afghan counterpart resigned over a deadly Taliban attack that triggered anger and left the embattled army in disarray.
Paying his first visit to Afghanistan as Pentagon chief, Mattis met with President Ashraf Ghani and other officials and US military commanders.
Were under no illusions about the challenges associated with this mission, he said at a press conference in Kabul with General John Nicholson, US commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan.
2017 is going to be another tough year for the valiant Afghan security forces and the international troops who have stood, and will continue to stand, shoulder-to-shoulder with Afghanistan against terrorism, he said.
His arrival came after a Taliban attack Friday on an Afghan military base which left more than 100 soldiers killed or wounded.
It shows why we stand with the people of this country against such heinous acts perpetrated by ... this barbaric enemy, Mattis said. Nicholson recently called for a few thousand more troops but Mattis would not be drawn on extra forces to help battle the resurgent militants, who are gearing up for the spring fighting season.
The Pentagon chief, who served in Afghanistan, is compiling an assessment for President Donald Trump on the brutal and seemingly intractable conflict.
As you know, President Trump has directed a review of our policy in Afghanistan as the new administration takes hold in Washington.
This dictates an ongoing dialogue with Afghanistans leadership and thats why I came here, he said. Mattis arrived as Afghan security forces, already paying a heavy price against the Taliban, faced chaos with the resignations of Defence Minister Abdullah Habibi and army chief Qadam Shah Shaheem.
The resignations, along with the announcement of a corps commanders reshuffle, followed fury over the Taliban assault on an army base outside the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
Gunmen in soldiers uniforms and armed with suicide vests entered the base in army trucks and opened fire at unarmed troops in one of the deadliest-ever Taliban attacks on an Afghan military target.
Afghan authorities have so far ignored calls to break down the official toll of more than 100 soldiers killed or wounded. Some local officials have put the number of dead alone as high as 130.
The raid, the latest in a series of brazen Taliban assaults, underscores the insurgents growing strength more than 15 years since they were ousted from power by the US invasion of 2001.
Up to 10 army personnel are being questioned as suspects, a military spokesman attached to the base said, amid fears it could have been an insider attack.
At least four of them had valid passes to the base and had previously trained there, a security source told AFP.
Afghans have slammed the government over the attack, though Habibi told a press conference Monday his resignation was voluntary.
Nobody in the world has been able to prevent such attacks, he said of the base assault. It is an intelligence war and a war on terrorism. It is very difficult.

PFC to ensure transparent financial system: PM
The establishment of the Public Finance Committee will provide the mechanism for a more vibrant and transparent financial system in the country in the future, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He also said the introduction of the new system of Sectoral Oversight Committees will further strengthen Parliament.
The Premier made these observations at the opening ceremony of the Regional Meeting of Young Parliamentarians of the Asia-Pacific held in Colombo yesterday.
The Premier added that the power of public finance has not been enhanced in the past few years and Sri Lanka had to face numerous problems due to this fact.
Sri Lanka is currently in a debt-trap as a result of actions carried out during the last five years especially concerning the control of public funds. Parliament was disregarded and weakened as was the tendency in the past, by the use of executive powers, he added. The Prime Minister said the government was now in the process of changing this situation and strengthening Parliament.
This will include the introduction of Oversight Committees, which is already in practice in the US Congress and the EU Parliament. There will also be a Special Parliamentary Budget Office.
The mandate of the J R Jayewardene Centre will be expanded to include research and training for parliamentarians thereby forming a backup office to Parliament and core political training on the enactment of legislation, parliamentary conventions and procedures, ethics and good practice for new legislators. The Oversight Committees will further strengthen public finance. It was proved during the last election that we need a new Constitution. We have moved a resolution in Parliament for converting the House into a Constitutional Assembly, marking the formal inauguration of the process of making a new Constitution. There is a Steering Committee which will send in the interim reports, and the Assembly which will debate. So once we have a final draft, we will send it to be passed by the Constitutional Assembly and send it to Parliament, the Prime Minister.
In addition, measures have been taken to strengthen Parliament resources. Accordingly, new buildings will be established in Parliament. Women Parliamentarians Caucus has also set up to facilitate female MPs.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the theme of this conference, The role of young Parliamentarians in Advancing Inclusive and Peaceful Societies and Preventing Violent Extremism, is the most relevant and opportune topic as that is being unleashed each day in all parts of the world today. As a result, todays world is replete with armed conflict, terrorism, poverty, hunger, displacement, the refugee problem, forces migration, political instability and social disintegration. Therefore, young parliamentarians have a significant role to play in this regard. This conference will explore ways in which young parliamentarians in the Asia-Pacific could cooperate and interact with each other to facilitate knowledge transfers on preventing violent extremism.
This will help them to prevent violent extremism in the region.
Inter-Parliamentary Union President Saber Chowdhury said young people must be firmly part of the formal political processes to effectively contribute to preventing violent extremism. Increasing youth participation in parliaments and the number of young MPs is both a way to harness the talents of youth to address extremism and its socio-economic drivers, and also an antidote to combat youth marginalization that leads to radicalization.
UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Sri Lanka Una McCauley said, Empowered youth are the engine of the progress we all seek. Through our work, we continually remind that young people today are more connected, creative and informed than any previous generation.

Photographic puzzle unlocked
An extraordinary picture taken in 1948 by David Chim' Seymour, one of Magnum Photos' co-founders, has since been seen by millions: first, it was published in LIFE magazine where the caption read in part Children's wounds are not all outward. Those made in the mind by years of sorrow will take years to heal." Then it was selected by Edward Steichen for his legendary exhibition The Family of Man. This image of Tereska drawing her home has fascinated many and has become emblematic of World War II.
In the Spring of 1948, when Chim was sent by UNICEF as a special correspondent to report on children in five European countries, 13 million children of Europe had survived World War II. They were homeless and orphans, many of them physically wounded as well as mentally traumatized. As a new retrospective of Chim's photographs opens in Israel at Tel Aviv's Beit Hatfutsot Museum, it seems like a perfect time in history to take a new look at Tereska's picture.
In a school for backward and psychologically upset children, as Chim states in his story's captions, Tereska, then seven or eight years old, is standing in front of a blackboard. As we see in Chim's contact sheets from a pinned notice on the blackboard, the teachers' assignment was To jest dom- This is home.
That is what children were supposed to draw, but Tereska could only trace in chalk a tangle of frantic lines. Her haunted eyes reflect her confusion and anguish. Tereska's identity has remained a mystery for almost 70 years.
Initiated by Gregor Siebenkotten, director of the Tereska Foundation, a thorough research on Tereska has just been carried by Patryk Graewicz, a Polish researcher, and Aneta Wawrzyczak, a human-rights journalist. Matthew Murphy, an editor at Magnum Photos's New York office and myself assisted them from this end with information on Chim's life history and archive.
Early in September 1948, Chim arrived in Poland, his native country and the last he visited on his mission (after Italy, Greece, Austria and Hungary). He had found out that his parents and most of his family has been killed by the Nazis.
After traveling to Otwock, 25 miles from the capital, where he summered as a child, he went back to Warsaw, where he photographed the ruins of the Jewish ghetto and children on Stawki Street. They were walking home from their school, the only building that had not been razed during the Warsaw bombings.
The captions and contact sheets of his story on Polish children, shot with both 35mm and Rolleiflex, let us follow the photographer on a mid-September morning of 1948. Chim first photographed at the Legia Warszawa soccer stadium, then walked among Warsaw's ruins, shooting on the way. He chanced upon a group of schoolchildren pushing wheelbarrows full of rubble, and he followed them, finding several other children working on their garden plot as occupational therapy. He photographed children from the same school standing in front of a group of buildings.

Pietersz stands vindicated through the performance of his students
We refer to the article in the Daily News titled Foreign coach Pietersz failed in his task  SLTA, which was published on 24 April.
The facts are that amongst the players coached by Eric Pietersz is a member of the Junior Federation Cup team, a reservist for the World Tennis Juniors and currently five trialists for the ITF Under 12 tournament in Nepal.
In addition in the four tournaments held this year for ranking purposes, players from the squad trained by Eric Pietersz have performed exceptionally well as demonstrated in their achievements.
National Tournament Tamil Union (Feb. 2017):
Winner Girls U-10 (Ruvi Lewkebandara), Winner Girls U-12 (Heshani Imanga), Winner Girls U-14 (Oneli Perera), Winner Girls U-16 (Senuri Alexander), Winner Boys U-14 (Thehan Wijemanne), Winner Girls U-10 doubles (Ruvi Lewkebandara), Winner Girls U-14 doubles (Oneli Perera), Runner-up Girls U-14 (Heshani Imanga), Runner-up Girls U-14 doubles (Heshani Imanga/Tharani Alexander), Runner-up Boys U-14 doubles (Thehan Wijemanne/Sahan Weerasooriya)
National Tournament Otters (March 2017):
Winner Girls U-12 (Heshani Imanga), Winner Girls U-14 (Oneli Perera), Runner-up Boys U-12 (Anujaya Abeywickrama), Runner-up Girls U-14 doubles (Oneli Perera/Sethmi Sumanaweera), Runner-up Mixed Doubles (Senuri Alexander)
Hill Club Nuwara Eliya Tournament (April 2017):
Winner Girls U-12 (Heshani Imanga), Winner Girls U-16 (Savini Jayasuriya), Winner Girls U-16 doubles (Savini Jayasuriya/Senuri Alexander), Runner-up Girls U-18 (Savini Jayasuriya), Runner-up womens Open Doubles (Savini Jayasuriya/Senuri Alexander), Runner-up Open Mixed Doubles (Senuri Alexander)
Bandarawela Tournament (April 2017):
Winner Girls U-12 (Heshani Imanga), Winner Girls U-14 (Oneli Perera), Winner Girls U-14 doubles (Oneli Perera/Sethmi Sumanaweera), Runner-up Girls U-16 (Senuri Alexander), Runner-up Girls U-14 Doubles (Preethika Chandramohan/Ashanti Seneviratne), Runner-up Girls U-10 Green Ball Pro (Ruvi Lewkebandara), Runner-up Girls U-10 Green Ball Achiever (Anielka Nobert)
It is noteworthy that amongst those who were winners of events are those who had not won any event previously.
The SLTA contends the coachs package costs Rs 800,000 and is therefore a waste of money. More than half of this cost is met through fees ranging from Rs 3000 per month for outstation players to Rs 25,000 per month for full time players. And the value of the investment is clearly borne out by results.
The SLTA commenced this program promising two years of uninterrupted training. However the SLTA decided to terminate the program in October last year after just eight months, without prior notice to parents/students, without any explanation for termination and without any discussion with parents of students who committed to this program. However, following appeals by the parents to the Sports Minister, the Minister directed the SLTA to continue the coaching program for a further six months and made a monthly contribution of Rs 200,000. Therefore the SLTA has only to bear a cost of Rs 200,000 a month which is surely not too much for a national association dedicated to the promotion of the sport.
Further in order to continue the program, parents have proposed to increase the fees by a further 25 percent. This is because Eric Pieterszs coaching programming is an excellent one, which needs to be sustained. It is the best that the SLTA has introduced both in terms of training and equal access for children of all backgrounds who show promise. However the SLTA is determined to end the program, without substantive reasons and without taking into account the willingness of the parents to make further financial contribution to sustain it.
The parents of all students in the program are glad that the Sports Minister has seen value in this program and has supported it so far and believe that its continuation will not only benefit children who are part of the program, but uplift the standard of tennis overall.

Podi Team champs at Red Bull Tuk It
Podi Team from the Sabaragamuwa Province took on a more strategic and calculated path through the rally and emerged champions of the Red Bull Tuk It 2017. 720 participants in 240 tuk-tuks set out at the dead of night from the start point of Thalduwa Kelani Valley sports ground on April 8 to compete across two provinces, covering 20 cities, 190 kilometres and 15 challenges in a bid to reach Nuwara Eliya on the April 9.
The rally, which lasted 21 hours, tested all teams equally as they battled fatigue, emotions, challenges and most of all the terrain of Sri Lanka which proved it is one to be reckoned with.
Podi Team remained calm and followed route instructions presisely to gain the most points. Completing 90 percent of the task through the rally, Podi Team pulled to the top of the pack and from the final checkpoint at the Ambewela New Zealand Farm to Nuwara Eliya saw them pick up pace as they saw their finish line.
Team Eksath Threerodha Ratha Sangamaya came in second whilst Team Ambalangoda secured the third place. Team Pink Lions from Maharagama was awarded the prize for most creative tuk-tuk.
We are so excited to win. The tasks and the route of Red Bull Tuk It was very challenging for us both physically and mentally including the fact that the race started at midnight which is an added difficulty. However, the whole team played their part well, from the navigators who sat in the back to the driver and all of us knew we wanted a podium finish whatever the difficulty is.
It took us a long time to get to the first task and we were a bit nervous about making mistakes during the challenges but we just kept pushing and I guess it turned out well for us.
Overall, I think this was a really good result and a great rally for us to take part in especially the Kithulgala stage. This had to be our favourite portion of the competition. We are definitely looking forward to taking part next year and defending our title, said Podi Team, winners of Red Bull Tuk It 2017.
Red Bull Tuk It is a rally style challenge that utilizes Sri Lankas most used form of transportation  the tuk-tuk. The course is not necessarily physical, but by accomplishing tasks, which are a combination of active adventure, getting to grips with tasks of local traditions and then the ultimate satisfaction of reaching the end brings the essence of what the project is about. The course this year consisted of 3 stages, 15 challenges and 12 checkpoints from Avisawella to Nuwara Eliya.
The rally does not stop there. For all the latest information from the event please visit our Facebook Page  Red Bull Tuk It or visit Red Bull Content Pool.

Poetess unlike any other
The first book of poems by Dr Paramita Mukherjee Mullick is simply called Life A Collection of Poems. There are 60 poems at various length in this little book of 92 pages published by Virgin Leaf Books in Mumbai. The poems are neatly grouped together under the titles Relations, Reflections, Inspirations, Journeys and The Light. It shows her progress from something closer to her to something sublime.
To understand her poems we should know something about the poet. Although I had a brief encounter with her at Udaipur Literary Festival in India last year, which was impressive. Watching her at close quarters of her performance reading her poems and her unassuming and affable nature, I felt that Indian writers and poets should be noticed by us Lankans for the variety of talents flourishing there.
Paramita born in Bangla (West Bengal) now lives in Mumbai with her academic lawyer husband and upcoming young poet, her daughter. She is a scientist with a Ph.D. in Genetic Toxicology from the University of Calcutta.
A note on her reads: she is now heling in the quality management of schools and junior colleges More than 15 scientific papers in international and national journals
As a rule I do not give an opinion on the content of a book of poetry because the poet has the right to say what he or she wants to say. Instead I pick up some lines in ones poetry which I think are fresh and somewhat original in expression.
Here are some:
a What else, but you to vent out my anger when I am angry on the world, emotions to unfurl
a In this world of stone and grime, its nice to know that we each other could find
a In love, thoughts count. The joy of life encompassed in love, has no end. Life ends, but love never ends.
a Were the clouds made up of gold There was a streak of fire across the sky. The mesmerizing beauty made me sigh. The red sun was throwing its light on the clouds. The silhouette of the dark clouds behind, a greater beauty I am yet to find.
a The blending of colours, the cobalt blue, the golden and then the red. The ground was a dark bed. I loved flying up and up high. With the kites and eagles upon high. With no cares of the world. The mind was not in a swirl.
a Have you ever seen a dormant volcano Fretting and fuming within but calm outside. Have you ever felt the pain of a dormant volcano Full of molten lava inside, but calm outside. The red hot lava wants to be released. The bubbling liquid wants to come out. It knows not why it is trapped. It knows not why it is enwrapped. (Please read the rest of the lines in this poem)
a Being happy with little things is no vice
Finally I wish to quote in full the last poem in the book as it borders on the sublime realization
The golden rays of the Sun fell on the ground.
Sheets of gold spreading from the clouds.
A ring like radiance around your head was found.
Was it You that I saw coming out of the clouds
A circling light in the sky.
A halo of light in the sky.
Was it You I found
I was awestruck and looked around.
The white clouds floating by.
The golden lined clouds in the sky.
I looked and looked in surprise.
Wait You in disguise

Poor show from govt institutions at LBO/LBR Brand Summits
Though free attendance invitations were offered to several public sector organisations to attend Lanka Business Online (LBO) infrastructure and digital summits, only a handful of state institutions responded, Lanka Business Online (LBO) Summit Curator Founder and Director Lakshman Bandaranayake said.
Speaking at the fifth LBO/LBR Brand Summit announcement launch press conference he said the Urban Development Authority, Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Tourism and Ports Authority responded and gained knowledge from the summit.
He said health, education and transport sectors could gain valuable knowledge from these seminars but these opportunities offered free to them are not being used. He said that though Sri Lanka is fast moving in digital adaptation, government institutions have not geared up to meet the peoples demands.
He said there are over 2.6 million mobile SIM cards and over 35% of the population use internet. In a addition there are over 450,000 Facebook uses and 40% of the population has smart phones.
He also said though banks and travel and air service companies use this to their advantage, even the FMCG sector is backwards
into moving in this area. He said that even in companies, employees are reluctant to move to the digital era. May be the older work force due to retire soon dont want to move into the digital era as they dont want to take risks and unnecessary education (which they think). Bandaranayake also added that it is the younger work force that are tech savvy and the older work force doesnt want to learn from them and dont respect their changes. However this is an unfortunate situation.
He also cautioned that not adapting to digitalisation may even result in the closure of companies (specially family owned) which is happening all over the world.
Lanka Business Online, LBO, will be hosting their fifth consecutive annual edition of LBR LBO Brand Summit on Wednesday the May 3, at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand Hotel. LBO has earned a fine reputation as Sri Lankas foremost conference host on technology, marketing, management, infrastructure and economy. LBR LBO Brand Summit, over a period of five years, has now become the most sought after thought leadership engagement on transforming marketing through technology and analytics.
The LBR LBO Brand Summit provides a forum for corporate executives from all branches of industry, business and academia to gain insights to how digital could be leveraged to redefine, re-imagine, and reinvent the relationship between brands and consumers. said Bandaranayake.

President Sirisena is inspiration to Parliamentary democracies  IPU President
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) President Saber Chowdhury said President Maithripala Sirisena has given an inspiration to those who work to strengthen Parliamentary democracies.
Chowdhury made this statement when he called on President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. He appreciated the anti-tobacco campaign of President Sirisena.
He said steps by President Sirisena to dilute executive powers of the Presidency and vest them with Parliament are important steps towards strengthening democracy.
Pointing out that in some countries, Parliaments have been marginalised by Executive Presidents and in some other countries, government terms have been extended through referendums, the IPU President said, Sri Lanka is a beacon of hope for other parliamentary democracies.
President Sirisena said he would extend fullest support to IPU programmes to promote youth and women participation in government and Parliament. He said steps have been initiated to introduce a womens quota for local government elections.
Chowdhury said although 50 percent of the world population is below the age of 30, only 1.9 percent of the Parliamentarians in the world are below 30 years. President Sirisena said intelligent youths should take more governing and Parliamentary responsibilities.
Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake was also present.

President urged to revoke gazette notification
A statement endorsed by 38 civil society organisations and 2, 680 individuals requesting President Maithripala Sirisena to review and revoke the Gazette Notification No. 2011/34 was sent to the President on April 22.
The gazette declares 40,030 hectares of land in Musali DS division in the Mannar District as Mavillu forest reserve under 3A of the Forest Conservation Ordinance.
As a result of the gazette notification, a number of villages in Musali including Karadikkuli, Marichchukatti, Wilaththikulam, Periyamurippu, Mavillu and Weppal will be seriously affected as families risk losing land they have traditionally claimed.
The statement, while reiterating the need for a concerted effort to ensure protection of forests, highlights the contents of the gazette notification and the manner the gazette was drawn up failing to take into account the rights of people from the area and the history of the issue of land claims.
The statement notes that unless corrective action is taken, there could be serious repercussions for the Northern Muslims forcibly expelled by the LTTE in 1990 attempting to resettle and rebuild their lives after the brutal war, and have a knock on effect on post-war reconstruction and relations between ethnic minorities and the State.
It also highlights a wider problem in the State's failure to address occupation of land by state agencies including the military and the Forrest Department in the North and East and calls for action to recognise the rights and claims of multiple war-affected communities.

Project approvals need to be fast tracked - CCI
A mega project needs to get eighteen different approvals from different agencies which is really frustrating and it takes more than six months to get the prpject off the ground, Construction Industry of Sri Lanka (CCI) Chamber President Dr.Surath Wickramasinghe said Monday.
The planning process needs to be fast tracked definitely he said addressing media after the launch of the CCI Trade and Business Directory 2017/18 and the website.
Recently the Urban Development Authority had taken over the issuing of building permits from the Colombo Municipal Council and all councils within the megalopolis area and the UDA Chairman Dr Jagath Munasinghe had assured that from end of March if the application was properly completed and submitted that the approval will be issued within a month. That was a very positive step if implemented, Wickramasinghe said.
It is very refreshing to also see the skyline in Colombo with so many cranes visible that clearly indicates the development potential of the city, Dr Wickramasinghe said.
This is a very healthy sign for our construction industry. But when the port city construction begins, the picture will change for the better.
In the housing and commercial sector about 50 to 60 projects has already received approval and so many huge towers are coming up. People invest in these because they know how to make money out of it.
He said however there were concerns whether the road infrastructure can cope and all these offices and apartments will have parking issues. But water and power could be eventually provided he said.
But the drainage and flooding problem is what our chamber is concerned about. We are of the view that the flood water should not be diverted or pumped to the sea. We feel thats a huge waste of a very valuable resource.
The government should take steps with the assistance of the irrigation department to find ways on how to divert flood water into safe areas within the Western Province. For example in Malaysia there is a tunnel nearly two kilometers in length during the dry month it is used to transport vehicles and rest of the time during Monsoon it is a drain and all the citys water comes into this tunnel and diverted and collected somewhere else. That is the type of thing we must have, Wickramasinghe said.
President elect Ranjith Gunatilleke said to overcome the delay in approvals for construction projects, discipline needs to be instilled in the statutory systems. When you asked those institutions what they say is the application itself is not perfect.
They come out with various deficiencies of the application. It is good if applications can be made online and get the approval online. Gunatilleke said there should be a time bar when making applications that within so many weeks and days the approval should be given.

Responding to the recent statement made by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) in connection with publishing newspaper advertisements on behalf of SAITM, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated that there is nothing wrong in communicating state policies to the public and educating them through publishing advertisements.
According to Minister Senaratne, the GMOA did not say anything when the previous regime did the same and published newspaper advertisements using public funds. During that time many such advertisements published on birthdays, on openings etc. but nothing was said.
Meanwhile, the GMOA held a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo and made a request from the relevant government authorities to bring a final and real solution to the SAITM issue through the set of proposals presented to the Government over a month ago by the GMOA, the Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers' Associations (FMTAs).
The GMOA also pointed out that the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister have brought another set of proposals with the intention of protecting a fraudulent company owned by an individual making the existing issue more complicated. Those were not the Government's proposals. The two Ministers purposely misled the judiciary by not presenting actual and true facts, the GMOA said.

Sharapova rags-to-riches journey resumes in Stuttgart
Stuttgart: From the shadow of Chernobyl's nuclear wasteland to international super-stardom and from penniless arrival in the United States, without a word of English, to a fortune of $200 million.
It may sound like the stuff of Hollywood dreams, but the story of Maria Sharapova is a testament to the power of one individual to make it, whatever the odds, whatever the controversy, whatever people think.
On Wednesday in Stuttgart, the 30-year-old will return from a 15-month doping suspension to open the next chapter.
When she takes to the court to face Roberta Vinci, it will be to the consternation of many opponents and the relief, albeit privately, of a women's tour left flagging by the absence of Serena Williams, probably Sharapova's only serious rival in the arena-filling business.
Sharapova shot to international fame as a giggly 17-year-old Wimbledon winner in 2004 -- the third youngest player to conquer the All England Club's famous grass courts.
She would go on to win the Australian and US Opens while claiming two titles at the French Open, despite famously likening her movement on Roland Garros's crushed red brick to a "cow on ice".
Siberia-born Sharapova first picked up a racquet at the age of four in Sochi, where her Belarus-born parents had settled after escaping the deadly clutches of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
Spotted by Martina Navratilova, she was encouraged to move to Nick Bollettieri's Florida academy, the proving ground of Andre Agassi and Monica Seles.
Father Yuri and the seven-year-old Maria left for the US in 1994 with just $700 (644 euros) to their names.
Yuri took odd jobs like dishwashing to finance his daughter's dreams although visa restrictions meant mother Yelena was back in Russia, separated from her daughter for two years.
When Sharapova was nine, the mighty IMG group spotted her talent and funded the $35,000 fees required for the Bollettieri school.
She made her professional debut at 14 in 2001 and by 2003 reached the world top 50. She won her first tour titles in Japan and Quebec.
Then in 2004, her Wimbledon final triumph over Williams made her an overnight international celebrity.
One year later, she became the first Russian woman to be ranked number one in the world while, in 2006, she won her second major at the US Open.
But in 2007 and 2008, she began her long, on-off battle with shoulder trouble.
She still had time to win the 2008 Australian Open before a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, including missing the US Open and Beijing Olympics.
A 10-month absence from the sport, as she recuperated from surgery, saw her ranking slip to 126, but she was back in 2012, capturing the French Open to become the 10th woman to complete a career Grand Slam and adding Olympic silver to her resume that year.
Her 2014 French Open title was another high after a dispiriting injury low.
More injury troubles followed before the bombshell announcement of her positive test for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open -- where she fell in the quarter-finals to Williams, her last match before her suspension.
With Williams, she has endured her most testing rivalry -- on and off the court.
The two famously exchanged personal insults over their love lives when Sharapova began a two-year romance with Bulgarian player Grigor Dimitrov, a rumoured previous suitor of the American.
Sharapova had previously been engaged to former Los Angeles Laker star Sasha Vujacic. She may have been unlucky in love, but Sharapova hit the jackpot in her commercial affairs. AFP

Alcohol, tobacco smoking and dangerous drugs are the three substances that come under the theme substance abuse. Of these alcohol and tobacco smoking have been abused by notable characters, often the key protagonists in many Sri Lanka, Indian and Western films. The risks and the dangers of substance abuse are well known. The reasons why people drink alcohol or smoke are connected with individual, social and economic reasons or may be a mixture of all these factors.
Tension may be a precipitating factor especially in a commercialised society where there is competition in all aspects of social involvement. It is a common saying that people take a drink for anything. They drink when they are happy, sorry, cold, warm or idle. Idle man's mind is like a devil's workshop. So why not take a drink or light a cigarette. The social effects of substance abuse are ill health, economic degradation, poverty, family disruption and early death. These are caused by addiction (compulsive drinking/smoking/harmful drug use).
In all the films the destructive aspects of substance abuse are shown. In the well known India film Devadas one could have observed the cruel fate of the protogonist Nageswera Rao in the Tamil version and Sharouk Khan in the Hindi version. In Sinhala films like Parasatu Mal, Dahasak Situvili and Ektam Ge the protogonists lapse into substance abuse, mainly to smoking and alcohol abuse from unsolved individual tensions and problems in life.
Emotional instability, frustration and lack of confidence leading to mental disequilibrium could be the immediate causes. Drinking or smoking or combined drinking and smoking have become a life style in Dahasak Situvili, Ektam Ga and Parasatumal because of disrupted sensual attachments.
Even in the world famous films like The Robe and BenHur scenes of drinking are shown. Emperor Niro drinking wine while Rome was on fire is well known.
In Whos Afraid of Virginia, Woolf the key protogonists including Elisebeth Tayler behave abnormally and furiously. Creative films are not documentaries on substance abuse, but cinematic creations and the inclusion of scenes of substance abuse has been essential for character development and the cumulative aesthetic impact of the film concerned.
One should not expect all characters to be saints observing the five precepts. But an intelligent audience would no doubt understand the evil effects of substance abuse even just by merely seeing such a film. Such films offer a powerful message against substance abuse.
In Trisulsdeepa Tabawita's cinematic creation Putandia the subject of substance abuse is the basic issue. The preventive and protective role of a father to save his son from substance abuse is very successfully displayed in this film.
The handsome young protogonist Hemal Ranasingha in the Aadaranya Kathavak (Melody of Love) displays mental and physicla deterioration in health in a large measure. There are several scenes of smoking and alcohol abuse.
The audience quite appropriately enjoy this film with a great sympathy towards the protogonist's fate. The structure and organisation of the film have been quite impressive with the use of new technology and novel cinematic techniques. But the National Tobacco and Alcohol Authority has unsuccessfully made an appeal to courts for a ban on this film blaming that it promoted alcohol and tobacco abuse. The untimely death of the protogonist in this film because of smoking and alcohol abuse itself, is a powerful message against substance abuse.
There are statutary bodies, rules and regulations, special projects/programmes legal provisions and religious and voluntary organisations aimed at preventing substance abuse. While heroin, cannibis, opium, and hashish etc are banned drugs, alcohol and tobacco are not banned but discouraged from use. Successive governments have been increasing taxation on alcohol and tobacco. Messages of warning are printed on cigarette packs. As well as on electronic media scenes showing the use of alcohol and smoking.
The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Odinace is in action. A person in possession of over two grams of heroin can be sentenced to death. But still, the media report almost daily on the seizure of contraband by Customs officers.
There is a substance abuse depenmdence syndrome affecting the constant users of abused substances. The users are overpowered to continue using the abused substance. Withdrawal symptoms appear if they give up the abused substance.
They need increasing dose of the substance to experience the same effect. This is called tolererance. Taking the abused substance becomes the priority desire over other desires in ones life. These features have been well shown in the protogonist in Adaraneya Kothavak as well as in many other films of the past.

SLS to nab inferior steel sellers
The Institute of Sri Lanka Standards (SLS) is on the look out to continue to raid stores and institutions that are selling low quality steel to the market.
Recently the SLS sealed a steel storage facility in Colombo which contained low quality steel. They were imported from India.
An official from SLS said that today this is becoming major threat to the construction industry. He said the Sri Lanka construction industry had maintained high standers in planning and in executing construction. "Due to this only few incidents of building collapses were recorded."
Dr, K.S. Wanniarachchi,
Senior Lecturer/Structural Engineer
In addition to high standard of construction and labor and engineering skills one key element for this positive sentiment was that the use of high quality cement and steel rods for constructions.
"However recently we see a trend where cheap imported steel especially from India are being brought and dumped in Sri Lanka putting not only buildings but also lives at stake."
He recalled that in Bangladesh over 100 apparel workers died last year as a result of a building collapsing due to the use of low quality building materials."
Fortunately such things have not happened in Sri Lanka so far but if low quality steel is used in the future a repeat of Bangladesh can happen in Sri Lanka.
Unfortunately today mainly due to mass constructions inferior steel are not being identified and some of them are used for construction creating a huge danger.
Dr, K.S. Wanniarachchi, Senior Lecturer/Structural Engineer, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Ruhuna, Galle said that easy availability of cheaper imported steel products, extended raw material issues related to availability and prices of ores and coal, reduced operating margins etc, the steel industry in India has been on an average operating at about 60% capacity utilization level.
The secondary steelmaking route may not be comparable to the blast furnace route of steelmaking when it comes to quality. As a matter of fact, more than 50% of steel in India is made through the secondary route. Low amount of interest in modern technologies and weak infrastructural facilities lead to a process of steel making which is more time consuming, expensive and even yields inferior quality products. Such a situation has also forced us to import better quality steel from abroad.
He said advised that the best method for a constructor is to take a sample of Steel and get it tested before ordering and installing them in buildings.
He said that the University can offer this service to the public if given notice in advance.
He said that steel not only binds a building structure together but also helps to absorb tension. He said that in constitution terms steel can live separately but cement cannot live and be a building without steel. (SS)

Sri Lanka seeks to carve out niche in medical tourism
Rising numbers of tourists from abroad and a state-led campaign to expand medical tourism could attract further investment to Sri Lankas health care sector, creating additional opportunities for its hospitality industry in the process.
The countrys bid to become a centre for health and wellness is supported by improved connectivity and infrastructure, as well as its increased popularity as a tourism destination. Foreign arrivals were up 3.4% year-on-year in the first quarter, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
In a sector update released in February, local brokerage and research firm NDB Securities said medical tourism could drive new demand for health services, catalysed by the three private hospitals in the country that are accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI).
JCI accreditation, which certifies that a hospital meets the same rigorous standards as in the US, is among the top growth drivers of medical tourism in emerging markets, according to industry research firm Patients Beyond Borders.
Global market size
Some 14m people, it calculates, travel abroad each year expressly for medical treatment, from dentistry and transplants, to cancer and cosmetic surgery, spending a combined $3800-6000 per visit on medical care, transport and accommodation. It estimates this market is growing by 15-25% per year.
In a broader measure, revenues from medical tourism worldwide grew by 14% in 2015 to reach $563bn, according to the Global Wellness Institute, a figure that includes domestic and so-called secondary wellness tourists travelling primarily for non-medical reasons. Of this, $111bn was spent in the Asia-Pacific region, a lucrative and fast-growing market Sri Lanka hopes to tap.
Another advantage for Sri Lanka is that its top-five source countries for tourists  India, China, the UK, Germany and France  represent a significant and potentially lucrative market for health provision.
Since these already comprise a large chunk of foreign arrivals  about half of the 605,000 who came in the January-to-March period, according to government data  there is potential to market health services to them as well.
Development potential
The government has identified health tourism as a subsector that could help lift export earnings to the $20bn target it has set for 2020, building on existing tourism and health infrastructure.
To this end, it set up a Council for the Promotion of Medical Tourism in 2015, bringing together government officials, hospital directors and other sector stakeholders to discuss ways of developing the market, with its inaugural meeting held late that year.
Potential to develop the niche is clear, according to Ajith Tudawe, chairman of Durdans Hospital, one of the countrys oldest private health providers. Medical tourism is in its infancy, but has started out strongly with investments into cosmetic and dental care, he told OBG. In one promising development, he said private hospitals have pursued far greater utilisation of ICT, leading to better data-sharing and information transfer  a key service for attracting foreign patients.
In mid-March Lanka Hospitals renewed its agreement with MyDoctor, a web-based advisory service that allows patients to upload their medical records for anonymous consultations with a hospitals doctors, facilitating ease of access for international patients.
Such capacity building, Tudawe said, could have a positive impact on medical services and encourage improvements in the public health sector by raising standards and boosting competition.
Assessment and strategy
To better understand the current state of the market, the Export Development Board (EDB) commissioned an evaluation of the countrys medical tourism services at the end of 2016 by the US-based Medical Travel Quality Alliance.
Representatives of the alliance have begun to assess the quality of hospitals, clinics, traditional health facilities, hotels and spas, awarding international certification to those that comply with recognised standards and regulations.
At a meeting with the EDB at the start of the year, the alliance identified core strengths Sri Lanka can use to develop health tourism, including its established network of hospitals with modern facilities, a large pool of English-speaking medical professionals and its strong tourism base.
However, these strengths are being offset by other factors at present, the EDB said, including lack of a clear strategy to support health tourism, non-recognition of local service providers by international insurance firms and low brand awareness worldwide.
Economic impact
As the country pushes ahead with efforts to address barriers to medical tourism growth, doors should also be opened for operators in travel and hospitality, where there is potential for tie-ins with health service providers.
Hotels, resorts and other serviced accommodation could, for example, adapt their offerings to the needs of recuperating patients, such as special dietary foods, ease-of-mobility improvements, and access to medical and rehabilitation personnel.
While targeting the health and wellness segment would require some investment up-front, gaining a foothold in this market could bring strong advantages, including longer average stays, larger bookings for accompanying family and a higher share of clientele from the upper end of the tourism market.

SriLankan gets QAS with Flygreen carbon offset programme
SriLankan Airlines, has achieved the distinction of becoming one of only six airlines worldwide to obtain the Quality Assurance Standard (QAS) accreditation for its Voluntary Carbon Offset Programme, Flygreen.
SriLankan is now authorized to display the QAS Carbon Neutral Quality Mark, demonstrating that it is using the global best practices for carbon offsetting. QAS (www.qascarbonneutral.com) is an accreditation that is awarded following a comprehensive independent audit system for companies who wish to evaluate their carbon offsets against the high standards available. QAS audits involve a 40-point checklist to ensure that companies meet the very highest standards in the world in terms of carbon offsetting.
The Flygreen Programme (www.srilankan.com/environment) obtains the participation of the airlines passengers, who are given the opportunity of voluntarily donating a prefixed amount to offset the carbon footprintof their respective flight. These donations are then channelled through the International Air Transport Association (IATA),and are utilized to procure carbon offsets on behalf of SriLankan and neutralize the footprints.
At present the offsets are sourced from two Sri Lanka eco-ventures,the Hapugastenne Mini Hydro Project and Hulu Ganga Mini Hydro Project- in order to support the country and local eco-ventures.
Global aviation accounts for approximately 2% of the worlds human inducedcarbon emissions, making it increasingly vital for airlines to actively seek out methods to promote conservation and reduce their carbon footprint.

St. Marys, Dehiwala to restore its past sporting glory
St. Marys College, Dehiwala, an education institute with over 100-year history has a proud history of school sports like cricket, volleyball, wrestling, boxing and track and field events. Among these sports boxing and wrestling were prominent. During 60s and 70s which considered the golden era of Dehiwala St. Marys, bunch of national level wrestlers were produced by this school. Cyril Fernando, Malcom Perera, J.R. Mendis, Merry George, Patrick Konugala and Sunil Peris are few to name.
An old Marian wrestler, Ernest Fernando represented the country in 1964 Tokyo Olympics. During the late 70s the progressive movement of the school hindered and later withered its prestige status in extra curricular activities.
The present principal of St. Marys, Chandana Udayakumara wants to uplift the schools standard to its past glory and seek support of the old boys. An old Marian J. Ranjith Mendis who is a wrestler with fame in his hey days during 60s - 70s volunteered to develop school wrestling.
Under his guidance, lot of students have stepped into wrestling since his training commenced in 2015. Out of 55 Marian wrestlers 29 have qualified from zonal level to compete in national level. The principal appreciated Mendiss commitment and said that it is a great victory to achieve many zonal victories during a short period.
Coach Mendis hopes to do his best to restore the past wrestling glory in St. Marys and the sport wrestling is not highlighted much in school fraternity and needs awareness programmes to popularize. We have very talented wrestlers, but they must guide in proper manner. If sports authorities provide facilities, we can produce national level wrestlers through the school fraternity, Mendis stated.

STOPPING BY THE SEA ON A BREEZY EVENING
Serendipity is carved in my disposition. Yet, my twilight stroll along the promenade quite parallel to the Matara road in the city of Galle on that absorbing evening was unpremeditated. My sedentary job always compels me to give a rest to my thinking faculty. In order to recharge my batteries, as my colleagues always crack a joke to me saying that I look pale, I dared to have a long stroll.
The sun was like a fire ball in the evening sky. It was steadily falling into the blue sea, the fantastic scene was that it was sandwiched between the horizon and the vault of the heaven. The evening panorama with the Dutch fortress in the backdrop , the giant clock tower standing as a sentinel quite visible to the whole city and the natural Galle harbor at sight with the nestling light house at the far end of the beach edifying its presence made my evening a memory play of my youthful escapades with rebellious friends.
Professor Ludowykes Good Evenings opened before me. Ludowyke of peradeniya DRAMSOC fame is synonymous with English education in Galle. His stellar pedagogic life began at Richmond, Galle. Nora Robertss Galle As Quite As Asleep came alive to me. Yet, the quite discernible truth to me is the terrible fact that the younger generation is alien to the rich legacy they have endowed to us in their service to mankind. The one time librarian of the Galle Fort Library, the late Nora Roberts deserves our encomium for writing the true history of Galle and its iconic precincts for us to cherish with pristine pride. Even a posthumous appreciation of their immeasurable services is imperative. The relevant authorities should wake up from their slumber to answer the need of the hour. We have to show that Gallians are grateful.
While I was lost in a reverie, all of a sudden, I was surrounded by an immaculately white clad bevy of school goers. Their presence brought me to the senses. They are some of my students, all of them have a penchant for reading in general and reading good books of literature in particular. Little cute girl Peshani, buxom Chamika, slim look Gayashi, forever chrysanthemum Isuri , ever smiling Mulmi, sprint quuen Prathibani, quite energetic and imaginative Samadhi, angelic Thathsarani, good speller Aparna, oceanic Sayuri, collected Dirukshi, pet loving Vinuri, Rameshi with her peculiar smile and hard working Nethmi Dias were them. They had been killing the time munching gram on the nearby kerb till their parents come to collect them after their evening classes for extra guidance in French. In chorus they said that they had been hunting for me to ask for some books for holiday reading. I, myself, as an avid reader had a whale of a chance to guide them for good read. I didnt have the foggiest idea of meeting them, there.
They have been my apples of the eye since they came to learn literature from me. Their taste of reading and their dispositions are quite palpable to me and so I broke the ice to play the devils advocate on good reading during their holidays. Reading is a good holiday job for the children. As they are always immersed in text related reading, I didnt want to make their holidays a busmans holiday.
Peshanis shrieking voice penetrated into my very hearts core. She insisted me to recommend a good read related to French. My first choice was Le Misarab le by Victor Hugo. My first reading of this great master piece by the iconic writer fired my imagination. Sir, I have already read it.I will be rereading it after my A/L. once again. It was Aparnas voice.
Chamika is a student with a different taste. She wanted to go deeper into rural Sri Lanka. Grass For My Feet by J. Vijayatunga came to my mind almost effortlessly.
Nethmi Dias , who is the bookworm among them suggested Village in the Jungle by Leonard Woolf, one time government agent in Hambanthota who had a soft spot for the innocent people there, Silindu still lives in our hearts. All of them showered Nethmi with praise for her witty choice.

Supply Chain Challenges in Supply Chain
Project and Supply Chain Management majors learn how to manage complex assignments across business functions, understand the critical components of supply chains, and apply business analytic methods to fully integrate supply chain practices throughout an organization.
These skills may be used to develop new products and services, schedule and coordinate resources, monitor and control projects, and coordinate procurement and project delivery systems.
Learners are uniquely well-prepared for careers in some of the most in-demand professions in business. They are able to manage supply chain and projects initiatives in world-class corporations, government, public sector organizations, construction, third-party logistics providers, and goods and services distribution operations.
Introduction Essential to project success is the timely, accurate, and cost effective delivery of materials, supplies, and equipment. Unless project resources arrive when and where required, achieving project success is difficult to achieve.
Key to ensuring project resources arrive as required are supply-chain management methodologies and methods. These essential project processes assist in mitigating negative effects. While project supply-chain management is always essential, todays project globalization landscape intensifies the need to effectively manage procurement and delivery of the project resource needs.
The expanding project globalization landscape, the state of interacting across national borders, is linked to the corporate environment. Within the global economy, corporations are competing not only locally but internationally to ensure their survival. To achieve this corporations are not only offering products and services nationally and internationally, they are also economically leveraging foreign manufacturing facilities, labor and the application of joint venture agreements to develop natural resources or new products
An essential element for global survival is the need to be more competitive through the production of products or services faster, cheaper, and better. Project management, as a discipline, is recognized as a process that provides enhanced capabilities to achieve these objectives while assisting in enhancing the global companys potential for success. Supply-chain management is an essential process within the project managers tool kit.
From a definitional viewpoint, Supply-chain management is the integration of the activities that procure materials and service, transform them into intermediate goods and final products, and deliver them to customers. Essentially, supply-chain management transforms a projects identified material, supply and service needs into available resources for its customers, the project. Achieving the effective and efficient transformation of project needs into available resources requires a comprehensive set of supply chain management skills and techniques.
Within the project context, the linear supply-chain perspective includes those procurements that are well defined and perform as designed. Conversely, non-linear supply-chains occur when identified or unidentified risks occur and the intended linear procurement process goes awry. These non-linear process risks have the potential to generate cascading negative influences across the project.
The potential non-linear supply-chain challenges can be viewed as similar to the quantum physics uncertainty principal in that, for the supply-chain, reality of achieving the final result depends on how we go about making the choices and applying the operators. The supply-chain operators purpose is to provide a linear process with measurable positive results. Application of the supply-chain operator, however, faces many challenges that if not effectively managed will generate a non-linear negative cascading project effect. A few of these challenges are discussed in the next section.
Supply-chain Challenges
Some supply-chain risks and challenges include lack of supplier attention, late placed orders, internal procurement challenges, critical material damaged in shipment, and supplier induced changes.
The lack of supplier attention has been recognized as a problem on many projects. The vendor view of a one-off project sale is not an uncommon project experience. Indications of this view can be traced to events such as promised delivery dates missed as higher valued competing orders are filled first. In this situation, the project team determines that their order has been preempted by another firms order as the supplier is providing a higher level of service to a larger and/or repeat customer rather than the one-off project order. Other lack of supplier attention examples include failure to return phone calls or Email inquiries in time, slow response to requested updates, and frequent shifting of procurement requests between different sales personnel.
While lack of supplier attention is a risk factor, the project team can also be the source of supply-chain risks and challenges. This supply-chain attribute can be recognized as late placed orders due to conflicting objectives and goals. Within the theory of conflicting objectives and goals, the project team must balance competing objectives and goals. The project management team faces the objective of managing cash flow burn yet must ensure required resources are available. These objectives may be in conflict as part of the cash flow management is to ensure that material is procured when required and within the quantities required. Managing where and when the material is purchased as well as when the material arrive supports the overall cash flow objective if the best price available is obtained and the material is delivered when required.
Another contrasting side of project procurement conflicting objectives and goals is the need to ensure that the material is on hand when required. Potential issues of vendor backorders, late deliveries, and wrong deliveries encourage the project team to order sooner than required to allow for these potential risks. Obtaining the materials earlier helps to minimize the risks yet can result in additional storage, breakage, and shrinkage costs as well.
Other internal challenges include conflicting or restricting company purchasing policies and procedures. Various supply-chain management constraints can include appropriate levels of procurement signature authority, mandatory competitive bid requirements, and restriction on the types of vendors equipment that can be used. Other limiting company policies can include stringent insurance and warranty contractual requirements. These various issues can present significant challenges to the project teams ability to obtain the specific material within the timeframe required at an optimum price.
Another supply-chain risk involves the receipt of damaged material. One recent example of this involved the procurement of a power generation unit. On receipt of the system it was discovered that the device had been subjected to shock forces greater than specified. This resulted in sending the unit back to the manufacturer for inspection.
During the detailed inspection process, corrosion was identified on critical parts. The combined material defect issues quickly moved the project supply-chain management process from a linear effort to a non-linear state. In this non-linear state cascading negative project effects are highly probable. High risk, non-linear supply-chain effects can very quickly occur when highly technical, complex systems are damaged during the supply chain process.
When it comes to technology intensive and complex systems, supplier induced changes are an additional area of supply-chain risk. Supplier induced changes involve the state where the supplier provides the requested part but has introduced a change from the original design. These changes can range from something as simple as substituting Metric standard bolts for English standard bolts to supplying a software intensive system that has a newer operating system version. In either case, the supplier-induced change can result in a continuum of issues from a minor irritation to catastrophic system impacts.
A minor irritation may be that the Metric bolt forces the project team to procure new tools that are sized for Metric bolts. This is an added cost and time impact to address the supplier induced change. On the other extreme, a supplier induced software version change is a ripe minefield of potential catastrophic problems. As an example, during one project, the system developer delivered a product where they had implemented an operating system software version change. What the system developer failed to understand was the extent to which other associated software was not certified to operate with this next generation operating system.
Much to the developers and the project teams frustration, the system acceptance test identified significant problems. The solution involved installation of a new operating system and a complete system acceptance re-test. While in the case a solution was achievable, there was an impact to the project from both a cost and schedule perspective.
Managing the risk of untested software, mistaken supply chain orders, material damage, late shipments and conflicting project objectives are just a few of the challenges facing project team delivery of a product or service on time, within budget, and which meets the established quality standards. It is the projSupply-chain process discussion Supply-chain management knowledge, skills, and tools are essential project management support elements. Effectively applying these skills and tools enhances the project teams opportunity to provide a cost effective delivery of required materials or services when and where needed. Project management teams charter to manage these risks using a variety of tools, techniques, and skills.
Supply chains in a global environment must be able to
1. React to sudden changes in parts availability, distribution or shipping channels, import duties, and currency rates
2. Use the latest computer and transmission technologies to schedule and manage the shipment of parts.
Providing the identified adequately trained and experienced supply-chain experts is critical. With the right people in the right positions, the ability to manage the supply chain is greatly enhanced. Ideally, the project management team will have a direct say in the supply-chain experts that are assigned to the project. If the project management team has the authority and responsibility to staff these critical team positions, they can ensure they have the best knowledge and skills available to support the project.
If the project management team is not able to directly influence the selection of the supply-chain personnel, they need to quickly learn who will be supporting the teams supply-chain needs. By knowing who will be responsible for supporting the project team, it assists in avoiding the perception that all material and service requisitions disappear into that black hole where at some unknown time or place the correct material and service may or may not arrive. Establishing the personal project manager to supply-chain expert linkage provides that personal interaction that contributes to lowering the black hole risk that others have fallen into.
The project management team can also minimize the non-linear supply chain risks by clearly identifying and linking material needs to specific activities and the resulting scheduled requirement dates. Creating this supply-chain needs linkage is achieved from the project plan genesis, to the development of the work break down structure, encapsulated within the project schedule, and fully detailed in the material requisitions efforts. This multi-pronged approach will show a clear linkage of material or service needs from the original design until the material or service is consumed within the project context.
Conclusions
Project management is a systems based discipline that relies on project managers competencies to implement a project within the time:cost:scope: quality success criteria. The competence maturity level is obtained through the merging of theoretical knowledge, training, and hands on experience. These project manager events create a common but individual specific view, It is this world view that allows the project manager the ability to apply specific project management tools, methods and applications in a flexible approach best suited for the unique project in process.
To assist in enhancing the project managers flexibility capabilities, their world view should be expanded to include SCM. While the youngest of management disciplines, SCM shares many PM similarities. Each is built on a systems view where the whole must work as an integrated and cooperative unit. SCM processes add to the PM tool chest which increases the project managers options during changing project environments.
Expanding the project manager world view increases the overall project requisite variety. Ultimately, the greater the project managers requisite variety, the greater the projects flexibility. This improved flexibility enhances the projects ability to respond to those unknown-unknown project impacts
In conclusion, supply-chain management is a critical project management knowledge and skill set for the team. Adequately applying the knowledgebase, tools, and skill sets can assist the project teams delivery of the product or service on time and at a lower cost. To achieve the highest level of supply-chain management requires having the right people available and being able to clearly trace the material or service needs to a component of the overall project.

Titan among Lilliputs
In the current wild fire conflict mode of medical arguments between GMOA and the government on the validity of SAITM qualifications, I read this wonderful book by Dr Gamini Goonetilleke In the Line of Duty.
I have no clue about who is right and who is wrong and who has sold his soul for thirty pieces of silver in this all important battle that is being fought by heavy weights of Hippocrates and the highly hypocritical powers that be (you know from where). I only know the roads get clogged to the limits with protest marches creating SAITM-related traffic jams. Then of course there maybe that thief or two or maybe even more who trapeze in the Diyawanna circus placing bets on both sides of the coin ensuring their pound of flesh is safe. Well! That is to be expected.
Debut novel
Amidst all this calamity where we the ordinary do not know what the truth of the matter really is, Dr Gamini gave me a birds eye view of who a doctor is and what is expected of him in this debut novel, In the Line of Duty. This is his story, from the beginning of his birth in Kandy at his grandfathers home to the present day, said in simple language with sincere meaning which should serve well not only doctors but any adult who would be interested to know what responsibility is all about. Especially how difficult it is at demanding times to rise up and shoulder the weight.
That applies everywhere, no matter how hard the going is and how slippery the slope slants. This is the story of the book In the Line of Duty, no frills, no tinsel, just an admirable way of life lived by a remarkable man with a stethoscope.
I must say the prologue itself made me love the book. The author quotes Mark Twain and the metaphor is matching magnificently, about the cat that jumped on the hot stove. Dr Gamini won no ambassadorship, I doubt he stacked millions for his children and grand children, he just healed people and saved them to live another day. Sunil, Ibrahim, Somalatha and little 3-year-old Chatu are his prologues unsung victories, just a smidgen from the mother-load he minted in sick and trauma care. People and their welfare would always be uppermost in my life says the doctor and adds I have rarely turned back anyone who came to me seeking solace and healing. I say no more, you read and find out where all this leads.
The book is mostly a journey of a committed doctor who served in the war-torn Sri Lanka of yesteryear. The worlds a little older now from the Nandikadal days and memory does fade in the best of minds. Younger generations only know of the conflict as history. This book gives much more of the trauma years and the best to me was page 178, the ceremony where Dr Gamini was inducted as the 19th President of the College of Surgeons in Sri Lanka. No doubt it was a great honour to him but what made me laugh to my cockleshells was the behaviour of the so-called substitute politician Chief Guest who tried to play musical chairs. He reminded me of a little boy who got angry and took the football and went home.
Three cheers to you Doctor, you had the courage to place it on print. Now we know the truth, but then in this day and age it is almost a norm of a conduct from the powers that be. Some of Dr Gaminis stories do tug at the heart strings. Ariyadasas gratitude (page 175), Trishaw driver Silva honours Dr Gamini by making him Silvas first passenger (171), getting two sick prisoners held by the Tigers (139), six-year old Susantha of Kadawathamaduwa (93), little Rani who was gored by a buffalo (53), they are all here, each one treated and cured by the blessed hands of the author.
The pages do carry stories of the war and also of the JVP uprising. Dr Gamini writes a middle-path of these sad times where the innocent died not even knowing why. His descriptions are about the suffering and his committed efforts and how he did his best to save the lives of the mauled. He does talk about Alimankada and Operation Balawegaya relating the story of Gamini Kularatne. Well! This is not Thermopylae or the Battle of Balaclava. No gladiator Spartans nor any sabre-rattling Light Brigade, just a simple soldier from a village called Hasalaka charging an armoured bulldozer with a grenade in hand and dying for his beloved country (page 119, the story).
Human value
If I have any praise for Dr Gamini and his very meaningful book it is simply a readers point of view. I honestly have never met him and does not know whether by complexion he is yellow, black or indigo. Of course he is not Khalid Hosseini or Salman Rushdie. He never claimed to be. He is just a medicine man who wrote his story and gave us a read that added human value to what responsibility is all about. This is definitely a good book for the young adult and a must read for the fledgling medical student to widen his vision as to where lies the essence of treating the sick and the suffering, especially when they are trampled by the multiple burdens of poverty.
Thank you Dr Gamini for enlightening me to another side of the story of the ethnic conflict that almost ruined our mother-land. You certainly need nobodys praise or recognition. People like you did what you had to do by the oath you took when you passed out as a doctor. Maybe those who are close to you, your wife and children and loved ones know how daunting the demand was and how you did your best, obviously at a great cost to you and your family. It was mostly a case of our soldiers - their war except when people like you made the sacrifice to make it our soldiers - our war.
My dear reader, have a go at In the Line of Duty. It certainly is a worthy read.

Trumps Method, Our Madness
Sometimes, when psychoanalysts begin treatment with a new patient, they quickly find themselves feeling that they cant make sense of what is going on. The patients statements and behaviour simply dont add up, and the flurry of dissociated statements and actions can quickly begin to produce something like a disorienting fog.
Most seasoned clinicians would have learned that they shouldnt attribute this confusion, which is typically accompanied by a distinct form of anxiety, to their lack of skill. Instead, adept clinicians take the experience itself and the accompanying anxiety as significant data, indicating that they are dealing with, if not psychosis in the strict diagnostic sense, at the very least something in the vicinity of psychotic-like phenomena.
Sigmund Freud distinguished between neurosis and psychosis by arguing that while the former is psychically localized, the latter is relatively global. In neurosis, individuals break with a portion of reality that they find intolerable. As a result, their overall relation to reality remains more or less intact, but becomes impaired in one aspect of their personality.
In contrast, because psychotic individuals tend to find reality as a whole too painful to bear, they break with it globally, and construct an alternative, delusional, magical reality of their own. This alternate relation to reality, manifesting itself in the initial meetings with the patient, is at the root of the clinicians confusion.
Now many of us throughout American society at large, after an interminable electoral campaign and transitional phase into the presidency of Donald J. Trump, have experienced a form of disorientation and anxiety that bears a striking resemblance to the clinical situation I have described. And recent events indicate that this feeling is not going to abate any time soon.
Trumpism as a social experience
Of course, a clinical psychoanalytic experience and general social experience are not strictly analogous. But a comparison of them can prove illuminating. Just as disorientation and bewilderment tell analysts something significant about what they are experiencing in the clinical setting, so too our confusion and anxiety in the face of Trumpism can tell us something important about ours. I am suggesting, in other words, that Trumpism as a social experience can be understood as a psychotic-like phenomenon.
This is not a question of Donald Trumps personal psychopathology, alarming as that question may be. The point is, rather, that Trumpism as a social-psychological phenomenon has aspects reminiscent of psychosis, in that it entails a systematic  and it seems likely intentional  attack on our relation to reality.
Much has been written about post-truth politics in the context of the recent presidential election, and rightly so, as Trumps relationship with the truth is not the same old conservative legerdemain.
But in an important sense, anti-fact campaigns, such as the effort led by archconservatives like the Koch brothers to discredit scientific research on climate change, remained within the register of truth. They were forced to act as if facts and reality were still in place, even if only to subvert them. For example, when they attempted to undermine the findings of legitimate scientists, they often utilized rational arguments concerning certainty, probability and proof. The collective social experience of this propaganda may have led to greater ignorance about the science of climate change, but it didnt substantially alter our experience of truth as such.
But Donald Trump and his operatives are up to something qualitatively different. Armed with the weaponized resources of social media, Trump has radicalized this strategy in a way that aims to subvert our relation to reality in general. To assert that there are alternative facts, as his adviser Kellyanne Conway did, is to assert that there is an alternative, delusional, reality in which those facts and opinions most convenient in supporting Trumps policies and worldview hold sway. Whether we accept the reality that Trump and his supporters seek to impose on us, or reject it, it is an important and ever-present source of the specific confusion and anxiety that Trumpism evokes.
Donald Trumps relation to Vladimir Putin is one area where our sense of bewilderment is particularly pronounced. Whatever may or may not be going on between the two authoritarian leaders, similarities in their style are striking. A recent BBC documentary, HyperNormalization, by Adam Curtis  who is often as over-the-top as he is insightful  is suggestive in this context. Curtis calls our attention to Vladislav Surkov, whose official title is the vice head of the presidential administration and has been referred to as the puppet master of Putins Russia. Surkov has a background in avant-garde theater and is a devotee of postmodern culture, and has adopted theatrical and artistic techniques of subversion to unleash a full frontal attack on Russian societys sense of reality. According to Curtis, Trump has taken his stratagems for spreading pandemonium from Surkovs playbook, with Steve Bannon  a product of Hollywood and Goldman Sachs who now sits on the National Security Councils Principals Committee  acting as Trumps Surkov.
As opposed to the Soviet Union or contemporary North Korea, Surkov, as Peter Pomerantsev observed in The London Review of Books, does not seek to generate and maintain the regimes power exclusively through the exercise of overt terror (though there is plenty of that). On the contrary, his fusion of despotism and postmodernism comprises a strategy of power based on keeping any opposition there may be constantly confused, creating a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because its indefinable. To keep his opponents off-balanced and powerless, he might, for example, sponsor nationalist skinheads one moment and human rights groups the next. In a similar vein, Surkov could have provided the seating arrangements for the N.S.C., where Bannon, a right-wing white nationalist who has provided a platform for anti-Semites, sits on one side of Trump, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, an orthodox Jew, sits on the other.
After observing Donald Trump for all these exhausting months, it is clear that, whether he is as calculating as a puppet master like Surkov or simply functioning on a showmans intuition, the law of noncontradiction does not apply in his universe.
Creating confusion
By continually contradicting himself and not seeming to care, Trump generates confusion in the members of the media and political opposition that has often rendered them ineffectual, especially in speaking to those outside the liberal base. They were slow to realize that he was playing by a different set of rules. This is why they, like Hillary Clinton before them, have had such difficulty gaining traction against him via appeals to facts and other cherished norms of liberal democracy. He has proved adept at deflecting well-intentioned fact-checking, regardless of how often it has caught him in a contradiction, and rational counterarguments, which can bounce off him like rubber. As long as Steve Bannon and his colleagues continue to destabilize our sense of reality, and their opponents fail to recognize how these techniques work, those who oppose him will continue to stumble.
In the psychiatric setting, it only becomes possible to treat a patient in the psychotic range of the diagnostic spectrum when an analyst does not focus on the manifest content  on what actually happens on the surface  but finds a way to address the underlying dynamics in order to work them through and establish, first in the analytic setting, and then hopefully in the patients life, a less compromised relation to reality.
On the hopeful side, there has recently been a robust and energetic attempt not only by members of the press, but also of the legal profession and by average citizens to call out and counter Trumpisms attack on reality.
But on the less encouraging side, clinical experience teaches us that work with more disturbed patients can be time-consuming, exhausting and has been known to lead to burnout. The fear here is that if the 45th president can maintain this manic pace, he may wear down the resistance and Trump-exhaustion will set in, causing the disoriented experience of reality he has created to grow ever stronger and more insidious.

Trump backs down on border wall funding

Donald Trump has indicated he will ditch plans to find cash for his border wall in this week's spending bill.
The president's close adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said funding for the wall would be left out of a budget measure that must pass by Friday.
Building the wall, paid for by Mexico, was a key campaign promise.
Democrats had threatened to block the bill if money was earmarked for the wall, so its omission may now avert a government shutdown.
But the president insisted on Twitter that he still supported the wall and that it would be built.
He reportedly told a private meeting with members of the conservative media on Monday night that he might be open to funding the wall later in the year.
And Conway confirmed that the wall does not need to be funded this week, but remains a "very important priority".
It was the centrepiece of the Trump election campaign. There was going to be a border wall, and at every rally he would shout out: "And who's going to pay for it" And the crowd would roar back: "Mexico!" Except the Mexican government made clear there was no way it was going to fund it.
So when President Trump moved into the White House, he said that - initially - it might require US taxpayers to fund its construction, but the money would be clawed back from Mexico at a later stage.
Now with the president approaching his 100th day in office, he's come across another rock solid wall - the one presented by Democratic senators in opposition to his proposals.
They are able to block the spending proposals, and so the White House budget director will have to rewrite his plans - minus the funding for the border wall.
The president tweeted this morning: "Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc."
At some point in the future it may well get built, but this has been a stark lesson in the difference between campaigning and governing.
White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Trump's "willingness to compromise on wall funding is a surprise to Democrats".
Trump had proposed $1.5bn (1.2bn) for his wall through Congress as part of the spending bill, which funds federal agencies to the end of the current fiscal year.
The plan has united Democrats in blanket opposition.
And some Republicans have balked at the estimated cost of $21.6bn - more than the price tag the president cited as $12bn.
Republicans with districts along the border have also been very critical, conscious that they have large Hispanic populations.
But the White House is insistent that the wall must be built, and will not concede there will be a "delay".
"Priorities have not changed," said spokesman Sean Spicer. "There will be a wall built.
It is important to prevent human trafficking, gangs like MS-13 from coming in, the flow of illegal drug and illegal immigration, he added.

Twenty five families to be sent to new houses by Friday
Twenty five families displaced in the Meethotamulla tragedy will be resettled this Friday at the houses made after converting the former Government paddy store at Wellampitiya into a residential facility.
Sri Lanka Navy Captain and Director Operations Kapila Ubesekera said 168 officers provided a yeoman service to the project proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The officers work day and night without any extra pay on the directives of Civil Defence Director General Chandrarathna Pallegama.
This spirit has enabled us to provide shelter to the first 25 families now in the Terence Vidyalaya. The school has to be given back to commence classes.
The balance will be moved to the paddy store. Altogether 75 families would be settled here, Captain Ubesekera said.
He said the people living at the paddy store will have the basic facilities. We have also taken steps to repair 50 ventilators to minimise the unusual heat prevailing at present, he said.
Captain Ubesekera said each family will have a 300 square metre space. The funds to cover expenses will be borne by the Civil Defence Department with the assistance the Divi Neguma, LECO, National Water Board and CMC among others.
Kolonnawa Urban Council former Chairman Ravindra Udayakantha said he appreciate the steps taken by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide facilities to victims.
Udayakantha said he was able to save 40 people whose houses had signs of collapse with multiple cracks on the walls, about two weeks ago with the assistance of the people .
He thanked CMC Commissioner V. K. Anura for taking appropriate action on his (V.K. Anuras) request to move eight families living close to the garbage site .
They would have been among the buried if not for the people and officers, he said.

Will it be curtains for JO
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, or more precisely President Maithripala Sirisena, has apparently had enough. Two weeks ago the President declared that he would soon be making several important decisions, politically. Reading into the Presidents statement, one cannot but come to the conclusion that he wants to consolidate the SLFP and in furtherance of this take a firm decision against the rebels of the party, read Joint Opposition.
Presiding at the party Central Committee meeting on Sunday the President unequivocally stated that all MPs of the SLFP MUST attend the party May Day rally at Getambe and a resolution was passed giving effect to this decree. In furtherance of this, letters had been sent to all SLFP MPs and Provincial Councillors that it was mandatory for them to attend the party May Day rally. Coming out more into the open SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said that SLFP MPs who boycotted the party May Day celebrations in Getambe would be expelled. What is more, the resolution also specifically mentions the mandatory presence of Mahinda Rajapaksa at the party May Day celebrations.
The past few weeks saw the President becoming more assertive, taking the full reins into his hands. He removed several SLFP electoral organisers who were backing the JO and replaced them with his loyalists. From all accounts, the SLFP is gearing up for perhaps its biggest ever May Day show this time, with over 2,000 buses already booked to transport crowds. The undoubted show of strength it is speculated will be a prelude to drastic action against the rebels.
In the past too, the SLFP had threatened action against the JO members for staging independent rallies. But these threats were lukewarm and unconvincing. This time though, it appears that President Sirisena is set to walk the talk. The tone and tenor of Minister Dissanayakes statement left no doubt that there will be no compromise this time around and for good reasons.
President Sirisena cannot be seen to be a weakling right through, a leader of a party, nay the President of the country, who cannot get a section of his party men to fall in line. He can ill afford a direct challenge to his rule by the rebels who have even threatened to lay siege on the Presidents House come May Day. Besides, it is incumbent on him to lead the SLFP to victory at elections, soon to be held. A defeat of the party caused by the present split will not only dent his image as a leader but also cause a drift of supporters towards the other camp. He would certainly not want to be a leader who presided over the defeat of the party while also being the Head of State. It has never happened before, barring the instance where CBK lost the General Election while still being the President, in 2001.
The JO has some 50 members in parliament but commands support out of proportion to its numbers, due certainly to the leadership given to it by Mahinda Rajapaksa. This is hanging like a sword of Damocles over the President. Hence he has to act and act fast. Last time around the Supreme Court held with the rebels when the UNP petitioned for the expulsions of messrs. Sarath Amunugama, Wijepala Mendis, Nanda Mathew and Susil Moonesinghe. The country was witness to a bizarre scenario where the rebels claimed they were still loyal members of the UNP while sitting and voting with the government. The court did not find anything amiss with this state of affairs. Of course that was a court that had Sarath Nanda Silva as its head. Things have changed since then. Is parliament going to witness a mass exit of members in the not so distant future Will the SLFP hierarchy walk the talk this time around
Cheers to John
Labour Minister John Seneviratne, no doubt, is going to be the toast of all the imbibers of this country. Speaking at a District Development Committee meeting in Ratnapura the Minster spoke in favour of reducing the price of a bottle of Special Arrack, commonly known as Gal, due to it being beyond the reach of the common man. Presently a bottle of Gal which is favoured by manual labourers and others engaged in strenuous duties, is priced at Rs. 1,500 which they can ill afford. As the Minister noted, this has made them turn to the cheap rot gut moonshine (kassippu) which is injurious to health.
Of course, the ministers suggestion will clash against the concept of mathata titha of the former President and also the current attempts by President Sirisena to combat drug and alcohol abuse. However the government should open its eyes to reality. Although it may earn extra shekels to the state coffers by way of excise revenue, on the other hand this will be offset by the extra expenditure imposed on the health budget to cure illnesses caused by drinkers taking to the rot gut.

Williams and Comaneci blast racist,sexist Nastase
Bucharest: Pregnant star Serena Williams and gymnastics great Nadia Comaneci blasted tennis legend Ilie Nastase for making "racist", "sexist" and "offensive" comments during the Fed Cup tie between Romania and Britain at the weekend.
Romanian Fed Cup captain Nastase has been suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) over his foul-mouthed and abusive behaviour during the tie, from which he was ejected.
On Friday, he had made a controversial racial slur over Williams's unborn baby while also reportedly propositioning the married and pregnant British captain Anne Keothavong.
"It disappoints me to know we live in a society where people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and unborn child, and sexist comments against my peers," said the 23-time Grand Slam winner.
Nastase was overheard by a journalist commenting on Williams's unborn child -- who will be mixed race as her fiance is white -- on Friday, saying: "Let's see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk"
On Saturday, the 70-year-old former world number one and two-time Grand Slam winner was kicked out of the tie after swearing at the umpire, Keothavong and British number one player Johanna Konta-- calling the latter two "fucking bitches".
"You may shoot me with your words... you may try to kill me with your hatefulness, but still like air, I rise," continued the 35-year-old Williams, a four-time Olympic gold medallist.
"I humbly thank the ITF for any consideration given to all the facts in this case. They will have my full support."
Nastase was also blasted by compatriot Comaneci.
"Ilie has been my friend for many years, but I can not condone or defend his recent ugly and very offensive remarks," the 55-year-old five-time Olympic gold medallist wrote on Twitter.
Nastase and Comaneci are Romania's two greatest sporting icons.
Comaneci was reacting to criticism she received from earlier comments she made at the European Gymnastics Championships, held in Cluj, Romania at the weekend.
Various press reported her as having said Nastase "says things that he doesn't really mean", adding that "everybody in Romania loves Ilie because he is Ilie".
Despite being kicked out of the Fed Cup tie, Nastase had blatantly ignored the ban on Sunday and walked into the VIP area at the venue in Constanta, before being asked to leave by the Romanian Tennis Federation president.
His bizarre behaviour did not stop there, though, as Keothavong revealed he had sent her flowers on Sunday in a peace-making gesture. AFP

Yasir Shah puts Pakistan on course for win
Kingston: Yasir Shah ripped through the top order of the West Indies second innings in the final session of another long day to put Pakistan on course for victory at the end of the fourth day of the first Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica on Monday.
After captain Misbah ul Haq became just the sixth batsman in Test history to be left stranded on 99 not out as Pakistan were dismissed for 407 in their first innings, the hosts, trailing by 121 runs, were reduced to 93 for four at stumps with Shah taking all four wickets.
They go into the final day needing another 28 runs to erase the first innings deficit with the pair of nightwatchman, Devendra Bishoo and debutant Vishaul Singh, expected to be under immense pressure, especially from the rampant leg-spinner, when play gets underway on a wearing pitch on the final morning.
Shah struck with his very first delivery, bowling Kraigg Brathwaite with a ball that skidded through on the opening batsman.
He quickly added the scalps of newcomer Shimron Hetmayer and Shai Hope before finishing off with the important wicket of Kieran Powell, the opener taken at slip by Younis Khan for a well-played 49.
That late drama was in contrast to the pedestrian progress through the first two sessions of the day as Misbah worked his team into a dominant position despite being left one run short of an 11th Test century.
Last man and debutant Mohammad Abbas was trapped leg-before by Roston Chase on the stroke of the tea interval.
In his usual phlegmatic manner, Misbah ensured Pakistan constructed their position of dominance via a succession of partnerships after they resumed on the fourth morning at 201 for four and facing the threat of the second new ball.
Yet it was a far from a flawless effort as the West Indies extended their season of woe in the field, allowing the opposing skipper to escape when he should have first been taken at short-leg by Singh off Shannon Gabriel and then later on in the morning session by Alzarri Joseph running back at mid-off to the bowling of leg-spinner Bishoo.
It was Bishoo who eventually broke an 88-run sixth-wicket stand between Misbah and Sarfraz Ahmed, the wicketkeeper batsman playing in his usual pugnacious manner in getting to 54 before he was bowled around his legs attempting a sweep shot just after lunch.
"I just wanted to upset the fast bowlers' line by doing a few unorthodox things because they were bowling very well," Ahmed explained at the end of the day. "It's all part of my game to be positive and today it came off."
During the course of his innings, Ahmed went past 2,000 runs in his Test career.
Misbah achieved a milestone of his own when he notched his 5,000th Test career run before reaching the half-century mark and began to play an increasingly important role through the afternoon session as the West Indies emerged from the listless indifference of the first session to finally get among the wickets.
Joseph removed Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz in quick succession to finish with three wickets in the innings, the same as fellow opening bowler Gabriel.
When substitute fielder Jermaine Blackwood ran out Shah, Misbah was on 68 with the score at 373 for nine.
However, Abbas displayed determination and discipline in surviving with his captain for 45 minutes while Misbah controlled most of the strike and edged towards the coveted century.
Just one run away, though, he was denied when Chase trapped the newcomer in front.
Misbah's innings spanned nine minutes short of six hours, during which he faced 223 deliveries, striking three sixes and five fours. AFP
