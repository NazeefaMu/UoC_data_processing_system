Govt. wont sell or lease Eastern Terminal of Colombo Port
The government would not sell or lease even an inch of the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port, said President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
The President gave this assurance to the workers of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, addressing the 38th anniversary of Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA). The event was held at the SLPA premises.
He also appreciated the workers, both working and the retired, for their contribution to make the Colombo Port to the present standard on par with the worlds best ports, with sophisticated technology and facilities.
He also said that the Government would also assure that the lands would not be given outright to foreigners, but only on lease.
There are many criticisms against the Hambantota Harbour agreement, said President Maithripala Sirisena. But in fact the agreement was drafted on September 3 or 4 in 2014 during the previous government in which I was a Cabinet minister. So I know it better and there were clauses far worse to the country than what we have inked.
He also said he could reduce the extension of the lands that were proposed by the previous government by 50 percent. He added that the clauses were included to execute the operations of the Harbour under the laws of the country with the supervision of the Sri Lanka Navy.
On the other hand, I also instructed to include the clause that we should be able amend the clauses of the agreement in future if there are clauses that affect the country. None of such agreements were presented before the Parliament during the previous regime, but now, it has changed, he said.
Whatever the criticisms levelled against the Government, the previous government gave six acres in Gall Face outright to Shangri-La. It had proposed to grant 240 acres of the Colombo Port City to China, but we changed it into a lease.
He also said that some persons attempt to topple the government. But they cant do it for another three years.
They have to do it, if possible, at the next election. Now we have brought about peace and equality and guaranteed other rights. So they can use them and win at the next election, President Sirisena added.

Strong Army Commitment to Peace-keeping Missions Emphasized at Colombo APPTCCC Conference
Three-day sessions of the 9th Asia-Pacific Peace-keeping Training Centre Commandants Conference (APPTCCC), themed Challenges of Developing a Robust Peacekeeping Mindset and the Annual General Meeting of the Association of Asia-Pacific Peace Operations Training Centres (AAPTC), commenced yesterday at Hotel Taj Samudra in Colombo.
It was attended by more than 40 foreign delegates and Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake was the Chief Guest for the inaugural ceremony. Lighting of the traditional oil lamp by the Commander of the Army and other distinguished invitees heralded the formal commencement of the sessions, followed by opening remarks of the Chief Guest after the welcome address.
In his address to the sessions, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake pointed out that the AAPTC programme would serve as an audience for providing intellectual connectivity amongst those who seek regional and global partnerships by convening prominent national and international scholars, think-tanks and diplomats around this particular theme. The workshop 2017 is also designed to encourage participants to take part actively in discussions so as to stimulate critical thinking, he said. The Sri Lanka Army has been engaged in training peacekeepers since 2004 and to-date we have trained 28,998 peacekeepers at the prestigious Institute of Peace Support Operations Training in Sri Lanka (IPSOTSL). The total number of deployed troops would be 19,395 so far. Also, at the moment one Composite Engineering Squadron and a Convoy Protection Company are prepared to deploy in UNISMA. I believe that my country will do its part in this process and this AGM and Workshop is a clear demonstration of our government's strong commitment to this noble mission. Further, the action plan spells out specific ideas to build stronger peacekeepers through training while acknowledging that global institutions and practices are the backbone of a robust mindset, the Commander said.
Although robust peacekeeping is not a new concept and has been partially implemented in some operations such as Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti and Lebanon, it has attracted renewed attention since 2008 with the developments in its conceptualization. While it recognizes the necessity and virtue of a robust approach as a protection mechanism for peacekeepers, it is required to recognize the extent to which robust peacekeeping is politically acceptable and operationally viable. Training was one of the best welfare projects for me and that should be the case with any soldier in a capacity-based Army. We are on our way to establish a Directorate of Peacekeeping Operations for ourselves, intending to produce more learned/trained Officers and Other Ranks who are ready to be deployed in UN peacekeeping missions, the keynote speaker added.
This years theme of the APPTCCC, Challenges of Developing a Robust Peacekeeping Mindset within the Asia-Pacific region will have separate sessions, devoted to workshop objectives and agenda, Sri Lankas IPSOTSL training presentations, Summary of the training related activities, training instructor standards and areas of cooperation for Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System (PCRS) during the first day of the conference. More than 40 representatives from Australia, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand and Sri Lanka at the request of the IPSOTSL and the Directorate of Training at the Army Headquarters are attending the conference sessions.
Delegates of the GPOI, BIPSOT, IPSOTSL, United Nations Department of Peace-Keeping Operations (UNDPKO), International Organizations such as OMA, ALCOPAZ, APSTA, EAPTC and a few more senior military Officers of the Sri Lankan armed forces also contributed to the Day 1 of the Colombo sessions.
General Staff Director General Major General Piyal Wickremaratne, Training Director General Major General G. V. Ravipriya, IPSOTSL Commandant Brigadier Prasad Pathirathna and several Senior Officers, were also present.

TPA stands by govt to go its full term
The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) yesterday said that they would stand by the Government.
The Government will go on until 2020," TPA Deputy Leader, Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaran said.
Addressing the media at his ministry, Digambaran said the Joint Opposition, regardless of their rhetoric, have not made a significant impact on the Government.
The minister called for the media briefing to explain a recent incident where he was accused of intimidating reporters of a private television channel. Digambaran said the television channel was on a mudslinging campaign against him. Former MP Sri Ranga was heading the campaign given their political differences, he said.
"I am not a leader who believes in keeping his people trapped in line rooms," Digambaran said. The ministry works on a plan to provide estate workers with seven perches of land with deeds and a house, he said.
We will build 160,000 houses. It cannot be done in a day. But the television channel is trying to say that I am not doing any work. We will hand over 3,000 houses to people soon," the minister said.
When asked about corruption allegations against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, he said legal action should be taken against wrongdoers, whether they are from the Government or Opposition.

Women have to fight their way to achieve their rights
City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle and Member of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender, and the Women Parliamentarians Caucus said nothing would be offered to women, but they would have to fight their way to achieve their rights and to be politically represented at national, provincial and local government levels.
She was addressing a discussion forum on operationalising the 25 percent quota for women in Local Government, and comparative experiences on advancing womens political participation held on July 26 at the Lighthouse, Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.
There is a general concept that women are not interested in getting involved in politics. The way women in politics are portrayed in Sri Lanka does not encourage women to engage in politics. We need to attract educated individuals to politics. I think it is a good time to start a dialog on making politics clean, she said.
Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said the political parties have a responsibility to ensure meaningful political representation of both men and women, including by selecting candidates for nomination lists through objective merit-based criteria.
I note that this is a commitment that most, if not all, of the political parties have signed on to in the March 12 Declaration, the Speaker said.
The event marked the conclusion of a series of knowledge exchange sessions on comparative experiences in advancing womens political representation and participation. On July 25, the Parliament Secretariat hosted a half-day workshop on operationalization of the quota system for women in local government elections for leaders and Members of Parliament and political parties. The visiting delegates from the UK that represented the two main political parties and a regional party and the member of the Womens Parliamentary Caucus of Pakistan shared their experiences, together with Sri Lankan resource persons from government, academia, and civil society.
The main purpose of the event was to share comparative experiences on advancing womens political participation from the United Kingdom (UK) and Pakistan, with local political party members and civil society actors who are advocating for increased womens representation and participation in political party systems.
In Sri Lanka, women have had the right to vote and participate in political activities since 1931. However, the representation of women in Sri Lankan politics has been the lowest among the South Asian nations, despite having had female heads of State for 25 out of 69 years of post-independence history. As of 2012, just 4 percent of seats in the Provincial Councils and 1.9 percent in Local Government have been held by women. Sri Lanka ranked 180 out of 190 in the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranking of female members in Parliament as of 2017.
As a step towards addressing this issue, Parliament passed the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 1 of 2016 to increase womens representation at the Local Government level by introducing a 25 percent mandatory quota for women.
Ensuring that the quota for women is successfully operationalised at the upcoming Local Government elections is vital for demonstrating the benefits of womens political participation. It will also have an impact on the scaling-up of such affirmative action to the provincial and national levels. In this regard, creating awareness of the evidence-based benefits of womens participation in political decision-making bodies is important.
The session hosted by the Parliamentary Secretariat was followed by a Roundtable Discussion on Advancing Womens Political Participation on July 26. The main purpose of this event was to provide an opportunity to the members of the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender, and the Women Parliamentarians Caucus, to discuss with the resource persons from the UK and Pakistan, cross-party initiatives and the role of oversight committees in advancing womens political representation and participation.
Women and Child Affairs Minister and the Women Parliamentarians Caucus Chairperson Chandrani Bandara, who chaired the Roundtable discussion, said the Womens Caucus ensures that womens issues are raised and are addressed through advocacy, and lobbying for amendments of discriminatory laws. She said it was crucial for women parliamentarians and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs with the participation of all stakeholders, led by the Prime Minister to be involved in political discussions on laws that affect women, such as amending the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act on the 25 percent quota system for women at the local level.
Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender Chairman, and member of the Women Parliamentarians Caucus Thusitha Wijemanne co-chairing the event said the district level awareness programs was launched that covered about 6-7 districts and workshops will be launched in future to reach out to local women leaders. We are also exploring ways in which we can support discussions on amending laws and policies such as the Muslim Personal Law that would benefit and respond to issues that concern women. she said.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), collaborated in organizing the events for meaningful operationalization of the mandatory 25 percent quota for women candidates at the Local Government level.

Foreign inflows to the stock market originating from Australia indicate a figure of Rs. 626.4 million year-to-date, which is an all-time record for foreign purchases from Australia in a calendar year.
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in association with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) hosted a series of Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forums to promote Sri Lankan capital market investment in Australia during March 2017. Rs 593.4 million, which attributes to 95% of the purchases this year, have been recorded since the Invest Sri Lanka forums.
Record inflows from Australia also place the country as the 10th ranked contributor in terms of overall net foreign flow in 2017, a noteworthy development considering the fact that an actual outflow of funds to Australia amounting to Rs 80.2 million was recorded in 2016.
A strong community of individuals with a Sri Lankan origin eager to look at new Sri Lankan investment opportunities and the celebration of 70 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Australia presented the CSE with a unique opportunity to promote the capital market in Australia this year.

Bald beauty queen
An 18-year-old teenager who was left bald after pulling out all her hair while battling anxiety is now a beauty queen.
Sarah Pennington, 18, from Pottstown in Philadelphia shaved her head after developing embarrassing bald spots while battling anxiety and depression. It turns out that Sarah has trichotillomania, a disorder which saw her pluck out all her strawberry blond hair, eyebrows and eyelashes after she developed the condition seven years ago.
Sarah covers her hair, which is shorter than an inch, beneath hats and wigs, describing it as an 'irresistible urge' to pull her hair out.
But two-years-ago, after receiving psychiatric help she started to embrace her condition and stopped hiding her baldness in public.
The young girl then decided that she wanted to raise further awareness about the condition by entering beauty pageants.
Sarah's been entering beauty pageants for two years now, winning first place and runner-up positions and using her platform to talk about trichotillomania. AP

A beer that tastes of ancient China
Scientists have developed a new beer that is inspired by archeological artifacts and recreates the fruity flavors of ancient Chinese alcohols.
The beer was named QingMing after the Chinese festival in April and the famous 12th Century scroll by Zhang Zeduan.
The Chicago Field Museum displays a 17th Century reproduction of the scroll in its Cyrus Tang Hall of China along with many other Chinese artifacts.
Among the artefacts on display at the launch party includes a 18th Century bronze "pitch pot" from Beijing, a popular drinking game.
Researchers from the museum and Off Color Brewing - Chicago Brewery - were inspired by the fruits incorporated in making certain Chinese alcohols as well as the mold saccharification of rice, the state-run news agency 'Xinhua' reported. "I have always been interested in mold-based saccharification. It is really fun for us as brewers coming from Western traditions where we use grain-based enzymatic degradation of starch and simple sugars," said John Laffler, from Off Color Brewing in the US.
The beer is a modern recreation of Chang and a stronger, drier herbal version of Li, a low alcohol rice or millet-based beer with a flavor profile of peaches and lemon rind with aromas of tea, bubblegum, and sake followed by a complex fruit, herbal, and floral character.
The finish, as the alcohol evaporates off the tongue, leaves hints of nectar, honey, and perfumed rice. PTI

Cabinet nods to introduce e-passports

The Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) this week received cabinet approval to introduce e-passports to all through a public-private partnership (PPP).
This would be a travel document with the holders biometric data in electronic format and it will store, digitally signed data, which include a copy of the MRZ in data page, digital facial image (mandatory data), fingerprint images (optional), iris image (optional), chip authentication, and validation data.
The University of Moratuwa had been assigned to carry out a comprehensive assessment on the Departments readiness for its migration to an e-passport and to determine and additional requirements for the same task, said the cabinet paper on the subject.
The Cabinet committee on Economic Management further advised the Department to develop an overall implementation approach for the establishment of the solution in consultation with key stakeholder organizations including ICTA. 
The General assumption is that e-passports benefit other countries than the issuing country but the solution has the potential of bringing in new regulations to facilitate e-passports issued by other countries in Sri Lankas border control, read the justification for the new scheme.
At present, Sri Lankan passports already incorporate biometric data into the passport application system.
This joint proposal made by the Minister of Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure, Harin Fernando and Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, S.B. Nawinne also proposed that the PPP be drawn out with the company De La Rue Lanka Currency and Security Print. The company is expected to finance 100 percent of investment which amounts to Rs 1.2 billion. 
Cabinet thus granted approval for De La Rue to study the current passport printing and personalization system of the DIE in collaboration with ICTA and prepare detailed system design and submit to cabinet and to have existing service providers of DIE associated with the current passport issuance process to carry out related integrations with the new e-passport solution and to engage De La Rue through a MoU for the proposed first work study on e-passports and to have ICTA serve as a partner of the project.

Chinese ambassador calls for direct use of RMB in trade with Lanka
Industrialisation of Hambantota will help Sri Lankan industries and the people, said Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang addressing the China Sri Lanka Infrastructure Investment Cooperation Forum at Kingsbury Hotel, yesterday.
Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed with Sri Lankan leaders when they visited China in 2015 and 2016 about industrialisation of Sri Lanka. It is quite clear President Xi Jinping would like to assist Lanka to set up a basic industry system. He said that Sri Lanka should have industry zones because land is limited in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka should assemble all industries to one or two zones with support of serious policy and logistics and we can help with one industry zone in Hambantota which will be a win-win for both sides.
Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested to Lankan leaders to use our currency the Chinese RMB in trade and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka-like done in many other countries such as Vietnam-Chinese companies will come back.
He said a year ago china-SL trade was around $ 4.3 billion.
If the Chinese currency RMB was used instead of the Dollar, we can do much more bilateral trade (beyond $ 4.3 billion).
Commenting on the Hambantota Port Agreement he said that they have no idea for a military consideration there and its purely a business idea.I must tell you the Chinese company that constructed the port spent more than a billion dollars earlier and again poured another $ 1.5 billion so the total cost for them is more than $ 3 billion.
Some people asked me whether we are crazy-why re-spend on the same port again Even if re-spending, why not spend only around $ 600 mn I told them I am not the person making the decision but its a business issue between China Merchant and Port Authority of Sri Lanka.
But a port is just a port. It is never an industrial zone. I will put all the efforts to push the industrial zone forward. This is also the need of Sri Lankan people. Industrialisation, that is, Made in Hambantota will help Sri Lankan industries and the people.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, said that out of US$ 801 million FDI China was the first biggest investor accounting to US $ 52 million.

INCREASE OF STATE BANK PENSION
As a Bank of Ceylon pensioner I wish to express my utmost gratitude to the bank and its General Manager for the increase of our members' pensions with effect from January this year. It was done by the bank in an unexpected manner especially, at a time when we are facing many financial difficulties due to high cost of living.
Generally, the bank increases staff salaries every three years according to the collective agreement that had been signed by the bank with the Ceylon Bank Employees Union. Accordingly, the last salary increase was granted to them in January 2016. But pensioners have been granted their respective increase after and year and half later. Even though, bank employees had received their full arrears since the date there salary was increased pensioners have not been given their full arrears. Instead the bank paid them only six months arrears even though they are entitled to one year arrears. It is very regrettable to state that many of our members die every year without enjoying their salary increases due to this reason.
Therefore, I earnestly request from the authorities concern to look in to this matter on the ground of humanitarian level since other pensioners like government and Central Bank get their pension increased on the same day without any time differences.
I wish to state that increasing of salaries to the pensioners has to be done without considering their grade in the bank they held. If the pensioners had been granted same amount without a grade bank could have saved it money in the Pension Trust Fund.

CMTA holds fruitful meeting with Finance Minister
Finance Minister Managala Samaraweera has responded in a very positive manner to find solutions to the grievances faced by motor industry in Sri Lanka, said Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) Chairman Reeza Rauf.
He said the recent meeting with the finance minister had been very progressive with the minister being very accommodative to the associations views and appointing a subcommittee with the finance ministry to listen to their grievances and come to a compromise.
We met the new finance minister and expressed our grievances. He was very accommodative and agreed to appoint relevant officials to look into the matter and discuss with us, Rauf said.
The CMTA chief said the minister gave a good hearing to their problems and CMTA was very happy and content with the meeting with Minister Samaraweera. Rauf said the minister had understood the situation very well and accepted that there have been a lot of enormities in the past that has adversely affected the motor industry in Sri Lanka. Minister Samaraweera at the discussions with CMTA had pledged that he will ensure that a level playing field would be created for all stakeholders in the motor industry.
CMTA the apex automobile franchise body of global automobile brands imported to Sri Lanka had continuously lobbied for policy consistency from the government in the automobile industry.
Rauf said they would continue to lobby against the governments ad-hoc policy changes, which had badly harmed the countrys legitimate auto industry in the past couple of years. The Chairman said they would seek a change to the government policies on the automobile industry which has created a no level playing field in the market while certain sectors especially the used car imports continued to benefit. It has also been very unfortunate that the relevant government institutions had in the past failed to recognize CMTAs contribution to the economy, he noted.
The CMTA boss also expressed the associations displeasure over the move to allow the registering of vehicles assembled by importing age-old, used spare parts, contravening all safety standards and risking the lives of the public, who are unaware of the dangers.
Rauf alleged that by this the government had contradicted its own budget proposal of 2016, where it suggested re-exporting vehicles, which are five years and older, as these so-called used spare parts could be well over five to 10 years.
The CMTA Chairman cautioned that the danger of permitting such a move was that the unsuspecting buyer would not know the year of manufacture of these assembled vehicles as a car manufactured years ago can be issued with a latest registration number plate by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
He also brought to light that the present valuation system in place for import brand new vehicles was disadvantageous to the country and has cost the government coffers colossal loss in terms of revenue. The authorities could find out for themselves the extent of loss by carrying out a appropriate investigation and evaluate the market trend for the last one to one-and-a-half-year period, he said.
Rauf opined that the grievances of the legitimate importers of brand-new vehicles had gone into deaf ears in the past but was very optimistic that discussions with Minister Samaraweera will turn around the situation. The CMTA Chairman pointed out that the industry had also been badly affected by the Central Banks restrictions on loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) to 50 percent for motor cars and SUVs, 70 percent for motorcycles and 25 percent for three-wheelers. This has hampered the customer demand to purchase at least a low-end motor vehicle through a financing facility.
The CMTA Chairman also acknowledged that the CMTA was very much aware of the dilemma the government had to face in bridging the balance of payments gap of the country.
He therefore requested that both the automobile industry and government should work together without further delay to create a level playing field and find a mechanism for the sustenance of the industry, its stakeholders and future growth.
CMTAs meeting with Minister Samaraweera is a clear step towards that direction Rauf added.

DCS launches book, web portal on SDGs
The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has launched a publication titled Status of Sustainable Development Goals Indicators in Sri Lanka: 2017 and a website to disseminate up-to-date information particularly for Sri Lanka on SDGs.
In 2015, countries of the United Nations adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as a part of the new sustainable development agenda. The SDG officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, is a set of 17 Goals with 169 targets and 244 indicators between them. Countries of the United Nations are expected to give high priority in their development agendas to the Sustainable Development Goals.
The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka in achieving 2030 goals is reflected by establishing the Sustainable Development Ministry, Parliament Select Committee on SDGs mandate of which is to make recommendations to ensure that the UN 2030 Agenda for SDGs is achieved in Sri Lanka and having four cluster committees of parliamentarians setup representing four thematic areas.
The first copy of the publication was presented to Deputy Speaker, Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee on SDGs Thilanga Sumathipala, on July 26 at Parliament by Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics. A website on SDGs in Sri Lanka was also launched by the Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee on SDGs.
There is an urgent need for a SDG indicator framework to turn the SDGs and their targets in to a Management tool to help develop implementation strategies and to allocate resources accordingly. It serves as a report card to measure programmes towards sustainable development and help ensure the accountability of all stakeholders for achieving the SDGs.
Preparing the publication on the availability of data for 244 SDG Indicators (Indicator Frame Work) is an important endeavour to facilitate compilation of baseline data by respective agencies, monitoring the progress, and reporting the achievements of SDG Targets Dr. A. J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics, said at the launching ceremony.
This publication provides a brief overview on 17 SDGs, 160 SDG targets and 244 indicators. Baseline data already compile by the DCS for the indicators are given in this publication.
Also given in this publication are Global and Local definitions and tiers for these indicators. The Director General said the publication would continue to be updated by incorporating data compiled by the DCS and other institutions of the NSS from time to time.
The DCS Director General said the web-page launched on SDGs in Sri Lanka can be accessed through its website at http://www.statistics.gov.lk Several Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers, MPs and Government Officials including M.I.M Rafeek, the Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs were present at the launching ceremony.

Diesel and petrol car ban: Clean air strategy 'not enough'
The UK government's 3bn clean air strategy does not go "far enough or fast enough", campaigners have said.
Moves including banning the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2040 and 255m for councils to tackle air pollution locally have been welcomed.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was determined to deliver a "green revolution".
But environmental groups criticised the decision not to include a scrappage scheme or immediate clean air zones.
The plan to stop all sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is part of the government's intention for almost every car and van on UK roads to be zero emission by 2050.
The government report includes the promise of 40m immediately to start local schemes rolling, which could include changing road layouts, retrofitting public transport or schemes to encourage people to leave their cars at home.
The funding pot will come from changes to tax on diesel vehicles and the reprioritising departmental budgets - the exact details will be announced later in the year.
If those measures do not cut emissions enough, charging zones for the most polluting vehicles could be the next step.
While air pollution has been mostly falling in the UK, in many cities, nitrogen oxides - which form part of the discharge from car exhausts - regularly breach safe levels.
Grayling said the new plan showed the government was "determined to deliver a green revolution in transport and reduce pollution in our towns and cities".
But campaigners say these are the measures that need to be implemented now to tackle environmental and health problems, with air pollution linked to about 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK.

DIMO, Vallibel Finance initiate ground-breaking Mercedes-Benz and Jeep deals
Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) recently signed a special MOU with Vallibel Finance at the Mercedes-Benz Centre to deliver customised, accessible and convenient solutions and deals to DIMO Mercedes-Benz (Passenger and Commercial) and Jeep customers.
Prime among these offers will be Vallibel Finances breakthrough loan facility, the Auto Draft (similar to a bank overdraft), where customers pay an initial down payment of 50% of the value of the vehicle and thereafter pay the interest for only the remaining 50%. Via this short-term liquidity requirement, customers using the facility will not have to have a huge capital base to fulfil their dream of using or upgrading to a brand-new Mercedes-Benz or Jeep vehicle via DIMO.
Customers will also be open to a bonus instalment scheme to pay nothing up to 6 months once 50% of the vehicle value is paid as an advance, with the instalment payments beginning from the 7th month and further facilities arrangeable for 3, 4, 5 and 6 years. This scheme was developed especially for customers who purchase commercial vehicles, where they could earn and then start paying later so as to yield a better return on their investment.
A residual payment scheme amounting to 20% of the vehicle value would facilitate a reduced rental throughout the lease period. Thereafter, only one-fifth of the vehicle value would be payable to the leasing company. No additional interest will be charged here. This scheme was designed for customers who are purchasing passenger and SUV vehicles and would like to upgrade their vehicles after 3 or 4 years without committing themselves to a higher monthly instalment. As the nations premier distributor of luxury vehicles, DIMO has again proved its commitment to its customers, with a history of more than 78 years in the nation. DIMO is the only general distributor for Mercedes-Benz and Jeep, and has always ensured that its commitment to the customer extends beyond the sales point through an array of after-sales services unparalleled by any other in the industry.
Vallibel Finance has consistently proved itself as one of Sri Lankas most respected conglomerates. Having revolutionised the role of a finance company with its breakthrough Auto Draft facility, Vallibel Finance has become increasingly popular for its wide array of Hire Purchase, Leasing, Pawning (Gold Loan), Fixed Deposit, Group Personal Loan, Mortgage Loan, Education Loan and Microfinance Product packages and offers deployed via a cutting-edge framework.

Electric Mini to be built in Oxford
A fully electric version of the Mini will be built at the Cowley plant in Oxford, BMW has said.
The carmaker said the model would go into production in 2019, with Oxford the main "production location" for the Mini three-door model.
However, the electric motor will be built in Germany before being shipped to Cowley for assembly. BMW said it had "neither sought nor received" any reassurances from the UK on post-Brexit trading arrangements. Last year, the government faced questions about the "support and assurances" given to Nissan before the company announced that new versions of its Qashqai and X-Trail would be made in the UK. And there have been reports that Toyota agreed to invest in the UK after receiving a letter reassuring the Japanese car maker over post-Brexit arrangements.
'Vote of confidence'
About 360,000 Minis are made each year, with more than 60% of them built at Oxford. But BMW has built up an alternative manufacturing base in the Netherlands amid concerns about Britain's suitability as an export hub after Brexit. BMW has warned about the damage of Brexit uncertainty, and in May chief executive Harald Krueger said the company had to remain "flexible" about production facilities.
UK Business Secretary Greg Clark hailed BMW's announcement as a "vote of confidence" in government plans to make Britain "the go-to place in the world for the next generation of vehicles". On Monday, he set out plans to invest in development of battery technology in the UK.
Clark met BMW's head of sales and marketing, Ian Robertson, at the company's headquarters in Munich in January and March this year. The two also held meetings at Westminster in March and June. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said the true test of the global car industry's desire to invest in the UK would come next year:
"I don't think it [BMW's decision] tells us much about Brexit and the form of trade barriers we may face in the future.
"The big decisions will be about future models [which would have redesigned bodies], both at Mini and at companies like Vauxhall when they announce their new models in the next couple of years." BBC

Enabling a safer tomorrow with clean water
Water is undoubtedly the lifeblood of our civilisation. One look at history will reveal that the first great civilizations all flourished in river valleys. Yet water not only holds the power to create, but also to wipeout civilizations.
With full knowledge of this, our ancestors learned to tame this force of nature, which eventually paved the path to the advances and innovations we enjoy today.
The UN reports that there is a sufficient amount of clean water to meet the needs of the population of planet earth. However, they also point out that current shortcomings with the worlds economic and infrastructure frameworks causes millions of deaths due to the lack of good-quality water.
Although significant advancements have been made in the field of water management in Sri Lanka, there are those who still struggle to access the basic necessity of a consistent source of clean water. While reasons may include natural hazards such as droughts or floods that are beyond human control, there are also major gaps in the infrastructure and facilities available to ensure steady accessibility to water.
According to a recent UNICEF report, children are especially impacted by the countrys water issues, with schools in a number of areas across the island lacking access to clean water and sanitation. There is a dire need to address this problem as it increases risks to childrens health, and naturally,it poses a threat to their education.
UNICEF reports that the percentage of schools in Sri Lanka with improved water sources ranges between 80 to 85 per cent. In addition to this, the continuous availability of water, or the quality of the water sources are all key challenges faced by schools or communities, whether or not they have access.Taking that into account, the ensuing issue becomes one of national importance that sheds light on the spread of water-borne diseases among our children, and our countrys urgent need to be educated on the matter. While authorities will continue to assist, knowledge will empower these afflicted communities to explore solutions themselves, creating true sustainability.
Here, private sector contributions can play a key role in helping shape the futures of rural communities faced with the water crisis. It is important that private corporations work hand-in-hand with central and provincial governments and communities to provide clean water and sanitation.
In this regard, Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka, the company behind Anchor milk, has fostered a reputation for spearheading a campaign around providing clean water and safe sanitation among children in rural townships. According to the dairy company, these initiatives are driven by their corporate vision to uplift the quality of life of the communities where they operate.
With such a focus, the company has identified schools located within the North Western, Central and even the Western Province, the latter of which is regularly mistaken for having access to clean water and sanitation due to its geographical proximity to Colombo. Leveraging close collaboration with relevant community groups, this work has delivered relief to several schools in rural communities just outside Colombo in rural areas in Kiriwathuduwa and Hanwella.
At a time when the country has been frequently afflicted by natural disasters, drought and water-borne diseases, Fonterra has pledged to fight back through long-term sustainability to safeguard our future generations.
The provision of clean water is also critical for the formulation of a safer ecosystem and, therefore, its necessity cannot be regarded lightly; our survival depends on it.Through the instigation of such local projects  raising funds, awareness and the involvement of local parties such as teachers, School Development Societies and authorities  such efforts will strengthen rural communities, which is where true impact and transformation can take place.

Englands Ali picks his moment for first hat-trick
London: Moeen Ali chose a fine time to make both personal and cricket history after his first hat-trick at any level sealed England's 239-run win in the third Test against South Africa at The Oval.
A match imbued with historical significance -- this was the 100th Test at The Oval -- saw off-spinner Ali create some of his own.
His was just the 14th England hat-trick at this level and the first in south London ground The Oval's 127-year history as a Test venue.
Dean Elgar did his best to prevent England going 2-1 up in this four-match series with a gutsy innings of 136.
The left-handed opener was, however, the first of Ali's hat-trick victims on Monday's fifth day, edging to Ben Stokes at first slip. Kagiso Rabada exited in similar fashion next ball but that was the end of the over. But with South Africa surviving the ensuing Stokes over, it was left to Ali to have last man Morne Morkel lbw with his next delivery.
It needed an England review of West Indian umpire Joel Wilson's not out decision, however, to confirm that the Proteas, set a mammoth 492 for victory, were all out for 252 after lunch on Monday's fifth and final day."I've never taken a hat-trick in any sort of cricket," said the 30-year-old Ali.
"I've scored a few hat-tricks in football warm-ups, but this is a different sort of feeling ... a better feeling."
England captain Joe Root added: "It was a special way to finish, and quite a fitting one in the 100th Test here, and summed up a really good week for us."
Ali, England's lone specialist spinner at The Oval, has now taken 18 wickets this series and 116 in his Test career in total.
Not that England will care if Ali, who had innings figures of four for 45 on Monday, keeps taking wickets. "Mo quite likes having that feeling of having maybe a little bit less pressure," explained Root. "When we need to take wickets in the fourth innings of a Test match, he's able to do it," he added.
Several former England captains had slammed Root's men for an inability to graft out a score during a 340-run thrashing by South Africa in the second Test at Trent Bridge.
But with all-rounder Stokes, the man-of-the-match, making 112 in a first innings 353, England established a commanding position at The Oval that they never let slip.
"It was obviously a difficult week up in Nottingham, but the way the guys responded and character they showed to come back was outstanding," said Root after just his third Test as captain.
But if the pattern of this see-saw series continues, South Africa should secure an equally huge win in the fourth Test at Old Trafford starting on Friday.
"We've not done things by halves so far in this series," Root admitted.
"It's just important that we take (with us) the way we've played this week -- especially the way we batted, which I thought was exceptional."
Stokes led the way and Root said: "He thinks really well and he's got a great cricket brain, which he doesn't always get a lot of credit for."He's a person you know you can turn to under pressure to wrest a game back in your favour."Elgar battled hard to keep England at bay during an innings where he copped both physical and verbal blows.
"It's part of the game - you have to roll with the punches and take the blows when they come your way," he said.
As for the 'verbals', Elgar insisted he "enjoyed it", adding: "England are a big huff-and-puff bowling attack and when they are on top, they are definitely going to bring their mouths as well.
"If the shoe was on the other foot I'm sure we'd be doing the same thing." AFP

With the entrepreneurial cap put on
Exports are the goods and services produced in one country and purchased by citizens of another country. Sri Lanka, a small island nation with limited arable land area (27,400 sq. km) cannot solely rely on agricultural and plantation crops to meet the increasing demand for foreign exchange. One of the strategies adopted by small nations in the region (e.g., Singapore) is to improve export entrepreneurship and increase net value addition (not merely increasing exports). Such attempts were made by successive Sri Lankan governments since 1978 but thrust was only to increase industrial exports (but not the net value addition) to supplement the declining earnings from agricultural and plantation commodities (21%). As a result Sri Lanka was able to increase industrial exports (68%).
Although share of industrial exports surpassed the share of plantation and agricultural commodities, net contribution to foreign exchange earnings may not as large as its share. Other important factor is the stagnated number of exporters in recent years. According to recent research, number of entrepreneurs in a country is positively related to economic growth. Validity of this argument is evident when considering the declining trend of exports contribution to GDP (around 16%) while remaining the number of exporters constant.
What is export entrepreneurship
Definition for export entrepreneurship is rare in entrepreneurship literature. However we can derive a definition for export entrepreneurship using widely used definitions for entrepreneurship in general. Some scholars argue that entrepreneurship is opportunity (nature of business) based behaviour while others argue that entrepreneurship is involved in three activities (discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities for profit in five areas: to introduce i. new goods and services ii. ways of organising iii. new markets iv. new processes iv. new raw materials through organising efforts that previously had not existed. When the opportunities are in the international business it may be termed export entrepreneurship.
According to above definition we have to assess to what extent our exports are entrepreneurial. The other research finding in entrepreneurship is the number of entrepreneurs of a country is positively related to economic growth. Then we have to assess whether we have increased the number of export entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka over last five years or so, number of new raw material discovered, number of new markets we found, number of new processes introduced and new services introduced.
History of export entrepreneurship
Although Sri Lanka had been exporting since history known to us, very often, opportunities were discovered by buyers or traders of other countries. Therefore, our history of export entrepreneurship is not that entrepreneurial until 17th century with the invasion of Dutch traders.
After the invasion of foreign nations, gradually Sri Lanka started to processed export plantation crops (tea, rubber sheets, and coconut oil) may be the origin of both industry and export industry.
Most of these markets were organised by British and Dutch entrepreneurs who were also the producers of those crops. Involvement of Sri Lankans in the export trade in early years found to be minimal. Even today majority of Sri Lankan plantation crops and spices are exported to destinations founded by foreign companies. As a result, local skills of export entrepreneurship or the discovery of opportunities in international markets had not been very significant.
Considering the recent history of export policy regimes, export entrepreneurship may have started formally only in 1979. Export Development Board (EDB) was established in 1979 under the Export Development Act, No. 40 0f 1979 may be the first formal organisation established to promote exports although entrepreneurship was not a mandate of the Act.
According to performance indicators of EDB in 2016, contribution from exports to Gross National Product (GDP) is declining since 2011. These contributions to GDP fell from 16.85 percent in 2011 to 13.78 percent in 2016.
This stagnation and gradual decline may occur due to two reasons: expansion of GDP relative to exports and high dependency percent. Dependency percent is the indicator which determines the potential for further value addition. For example, apparel industry which claims 52 percent of total industrial exports and 40 percent of the total exports has high dependency percent according to World Bank working papers. Some local researchers claim that 50 percent of value of imports is devoted to textiles and its accessories and 70 percent of cost of production of apparel is for textile and its accessories. This indicates that the room for further value addition in leading exports of Sri Lanka is limited.
The other factor is diversity of exports. According to performance indicators of 2014, only seven products claim for 80 percent of total exports. These include textiles and garment (44 %), tea (14%), rubber (8 %), coconut (5 %). From these figures one can think three things: i poor diversity restricts adding value addition products which in turn restrict innovation ii. low contribution from main plantation crops but utilizes higher percentage of arable land iii. failing to find new product market, new products for existing markets. Lack of diversity of export markets is also a factor to be considered. Accordingly, European Union (EU) buys 31 percent of exports while USA claims 27 percent of Sri Lankan exports in 2014.
Even though we are next to two largest markets (India and Pakistan), our exports to these countries account only for 6 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. The silver line in this export cloud is entry into US and EU market which demand high quality. According to World Bank reports, Sri Lanka reputed for supplying intimate garments which fetches comparatively low prices. As a result young talent of Sri Lanka is devoted to CMT processes (cut, make, and trim) and opportunities for young fashion designers were curtailed.
Current status of value addition
In majority of research and reports produced by government agencies failed to highlight dependency of Sri Lankan exports. For example, Sri Lankan apparel industry is among highly dependent industries in the world. According to World Bank working papers Sri Lankan apparel industry is third on dependency among apparel exporting countries with 40 percent dependency. Leading countries in dependency are Cambodia (85 percent), Bangladesh (71 percent). Value addition in takes place at various stages of value chain until it reaches end user.
The greater the room for value addition, the lower the cost of inputs utilized. Most of the leading exports of Sri Lanka use import intermediate goods as raw material (eg., textile for apparel; leather for foot wear). As a result room for value addition becoming limited and dependency is increased.
As stated in introduction, export entrepreneurship is opportunity based concept which involved in opportunity seeking in international trade, innovation and risk taking potential. Innovation always takes place at individual and firm level. Role of government is to facilitate these risks preferred firms and individuals.
According to research there are four major problems to be encountered by export entrepreneurs: i. high cost incurred in the starting exporting business (sunk cost), ii. introducing old products to new markets (what we are doing now), iii. introducing new products that are not consumed by local consumers (EDB has supported for this considerably), iv. Cost incurred in changing product line when the product is no longer profitable.
Another major problem is with the information about value addition. Some people believe that value addition could be made by adopting some management practices. This is because of not providing information simple digit for value addition. Therefore it is important to develop a formulae to represent each export commodity (e.g., similar to formulae for bus fair). Upon this formulae an index could be made to identify products potential to earn net income for the country. Low infusion of high-tech into export is another major problem to be addressed by policymakers. Considering the structure of Sri Lankan exports, majority of products are low-tech products.
It is timely to get foreign expertise to infuse high-tech into Sri Lankan exports. Another important aspect of export entrepreneurship is finding new raw materials. Although Sri Lanka is rich in minerals such as titanium, graphite, Ilmenite, Rutile, and quartz, we are exporting them in the most basic form. Then it is better to conduct feasibility studies with foreign collaboration to assess the potential of Sri Lankan minerals into intermediate product market.
According to our analysis, the main reason is low value addition potential of Sri Lankan exports due to high dependency percent of leading exports. To improve earning from exports we made several suggestions including introducing single digit index to identify the potential of Sri Lankan export. This may facilitate policy makers to assess the export industry promptly.

Etihad records $1.87 b loss in worst blow to Gulf Carriers
Etihad Airways recorded a $1.87 billion annual loss, revealing the full extent of the pressures facing Persian Gulf carriers as they grapple with the impact of terrorism on global traffic flows and a low oil price thats crimped local travel.
The 2016 loss came after Abu Dhabi-based Etihad booked a $1.06 billion charge from writing down the value of aircraft and a further $808 million hit from the reduced value of stakes in so called equity partners including struggling Air Berlin Plc and Italys Alitalia SpA, which filed for bankruptcy in May.
The earnings reversal, revealed Thursday, comes after Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest Gulf carrier and the worlds largest long-haul airline, in May reported its first annual profit decline for five years. Mideast operators are facing the first serious challenge to years of breakneck expansion that have seen them exploit their position at a natural crossroads to win a major share of the lucrative inter-continental travel market.
This year is just as challenging for the global aviation industry and the ever-evolving competitive environment is likely to impact overall performance in 2017, Ray Gammell, interim chief executive officer of Etihad Aviation Group, said in a statement.
The loss was equivalent to almost 40 percent of Etihad Airs passenger revenue and more than 20 percent of its overall revenue of $8.36 billion. The company, which had a profit of $103 million a year earlier, didnt publish full group numbers, and the hit from partners includes only the impact of commercial ties rather than losses there.
U.S. Curbs
Pressure on Gulf carriers has mounted further this year after President Donald Trumps administration sought to restrict travel to America by people from a number of Muslim-majority nations and later imposed restrictions on using electronic devices in the cabins of U.S.-bound planes departing Mideast hub.
While the curbs watered down after being blocked in court and the laptops ban removed, Etihad, the third-biggest Gulf carrier, said last month it will scrap flights to San Francisco in October citing lower-than-anticipated fares. Emirates had earlier moved to eliminate 25 weekly flights to the U.S.
Delta Air Lines Inc., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. have accused their Gulf rivals of competing unfairly by taking subsidies from their state-owners, allowing them to serve some routes unprofitably -- a claim the Mideast operators reject. The U.S. carriers have also lobbied Trump to limit access to the U.S.
Emirates said in its earnings release that the last year had been punctuated by a run of destabilizing events including terror attacks in Europe and the Mediterranean, Britains vote to leave the European Union and an immigration crisis linked to conflicts in the Middle East, as well U.S. travel policies.
Qatar Blockade
While Qatar Airways, the Gulf No. 2, reported a 22 percent gain in earnings for the year through March, the Doha-based carrier has been left battling a slump in travel after four Arab countries imposed a blockade on its government-owner last month. The airline has scrapped 125 daily flights with others taking long and costly detours to avoid closed airspace.
Etihad is continuing to implement group-wide changes as part of a strategic review, Gammell said, as well as assessing its minority holdings following an exit from Switzerlands Darwin Airline last week. The group is also continuing its search for a permanent CEO following the exit of Australian James Hogan, who hatched the investment strategy to catch up with Emirates and Qatar Air. Yields, a measure of fares, fell 8 percent in the year, Etihad said. Prices dropped across all cabins, with business class worst hit as some premium travelers downgraded to coach with crude still in the doldrums. Fuel hedging also hurt its performance but should have less of an impact this year, it said.
Overhead costs were cut by 4 percent through job cuts and other measures, and the airline has introduced a new fees to boost ancillary revenues from perks such a neighbor-free seating for economy-class passengers.

External sector strengthens, export earnings rise
Sri Lankas external sector strengthened with significant inflows to the financial account of the balance of payments (BOP) with proceeds from the 11th international sovereign bond (ISB) issuance and a syndicated loan facility in May 2017.
These inflows resulted in an increase in gross official reserves from US dollars 5 billion as at end April 2017 to US dollars 6.8 billion as at end May 2017. Investor confidence in the Sri Lankan economy continued to be buoyant with continuous inflows to the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
However, the current account of the BOP demonstrated a mixed performance during May with a widening of the trade deficit and a moderation in earnings from tourism and workers remittances. Despite exports increasing for the third consecutive month, the higher increase in import expenditure resulted in a further expansion of the trade deficit. Overall, continuous inflows to the financial account with positive investor sentiments and a gradual rebalancing of the current account is expected to positively impact Sri Lankas external sector during the second half of 2017. Continuing the year-on-year increasing trend observed since March 2017, earnings from exports expanded for the third consecutive month in May 2017. Accordingly, export earnings increased by 7.8 per cent to US dollars 841 million in May 2017 compared to US dollars 780 million recorded in the corresponding month of the previous year.
The largest contribution for this increase was from agricultural exports followed by industrial exports. Earnings from agricultural exports at US dollars 223 million increased by 32 per cent (year-on-year) in May 2017 due to higher exports of all agricultural goods except coconut kernel products.
Export earnings from tea grew by 45.9 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 132 million owing to both higher prices and increased volumes.
Reflecting high tea prices in the international market, the average export price of tea increased to US dollars 5.41 per kg in May 2017 in comparison to US dollars 4.24 per kg in May 2016.
Earnings from seafood exports increased by 40.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 18 million in May 2017 benefitting from the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market.
On a cumulative basis, earnings from exports grew by 4.3 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 4,410 million during the first five months of 2017.
Expenditure on imports increased to US dollars 1,727 million in May 2017 registering a 8.6 per cent (year-on-year) growth, reflecting higher demand for consumer goods and investment goods imports.
Expenditure on consumer goods imports increased by 17.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 386 million in May 2017, mainly driven by higher imports of food and beverages particularly sugar and rice.
On a cumulative basis, import expenditure at US dollars 8,610 million during the first five months of 2017 increased by 12.6 per cent (year-on-year) largely due to higher imports of fuel, rice and gold.
The deficit in the trade balance widened to US dollars 886 million in May 2017 compared to US dollars 810 million in May 2016.
The cumulative trade deficit during the first five months of 2017 increased to US dollars 4,200 million from US dollars 3,415 million in the corresponding period of 2016.
In May 2017, tourist arrivals recorded a decline of 2.5 per cent, year-on-year, with 121,891 tourists arriving during the month.
The overall BOP is estimated to have recorded a surplus of US dollars 1,586.6 million during the first five months of 2017 in comparison to a deficit of US dollars 1,142.4 million recorded during the corresponding period of 2016.
Sri Lankas gross official reserves increased to US dollars 6.8 billion by end May 2017 with the proceeds from the ISB issuance and the syndicated loan facility.
The gross official reserves were equivalent to 4.0 months of imports, while total foreign assets at US dollars 8.9 billion were equivalent to 5.2 months of imports.

Finn remains in England squad for fourth Test
London: Steven Finn has been retained in a 13-man England squad for this weeks fourth Test against South Africa after the injured Mark Wood was ruled out of the Old Trafford match.
Just hours after England wrapped up a 239-run win in the third Test at The Oval on Monday, a result that left them 2-1 up with one to play, the selectors announced that Finn would travel with the squad to Manchester, where the series finale starts on Friday. Finn was summoned as late cover for Wood on the eve of The Oval clash, after the Durham quick was sidelined with a heel injury that means he has now been omitted from the Old Trafford squad as well, but did not make it into the XI.
Mondays announcement means Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan is set to be given another chance to prove his worth at Test level after managing scores of just one and 10 on debut at The Oval. Keaton Jennings is also in line to retain his place after the opener, like Malan brought up in South Africa, made a determined 48 in Englands second innings at The Oval after managing a mere three runs in his three previous knocks.
Hampshire left-arm spinner Liam Dawson, who did not play at The Oval after featuring in the first two Tests of this series, was retained in the squad. AFP
England squad:
Alastair Cook (Essex), Keaton Jennings (Durham), Tom Westley (Essex), Joe Root (capt), Dawid Malan (Middlesex), Ben Stokes (Durham), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire, wkt), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Toby Roland-Jones (Middlesex), James Anderson (Lancashire), Steven Finn (Middlesex), Liam Dawson (Hampshire)

Fortune Global 500 firms look to emerging economies for growth
The newly-released Fortune Global 500 Index for 2017 reaffirms the ever-increasing role that emerging markets are playing as a driver of growth across the world economy and the pull they are exerting on many of the biggest international companies.
Oxford Business Group (OBG), which has long served as a valuable point of reference for investors seeking in-depth analysis and data on the emerging markets shaping the future balance of economic power, once again saw its subscriptions from the worlds biggest companies increase.
Representatives from 336 or 67% of companies listed on the index are now using the international publishing, research and consultancy firm as a source of reference for their operations, up from 309, or 61% in 2016.
Research also showed that business leaders from eight of the top ten companies appearing on the 2017 Fortune Global 500 Index had subscriptions with OBG. The number of top firms either relocating to emerging economies or extending their reach into these dynamic markets has been rising steadily since the turn of the millennium.
According to data compiled by EY, 132 of the worlds largest companies were headquartered in emerging markets in 2014, up from 21 in the year 2000.
Oliver Cornock, OBGs Editor-in-Chief, said that while emerging markets have been increasing their share of global GDP since the fall of the Berlin Wall, their expansion had accelerated markedly over the past two decades, buoyed by favourable tax environments and other competitive advantages.
Corporate income tax imposed on non-US-headquartered companies fell from 39.2% in 2000 to 28.1% in 2014, while the share of Fortune Global 500 companies based in the US declined from roughly 36% to 26% over the same period, he said. Other factors fuelling the relocation of these companies to emerging economies include local market potential, maturity of the industry, logistical capabilities, level of infrastructure, political stability, the quality of the employment market and ease of business entry.
Cornock noted that data also pointed to a rise in the number of new firms from within emerging markets earning a place on the Fortune Global 500 list, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
According to a report by PwC, the proportion of SOEs on the index grew from 9% in 2005 to 23% in 2014.
SOEs from China are playing a key part in steering this shift, which is expected to continue, according to Cornock. Privatisation and partial divestments of state-owned firms and assets in the years to come will undoubtedly result in more companies finding their way onto the Fortune Global 500 list, he said.
Cornock added that emerging markets were expected to dominate the development and composition of the index in the years to come.
Research suggests that emerging economies share of the Fortune Global 500 companies will jump to more than 45% by 2025, a trend we will be tracking closely for our growing number of subscribers, who include heads of state, CEOs, institutional investors, analysts and academics, all looking for macro information on emerging markets, he said.
Basak Pasali, OBGs Director of Communications, welcomed the rise in subscriptions from the worlds biggest firms, noting that many of the Groups readers were themselves employed by or did business with Fortune Global 500 companies.
As a trusted provider of foreign direct investment insight at a time when emerging markets are dominating the global growth, Oxford Business Groups analysis and understanding of these and other worldwide economic trends makes us an invaluable resource to international companies across the sectors, she said.
Im delighted that we now have subscribers at 336 of the companies on the Fortune Global 500 list and am confident that they will continue to draw on our business intelligence when making their investment decisions. The Fortune Global 500 Index is an annually-produced list of the worlds 500 largest corporations, ranked by revenue for the fiscal year ended on or before March 31.
Its latest list was published on July20.

Galgamuwa people cry out for cool clear water
Water has not been a common sight in the dry zone, while the search for water is a struggle even during the best of times. But for the last one and a half years, Galgamuwa, a Divisional Secretariat division in the Kurunegala District had sadly witnessed its lakes drying out, paddy fields wilting, while the hope for rain fades away.
It is a cloudless sky in Galgamuwa and any that dare to appear are soon swept away by warm winds. The rays of the sun beat down directly, burning the soil and evaporating every trace of water that collects on the ground. As the country braces for a long drought, residents of Galgamuwa are fast losing hope. They fear that not only the rains and the government, but also the Gods have abandoned them, leaving them high and dry.
Many villages in the North Western Province have fallen into the clutches of the drought, while 62 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat are no different. Villagers in the area have had to trek several miles in search of water, while their soles of their feet had begun to resemble the cracks on the ground they walk on. Those who could afford, hire tractors and lorries to travel even greater distances in search of water. But the Galgamuwa villager in addition to his lack of water, would have to sacrifice his Yala cultivation to the severe drought this year.
Of the 180 small and medium tanks, 160 have already reached rock bottom. Water levels in the remaining 20 tanks are on the verge of drying up. As a result, over 90 per cent of the cultivation in the main agrarian areas have now been lost. Those who had traditional wells too have started to suffer the decrease of the water levels. As water turns scarce, wild animals too have begun invading villages in search of water, increasing the number of animal attacks in villages.
Palukadawala Lake running dry
The Palukadawala Lake has been the main source of water for both agriculture as well as for drinking water purposes in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat for many years. Farmers of the Mee Oya project have to depend for water for the cultivation of their lands, but today, with very little rain, people have started to find it hard to meet all their water needs from the lake.
We have around 270 families in our village who depend on this lake. Apart from drinking water, all our water needs are met by this lake. We depend on the village temple well for our drinking water. But that well too had almost dried up. If we go there around 3 - 4 am, we could manage to fill a pot of water. The water level there too is not that good. In families where there are small children, they undergo many problems, said M.S. Mohideen, a resident of Palukadawala.
The Palukadawala Lake is the central source for the water supply in the area and when it is full, the wells in the surrounding areas too are replenished, explained A.B. Manchanayake, also a resident of Palukadawala.
We have all come to a decision to stop the release of water we presently possess for agricultural purposes as that would affect people more. Fishermen who have come to depended on this lake too are in trouble now. Since many of the water in this area is hard water, there are few options available to the people of Galgamuwa.
If this goes on, water in this lake would be polluted that other than bathing, the people wont even be able to use it for some other purpose. Similarly, we were not able to cultivate our usual two seasons this time. We are going to face many more problems in the future, he added.
No work and no food
Water today, has turned more precious than gold in these villages, while many have begun even to fight over the little water they possess. While the earth has hardened to the extent that one could not even plough the fields, those who managed to do so, have abandoned the prepared fields as there was no water to cultivate. Those who expected to at least grow some seed paddy, have found that their harvest has been scorched.
All our paddy fields have wilted by now. We shifted to chena cultivation, but that too was of no use. As the water levels in the lakes recede, the chances of any water being released to the fields have turned slim.
There are around 320 families in this village. All these people are suffering due to lack of water. The five lakes of Mahawewa, Ambagahagama wewa, Galkandawewa, Dikwewa and Dembatagahawewa have all turned dry, while villagers have to bathe in muddy water.
Even the cows and goats who used to be able to drink from the shore have to wade into the Lake for some water, turning the water even murkier. It is this water that the people have to bathe in. Most of the big lakes too have no water. If this continues for another month, we might even die for the lack of water, said D.M. Tilakaratne, a resident of the 48th Grama Niladhari division in Galgamuwa.
Galgamuwa Agrarian Services, Executive Officer, A. A. W. S. Pradeep observed that the severe drought which was similar to that of last year, would have to significantly reduce the acreage cultivated.
Except for the Mahaweli region, no other region has been able to cultivate this year.
Especially in areas which depend on small and medium irrigation schemes.
When you take the 2016 Yala season, we had already harvested paddy by this time. Apart from paddy, people have also stopped growing vegetables. Not a cloud was yet to be seen in the sky. So people have lost their hope that rains would come down soon. We are trying our best to do something fair to the farmer, even with all these water problems, said Pradeep.
Within the Galgamuwa Agrarian Services Division, there are 2,257.5 acres belonging to the Mahaweli zone. A further 4,601.9 acres belongs to other major irrigation schemes, while 3,138.87 acres are cultivated using minor irrigation schemes. All cultivations under minor irrigation schemes have completely stopped, explained Pradeep.
In addition, there are 1,110 acres dependent on rain fed agriculture. Out of all this land however, only 1,580.25 acres have so far been cultivated. Pradeep said that this would lead to food security issues in future.
At present, of the 49 Grama Niladari divisions under the Galgamuwa Agrarian Services Division, only four Grama Niladari divisions have been engaged in some sort of agricultural activity. This had led to the worsening of the farmers economic conditions, as many were also not able to cultivate during last years, Maha and Yala seasons.
With farming on the decline, employment opportunities in the area are on a sharp decline and a large section of the population, it seems have simply resorted to staying at home.
Dry moulds
The lack of water has also had a drastic impact on the traditional pottery industry in the area. The village of Hampukumbura in No 77 Kalegama, Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat, had always been a traditional pottery village. For hundreds of years, its residents had depended on pottery for a livelihood. With the lack of water to make pots however, the industry has almost come to a standstill,
We have been in this business from the time of my father. For the last 30 years, my wife and I have been making clay pots for a living. We take the silt from the banks of the lake, people remove that silt having got permission for that and it is sold to us by tractor load.
Each load would cost Rs. 1,500 which was sufficient for a month. But today, we have a major water crisis and the number of pots we make have greatly reduced. To be honest, when we make the potting mixture, by the time it had been mixed, it dries up fast. The strong sun does not help either, so we are in deep trouble, M.J.A. Ananda Jayakody, a resident from Kalegama said.
There are around 83 families living in the village, said J.A. Ramani and all of them engage in pottery making.
Water is life to this industry just as it is life to us. A few days ago, we received a bit of pipe borne water, but we dont even have that now. There is a bit of water in the lake, but everyone in the village depends on that. At this rate, we will soon run out of water and I am not sure what we would be able to do then, she explained.
According to the Disaster Management Centre, close to 1,038 families have been impacted as a result of the prevailing drought, with the Divisional Secretariat having to deal with water issues of 3,650 individuals. Around 14 Grama Niladari divisions are suffering from the acute shortage of drinking water. DMC officials have resorted to using two bowsers at present to meet the water demands of the people. Accordingly, greater Galgamuwa, Diwullewa, Medawachchiya, Buduruwakanda, Upper Palukandewa, Kaluwaragaswewa, Kurundankulama, Kallanchiya, Monnankulama, Ihalagama, Ganediwulwewa, Kurundewa, Kohomankulama and Palukadawala face severe water shortages and bowsers have been sent to these regions, said DMC officer, J.M. Upali Jayasinghe.
In the Kurunegala District, a total of 33,032 families have been affected by the drought.
The Galgamuwa hospital which has not been opened for a long period, was declared open by President Maithripala Sirisena on July 20, but it is learnt that the hospital too suffers from a water issue, while no permanent solution had been offered to it so far. As a result, many patients who seek treatment at the hospital, if needed to be admitted are transferred out to other hospitals.
The greatest fear in the minds of all who live in the district was What would we do once we reach the bottom of the Palukadawala Lake

Global climate change may not be due to anthropogenic generation of carbon dioxide
During the recently held Economic Summit at Cinnamon Grand, there was an interesting discussion on Sustainable Development attended by Dr. RaeKwon Chung, advisor to Ban Ki Moon and local experts.
After Dr. Prashanthi Gunawardena mentioned that cement kilns at Puttlam Cement generates very significant amounts of CO2, I sent a small note to the panel worded as follows: According to the 'State of the Climate' published by USA every year, out of the three energy flow rates crossing the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) boundary - Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), Reflected Short Wave radiation (RSW) and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) - the only flow rate which has shown a statistically significant variation during the six years 2010-2015 was the Reflected Shortwave Radiation.
Does not this indicate that any change in earths climate is not due to anthropogenic carbondioxide
The panel did not give any response to the question. So, I rang up Dr. Gunawardane later and said that I had been the Deputy Works Manager of the Puttlam Cement Works as it was called then and that I had seen studies indicating that concrete would utilize the smallest amount of energy to provide a given structural strength out of all structural materials considered at that time in early 1980s.
That was a time when we did not worry about greenhouse gases. In fact, I was the person who prepared project feasibility studies for converting both Puttalam and Kankasanthurai cement factories into coal firing from oil firing. Of course, CO2 generated from decomposition of CaCO3 during cement manufacture is much more than the amount of CO2 generated during coal combustion in the kilns.
When I asked her about the note, she said that since the session was not on climate change per se they did not want to respond to it. I have no issue about it.
Since this issue has come into the domain of public knowledge now and this may be the first time this aspect being publicly expressed anywhere in the world, I want to be a bit more specific on it and thus this statement
Out of the three energy flow rates mentioned above, the only long wave radiation, due to it been generated at global temperatures is Outgoing Longwave Radiation(OLR). Any alien living in another planet could decide whether Planet Earth is warming or not by checking whether this OLR is increasing or not. And it has not shown a statistically significant change.
Both the other flowrates TSI and RSW are shortwave radiations due to having originated from the sun at 5800 K and their changes will not show whether earth is warming or not.
According to current climate change pronouncements, RSW should be decreasing due to anthropogenic CO2 increasing global temperature and melting icecaps.
Furthermore, such decreases could be due to this ice cap melting, deforestation and also laying of tarred road surfaces.
On the other hand, RSW could increase due to cloud formation, volcanic eruptions and excessive dust particles in the air.
RSW has indicated the following three statistically significant variations during the last six years: 2010 + 0.6Wm - 2,2013 + 0.45Wm - 2 and 2015 - 0.45Wm - 2 and during the other three years 2011, 2012 and 2014, the changes had been statistically insignificant decreases.
If one looks at anthropogenic energy generation using fossil fuels, the only output from this energy generation which could both increase and decrease RSW is water vapour - Newly Formed Water - NFW as I call it.
When this water condenses to form clouds, it could lead to increases in RSW and when this water collects in the atmosphere as atmospheric rivers or Pineapple Express it would reduce RSW.
I strongly believe that anybody - any person, country or organization - interested in solving climate change should - it may be too late even now - start addressing this reduction in RSW and the solution I have proposed - Highway Solarisation linked with electrification of road transportation - will make the biggest contribution towards achievement of this out of all possible suggestions; at the rate of 1.4 KWhrs reduction in global warming per every kWhr of electricity generated.

Govt. to import rice to face drought
The Government will import rice in response to drought. Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is finalising the orders to purchase rice from Thailand and Myanmar in keeping with recommendations by President Maithripala Sirisena and the Governments Cost of Living Committee, a spokesman for the Industry and Commerce Ministry said.
He said Minister Bathiudeen had negotiations with rice authorities in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Myanmar to procure rice tranches.
The ministry will import 100,000 metric tons of Nadu and 25,000 metric tons of white raw rice from Thailand. About 30,000 metric tons of white raw rice will be imported from Myanmar and 100,000 metric tons from India to ensure sufficient rice in the market, he said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe participating in a pinnacle unveiling ceremony at the Sri Mamgalarama Temple in Galnewa, said the drought is threatening the countrys rice production. If the drought continues it could bring down rice production by 50 percent, he said.
Industrial and Commerce Ministry sources said Pakistan agreed to supply rice to Sri Lanka from September.
The sources said paddy stocks in Government warehouses are being taken out for milling to face a possible shortage.
The milled rice will be sold to consumers lower than the market price. The ministry expects 187,000 metric tons of rice to flow into the market soon. With the rice supplies from India, there will be 287,000 metric tons for each month. There will be an excess of 87,000 metric tons of rice for consumption, the sources said.

THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES: A STUDY IN SUSPENSE
Written as a powerful fiction that became a modern classic in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created two characters based in London of the time as two detectives, Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson who practiced their profession at 221B Baker Street. So realistic was the address that people from and around London, sought their assistance to solve mysteries and so great was this fictional address that led to the creation of clubs such as Baker Street Irregulars in New York in 1935, Sherlock Holmes Society of London in 1951 and a Sherlock Holmes collection in Marylebon Public Library in London.
This was their Scotland Yard they believed in. All criminal cases and murders were handled by Holmes and Watson so much so that people in trouble visited 221B Baker Street, London until the internet replaced this address that was fictions much like Holmes and Watson when they realized they were no better than other fictions such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza or for that matter like Steinbeck's George and Lennie and may be like of Mice and Men who were seen as two sides of the same person as Holmes and Watson. The difference that modeled Sherlock Homes as an armature detective and together they appear in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1891 and the Memories of Sherlock Holmes in 1894 which are collection of short stories. Conan Doyle who made his detective look partly like a teacher from Edinburgh but known for his powers for detection in the field of medicine. He was made to appear as rather an eccentric man because of his behaviuor with such unusual gifts. However, to all of us Dr. Watson appear less original and not quick in the uptake.
Getting rid of Sherlock Holmes
By the time Holmes became globally famous, Conan Doyle was tired and exasperated writing on him and planned willfully to 'finish' him off but his readers demanded him to continue. He was already tired of his hero and allowed him to fall to his death from Swiss Alps in the story of The Final Problem. He had to 'resurrect' Sherlock Holmes back to life for further adventures as recorded and collected by Dr. Watson in The return of Sherlock Holmes in 1914, His Last Bow in 1917 and The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes in 1927.The first edition of The Hound of The Baskervilles was in 1902.
SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
Who was a doctor from Edinburgh University was in service from 1891. He was knighted in 1902 after his work in field hospital in Bloemfontein during the South African War from 1899 to 1891.
He most probably may have drawn the character of Dr. Watson from where he worked, Edinburgh University. Conan Doyle used basic language sans literary brilliance but it superseded many books of his time mainly because he was a man of medicine but loaded with imagination beyond what a mind can conceive.
THE LEGEND BEHIND THE HOUND
One of the most complicated and harrowing legends I have read over and again to feel its intended impact, Hound of the Baskervilles is spiced up in mystery, intrigue, suspense and ideology making the reader's mind reel and spin The story has many compelling questions posed such as this conversation with the cabman hired by Holmes in a situation that pointed to wrong identities and made Holmes laugh at himself but making the mystery deeper and deeper :-
'They told me later that a gentleman at this address was asking for 2704.
I have driven this cab for seven years. What do you have against me
'I have nothing against you, my good man' said Holmes but have a half sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my question'
'Well, I've had a good day and no mistake. What was it you wanted, Sir
'First of all your name and address
'John Clayton, 3, Turpey Road
Sherlock Holmes made a not of it.
'Now, Clayton, tell me about your passenger who came and watched this house at ten o'clock this morning
The cabman looked surprised.
'Why, there is no good in telling you things you already know. The gentle man told me he was a detective and that I was to say nothing to anyone. 'My good fellow, you may find yourself in a rather bad position if you try to hide anything from me. Dis he say anything more 
'He said his name'
'What was his name
'His name, said the cabman was' Sherlock Holmes'.
Never had I seen my friend more surprised. Then he burst out laughing.
The cabman was happy left when he left and Holmes turned to me,
'I tell you Watson, this time we are fighting a very clever man. I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire than here in London but I do not like sending you. Towards the end of the story and in the dark night of Dartmoor was the site where the legendary Hound of The Baskervilles stay hidden. Obviously two men hid on the moor to be apprehended later. Holmes and Dr. Watson combed through evidence why Barrymore the butler kept watch at the window. Did they expect the Hound to be back to hunt Sir Henry Baskerville. As they kept probing one after the other, fresh clues emerged for the detectives to consider whether Sir Charles walked away from the house and not towards it. Obviously, Sir Henry was in full control of the situation and well focused.
Stapletons plan
In the meantime and on last day, Mrs. Stapleton knew her husband was in the outhouse and planned to kill Sir Henry. She was angry and would not allow him to do so. She would go out and tell the people of his plan and therefore he tied her up until Holmes and Watson discovered and saved her life.
Stapleton's plan to get the money and set himself as the master of the Hall, intrigued and baffled Holmes and Watson but they were aware if somehow he found the money he will move in with his mistress to the Hall.
Or would he
There was Mrs. Stapleton whom he thought was dead and Sir Henry and the wining of the unfortunate Hound whose death call, will haunt him forever.
As for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, there was more work waiting for them at Baker Street.

Immediate relief for drought victims
Cabinet yesterday made the decision to provide people affected by the drought a relief pack with essential items worth Rs 5,000 per month for the next two months.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera addressing the media at the end of the meeting with the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Cost of Living (CSCL) at the Finance Ministry said the relief items provided for the month will be split into two. Beneficiaries will receive Rs 2,500 worth of good every two weeks.
As the prevailing drought further devastates paddy harvests, Minister Amaraweera said the CSCL had also made the decision to decrease the Special Commodity Levy on rice import from Rs 5 per kilo to .25 cents per kilo.
Essential Items Importers Association Secretary, K.Ilamanathan explained that given the reduction in tax, importers have now been able to provide white raw rice (Vietnam) at Rs 60 per kilo, par boiled (Nadu) at Rs 72 per kilo and ponni rice at Rs 75 to 76 per kilo.
In addition, the Cabinet Sub-Committee has also opened up imports for wheat flour and wheat grain,
Cess tax on wheat flour has been reduced from Rs 25 to Rs 15 and wheat grain tax has been reduced from Rs 9 to Rs 6, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He added that the maximum retail price of packeted flour too has been removed.
The main reason behind reducing the price of flour is the prevailing drought. We are not aiming to make people switch to flour. Rice is our focus but local harvests have drastically reduced due to the drought.
In the next few months, even though the droughts continue, the government will ensure that the price of essential items remain stable. The government is also taking action to encourage food production, Minister Amaraweera said.
The Fisheries Ministry has also requested that the special commodity levy on wet fish be reduced by Rs 50. Accordingly the levy on imported thalapath and koppara have been reduced from Rs 75 to Rs 25.
The Industry and Commerce Ministry in the meantime has drawn out MoUs to import 100,000 metric tonnes of par boiled (Nadu) rice and another 25,000 metric tonnes of white raw rice from Thailand.
Another MoU has been drawn up to import 30,000 metric tonnes of white raw rice from Myanmar.
The CWE, the Industry and Commerce Ministry announced had also started extracting 51000 metric tonnes of paddy lying with the Paddy Marketing Boards warehouses to mill in CWEs own mills and through private millers.
The Ministry expects 187,000 metric tonnes of rice to flood the market immediately.
The country consumes 200,000 metric tonnes rice a month.

India to host Sri Lanka for full series later this year

India will host Sri Lanka for a full series later this year, with the cricket board adding nearly two dozen matches to the tail-end of a packed home schedule for Virat Kohli's team.
India will now host Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka back-to-back at venues across the country between September-December.
Australia, who went down 2-1 to hosts India in the Test series earlier this year, will return for five one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches.
India will then welcome New Zealand for three ODIs and three T20 matches, followed by Sri Lanka for a return series with three Tests, three ODIs and three T20s.
India are currently touring Sri Lanka. The two sides meet Thursday for the second of three Tests after the hosts were thrashed in the first, and they then play five ODIs and one T20.
Sri Lanka had previously been expected to tour India next March. But the Board of Control for Cricket in India adjusted the schedule because the island is hosting the Independence Cup over that period.
"Sri Lanka has always co-operated with India and therefore India will be making a reciprocal short visit only to play the Independence Cup," BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary told reporters on Tuesday.
"Another reason being there are six proposed exchange of tours between India and Pakistan which did not happen, so those spaces had to be adjusted."
India are slated to tour South Africa for a full series after completing their matches against Sri Lanka.
Schedule:
Australia: 5 ODIs in Chennai, Bangalore, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata; 3 T20Is in Hyderabad, Ranchi, Guwahati
New Zealand: 3 ODIs in Pune, Mumbai, Kanpur; 3 T20Is in Delhi, Cuttack, Rajkot
Sri Lanka: 3 Tests in Kolkata, Nagpur, Delhi; 3 ODIs in Dharamsala, Mohali, Vizag; 3 T20Is in Kochi/Thiruvananthapuram, Indore, Mumbai

Kerala and Assam may host Sri Lanka Tests
Two new venues, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and Barsapara in Assam are in contention to host Test matches during the home series against Sri Lanka as India are set to play a record 23 international matches at home between September and December.
A decision will be taken by BCCI's Tours and Fixtures Committee in Kolkata.
According to a BCCI office-bearer, who can't be officially quoted, India will play five ODIs and three T20 Internationals against Australia from September end to mid of October. The series will be followed by three ODIs and as many T20Is against New Zealand. The series against the Black Caps Kiwis will begin late in October and conclude in the first week of November.
The home season will end in December with three Tests, three ODIs and three T20 Internationals against Sri Lanka. After that Virat Kohli and his men fly down to South Africa.
"There are a whopping 23 International matches at home. Three Tests, 11 ODIs and nine T20 Internationals. Each and every venue in India will be covered.
Barsapara in Assam and Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram have got Test status. Both are vying for Test matches. Most of the bigger centres want either a T20 International or ODIs," a BCCI official told PTI today.
A Kerala Cricket Association official confirmed the development.
"Since Kochi's Nehru Stadium, which has traditionally hosted ODIs, will be used for the Fifa U-17 World Cup, we are hoping that Greenfields gets its first Test," he said.
Nagpur, which was under suspension may also be in contention to host a Test match.
The traditional centres such as Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru or Mohali will get ODIs or T20 Internationals, which draw a capacity crowd.
There are possibilities that a couple of centres may get more than a match. "One can be rest assured that at least 16-18 venues will be covered during this phase," he concluded.

Knife Angel
Theres a giant 26-foot-tall Knife Angel sculpture in the UK, built entirely out of 100,000 donated knives. But besides the impressive statistics, its also a monument built out of morbid necessity to remember the victims fallen to the increasing knife violence in the United Kingdom and to finally acknowledge that there is a real problem.
The angels creator, Alfie Radley, has spent two years designing and building the sculpture which features police donated knives that were actually used in violent crimes all over England and Wales, some of which even have the names of the victims engraved onto the blades. The rest came thanks to the help of British Ironwork Centre in Shropshire, which initiated an amnesty program Save a Life, Surrender Your Knife, through which people could anonymously donate their knives to the project.
Besides cleaning every knife of biological material, Alfie also had to blunt every single knife to make sure theyre not sharp anymore, and cant create any damage, Radley told ITV News.
Radley is currently running a petition to put the sculpture on Trafalgar square in London to raise awareness of the issue.

Korea Exim Bank to establish ICT hub for Sri Lanka secondary education
The Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) has completed the KSP-ADB Joint Consulting Programme to establish an ICT hub for secondary education project.
The dissemination seminar was held on July 26 at the Education Ministry with the chairmanship of Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi. At the ceremony, the Korean consultant team presented the final results of the study to the government officials.
The proposed project covers an islandwide plan targeting national, provincial and zonal level ICT education. National Content Development Center (NCDC) and 2 PICTECs (Provincial ICT Education Centers) in Eastern and Southern provinces will be newly built, and five PICTECs and 99 ZICTECs (Zonal ICT Education Centers) will be fully equipped with education materials, network system, and office equipment. In addition, to make the ICT hub more sustainable capacity building programmes for government, officials and consultation on content development and e-Learning will be provided.
Today the urban population of Sri Lanka records a computer literacy level of 39.2 percent, while computer literacy in rural areas and estates are at a considerably lower 25.5 percent and 9 percent respectively. The phenomenon has become a hindrance to realising Sri Lankas development priority of moving towards a digital economy.
In this context, when completed this project will provide not only a strong foundation to realise a digital economy and a knowledge based society but also ICT savvy labour force for labour market to boost Sri Lankan economy.
The Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) provides Official Development Assistance (ODA) for international development and cooperation. The bank signed its first ODA loan agreement with Sri Lanka in 1990 to rehabilitate the Colombo-Galle road. The Bank has approved USD 806 million for 28 development projects in Sri Lanka
The Korea Eximbank also provides financing for international trade and overseas investment, to promote bilateral economic cooperation. Since 1978, Korea Eximbank has provided USD 386 million for trade between Sri Lanka and Korea and for Korean companies foreign direct investments in Sri Lanka.
The KSP (Knowledge Sharing Programme) is a special technical assistance programme provided by the Korea Eximbank under the auspices of the Strategy and Finance Ministry of Korea to share Koreas development experience and knowledge accumulated over the past decades with partner countries.
KSP offers Joint Consulting Programmes with Multilateral Development Banks, Modularization Projects, and Policy Consultation tailored to the needs of partner countries encompassing in-depth analysis, policy recommendations, and training opportunities.

The Thera said Lankaramaya is a significant dagoba constructed in the 1st century BC by the King Vattagamini Abhaya (King Valagamba) enshrining the relics of the Buddha, a section of the Pati Dhathu as well as the jewellery of Soma Devi , the Queen of King Valagamba, which were offered to the Buddha. A shrine for Lankaramaya is felt as it has no place for devotees arriving from different directions to worship the dagaba, Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said. There is evidence of a shrine built in the period of the kings. But it had been destroyed a long time ago, the Thera said. The Thera said the constructions was expected to be completed before June next year.
The construction of a shrine is one of the Eight Great Efficacious Merits. Therefore, the Committee on the construction decided to open opportunities for Buddhist devotees to make their contributions for the construction.
The Thera, who is also the President of the Anuradhapura Lankarama Temple Shrine Fund, said the construction cost of one square feet of the shrine is around Rs. 7,000 and those who wish to make contributions either could contact phone numbers 0252221884 or 0777855399, or send an email to the address [emailprotected]. The contributions could be made to a bank account in Anuradhapura.

Lead by example
Head Prefect of Mahamaya Girls College Kandy Methma Athauda has been inculcated in strong Buddhist values. It is the driving force in her life. Perfect Prefects features Methma Athauda, a proud product of the rich Buddhist traditions and teachings of Mahamaya.
The Post of Prefect-ship requires good leadership qualities. I need to cooperate with others and organize many events at school. So I have to balance my studies and all my other activities with the prefectship. It is not easy but where there is a will there is a way. So as a Head Prefect I must give priority to my studies. So I need to fulfill both commitments, said Athauda
Athauda, a principled young woman regards patience as an admirable quality.
One leadership quality that I regard as important is patience. Another is being friendly with others. They must be able to come and talk with me openly and I need to take their ideas into consideration. I should be easily accessible. I feel another valuable quality in a leader is respecting our teachers and our elders, stated Athauda.
Leading by example is one of her principles.
I feel that it is important for me to be a good example for others. In other words I must lead by example. Otherwise I dont think it is fair for me to ask them to follow me. So the first thing is, being a competent leader so that others will want to follow me. I study in a Buddhist Girls School, so I have to behave in accordance to the values of Buddhist teaching. I need to obey my traditions because Mahamaya is a Buddhist school with a very proud history. So I really must give priority to the traditions and uphold the values that every girl at Mahamaya adheres to, pointed out Athauda.
Tact and diplomacy can go a long way.
Intelligence is an attribute I feel is important because ultimately I have to work with others and organize many things. Without wit I do not think we can execute a plan to satisfaction, added Athauda.
Ambition and conscience are two more of her qualities.
One leader I look up to is Nelson Mandela. He was a fine example to his followers. He always thought about others. I really respect him. My ambition in life is to be a CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of a bank. I am going to sit for my A/Ls in the commerce stream. I always tell my prefects under me to think about the school first and foremost. Do not be self-centered. Give priority to Mahamaya and what it stands for. These values are the cornerstone of the school, explained Athauda.
Having a good education is important for any child. Because that is something no one can take from you.
If you do not have a good education then you wont have a good future. Without your studies your opportunities are limited. Also you need to respect your school. That is your service to the school that has given you so much, informed AthaudaMahamaya has taught her so many lessons.
The Buddhist values taught to me from Mahamaya are being righteous. We need to respect other human beings. I ask them to do the right thing. Take the right path. I believe in doing what is right and I hope others will follow my example, shared Athauda.
Being an Athlete has its own lessons.
I am an Athlete. I have been doing Athletics for nine years. And what I have learnt on the field is hard work. Without hard work we cannot win a game. Athletics is really a competition so we need to practice as hard as we can. Our behaviour must also be disciplined. It helps to be friendly with others on the field of sport. You learn the importance of friendship with others. That is what I have really learnt from Athletics. The partnerships you form, elucidated Athauda.
Mahamaya has been producing women of fine character. Women who are examples to others because of their discipline.
Mahamaya is my second mother. I feel that attitude also plays a big role in your development. I feel that nothing is unattainable. Up to now I have balanced everything. Like I said before, if there is a will there is a way. Of course the help others give you matters a lot. My school is one of the best schools in Sri Lanka. It has provided me with so many opportunities. I am privileged to have this position. This school has gifted us with the incentive and means for us to forge a fine future. We have received a good education. We have received good leadership qualities. I am proud to be a student of Mahamaya. It is a school with a rich history and timeless traditions, said Athauda.
The cooperation she has received cannot be forgotten.
My fellow prefects are very helpful. They bring so many ideas to the table. My Junior Prefects are also very helpful. I am truly grateful for the fact that they respect me and that they cooperate with me. My mother is a big role model for me. My teachers are also very supportive, giving me good advice. They always show us the right path. And for this I really respect them. They are our second mothers, summed up Athauda.

Living with meaning
From time to time, spiritualists and thinkers emerge in the society pronouncing the value of existence and the essence of living conditions via religious visions. These religious visions are manifold. Some are based on the views of other previous religious teachers, and some are based on new interpretations formulated in modernistic outlooks.
The name of such a spiritualist was known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh or more known as Osho (1931  1990).
Though I am not familiar with the popular vision of Osho, I had the chance of reading one collection of conversations and dialogues on the Zen Master Bodhidharma, as compiled by Osho broadly titled as The White Lotus (2014). This compilation of talks as delivered by Osho, the spiritualist is a compendium of visions, dialogues, interpretations, fables, poetic expressions, and above all insights based on Zen as laid down by its founder Bodhidharma. As such, the visions laid down centre around new spiritual findings as reinterpreted and age-old writings more known in China and Japan.
Nothing to realise
What Osho does is to present them in a new outlook to the modern reader. Spanning to eleven chapters, the compilers have taken care to present each chapter to a single point, though allowing the chance for diverse variations. The Chapter One titled as Lotus Rain paves the way to know who a Tathagatha is. The answer is that he is one who knows that he comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. Then what is the Buddha He is one who realises the truth and holds nothing that is not to be realised. Then what is Dharma It is the norm of the universe.
The encounter of the two great personalities, Bodhidharma and Emperor Wu of China, is described as the starting point of the Zen doctrine. The situation is pictured dramatically allowing the age-old legends and the reality interlinked. Followed by the episode, several questions are being answered. What the Buddha mind is one such seminal questions Bodhidharma answers as your mind is it.
The questions and answers lead to stories both actual and fictitious, realistic and fantasy. When one chapter comes to a close, the reader comes across the utterance Enough for today hinting that the question and answers are never ending.
Chapter Two titled as Because I love you centres for the most part to forms of meditation. Osho underlines the process of meditation into a transformation of ones self and one whole entity.
Rigid rules
The entire process of meditation is dealt in terms of events and incidents in the life of Osho. In one of the explanations as regards meditation, Osho says that strict rules can never make a good meditator, and says that no rules can help if imposed from outside. Instead, the process of meditation is a necessity, which is needed to make the mind conditioned by ones own rules laid down by himself.
The concepts and interpretations pertaining to the belief in God and linked matters too are discussed at length. Why people believe in a god is tackled in many ways, paving way for one to reach ones own conclusions. At one moment, he states: If you really know what prayer is, prayer itself is its own reward. There is nobody else to reward you.
Adds he: If you enjoy dance, you dont ask whether there is a god or not. If you enjoy dance, you simply dance, whether anybody is seeing the dance from the sky or not, is not your concern. Whether the stars and the sun and the moon are going to reward you for your dance, you dont care. The dance is enough of a reward in itself.
Perhaps Osho utilised Zen, instant enlightenment as a means to an end.
Textual content
The explanations and doctrinal interpretations seem to the reader as an attractive manner that grips the flow of reading the textual content of the book. The chapters are interlinked and for the most part, one sees the overlappings, which I feel is inevitable. There are dialogues that ensue between psycho analysts and patients. This paves the way for better awareness of the mind.
Cant psychoanalysis help people know themselves on the broad issue This is responded in many ways enabling the reader to gauge his own standpoint. Perhaps as Osho concludes a Buddha is normal, a Jesus is normal, a Zarathustra is normal, a Bodhidharma is normal. (But) you are not normal. You are simply average!
But as he further analyses psychoanalysis, simply helps you adjust yourself to the society you live in. It makes your life a little easier. Chapter Three which centres around the concept of Dharma attempts to interpret it not as a dogma, but as a process that reaches the life structure as a natural phenomenon. Several stories are laid down to interpret it explains the nature of Dharma, Osho explains what he means by Dharma as follows.
His explanation is cited as a response to a question raised by a disciple of Bodhidharma.
By Dharma, remember: ordinarily it is translated as religion. That too is not right. Dharma is not religion. Religion is an attitude towards reality. Dharma is not an attitude towards reality. Dharma is simply living naturally, spontaneously. To live in, tune with nature is Dharma. A Zen master is reported to have said when asked what is Dharma, when I feel hungry, I eat and when I feel sleepy, I sleep.
Stress and strain
This book, which runs to eleven segments, differing from the common categorization into chapters, each contains varying types of approach to the broad aspects of living conditions aiming at alternative ways of thinking, resulting in a new way of living in a more relaxed manner, shredding off stress and strain. Perhaps a reader of The White Lotus has the chance to transform.
The subtext or the inner layer of each chapter is intended to make the reader feel that he or she is freed from bitter material bonds in order to create conditions for the birth of a new kind of human being.
For the first time, I enjoyed reading The White Lotus and recommend it to many others.

Lost and Found in Tamil Nadu
I have visited neighbouring India several times to both the North and the South and felt at home. After all, we Lankans have our ancestral connections with India too. That is not the point. Today we are a separate Nation with individual and unique characteristics but with common parallels in culture and the like.
Two weeks ago.I spent a hurried journey to three places in Tamil Nadu: Chennai Coiambuttur (now known as Kovai in short), and Salem.
In Chennai, I went to the Madras University to collect my academic certificate (MA English) for which I sat for two years in 10 subjects as a Distant Education Candidate and passed with Second Class Honours. At 80 years I consider this an achievement for the simple reason the examination was difficult and the pass mark was 50 with very strict corrections, But I was told that my certificate would be posted to me after the Convocation which was held on July 15, It was delayed for a long time as the Vice-Chancellor was appointed only recently. They reserved the convocation only to PhD holders and Gold Medalists. Since there were a large number of postgraduate students passing the examinations in the various courses of studies, they could not accommodate all at the Convocation Ceremony. This was a disappointment for me.
Nevertheless, I made the time available to make my stay useful. On the 10th I visited my publisher, Manimekalai Prasuram that was printing my new book in Tamil on the International Film Festivals I had seen over the past few decades in New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Goa and Thiruvananthapuram. I read the final proof and approved it for printing. The book is expected to be out next month. And in the afternoon I visited the Madras University near the famous Marina Beach. As I have said above the mission was not satisfactory to my expectation. So I returned to my hotel near the L I C building on Mount Road, now known as Anna Saalai.
July 11 early morning I left my hotel to take the Kovai Express train to Coiambuttur that was to leave Chennai at 6.15 am. My! It was a long train covering the whole platform running to about 150 metres. Since I had already reserved my seat I got into the train and sat on my comfortable seat. It was a fast train and the journey was pleasant in the salubrious climate. The train reached the destination by about 1.45 pm. I put my luggage, a bag of clothes, into the locker at the railway station and went to the other building to buy a ticket to travel to Salem on the 12th afternoon. So, almost the whole day has gone.
Kovai is the second biggest city after Chennai in the State of Tamil Nadu. The other big cities are Thiruchirappalli (Trichy), Mathurai and perhaps Thirunelvely. Besides, there are several important junctions that are fairly big.
With time remaining I went to an Ayurveda Hospital to refresh my strained body that became stiff and painful. Surprisingly the male attendant gave me a herbal oil massage and later mild hot water bath. It was very refreshing and the circulation of blood in my body became normal.
The whole process took nearly two hours.
I returned to the station and waited in the waiting room and had interrupted sleep now and then.
On July 12 I got up early. There was a special room for washing and changing clothes. You have got to pay Indian Rupees 20 to use it for an hour. I used that facility and went upstairs to have my breakfast, I ate three idlies and had a cup of coffee. Came downstairs and waited in the room with my hand bag where I kept my passport, return air ticket and some money, Time was running slow. It was only 9 am. My train to Salem was only at 3.15 in the afternoon. I just sat and watched the world go by. It was interesting to see the reactions of all sorts of passengers who were to go to various places in the country.
After some time I felt tired and went out of the railway station to have my lunch. Just opposite the railway station there were some vegetarian restaurants I went into one of them had a Masala Thosai and filtered cup of coffee. It was O K. After the new taxes introduced in the whole of India, the meal costs a heavy sum when converted into our Lankan currency. Now the exchange rate is for an Indian rupee, we have got to pay Rs 2.45.
After lunch, I took my seat in the waiting room with my handbag put under the chair and took some time for siesta. It was some kind of relief for me. Then about 2.30 I slowly woke up and went near the electronic display of the departure trains and timings. Noted that my train was to leave at 3.15 to Salem on platform No 4 and came back to see my handbag with (cash, tickets and most of all the passport), was missing.
I became panicky and was almost losing control. I sat flabbergasted on my seat not knowing what to do next.
A few seconds passed. I saw a man whom I noticed seated at the far end of my row of seats came walking towards me carrying my hand bag. He gave it to me and asked me politely whether everything was intact in the bag. I quickly grabbed the bag and opened the zip and found that everything was there. My God. Then I looked at the man who looked sick and sad. I thanked him profusely.
I asked him how he got the bag when I placed it under my seat. He told me in Tamil:
Sir, You look a foreigner to this place and careless in leaving your bag and walking away. I rushed to your seat and had it with me to return it to you when you come back. I am happy that God had given me a chance to do something good for someone.
As a reward, I gave him some money. He refused to receive it and returned it.
He said he was waiting to go to the nearest hospital on appointment. He was a cancer patient. Thanking him again I went to the locker and picked up my other bag and rushed to platform No 4 to board the train to Salem.

National Audit Bill pending AGs clearance
The final draft of the much-awaited and long overdue National Audit Bill was completed and is pending the Attorney Generals clearance, Additional Auditor General W. P. C. Wickramarathna said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the main concerns raised by various parties have been duly addressed in the final draft, while retaining the provision for the Auditor General to impose surcharge on public officials to recover losses on account of financial fraud or irregularity that they are responsible of.
The main concern on the provision to impose surcharge was that it goes against the natural justice as the Auditor General, who issues the surcharge notice, also becomes the appellant authority that reviews and decides appeals.
In the earlier draft, the Audit Commission chaired by the Auditor General was the appellant authority. Now we have brought an amendment to establish a separate audit appeal committee for that purpose. The Committee members will be appointed from the Audit Service Commission, but the Auditor General should not be a member that by law, Wickramarathna said.
The spirit of legislation has been preserved while duly amending the problematic clauses, Additional Auditor General added.
Wickramarathna added that he was informed by the Attorney Generals Department on Monday that they have certain concerns on the final draft. We are waiting till we receive them. Then we will have to revisit the draft and make necessary changes after discussing with the Legal Draftsman, he said.
The first draft of National Audit Bill was formulated in 2004 and it has been dragging on for 12 long years now. We hope that we will be able to push the Bill through this time, he added.
Sri Lanka Audit Services Association President K. N. M. Kumarasinghe said that they were in agreement on the content of final draft sent to the Attorney General, adding that all the progressive features seen in the initial draft have been incorporated into the final. As we are aware the final copy has already been sent to the Secretary to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has stated that he needs to place it before the Cabinet again before publishing in the Gazette, Kumarasinghe said.

NDBIB voted Best Investment Bank by Euromoney
Repeating their feat for the sixth consecutive year, NDB Investment Bank was once again crowned as Sri Lankas Best Investment Bank 2017 by the prestigious Euromoney Magazine.
Following a record-breaking year in 2015, NDBIB managed to raise Rs 48 billion in 2016 in both debt and equity capital despite subdued market conditions; the second highest in terms of funds raised during a given year in the history of NDBIB. The performance assumed greater significance in light of the policy uncertainties in Sri Lanka and volatile global political events. NDBIB continued its vigorous quest for innovation, by introducing several new structures and products to the Sri Lankan Capital Markets. A case in point is the maiden introduction of a Cornerstone Tranche for an IPO in Sri Lanka in line with best practices in regional markets. Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB said, Being awarded as the best in the country at what we do for six consecutive years is no small achievement. NDBIB has continuously sought out new challenges and avenues to express ourselves as the pioneers of innovation in the local capital market.

New era dawns for Hambantota
The biggest news story from the past week, both in terms of politics and economics, was the US$ 1.1 billion agreement signed with a Chinese company for the management of the Hambantota Port, often described in the past as a white elephant. The deep-water port is located on Sri Lankas Southern coast, within just 10 nautical miles of the main Asia  Europe shipping route. It is also in a position along Chinas Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
The Port eked out an existence as a transhipment venue for Roll on Roll off (RORO) car carriers, some of which unloaded cars for the local market as well. However, the volume of traffic was simply not enough to sustain the Port and pay the massive debts incurred by the previous regime for building it. Only a handful of vessels called over at the Port, which was ostensibly built to take advantage of the islands strategic position on the East West sea route at least in terms of refuelling. This did not go exactly according to plan because todays ships are very fuel efficient and do not need frequent fuel stops. Besides, Colombo was the preferred choice for most vessels, being among the top 30 ports in the world.
The problem for the National Unity Government was that a huge project such as Hambantota cannot be undone easily (the same goes for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport). The challenge was to find a rationale and a means for maintaining the project, without straining the public purse if possible. The next best alternative was finding an investor or partner for the project that could possibly save the country millions of dollars in debt servicing. The Port which had accumulated a loss of 46.7 billion rupees since 2011 was also bleeding another 9,100 million rupees annually to service its foreign debt to China. The previous government had borrowed US$ 1.5 billion to build the port which the Chinese valued at US$ 1.4 billion raising certain questions about the transaction.
When the National Unity Government tried to implement a deal for the port earlier, there were protests orchestrated by the Opposition. Ironically, most of the Opposition figures themselves were responsible for creating the mess that is Hambantota Port in the first place. The fact they themselves had planned to sell off the Port to a Chinese company was conveniently forgotten. To the new Governments credit, it acknowledged that certain clauses in the agreement could be tweaked and it did. The Government also ensured that Indias security and geopolitical concerns would be addressed in the new deal.
In the meantime, there was a change of Ministers as well and new Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe worked hard to get the details right on the new agreement, which was signed last week in Colombo. Sri Lankas Navy will be in charge of security at the port while the agreement with China Merchants will be in line with Sri Lankan law.
The Sri Lankan Government has categorically said that its Navy will be the sole in-charge of security at the Hambantota Magampura Port. No foreign naval force will be allowed to use it as a base, the Government has said.
China Merchants Port Holdings (CM Port) and the Sri Lankan Government have agreed on a 99-year concession agreement worth US$1.12 billion, for the development, management and operation of Hambantota Port. From the total investment, the Chinese state-owned port operator will pay the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) US$ 974 m for a 70% stake in the Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG). Concerns that the port could be used by the Chinese military had delayed the deal but the Government has given assurances that China will run only commercial operations from the port which have allayed the concerns of India and other countries that China could use the Port for military purposes.
CM Port will use the remaining US$146 m for port and marine-related activities in Hambantota, as agreed with the Sri Lankan Government within one year of the final payment of the capital injection in HIPG. The agreement gives HIPG the sole and exclusive right to develop, operate and manage Hambantota Port and Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS) the sole and exclusive right to develop, operate and manage the common user facilities for the operation of the port. It is expected that the facility will be developed in three phases  the first two will have 10 berths and a quay length of up to 3,487 m, able to handle containers, bulk cargo, general cargo, roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) cargo and liquid bulk.
The international market reaction to the deal was overwhelmingly positive. The Governments billion-dollar partnership with China to revive the loss-making Hambantota port will be credit positive for Sri Lanka and bolster investor confidence, the international ratings agency Moodys said. It said the transaction will boost Sri Lankas foreign exchange reserves and ease the Governments external liquidity position ahead of several large bond repayments between 2019 and 2022.
Earnings from the Hambantota port stake sale will feed into the Central Banks foreign-exchange reserves, which will help bolster investor confidence and encourage future portfolio inflows, Moodys said in a report on Saturdays deal.
Both the Joint Opposition and the JVP attacked the deal, describing it as a sell-out to China. Previously, many Ministers had commented on the behaviour of the Joint Opposition MPs who created a rumpus that disturbed the Parliamentary debate on the Hambantota Port deal. They charged that this was done deliberately to prevent sordid details of the previous Governments Hambantota deals coming to light.
Shattered hopes of a new regime
Interestingly, Basil Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party has gone on record as saying that a future Government led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would annul the agreement and take over the Port. Mahinda Rajapaksa himself has a very close relationship with China and Basil did not explain how exactly the Port would be taken over. It did not take long for Government Ministers and the media to pinpoint many instances where the former regime sold land outright to foreign parties  the Shangri La and Port City were among the examples cited.
Over in India, the Hambantota Port issue did not gain much traction in the media and in political circles, in the backdrop of Sri Lankas assurances on the strictly commercial nature of the Joint Venture port. India Today analyst Prabhash Dutta wrote: Any change in the status quo in the Indian Ocean is bound to alter the security concern for India. In 2014, when China docked its submarines at Hambantota, India raised the issue with Sri Lanka.
The constant talks between Sri Lanka and India at various levels have helped the two countries understand one another's concerns. In May this year, when China wanted to dock its submarine once again at Hambantota port, Sri Lanka turned down the request. With Sri Lanka and India staying on the same page on the issue of security, there is not much for New Delhi to worry about.
Basil Rajapaksa was not the only one thinking of regime change, though he was careful to add the words one day when we come to power. The Joint Oppositions Prasanna Ranatunga, however, threw caution to the winds when he said Mahinda Rajapaksa will be in power in December this year addressing a gathering in his constituency.
Mahinda Rajapaksa himself did not involve himself in this debate. Ranatunga did not elaborate on exactly how Mahinda Rajapaksa could come to power so soon since the present Government can legally go on till 2020. While Government Ministers laughed these threats off, it fell to President Maithripala Sirisena to firmly dash these hopes with an elaborate explanation.
Commenting on a statement by an Opposition Member of Parliament as well as a former minister who said the power of the Government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members of Parliament, the President pointed out that according to the Constitution nobody can form a new Government without his blessings. Addressing a meeting in Hingurakgoda, he said when the Government is working for the countrys progress by removing all barriers, certain empty voices were attempting to cause disturbances. Some people raise their empty voices as they cannot bear the advances made by the Government through protecting democracy and freedom of expression, by changing the way the country was earlier governed through fraud, corruption, waste and family rule, under me as a leader who was raised in the village, he said.
Prime Minister's call
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who recently completed 40 years as a Parliamentarian, too expressed his views on this issue at a public gathering. The allies of the national unity government should concentrate on the country's development instead of turning on one another, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. There is no point in confrontational politics at the moment as what is needed at present is for everyone to focus on development, he added.
The Opposition, which was searching for an issue to challenge the Government after SAITM, has found it in the issue surrounding Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake whose name was mentioned in relation to a housing deal by one of the witnesses who gave evidence before the Presidential Commission investigating the bond scam. The former Finance Minister, who maintained that he could not appear before the Commission due to other pressing matters, is set to appear before the Commission this week to give his side of the story. The Opposition is already talking about bringing a no confidence motion against Minister Karunanayake.
While some SLFP Ministers have indicated willingness to vote for such a motion, most UNP Ministers said they would wait till the Minister gives evidence before forming an opinion.
The Joint Opposition and several SLFP Ministers including Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara have called for Minister Karunanayake to step down from his current position either temporarily (until investigations are completed) or permanently.
Minister Kabir Hashim has said the UNP has no issue going it alone, but it would like to continue the cohabitation with the SLFP at least until the Governments term ends for the sake of developing the country and resolving national issues.
Deft handling of the CPC strike
Amidst these developments, the Government is enjoying a surge in popularity following its deft handling of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) workers strike. One web comment stood out in particular: today is the day that the National Unity Government was really born. Almost all the persons interviewed by TV stations praised the Government for bringing the Army in to control the situation. While the Opposition raised allegations that certain Government politicians unleashed other methods to quell the protest, the final result pleased the public who had to endure long lines at filling stations to purchase fuel. At least one minister who is known for making very frank comments and who has spent some time in jail precisely because of that trait, told a television interviewer that he was extremely happy about how the strike was solved.
The Army handled the matter very professionally, the Governments declaration of petroleum distribution as an essential service and the order to consider vacation of post for those who do not report to work ensured a quick end to the strike. The President held a second round of talks with the CPC unions yesterday (except the JSS which did not participate in the strike) after which the unions said they would not resort to strike action.
This is a victory for the Government. However, there are persistent rumours and threats on a general strike, mainly on SAITM and Hambantota issues, but unions may have taken a backseat at least for the moment with the Governments competent handling of the CPC strike. An organisation called the SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra (SVJP) has declared August 2 as the National Protest Day Against SAITM), saying protests and black band campaigns will be held across the island. The Railway Engine Drivers' Union also announced that they would launch an indefinite strike from last night over several demands including the operation of Chinese power sets having problems with their brake system. This appears to be a non-politically motivated strike over purely technical and administrative issues.
Jaffna pandemonium
The Government has also taken a serious view of the incidents in Jaffna, the latest being the attack on two policemen (One Sinhalese, one Tamil) by sword and club wielding thugs in Kopay. This comes hot on the heels of the shooting incident involving a Jaffna High Court Judge, who escaped unhurt.
The thugs who attacked the policemen are believed to be members of the Ava gang and former LTTE members. The Police have since arrested several suspects and IGP Pujith Jayasundera visited Jaffna the very next day after the incident to personally direct the ongoing probes.
This incident, coupled with the discovery of a cache of unserviceable weapons from an unused well in Karainagar, has prompted the authorities to tighten security in the peninsula even as they completed the handing over of more military-occupied lands back to civilians. Five suspects have also been arrested by the Police in Jaffna for several offences including the assault of a group of Coast Guards and damaging a police checkpoint at Point Pedro. The authorities have taken care not to involve the military in these investigations, to avoid any complications. Peace is of paramount importance for the people of the Northern Province, which suffered for three long decades as a result of the conflict and the Government must ensure that militancy in whatever form does not rise again in the North.
The Government has to contend with one other major issue in the North and several other provinces  the prolonged drought which has affected more than one million people. The Northern Province is the most affected Province with a total of 462, 815 individuals belonging to 133, 678 families being hit by the drought. Anuradhapura received welcome rains after a long spell of drought over the weekend. Rains are predicted for several of the 17 drought-hit districts over the next few days. The President has instructed officials to provide drought relief packs to the affected families islandwide. In the light of climatic shifts of this nature, the Government must be firmly committed to global instruments designed to mitigate the effects of climate change. With the UK decoding to ban petrol and diesel cars by 2040, it is time for our leaders to think 20-30 years into the future on all fronts without allowing petty politics to spoil it. This is why it is important to go forward with consensual politics to firmly resolve the outstanding issues facing the Nation.

North Korea: US not seeking regime change
(Secretary of StateRex Tillerson)
The US government is not seeking a regime change in North Korea, the secretary of state says, amid tensions over Pyongyang's weapons programme.
"We're not your enemy," Rex Tillerson said, adding that the US wanted a dialogue at some point.
Meanwhile, a senior Republican senator said President Trump considered going to war with North Korea as an option.
Pyongyang claimed that its latest missile test could hit the US west coast and beyond.
"We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel," said Tillerson, referring to the border between the Koreas.
"We're not your enemy, we're not your threat but you're presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond."
The second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Friday, celebrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was the latest to be conducted in defiance of a UN ban.
Barbara Plett Usher, State Department Correspondent
North Korea's recent long-range missile tests have deepened concern about the threat Pyongyang poses to the US mainland, and strengthened determination here to prevent any strike. That's what the president had in mind in his war talk with Senator Lindsey Graham.
The Pentagon has updated military options, but at the same time says a confrontation would be catastrophic. In light of that, Tillerson repeated at length that the US wasn't seeking regime change and said the goal was dialogue, but one not based on the assumption that North Korea could keep its nuclear weapons.
Pyongyang has categorically refused such terms.
The strategy, said Tillerson, is a sustained campaign of peaceful but intensifying economic pressure to change its mind. But given the advances in ballistic technology demonstrated by the recent ICBM tests, there's growing doubt that denuclearisation is a realistic possibility.
As always, there are no good options when it comes to North Korea, but less time to pursue them.
President Trump has repeatedly criticised China, which shares a land border with North Korea and is its closest economic ally, for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme.
However, Tillerson took a more diplomatic approach, saying that "only the North Koreans are to blame for this situation".
"But," he added, "we do believe China has a special and unique relationship, because of this significant economic activity, to influence the North Korean regime in ways that no one else can."
In a separate development, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that Trump told him that there would be a war between the two countries if Pyongyang continued with its aim to develop a missile programme with the US in its range.
"He has told me that. I believe him," Graham said of his conversations with the president in an interview withNBC's Today programme.
"If there's going to be a war to stop [North Korea], it will be over there. If thousands die, they're going to die over there. They're not going to die here. And he [Trump] has told me that to my face."
Despite the ongoing tests, most experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.
They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.
Others, however,believe thatat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US.

An open letter to people who dont think they need to read diversely
I love old, dead white men. There. I said it. F. Scott Fitzgerald is my boy. Tolstoy, Dickens, Steinbeck, Orwell, and NabokovGive me all the books. I even have a Vonnegut quote tattooed on my wrist. But because of that love, for the longest time, I experienced a very narrow sliver of what literature has to offer. The worst thing about that was that I didnt know it.
Sure, I read some diverse fiction when I was in high school. I read Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, The Sound of Waves by Yukio Mishima, Anowa by Ama Ata Aidoo, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass by Frederick Douglass, and The Lion and the Jewel by Wole Soyinka. These arent the only diverse books that my classes read, because I know my teachers explicitly made an effort to introduce us suburban kids to diverse authors. But the thing that didnt sink in then was why reading diversely is important.
That wasnt a lesson I learned until college when I took a class on literary theory. That class, especially the words of my peers who all came from different backgrounds, taught me to see a literary work through anothers eyes. So when I graduated and started a job at my old high school, my old English teacher was tickled to hear me say, I have a problem with this curriculum. Just too many old, dead white guys.
That doesnt mean I was putting my money where my mouth was though. Scrolling back through my read shelf on Goodreads, I see my reading looking a lot like this: dead white dude, dead white dude, dead white dude, living white dude, living white woman, dead white dude, hispanic woman whose book was assigned. Seriously, yikes.
You might be thinking, well, who cares Read what you want to read. But there are so many problems with the idea that what I wanted to read could only be written by dead white guys. That statement itself hides the toxic assumption that authors of color couldnt possibly write something that is relatable to a white reader. Like, what
A good story written well is relatable. Period. If you cant relate to it, it might not be a good story. I dont know about you, but I have read plenty of stories I just couldnt connect with. Many of those stories were written byyou guessed itold dead white guys. Relating to and empathizing with a character is the entire point of fiction! This has everything to do with how skilled the writing is and nothing to do with the race, gender, sexuality, or class of the writer. A good story is a good story. The end.
Still, many people see reading diversely as just an excuse to pat yourself on the back. That is so false.
As far as just filling a quota: that assumes that people of color dont write books you wouldve been interested in naturally, and that reading books by authors who arent white is just to be done to satisfy some external goal. By diversifying your reading, youre actively doing something to combat structural racism (especially if youre in the U.S.), and youre setting yourself up for a richer, more interesting reading life.
One of the most important reasons why I try to read diversely is because I wholly believe in the power of story. Story is transformative. It allows you to, for at least a little while, become someone else. When a story is written well, you can experience another time and place so profoundly that it changes you. We should want to know what it is like to experience the lives of people different from us. And when we do, what might strike us the most is seeing that on the inside, were not all that different. Like Amanda said, that makes for a richer, more interesting reading life. Thats true. But it also makes for a kinder life, because people who can step outside their safe readerly bubbles will find there a capacity to care for their fellow human beings like they never thought they could before.
Now, I cant say that Im perfect or that 50% of all the books I read are by authors of color, but I am more conscious of what I read now. One of the biggest things that helped me with that was Litsy. For a while, every month, I would post my reading stats. The first time I did it, I was shocked. I read 15 books that month, but only three of them were written by authors of color. That didnt seem like enough, because I truly wanted to experience the lives of people who arent exactly like me. (I mean, Im already living that life. I know what happens in it.) So I upped my game, and Book Riots diverse reading recs honestly helped a lot.

Pakistan envoy to help resolve betel issue
Pakistan has pledged support to resolve the growing crisis faced by about 5,000 Sri Lankan betel growing families due to a new tax imposed by Pakistan.
On June 21, the Government of Pakistan imposed a Pakistani Rs 200 (SL Rs. 291) per kg of new regulatory tax on betel leaf imports from Sri Lanka. This was on top of the existing Pakistani Rs 343 (SL Rs. 500) per kilo of Pakistani customs duty imposed on Lankan betel leaf as of June 21.
We will give favourable consideration to the betel tax faced by Sri Lankan exporters, assured acting High Commissioner of Pakistan Dr. Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra when he met Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary Chinthaka Lokuhetti, DG Commerce of Sri Lanka Sonali Wijeratne and representatives of betel leaf exporters of Sri Lanka, recently.
Minister Bathiudeen added: Pakistan has imposed a new regulatory tax on Sri Lankan betel imports. This has affected more than 5,000 farmers and their families in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Puttalam Districts. Pakistan is the only country where Sri Lankas betel leaves are exported. Sri Lankan betel is also the main betel leaf type imported from Pakistan. Lankan growers have informed us that there is a big yield in betel harvest this year but due to the new tax by Pakistan, they are unable to recover even their export duty costs. This issue can impact our bilateral trade volumes as well.
According to the Department of Commerce, in 2016, bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Pakistan stood at $368 million, showing a marginal decline from 2015s $ 370 million.
Acting High Commissioner Dr Sipra said: If there is any problem, we will resolve it. I shall take this issue up with my government.
We need to have a concerted and conjoined effort to develop our future trade. The regulatory import tax imposed by Pakistan on betel leaves is not only for Sri Lankan betel leaves but for betel leaf imports from all countries as well-across the board."

Parents do have a favourite child
If you have a sibling then you know of the old too common battle over who's the favourite child. Your parents might never tell you but according to a new study they do have a favourite child.
For the study researchers at the University of California studied 384 families. The participants were a four family household consisting of two parents and two children. The siblings were all born within years of each other, the Independent reported.
Out of the 768 parents surveyed, the results revealed 70 percent of mothers and 74 percent of fathers admitted to having a favourite child. While the parents did not indicate which one they preferred, the findings suggested the older child was more favoured in most cases.
The children were also asked two questions:
1) Did they feel like their parents were treating them differently
2) Has it affected their self-esteem
The younger children mostly reported low self-esteem due to favouritism showed by their parents toward the older child.
Katherine Conger, Professor of Human Development and Family Studies at the University of California is the lead author of the study. Conger was surprised by the results and thought the firs child would feel they were the ones being treated unfairly.
Our working hypothesis was that older, earlier born children would be more affected by perceptions of differential treatment due to their status as older child - more power due to age and size, more time with parents - in the family," she told Quartz.
Other research teams studying sibling relationships have also discovered older child might me smarter than their siblings. The Scientist

Paris celebrates 2024 win as LA accepts 2028 consolation
Paris: Paris is celebrating outright victory in its bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games despite cautionary rhetoric from French President Emmanuel Macron and bid leaders following a historic deal with Los Angeles.
Macron hailed the very important step on the road to hosting the Games after Los Angeles on Monday announced its intent to organise the 2028 Olympics.
The deal was described by International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach as a win-win-win agreement for both cities and the Olympic movement.
But despite the fact that Paris is now effectively the only remaining candidate to host the 2024 Games, Macron and other bid leaders shied away from overt triumphalism.
France notes the decision of Los Angeles to put forward its candidature for 2028 and to reach an agreement with the IOC and Paris, a statement from Macrons office said.
Macron spoke to Bach following Los Angeles announcement and was delighted by this very important step towards France obtaining the Games in 2024.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter on Monday night: Happy that my friend @MayorofLA has made an important new step on an agreement that will have three winners: Paris, Los Angeles and the IOC.
Both Paris and Los Angeles had wanted to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, with the winner to be officially named by the IOC on September 13 in the Peruvian capital Lima.
But the possibility that Los Angeles would abandon a 2024 bid and instead accept the 2028 Games has been growing since the IOC decided in July that it would attempt to award both Games at its Lima meeting.
The French capital insisted it only wanted to host the Games in 2024, on the 100th anniversary of the citys 1924 Olympics, prompting Los Angeles to soften its stance and consider hosting the 2028 Games.
And confirmation of the decision everyone was expecting came on Monday night.
I am proud to announce the Olympic Games are coming back to the United States of America, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said at a ceremony at the StubHub Center stadium. AFP

Petroleum unions call off strike
The Petroleum Trade Unions yesterday decided to suspend their strike action following discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union Collective Convener D.J. Rajakaruna told the Daily News that discussions ended on a successful note as the President assured his intervention to look into the possibility of assigning the Hambantota Oil Tanks to the CPC.
The President told us that a new Clause was included into the Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement to be able to amend it any time even after signing it. Agreeing to our demands on the Hambantota Oil Tanks, the President said he will take them up with the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company. He requested fair time to do so. We have faith in the President and decided to suspend Trade Union action. We hope the President will keep to his word, Rajakaruna said. The TUs had three major demands, the acquisition of Trincomalee oil tanks complex to the CPC, acquisition of Hambantota Port oil tanks complex to the CPC, and the modernisation of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery. However, Rajakaruna said they only stressed the demand on Hambantota Oil Tanks during the meeting yesterday.
Ministers Arjuna Ranatunga, Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake participated in the meeting alongside with the President. The meeting took place at the Presidential Secretariat. Rajakaruna said the President asked Minister Ranatunga to take up the TU concerns with the Chinese company.
The CPC launched an indefinite strike from July 24 midnight on the heels of inking the Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement. The strike was temporarily called off following a meeting with the President on July 26.

Pole vaulter sues after pothole injury at Olympic stadium
Athens:Greek pole vaulter Kostas Filippidis is suing the owners of the Athens Olympic Stadium for 530,000 euros ($625,000) after a pothole left him injured during a practice session, his lawyer reported Monday.
The 30-year-old gold medal winner in the 2014 World Indoor Championships injured his left knee during the June 19 training session and is asking compensation through a lawsuit filed in the Athens Court of First Instance.
The serious injury caused him to stay out of the stadiums and in a particularly important time for himself, missing three top international competitions, the suit filed by lawyer Vassilis Chirdaris on behalf of the athlete said.
In the lawsuit Filippidis claims that he and his coach Dimitris Kyteas had warned the stadium personnel numerous times about the pothole in the runway of the pole vault jump in the indoor training facility of the stadium without it being fixed.
The Athens Olympic Stadium is owned by the Greek state and hosted the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. AFP

President clears the air
President Maithripala Sirisena has reiterated that attempts to form a government by manipulating numbers in parliament was but a pipe dream lived in by those currently out of power and that he, and he alone, would be the final arbiter as to who forms a government. The President was responding to a remark make by a former minister and another Joint Opposition stalwart that the unity government and the President himself will soon be history after they win over 113 members in parliament to form a government. The President's statement also comes in the wake of reports that 18 members of SLFP, which is part of the unity government, are to part ways and sit as Independents in parliament, thus shaking the government's two thirds majority in the House. Responding to this, SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said that disciplinary action would be taken by the party Central Committee, in the event of this happening, which, in all probability, would see the rebels being ousted from parliament.
Be that as it may, the President's statement was based on sound logic. To begin with, the UNP which is all for the continuation of the unity government is the party with the largest number of members (106) in parliament, though falling short of the magical 113 required for a simple majority. The Joint Opposition which is hoping to oust the government via the numbers game commands a mere 51 members (with two members on the fence). Even assuming that the 18 SLFP MPs quit the government and align themselves with the JO this hardly is going to shake the government's majority in parliament, although it may affect the two thirds majority. As the President has noted, it is he, and he alone, who is vested with the constitutional powers to decide which party rules. With the UNP commanding the majority in parliament and many SLFP stalwarts holding important ministerial posts, for all intents and purposes, the unity government is set for the long haul.
We say this because CBK had only a one member majority in parliament when she won in 1994 although she received support from outside the People's Alliance to cobble together a simple majority. The situation was the same after the PA won the 2000 General election as well and she went on to govern for two full terms commanding only a simple majority in parliament barring the 2001-2004 interregnum. Of course, she tried to engineer a two thirds majority by buying over UNPers to get her new constitution passed, an exercise which however came a cropper.
Such a scenario certainly does not obtain in the current parliament, with a combined UNP-SLFP government in place, and over three dozen SLFP MPs well ensconced as ministers, deputy or state ministers, rendering any attempts by the JO to arrive at the 113 mark a dashed long shot. A dissolution of parliament too is out of the question given the constitutional bar placed on the President that permits him to dissolve parliament only after the expiry of four and a half years of its current term, dashing any hopes of the JO to go for an early election.
Therefore, those of the SLFP planning to defect are bound to be stranded in no mans land. They will have to vegetate as Independent members in parliament (if that be their true intention) for another full three years when elections are due. Even then, providing they get nominations from the party under which the JO will contest, their success is very much in doubt after having already consorted with the enemy and enjoyed ministerial office under a UNP led unity government.
This is of course assuming that they will survive an expulsion from parliament prior to that. But with Sarath Silva taken out of the equation there is no guarantee that the rebels will remain long enough in parliament to face another election. One recalls how four UNP stalwarts decamped on the eve of 1999 Presidential Election to throw in their lot with CBK. The stand taken by the foursome was that they were still members of the Grand Old Party and joined the other side to support the programmes of the President. Attempts to get them expelled from the party and therefore parliament by the UNP failed due to the Sarath Silva led Supreme Court holding with the renegades.
One fails to see a reenactment of such a scenario now, when the SLFP leader is President Sirisena. It is equally doubtful if the present Supreme Court will take a similar view of things.
A courageous call
The call by TNA and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for the arrest and imprisonment of unlawful elements in the North is to be commended in the context of criticism leveled against him for pursuing only a single issue agenda, namely federalism and for not performing the duties of a true Opposition leader that should encompass the entire country. It would have taken a lot of political courage for Sampanthan to make that call, given that it was made to the Sri Lanka Police, read Sinhala Police.

President gifts invaluable kastane to national museum

President Maithripala Sirisena presented the invaluable 19thcentury kastane (royal sword) he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin to the National Museum today (2).
He received the Kandyan era royal sword from President Vladimir Putin during his state visit to Russia in March this year.
President Putin, a known lover of antique weapons, graciously decided to part with one of his treasured antiques for the sake of friendship.
It was a pleasant surprise for President Sirisena as the Russian leader gave this invaluable gift when he entered the Green Chimney Room in the Kremlin at the Red Square for bilateral talks with President Putin.
The Russian leader said he was presenting this significant gift to President Sirisena symbolizing the close relationship between the two countries.
While President Sirisena was admiring the shining weapon and its beautifully carved case which was studded with gems, Putin explained that it was an antique Kastane belonging to a Kandyan Nilame (Nobleman) and that it has a fascinating history.
This sword had been brought to England in 1906 and later bought by Russia at the leading archeological artifact auction house, Sothebys in London.
The kastane (sword, hanger) was the major attribute of the noblemen of Sri Lanka. People who were not noble by origin were not eligible to bear or even keep a Kastane. Therefore, the purpose of such arm was to underline the stature of the bearer.
According to Alex Freger (Tel Aviv), a high-profile Israeli expert on bladed weapons, the item subject to expertise descends from the Kandyan rulers (kings).
Freger noted that the Kandy ruling class had always played an essential political and religious role in Sri Lanka. The temple which still keeps custody over the sacred Buddhist object  Tooth of Buddha  was located at the premises of the Royal Palace, and up to this day is the destination of pilgrims from all over the world.
The kastane was auctioned at the Sothebys Auction House on 19 December 2006 in the elite section of Property of a Princely Family and Other Aristocratic Estates.

President orders inquiry into Foreign Ministry statement condemning North Korea missile

President Maithripala Sirisena has asked that an investigation be conducted into a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the firing of a ballistic missile of intercontinental range by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) on 29 July.
The Ministrys statement had condemned the missile launch and the series of similar hostile attacks by DPRK in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne addressing the Cabinet media briefing today explained that when the President had questioned both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister over the statement, they had informed him that they were unaware of it and had not approved it.
This is the first time the Sri Lankan government has issued a statement condemning North Korea.
The strongly worded statement had also called on DPRK to refrain from such hostile acts and programmes, in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, which impact adversely on the stability of the region and beyond.
The statement had further added: The international community must unite in words and deeds to seek solutions to this grave situation which is an ever increasing threat to international peace and security.

The Duke of Edinburgh will meet Royal Marines in his final public engagement before he retires from royal duties.
The 96-year-old announced his retirement in May, after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations.
Prince Philip has completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952.
On Wednesday, he will meet servicemen who have taken part in a 1,664-mile trek in aid of charity.
As Captain General of the Royal Marines, the duke will attend a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge - a series of strength and endurance challenges raising funds and awareness for charity.
While his diary of engagements will come to an end, Buckingham Palace has said the Duke may still decide to attend certain events alongside the Queen in the future.
The Queen's public schedule will continue as normal.
On announcing his retirement earlier this year, the royal consort was praised for his years of service, with prime minister Theresa May offering the country's "deepest gratitude and good wishes".
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wished him "all the best in his well-earned retirement"

For most of us, conquering a university degree is hard work. It is amazing to achieve it before one is old enough to vote. Sandika Shanil Jayamahas Alma Mater was Lyceum International School. He completed his Cambridge (Ordinary Level) having achieved excellent grades, entered ANC Education to pursue his Bachelor of Business Administration  International Business degree from Northwood University USA.
Being too young to be alone at an University in USA and seeing the opportunity offered by ANC Education was an excellent option for him here in Sri Lanka.
ANC Education Graduation Ceremony 2017 was held on Friday the 28th July at BMICH, where over 400 students received their degrees. The Chief Guest was National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva. Sandika was the youngest person to receive a Bachelors Degree from the Assistant Vice President and Dean of International Programs at Northwood University Dr Mamiko Reeves as he walked across the stage.
Sandikas dream is to become an Airbus Pilot and work for an airline. But when he completed his Cambridge (O/L) he was too young to get into the Airbus program, the minimum age being 18 years. Currently, he is pursuing his Private Pilot License at Fairway Aviation Academy at Ratmalana. Immediately after completing his PPL, he will begin his Airbus program. He may well become one of the youngest Airbus pilots.
All this was possible for Sandika Jayamaha because his parents Dr. Seba Jayamaha and Surani Jayaweera Jayamaha were able to carefully, methodically plan his career path and help him stay focused to achieve the goal.

Ranjit Fernando much admired Cricketer, Coach and Commentator
RANJIT FERNANDO looked every inch like a West Indian cricketer, more like an Everton Weekes, but while he had the West Indian batsmans batting genes in him, he added more charm to it by being a wicket keeper of sheer class. Starting his leather ball cricket as an under-12 player, he served notice of someday sporting the Sri Lanka cap with all coaches he came under predicting it. And it was not long when those predictions came true.
Learning all aspects
Learning all aspects about the game as his career grew from under-12-under-14 and under-16 and then automatically making it to the First X1 under the writers captaincy in 1960, his first big game was against St.Peters College, Bambalapitiya where he batted in the middle and being unfortunate to miss a debut 50. That was also the game where SBC beat the Peterites for the first time in the history of these encounters. FERNANDO made waves when regular wicket keeper Alan Gunasekera shed gloves in favour of the youngster. And thus began his way to stardom as a wicket keeper batsman of international class. From that memorable moment there was never looking back.
His rise was meteoric and his best remembered innings that he played was when he mauled a Royal College attack to score a belligerent 112 before the milk interval in 1962. In those days scoring a century before the milk interval was rarely heard of or scored. Inter-school matches then began at 12 noon and there was a break of 10 minutes after 110 minutes of play. In that 110 minutes he made a blistering 112 that had the full house of spectators cheering wildly and it had the batting of an Everton Weekes writ on it.
So from one of Asias Best Wicket keepers, Dr.H.I.K. Fernando, who I featured last Thursday, its logical for me to move on to another Fernando who shone in the pre Test era, EDWARD RANJIT FERNANDO who hailed from that green, white and green school in Kotahena St. Benedicts College.
FERNANDO was also from my neighaborhood and although being a little junior to me, we moved together during our growing up days and started as usual playing softball cricket at St. Lucias Cathedral Church yard from which yard emerged many brilliant Benedictine cricketers.
After a glittering school career where he led the school in 1962 and after being adjudged the schoolboy cricketer of the year he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where H.I.K. Fernando was the permanent keeper and his chances of gloving for the club was remote unless H.I.K. suffered some injury. FERNANDO had the talent and was in big demand by other clubs but he chose right and joined the NCC and came under Asias Best wicket keeper who had heard much about the young man.
Taught him good wicket keeping
H.I.K. immediately took a fondness to FERNANDO and taught him the nuances of good wicket keeping and FERNNDO was quick to learn from the great man and once H.I.K. joined the Army, he took over the glove work and performed admirably in the big league and coming under the astute leadership of Michael Tissera his keeping improved tremendously and his place in the national team was not long in coming.
He was in the Sri Lanka team as a schoolboy when the country under Michael Tissera toured India in 1964 as second wicket keeper to H.I.K. Although he did not play in that famous unofficial four-day Test which ended in a historic win for Sri Lanka, being in the swim of things and the atmosphere in the dressing room helped FERNANDO in his career that blossomed from there onwards. Under Tissera at the NCC Fernando says it was different, organized and enriching experience.
FERNANDO won his first unofficial Test cap against Colin Cowdreys England touring team in an unofficial Test in 1969 and that game was the stepping stone for more representative honous in unofficial Tests and ODIs both at home and abroad until he put aside his cricketing gear in 1979. FERNANDO sported NCC colours from 1963 to 1979 and played Sara trophy cricket for over a record 16 years and captaining the club he led them to winning many trophies.
Refused Cowdreys offer
A little known fact was that after the unofficial Test against England, Captain Colin Cowdrey a stalwart of Kent County Club highly impressed with FERNANDOs excellent work behind the stumps invited him to join his county club. But as FERNANDO says after much deliberation did not pursue it on the advice of his parents because by then he had hit upon a very steady job with a future at Mackwoods.
FERNANDO, I guess, remembers and regrets the wasted opportunities when a scheduled tour to England to play three day games against all the counties and a game against MCC was called off. The tour squad trained on fitness and skills for months and then an incident that was not cricket took place when two selectors picked themselves and hey presto the tour was cancelled. It was heartbreak. It was a waste says FERNANDO and it took our cricket back a few years.
No doubt what FERNANDO will remember most and a memory that he would still dreads is when he had to face the thunderbolts of that venomous opening pair of Australian bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson when he opened batting for the country in the 1975 World Cup in England when no head gear was in vogue.
Facing Lille and Thomson
He opened with Sunil Wettimuny and when at the non-strikers end he used to always give the two pacemen broad smiles so as to soften them so that they would not let fly at him. But smiles or no smiles they were devastating to face.
A wicket keepers job is a tough ask because the keeper has to squat, stand and concentrate every ball. In his own recounting he says he enjoyed and learnt a lot keeping to spinners Elmo Rodrigopulle, Cyril Ernest, Gordon Dissanayake, Kanaga Balendren an Nevile Pereira and paceman Nihal Zoysa at SBC and later keeping to Ian Pieris, Darrel Lieversz, Norton Fredrick, Sylvester Dias, T.B. Kehelgamuwa and world class spinners Ajit de Silva, Lalith Kaluperuma, D.S.de Silva, Daya Sahabandu, Abu Fuard, Neil Chanmugam, Anura Polonowita, Fritz Crozier, Annesley de Silva, Priya Perera and Raja de Silva.
Fernando later served Sri Lanka Cricket in almost every capacity  player, coach, administrator, selector, television commentator for over 25 years and also as a cricket journalist. He was Executive Secretary (honorary) of the Sri Lanka Cricket Foundation for many years. A career that any cricketer could be proud of.
And now the question that needs to be asked is whether Ranjit Fernando is better known in our country or is it his glamorous and talented wife Ramani, who has acquitted herself so well in the beautician business Ask any lady, conscious of beauty and style, and you'll get the answer!

Ravi, Mahendran appear before Bond Commission: Scenes from this morning

Former Finance Minister and current Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to investigate the Treasury bond issue this morning.

Serena serves ace for black womens equal pay
New York: Serena Williams served up a rallying cry for equal pay for black women Monday, decrying that they would have to work on average eight months longer to earn the same as male counterparts in one year.
The record-breaking tennis star and worlds highest paid female athlete -- who has spoken candidly about sexism and racism -- wrote a nearly 1,000-word essay in Fortune magazine to mark Black Womens Equal Pay Day.
For every dollar made by a man, black women make 63 cents in the United States. Black women earn 17 percent less than white women, and black women with graduate degrees get paid less at every level, wrote Williams.
The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion quoted data showing that only 44 percent of white men recognize the pay gap as an issue.
I have been treated unfairly, Ive been disrespected by my male colleagues and -- in the most painful times -- Ive been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court, wrote the 35-year-old.
The cycles of poverty, discrimination, and sexism are much, much harder to break than the record for Grand Slam titles, she added, calling for legislation and action to change the status quo.
Williams, who announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian last December, is pregnant with her first child. She plans to return to competitive tennis next year.
Black women: Be fearless. Speak out for equal pay. Every time you do, youre making it a little easier for a woman behind you, she said.
Most of all, know that youre worth it. It can take a long time to realize that. It took me a long time to realize it. But we are all worth it. Ive long said, You have to believe in yourself when no one else does.
Forbes ranks Williams as the highest earning female athlete with a pay check of $27 million -- but only 51st on an overall list of highest paid athletes. Forbes ranks Roger Federer as the worlds highest paid tennis star at $64 million.
Black women are the cornerstone of our communities, they are phenomenal, and they deserve equal pay, Williams tweeted Monday with a picture of herself wearing a T-shirt saying Phenomenal Woman. AFP

Several amendments related to Htota agreement submitted to Cabinet
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that several amendments which were incorporated in the Hambantota Magampura Port agreement and signed last Saturday were submitted to Cabinet yesterday, allowing Ministers to further study them. It will be presented to Parliament next week.
When the agreement was presented at yesterdays Cabinet meeting, the President taking into account the current situation said that the Ministers should be given at least one week to study the agreement.
The Minister said so at a press conference held at the SLFP Headquarters, yesterday.
These amendments were presented to the Cabinet by me before signing the agreement and they were included in the signed agreement. The signed agreement will be further discussed in the Cabinet on August 8 and thereafter, presented to Parliament during the same week, he said.
Three amendments were approved in Cabinet yesterday, among which the proposal presented by President Maithripala Sirisena, allowing the government to revise the agreement at any time. The Finance Ministry also proposed the amendment which noted that all parties should abide by all clauses in the agreement. Two other amendments were presented by the Attorney Generals Department.
We have decided to give one week for MPs to study the agreement on the request by the President and then they can present some fruitful proposals during the debate in Parliament... Even though, the government was ready for the debate during last week, the Joint Opposition sabotaged it intentionally. Now they distort the facts of the agreement by presenting various false details. Thats why the President has given them a week to study the agreement, he added.
He said, the Hambantota Port was constructed with an investment of Rs. 193 billion through commercial loans obtained by the Sri Lankan government and the annual loan repayment for SLPA is around Rs. 9.1 billion. But the project was completed only by 20 percent and at the end of 2016, the accumulated loss was over Rs. 46.7 billion. Only 10 ships have been handled by the Hambantota Port by July this year, while only 14 ships were handled in last year. He further said, continuous losses were threatening the survival and continuity of SLPA.
That is why the government decided to amend the agreement to lease out the Hambantota harbour to a Chinese company for 99 years, in which Sri Lanka will have 30 percent ownership and China Merchants Company (CMP) will have 70 percent ownership. The agreed investment value was USD 1.12 billion, he said.
Under the previous agreement signed by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, the treasury did not receive a cent. But according to Minister Samarasinghe, the transactional value will remain at USD 1.12 billion, as per frame work agreement and USD 973 million will be received by the Treasury. The remaining USD 146 million will be invested in the Hambanthota Port.
Our foreign reserve will be increased gradually due to this endeavor, resulting the strong economy. He said that employees of the Hambantota Port were aware of this situation and that is why they did not go on any strike.
Commenting on the statement made by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who has urged the government to nationalize the Hambantota port, the Minister said that Basil Rajapaksa has forgotten how he sold the plot of land outright to Shangri-La.

Seylan Group shows strong 1H performance with 32% growth
Seylan Bank and its Group reported a strong growth momentum with its performance for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The Seylan group recorded a net profit after tax of Rs. 2,310 Million for the period which is an increase of 32% compared to the prior year corresponding period.
Seylan Bank closed the first six months ending June 30, 2017, with a post-tax profit of Rs.1,805 million a growth of 2.87% compared to Rs.1,755 million over 1H 2016. The Bank was able to record a moderate growth in core banking activities for the first six months despite challenging business environment and prudential impairment provisions on legacy NPAs. The Bank will reach year-on-year growth of Profit After Tax over 21% if not for the impairment made on legacy NPAs that was made due to the delay experienced in settlement of dues by the Compensation Tribunal and another payment to be received as a secured creditor with the liquidation of entity concerned. Net interest income increased from Rs. 6,147 million to Rs. 7,265 million, an 18.19% increase for the six months ended June 30, 2017, resulting from selective growth in advances and effective pricing strategy.
Nevertheless, interest expenses increased at a faster pace of 53.26% during the period under review, thereby compressing margins.
Net fees and commission income grew across a spectrum of fee-based products and services by 23.83% for the period under review to Rs.1,773 million in 1H 2017.
Other operating income comprising net gains from trading, gains on financial instruments, gains on foreign exchange and other income increased by 46.08% from Rs. 611 million in 2016 to Rs.892 million during 1H 2017 mainly as a result of mark-to-market gains on Government Securities, due to the favorable movements in interest rates. Decrease in foreign trade transactions resulted in the Bank recording a substantial decrease in net exchange income of 20%.Total expenses increased from Rs.4,676 million to Rs.5,421 million during 1H 2017, mainly due to increase in investments made in employees, technology, upgrading and refurbishment of branches, etc.

Shahid Khaqan Abbasi sworn in as Pakistans PM
PML-Ns Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was sworn in as Prime Minister of Pakistan in an oath-taking ceremony held at President House on Tuesday.
President Mamnoon Hussain administered the oath to Abbasi.
Abbasi was elected Prime Minister by lawmakers in the National Assembly(NA) earlier yesterday, bagging 221 votes to become the successor to ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
PPPs Syed Naveed Qamar secured 47 votes, Awami Muslim League Chief Sheikh Rashid received 33 votes, and four MNAs voted for Jamaat-i-Islamis Sahibzada Tariqullah during the ballot.
An NA session to elect a new Prime Minister had been called by President Mamnoon Hussain following a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the Panama Papers case on Friday, in which Nawaz Sharif was disqualified as PM after being deemed unfit to hold office.
Following the SC verdict, the PML-N had agreed upon Abbasi, the former Petroleum Minister, as its candidate for Prime Minister for the interim period till the permanent replacement could be elected. Abbasi has to eventually give way to Shahbaz Sharif, who is likely to compete for the National Assembly seat lying vacant following the ouster of his elder brother and then stand for the chief executives office.
Following the announcement of Abbasis victory by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, the PML-N benches in the Lower House had erupted with loud sloganeering in favour of Nawaz Sharif.
Addressing the Lower House soon after his victory was announced, Prime Minister-elect Abbasi said: I am grateful to you all, for following the democratic process  whether you voted for or against me.
I am grateful to the people of Pakistan, and I am grateful to the peoples Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, he continued.
I am also grateful to the opposition and Imran Khan for remembering us in their daily slandering, he jibed.
Moving on, Abbasi termed the Supreme Courts verdict on the Panamagate case unprecedented, saying that although the party was blind-sided by the judgement, we accepted it as it was.
We did not challenge the courts, there was no division in our ranks. The party stands as it was. No one wanted to joust for power  whoever the Prime Minister [Nawaz Sharif] named was supported unanimously, he said, rebuffing rumours of cracks in the partys ranks following the verdict.
Everybody wants the [Prime Ministers] chair. Tell me, who in this house doesnt It is to the PML-Ns credit that all party members rallied unanimously behind whoever was nominated by our leader.
Within four days, the democratic process is back on track. There were no defections. There was no dissension in our ranks.
Justice mandates that though a 1,000 guilty people may go free, not even one innocent person should be wrongfully convicted. I will not go into details of Fridays decision  I only want to say that there will soon be another court  one held by the people. There will be no JIT there, he said, referring to the upcoming general elections in 2018.
I am sure that the real Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, will return to this seat.
However, he said that, I am the countrys Prime Minister  bet it for 45 days or 45 hours  and am not here just to keep the seat warm.
If I am here for 45 days, I will try to complete the amount of the work that requires 45 months, he vowed.
Continuing, the Prime Minister-elect urged that the Constitution be respected. Politics, which has come to be seen as a disreputable profession, will be made respectable again.
Be it the government, bureaucracy, opposition or the army  we are in the same boat, and a hole in this boat will sink everyone, he cautioned.
We will continue taking difficult decisions, Abbasi said as he promised to take action against private militias providing security to citizens.
There is not a single country in the world which allows the licencing of automatic rifles for citizens. If you go outside parliament right now, you will see a private militia, Abbasi remarked.
Action will be taken against them if my cabinet allows for it. The federal government will seize all automatic weapons, compensating people in return, he promised.
The Premier, carrying forward Nawaz Sharif and the PML-Ns promises, vowed to eliminate loadshedding by November this year as he highlighted various infrastructure and development projects initiated by his partys government as examples of its commitment to the countrys growth.
Abbasi also briefly mentioned a focus on agriculture, education and health services.
Agriculture is the backbone of the country, Abbasi said. Although I am not an agriculturalist, I feel their pain, he said.
Speaking about the state of education, the premier called for improvements in higher education and the need for a national testing mechanism.
Abbasi also touched upon the PMs Health Card scheme introduced by Nawaz Sharif - the largest system in South Asia. - DAWN

Shastri adds a different hue to Indias training style
After taking charge of the team in his second stint, India coach Ravi Shastri has tweaked team's preparation style and though it's early days, an immediate impact can be noticed.
A key implementation on Shastri's part is how the batsmen are now ever ready to bat in the middle. This has nothing to do with the batting order, instead a new practice of warming up before going down to the middle.
It was evident in Galle itself when Shikhar Dhawan and Abhinav Mukund - India's pairing for the first Test - reached the ground before the rest of the squad. The mandate for them was to get to the nets and start hitting balls just in case India bat first.
As it turned out, Kohli did win the toss and the amply warmed-up Dhawan smashed 190 off 168 balls in the first innings.
By the time the openers went in, Cheteshwar Pujara had completed this routine, while Virat Kohli was in the nets. It is a different approach to the previous regime, of course, and agreeably welcomed in the team as well.
The underlining aspect of this new thought process from coach Shastri is his belief that the team should exert its number one status on the field.
India were confirmed as the world's number one ranked Test side under Anil Kumble, romping to successive victories over the West Indies, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia.
Shastri has also brought forth a certain differentiation in the team's thinking in the short span of time that he has spent with them thus far. In one of his first conversations with the team, the coach had underlined the importance of enjoying the game before thinking of anything else'.
Apparently, he had asked the players to remember why they had started playing cricket and urged them to exhibit this passion on the field'.
Given the short timeframe of comparison, it might be harsh to highlight Kumble's coaching approach as a bit too methodical, if not mechanical. Shastri's first move has been to unshackle the players in his own inimitable way, whilst keeping a tight leash on how things take their course within the dressing room.
And there is a keen example of this as well.
For some time now, the Indian team has a standing rule that injured/ill players will be given back their spots in the playing eleven when they make a successful return to the squad after proving their fitness.
Apparently, in February when India were preparing to play Bangladesh, Ajinkya Rahane, returning from injury, was not aware of his standing in the team's plans. It was only after Kohli highlighted in the pre-match press conference that Karun Nair - despite his triple ton - would have to make way for the vice-captain, did a clearer picture emerge.
There is much clarity now in keeping with how things shaped up couple years ago. Earlier past week, KL Rahul recovered sufficiently from his illness and joined the team in Galle. He even frolicked with his colleagues on Sunday as the Indian players spent their afternoon at a resort near their team hotel.
Although the team management hasn't officially confirmed his return to full fitness, it is expected that he will be part of the playing eleven at the SSC in Colombo when the second Test starts on August 3.
As such, it becomes a problem of plenty. India will once again have three fit and in-form openers to choose from, yet it is an easy guess the name expected to lose out.

An adorable cabin built to resemble three forest owls is now ready for campers in the Bordeaux region of Southwestern France, and it costs absolutely nothing to stay the night. Its part of an initiative encouraging city dwellers to get off the grid and experience nature.
The plywood shelter contains three floors, circular white beds, and an adjoined boardwalk overlooking nearby wetlands. Dubbed Les Guetteurs (the watchers), the timber strigidae were designed and constructed by contemporary art producer Zbra3, a project commissioned by artist-architect collective Bruit de Frigo as part of their Refuges priurbains (peri-urban shelters) campaign.
If youre planning a trip to Bordeaux in the near future, you can book your free stay in Les Guetteurs  or one of the many other unique camping structures in the area  here. Honestly, who wouldnt want to give up electricity for a few days to live inside a wooden trio of owls

Sri Lanka invites more Chinese investors

Sri Lanka on Monday called on more Chinese investors to invest in the island country, saying that China had invested more than $52 million in the country in 2016 alone.
Speaking at the China-Sri Lanka Infrastructure Investment Cooperation Forum in Colombo, Commerce and Industry Minister Rishard Bathiudeen said that in 2016, Sri Lanka received foreign direct investment (FDI) of $801 million.
Bathiudeen said mega Chinese projects such as the recently signed $1.1 billion Hambantota Port agreement between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and China Merchants Port Holdings and the $1.4 billion Colombo Financial City project were immensely beneficial for the island country.
He said there were many other Chinese FDI projects in Sri Lanka including in the textile and apparel, fisheries and manufacturing sectors.
"Tourism is another attractive sector since Chinese tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka doubled from year to year. Therefore today I invite the potential Chinese investors to invest in Sri Lanka and partner with us," Bathiudeen said.
Statistics from China's Ministry of Commerce showed total trade volume between China and Sri Lanka reached $4.4 billion. That is a 363 percent increase in comparison to a decade back in 2007, which stood at $965 million.

Ganas are the common decorative elements seen in most of the Indian and Sri Lankan historical archaeological sites. Gana figures are common decorative elements found in most of the ancient architectural and archaeological sites of India and Sri Lanka.
Most of the common masses consider the Gana figures were only used for decorative purposes in ancient times to adhere to the beauty of the ancient constructions. Many times the common masses fail to understand the rhythmic beauty of the body movements and beautiful body positions of these decorative Ganas. But today instead of the decorative elements, animal and bird figures like elephants, lions and swans are often depicted to decorate the outer wall constructions.
The decorative elements of Ganas are often called Puthams in Tamil. The Ganas are depicted with numerous body positions. The decorative Gana sculptures are beautifully exhibited with different body positions and stances along with limited ornamental decorations.
Polonnaruwa constructions
Gana figures are common features in Sri Lanka and India during the 10th and 12th centuries. In India, many of the South Indian Hindu temples and cultural chambers were decorated with Gana figures. In Sri Lanka, similar Gana figure decorations are common features during the Polonnaruwa period constructions and afterwards. In Sri Lankan history the late Anuradhapura period and Polonnaruwa period sculptures have very close links and resemblance with the contemporary Indian Chola period sculptures.
Many of the Chola period Indian Hindu temples and cultural chambers were exquisitely decorated with numerous Ganas with different stances. Still, these decorative sculptures are well preserved in numerous ancient archaeological sites of India and Sri Lanka.
Similarly, the Sri Lankan Gana figures were used to decorate ancient Buddhist temples and Buddhist constructional places. The body structure of the Ganas is quite different from that of the general human body. The physical body structure of the Ganas resembles dwarfs. They are short in size, but the body positions resemble the beautiful rhythmic dance postures.
Most of the body positions, stances, and ornamental decorations of Sri Lankan Ganas resemble Indian dances. Even after the Chola period Gana sculptural decorations continued in the Hindu religious places and cultural chambers in India and Sri Lanka. Many decorative Ganas adopted numerous body positions which are deeply rooted in the typical Natya Sastra traditions.
Limited edition
The Ganas are always adorned with selective ornamental decorations. Normally ears of the Ganas are adorned with ring type of ear ornaments, a simple one or two necklaces decorate their necks and a very limited number of bangles adorns the hands and anklets adorn the legs. Ornamental decorations and decorative Ganas are generally considered as decorative elements in the ancient archaeological constructions. Generally, most of the masses consider Ganas as only decorative elements, but a few only appreciate the aesthetic values of the Gana decorative elements. Indeed the Gana figures have numerous excellent aesthetic values.
Different body and foot positions, glances and head positions are very well seen in the Ganas. Different rhythmic dance movements are well depicted through numerous body positions, head positions, neck positions and eye glances of the Ganas, resemble the dance postures and dance stances. The majority of the poses have close links with typical Bharata Natya Isthana (position) such as the body poses.

Thirimanne recalled after 13 months
Left-hand middle order batsman Lahiru Thirimanne has been recalled to the 16-member squad for the second Test against India starting at the SSC grounds on Thursday 13 months after playing his last Test for Sri Lanka.
Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman has also been named in the squad at the expense of fast bowler Suranga Lakmal who declared himself unfit for the Test with a stiff back.
Thirimanne will in all probability fight for a place with Dhananjaya de Silva to fill the number six slot left vacant by the injury to Asela Gunaratne. He can also bat at number four.
A sudden loss of form resulted in Thirimanne who was a permanent fixture in the national team for three years since 2013 losing his place. Since then he has been working really hard at his game to regain his Test place. He had moderate success in the recently concluded Premier league season scoring 282 runs (avg. 35.25) for Ragama CC with two half centuries including a top score of 70. He did however score 59 as captain for SLC Presidents XI against India in the two-day warm-up match played at the CCC grounds.
Sandakans inclusion indicates that Sri Lanka are looking to go in with a strong spin bowling attack on the SSC pitch. Sandakan forms a strong spin combination that includes Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera who both played at Galle and uncapped left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara.
With fitness doubts persisting with Heraths sore left middle finger of his bowling hand Pushpakumara will be a likely replacement if he fails to recover sufficiently to play in the Test.
Sri Lanka are giving Herath who captained the team in Chandimals absence enough time to recover from his injury which he sustained while fielding during the Galle Test.
Dinesh Chandimal also returns to the side to lead the team after missing out on the first Test through pneumonia.
He is expected to resume his usual number four batting position with Kusal Mendis reverting back to number three. Mendis was asked to bat at four at Galle because Sri Lanka could not bat opener Danushka Gunathilaka, who came in as replacement for Chandimal in the middle order.
Gunathilaka who made his Test debut in that match didnt contribute much being dismissed for 16 and 2.
India who won the first Test by 304 runs leads the three-match series 1-0.
SRI LANKA SQUAD FOR 2ND TEST AT SSC: Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Nuwan Pradeep, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara, Lakshan Sandakan, Lahiru Thirimanne.

UK welcomes return of lands by Sri Lankan armed forces
British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris, speaking at the Defence Services Command and Staff College recently, welcomed the renewal of links between British and Sri Lankan armed forces that has developed over the past year. He commended the armed forces on the land releases that have taken place and said that further releases would continue to contribute to building confidence between communities.
In the course of his comments, the High Commissioner spoke about the importance of post-conflict reconciliation, drawing on the UKs own experience in Northern Ireland. He commented that truth and accountability work in both, the national interest and the armed forces self-interest and are necessities for modern militaries, the British High Commission stated in a release.
High Commissioner Dauris said that a process of truth and accountability advances reconciliation and prosperitythis is in the wider national interest. It builds confidence and trust between communities, and between the armed forces and the communities it is the responsibility of our servicemen and women to protect. And among many reasons why it is in the militarys self interest, he suggested that it enhances credibility and self-esteem, strengthens morale and wins respect. He also talked to the audience of officers from all of Sri Lankas forces about the UKs recent Strategic Defence Spending Review (SDSR) and particular challenges that will drive UK security priorities and thinking for a decade. Priorities include, the increasing threat posed by terrorism, extremism and instability and the impact of technology, especially cyber threats. Events of the last year have shown that these remain as important now as they were when the review was published, the release added.
Since January, 2016, the UK and Sri Lanka have enhanced their defence ties, including through the appointment of defence attachs and programmes involving army, navy and air force personnel.
The UK and Sri Lanka have a long shared history. Our two countries are linked in so many waysthrough history, tradition, language, culture, education, sports, business, etc. And, of course, for two hundred years, they have also been linked through our armed forces and through defence, High Commissioner Dauris said.
In Sri Lanka, look at how much land that was unusable because of landmines is now back in the hands of the families and farmers displaced by the conflict. In my High Commission, we are proud of the funding that we have contributed to this work, much of which has been led by two British NGOs, the HALO Trust and the Mine Action Group. Handing land back has required some tough decisions. Making it work is harder than it sounds and requires clear-sighted and determined leadership, he added.
He said, One thought I would like to leave you with is this; that further land returns will win further confidence and that a further shift in the relationship between the soldiers and airmen and sailors who are doing their duty in the north and local populations will also win further confidence.
I believe that you can all be confident that all this is worth the effort. You can be confident that the steps that have been taken are ones that are contributing to building confidence between communities, to re-establishing the bond of trust between ordinary people and their armed forces, he added.
In the UK, we are proud that our country is a close and long-standing friend of Sri Lanka. And we welcome the steps your government has taken and which it wants to take, that have enabled the renewal of the partnership between our forces that we are enjoying today, the High Commissioner said.

Unsung hero
A promising left-handed opener and an all-rounder played his school cricket for Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, and made his first class debut for the Police Sports Club at the age of 18 years. A useful off-break bowler, he displayed impressive skill with both bat and ball to earn a spot in the Sri Lanka U19 side. Although unrelated to Sanath Jayasuriya, he is a steady run-getter with a good technique and a penchant for long innings.
His most notable memory is signing up for the Chittagong Kings in the second season of the Bangladesh Premier League. In the 2013 edition of the Champions League T20, he has represented the Kandurata Maroons, the winners of the Super Fours T20 competition in Sri Lanka.

UTE to showcase world class training center, workshop to aspiring students
When servicing and overhauling high value machines and engines to give them a longer service at lower operating costs, United Tractor & Equipment (Pvt) Ltd (UTE), pioneers in industrial solutions decided to show Advanced Level students who aspire to be Automotive Engineers what it will be like to be trained in the world class UTE-CAT state-of-the-art multi-million dollar training center.
The current G. C. E. A/L curriculum offers Engineering Technology as a subject stream covering areas such as the Principles of Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Technology and Training. However, students lack access to state-of-the-art facilities, equipment and tools necessary to experience and enhance their knowledge and understanding on the subject.
With the aim of providing students an opportunity to develop their technical skills and academic performance, and to enhance their future career prospects, UTEs invites students for a full-day field visit at their Training Center.
The concept of offering free workshops for students at UTEs Training Center was devised UTEs Training unit. Initially, the programme was offered to schools in the Western province. However, UTE now welcomes applications from schools countrywide which offer Engineering Technology as a subject to participate in this full-day programme. Schools can contact UTE Officials on 0773095175 for additional information or any queries about the programme.
The opportunity enables the students to gain hands-on experience on the practical aspects of engine systems, hydraulics, etc., creating awareness that skill in mechanical construction has the potential to generate an extremely successful future. The UTE designed full-day training module covers a range of interesting topics including sessions on engine systems, introduction to electrical components and hydraulics etc. Students have access to UTEs training center and its sophisticated equipment such as Engine Workstations, a real Caterpillar Dozer, a Computer Room and Hydraulic Laboratory.
To-date a total of 150 students have attended the full-day workshop and benefitted from the superlative practical experience it provides.
We understand students in the Engineering Technology stream lack access to sophisticated facilities to enhance their knowledge. Providing them the initial encouragement and experience of a well-equipped training center we believe will enable students to develop themselves and also contribute towards the nation in their future efforts, said Prasan Fernando, Chairman, UTE.
Subsequently, students who have completed their A/L examination can also enroll in the National Certificate in Construction Equipment Mechanic (ACCEM) programme conducted by UTE. This programme is also recognized under the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 04 in Sri Lanka presenting an ideal opportunity for youth to be transformed as true professional technicians. It is noteworthy, that this is the only certificate course available in Sri Lanka for Construction Machinery with a NVQ Level 4 qualification.

A White Lily for Mother
Short story:
Seated on the concrete bench overlooking the cemetery was a little boy probably ten years old in school uniform. He looked at the people passing by him pleadingly but none had the presence of mind to even stop and enquire why the child was all alone at this late hour. They were busy scurrying to respective graveyards carrying varieties of flowers in sheaves and bouquets. Today was Mothers day. There were glistening tears on the boys eyelids. How can I ask someone for a flower, no one seems to have the time to speak to me thought he.
In a dejected mood when he thought he should go into the cemetery without any flowers, he spotted a young man carrying a sheaf of fresh white lilies swiftly pass his way. Even though he was walking quickly, yet he had the time to glance at him who looked at the man sorrowfully. His pathetic look made the man look at him for awhile, Yes my child what are you doing here all alone at this time of the day asked he. Please Sir, could you give me a flower said he. Sure, take this one, handing over the largest and fresh white lily from his sheaf to him. Thanking him profusely for his generosity, he saw the little boy run into the cemetery. With deep curiosity, the man waited until the child had gone a little further and then followed him to the spot. He saw him kneel down beside a grave just freshly laid and place the flower at the head of the grave. With clasped hands the boy was sobbing, tears pouring down his face. Moved by the pathetic sight the young man noticed that uncontrollable tears were streaming down his face too. It was unusual since he had last cried three years ago when he lost his mother. But today after a long time, yes, he was crying for the little boy. The child was unaware that he was being watched since he was in a world of his own sobbing loudly.
The mans presence at the cemetery was to place white lilies which he did every year for his mother who had passed away a few years back. White lilies was his mothers favourite flower. She had grown them in abundance in their backyard and the drawing-room and kitchen tables always had a vase of these flowers which brought in a exquisite aroma once they were replaced with fresh ones every week. He would watch his mother arrange them in tall glass vases. Mother was unaware that he too loved this particular flower. So, every year on Mothers day, he made it a habit to take a sheaf of white lilies from his garden to place them at her grave. The sight of the little boy crying continuously was really agonizing, that he walked towards him to hand over the sheaf in his hand. Looking at him with teary eyes, the boy was reluctant to take them, but when the man persisted, with tears brimming he clasped the flowers and said, Thank you Sir , and then placed them on the right hand side of the grave.
Gently breaking the silence, the man enquired as to who was buried there. Its my Mother, she died last week, and fresh tears poured down his face once again. I cry a lot at night, I want my Mum back, no one seems to help me. I have seen Dad cry too but he swiftly wipes his tears when he sees me. He tells me that Mum has gone to God and that she is watching me. Also he tells me not to cry always as she will feel very sad, to eat well and study hard and that she would like that. I want to go to my Mum, please help me said the child. No, you cant do that said the man patting the boys head.
You know Sir, last Monday, she kissed me good-bye as usual before I left for school and asked me not to forget to eat the lunch, and not get late, to be home early. You know I got good marks for the drawing which Mum helped me and it was shown to the whole class. So, I brought it, unfolding the painting to show the man. Isnt it an evening by the sea, its really picturesque said the man. When I came home she was not in and I waited that whole night for her arrival, she never came. Why should this happen to my Mum. Father does not know I am here, I quickly came here after school to tell her of the achievement  the boy said.
Random thoughts crossed the young mans mind. His mother had passed away of old age but this childs mother was gone in his prime of life. This was most disheartening, he was crying away his heart, poor child. Moved by the little boys speech, he said, Come my child dont loiter you will get lost, I shall take you home, I wish to meet your father too. The child nodded.

Why there is no quality in Sri Lankas young cricketers today
Sri Lanka has been a Test playing nation for 35 years  they played their first Test in 1982 and in that time has produced some outstanding players who have gone onto perform on the world stage and kept the countrys flag flying high. Cricket is the only sport that Sri Lanka can hold their own at international level consistently.
But in recent times the gradual decline of the sport is quite evident and unless this trend is arrested we would become a nation like West Indies and Zimbabwe  just making the numbers instead of being a strong cricket force for which we are recognized internationally.
There is no doubt that cricket is the pride of the nation and the performances of the national players have an adverse effect from the common man to the top most businessman in the country. It is a topic for much discussion at every nook and corner the highs and lows of the team.
Currently the team is going through a low period trying to build a side that could possibly win another World Cup for the country in 2019. But the most frightening aspect is that the quality of cricketers coming through the system has dropped drastically and that is why Sri Lanka are taking a long time to come out of the transition period.
From the present lot it seems only Angelo Mathews is the last of the quality players we will see representing the country for quite some time.
Over the years there has been a gradual decline of players coming through the school and club systems and for this the national bodies for cricket and school cricket are answerable.
School cricket has been diluted to the level that schoolboys play far too many matches for a season some of them against low quality teams and thereby their techniques are not properly honed when they come upto national level. There are plenty of loose balls bowled at batsmen and the bowlers are not made to work hard for their wickets with pitches being prepared to help them. As a result when the cricketer is placed on the international stage he is found to be wanting with his loose batting technique where he would seldom get a loose ball to score and thereby without the patience to wait for it to come along succumb to it. The bowlers too are at a loss on how to get wickets when the pitches are unhelpful. The fault lies with the coaches who want the school to win at any cost so that they retain their jobs and play every trick in the book to make that happen. This selfish approach by some of the coaches has an overall effect on the countrys national pool of cricketers who take time to bridge the gap.
The club system is no better with the administrators who come into power hell bent on laying the platform for their survival at the next AGM so that they can be re-elected for another two-year term. Like the schools system the level of first-class cricket played at club level has also diluted with as many as 24 clubs playing in the Premier tournament today. Some of these clubs have been promoted to keep the administrators voter base strong and thereby diluting the level of cricket that is being played. All this has an undesirable effect on the players who come through the system. For the sake of quantity the administration is diluting quality and thereby the cricket at national level suffers.
It was only the other day that former Sri Lanka cricketer Asanka Gurusinha who was the chief guest at the 39th Ceylon Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest said his dream is to see an under 19 cricketer representing Sri Lanka in Test cricket before his contract as cricket manager of the national team expires at the end of the 2019 World Cup.
During the schooldays of Gurusinha in the eighties and early nineties any schoolboy cricketer would have walked into the national team because the standard of cricket played at school level was pretty high. A season of matches comprised around 8-10 and against the best schools. Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva and Marvan Atapattu are outstanding examples of schoolboy cricketers who represented the country at Test cricket while still at school.
Can any of the present day generation of schoolboy cricketers emulate their feat
