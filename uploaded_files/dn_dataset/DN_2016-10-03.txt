Du Plessis century sets up big win
JOHANNESBURG, Sunday - South African captain Faf du Plessis overcame a thumb injury to hit an aggressive century and set up a 142-run win over Australia in the second one-day international at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday.
Du Plessis made 111 as South Africa piled up 361 for six wickets after being sent in to bat. Australia made a bad start and were bowled out for 219 in reply, leaving them 2-0 down in a five-match series.
Du Plessis praised his team for what he described as almost a perfect batting and bowling performance. The batsmen laid the basics well and the bowlers were exceptional.
He singled out opening bowlers Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada, who both claimed an early wicket and put Australias batting under immediate pressure.
Australian captain Steve Smith said he felt South Africas total was only 20 or 30 runs above par, given the history of the Wanderers pitch. But if you are chasing that sort of target you need a good start and you need things to go your way. Every games a must-win for us now, Smith said.
Du Plessis was struck on the left thumb by a throw from Aaron Finch as he raced through for a quick single to score his first run. He immediately went down clutching the thumb and required lengthy treatment on the field before resuming his innings.
The injury did not stop him playing some powerful drives as he went to his half-century off 42 balls. He reached his sixth one-day international century off 84 deliveries with 13 fours. He was eventually caught on the boundary after facing 93 balls, without adding to his boundary tally.
Luckily I dont use that thumb on my bat, he said.

Passion for bananas costs Kenyan Amos the race
Kenya's Amos Myens passion for bananas apparently cost him the mens full marathon race at the 16th LSR Colombo Marathon run from Colombo to Negombo yesterday.
Amos was leading the race when he stopped to pluck some bananas hanging from a bunch of a nearby shop and consumed it while running the race. But that was not what really made him loose the race.
Amos instead of following the scheduled route followed the course car that took a different route and eventually lost valuable time. He realised his mistake too late and although he got back on track he had to be content with second place.
Amos was very upset by his blunder and was lucky to escape with a warning for his 'banana act'. The race was won by fellow-Kenyan Joseph Kariuki.

Sharma helps India build big lead against NZ
KOLKATA, Sunday  Batsman Rohit Sharma's dominant half-century put India firmly in command of the second Test against New Zealand as the hosts stretched their lead to 339 on the third day in Kolkata on Sunday.
India were 227 for eight at stumps in their second innings with Wriddhiman Saha on 39 and Bhuvneshwar Kumar on eight at the crease. New Zealand bowlers Matt Henry and Mitchell Santner took three wickets each.
Sharma, who scored 82, put on 103 runs with Saha to get their second innings back on track after the New Zealand seamers rattled the Indian top-order with regular wickets.
Fast bowlers Henry and Trent Boult shared five wickets between them to strike back on the two-paced wicket after the visitors conceded a 112-run lead.
Henry, who had returned with figures of 3-46 in the first innings, sent opener Murali Vijay (4) and Cheteshwar Pujara walking back to the pavilion soon after the lunch break.
Henry trapped Pujara lbw for 7 on a pacy in-cutter that hit the outside of the batsman's front pad, but TV replays suggested that the ball might have missed the leg stump.
Boult joined forces to get Shikhar Dhawan, who got a nasty blow on his thumb early on in the innings against the left-handed pacer, trapped lbw for 17.
Boult's big wicket was that of India skipper Virat Kohli, who struck a purposeful 45 to lift India from 43/4. The star batsman was trapped lbw.
Kohli's departure once again raised New Zealand's hopes of a fightback but Sharma made sure the hosts kept up the good work of stretching their lead further.
Sharma tackled the New Zealand bowling with aplomb as the middle-order batsman struck 9 fours and 2 sixes during his 132-ball stay at the crease.
Sharma got good support from Saha, who scored an unbeaten 54 in the first innings, as the batting duo entertained the raucous home crowd at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.
Santner left-arm spin finally got through Sharma's defenses after getting him caught behind to Luke Ronchi, who did the wicketkeeping job in place of BJ Watling. Saha and Kumar then played through the final few overs in fading light till the umpires called it a day. Earlier Indian pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami helped bowl out New Zealand for 204 in response to India's first innings score of 316.
Kumar (5-48) and Shami (3-70) shared eight wickets between them to hand over the advantage to India, who won the first Test in Kanpur to go 1-0 up in the three-match series.

WP South Outer emerge 2016Prima U15 Provincial Champions

Ever since this U15 tournament commenced with district level matches followed by matches at provincial level, this tournament was conducted strictly according to the limited-over format before the final was played as a two-day contest.

WP South Outer opening the proceedings on a perfect batting track at the SSC got off to a positive start after their openers skipper, Kamil Minhara and wicket-keeper, Sheran Lakshitha shared a glorious 86-run stand for the first wicket before a mini collapse reduced them to 179 for six. Kavindu Umayanga then added a useful 105 runs for the seventh wicket with Ashen Dilhara helping his side hustle to an imposing total of 302 for nine that could put the opposition under pressure in their turn. After Kamils 72 at the top, Kavindu who scored a 153-ball 122 with 16 fours and two sixes was the only one to thrive on a day all others struggled with the bat in first innings. Almost all WP Central bowlers led by Yasiru Kasthurarachchi who picked up four wickets bowled quite economically, but failed to get breakthroughs to stop the opposition from reaching a total that could challenge their batsmen.
WP Central needing a miraculous start to cope up with oppositions huge total lost half their side in an inexplicable collapse even before they put hundred on the board despite Chamath Yatawaras fighting 41 at the beginning and their hopes for a first-innings triumph was hanging on a thread when they went collapse at 86 for six. However, there was a slight recovery during the seventh wicket stand between Amitha Dabare and Teron Gaskara, but it was too late and too small to make a comeback as their innings imploded for a woeful 148 in the end.
