An Annaa confronts Chinnamma
That modern South Indian matriarch, Jayalalithaa, may have departed from our lives but her power persists as the state of government in Tamil Nadu just across the Palk Straits remains in suspense with two loyalists of Amma fighting over the Chief Ministership of one of Indias richest and most populous states. Recently appointed caretaker Chief Minister succeeding the late Jayalalithaa Jayaram, O. Panneerselvam, is resisting pressures from inside the ruling AIADMK party to give up his top post to V. K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaas long-time companion and now party general secretary.
Sri Lankans will remember Jayalalithaa as presiding over a long period in Tamil Nadu in which the Sri Lankan issue has faded from the mainstream of politics and even culture in that 88 million population, relatively affluent, industrially strong, state. Tamil Nadu, thanks partly to Jayalalithaas careful steering away from ethnic politics, and partly to the distractions of a regional society enjoying relative affluence, no longer worries too much about little Sri Lanka south of her (i.e. in her backyard).
Support for Sri Lankan Tamil cause
In fact, Sri Lanka gets raised more as an irritant in Tamil Nadus resurgence as a southern power after nearly 300 years under European colonial domination. It is the Sri Lanka Navys and Sri Lankan fisher peoples resistance to the rapacious incursions of Tamil Nadus large fisheries industry, the possibility of mineral resources under the Palk Straits and, Colombos continued reign as the transhipment hub for Indian ports, that are the irritants and not the rights of the Sri Lankan Tamil community.
In the early post-colonial decades, when ethnicity was far more important on both sides of the Straits, Tamilness was a bonding that reached across sea. But with rapid industrialisation, social development and, the rise of Kollywood, ethnic survival was no longer a worry in the land of the Sangam and Chola.
Rapid capitalist development brought corruption in the economy as well as in government. Unlike Sri Lanka, where society is small and cosy and almost everyone is touched by corruption of some form (however micro it may be), in Tamil Nadu with its large geographical and demographic scale, the urban and rural elites combine with business within and outside the state in webs of corruption leaving the poor simply to be the victims.
Even though there is no longer any sustained and active support for the Sri Lankan Tamil cause, Tamil Nadus resurgence in the world can still provide a chord for resonance in the future depending on the stimulus, whether in terms of ethnic politics or of culture, on this side of the Straits. For now, especially in the light of a far more minority rights sensitive regime in Colombo, Chennai can indulge in other things, such as celebrating matriarchy of sorts. Chinnamma is trying to replace Amma, but an Annaa is now standing firm.
It is precisely this phenomenon of corruption that may be the key to who will be Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. This week, the Indian Supreme Court may give its ruling on the case disproportionate assets against Jayalalithaa, her companion Sasikala and two other Jayalalithaa family members. The late Chief Minister and her companion were the first and second respondents in this multi-billion-rupee case. Now Sasikala, who has earned the nickname, Chinnamma, is principle respondent and faces years in jail, fines, seizure of property and, political ruin if found guilty.
Indeed, Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao has given indications that he may wait for the Supreme Court ruling before entertaining any claims to the Chief Ministership.
Caretaker Chief Minister
In the aftermath of Jayalalithaas demise in December last year, long time Jayalalithaa loyalist and veteran party leader O. Panneerselvan, known as OPS was appointed as caretaker Chief Minister to succeed the late matriarch. OPS had held many senior party posts and a veteran of the state Legislative Assembly and his succession was hailed by most in the state as eminently suitable for that position. Indeed, some, pointing to his relatively cleaner political record (compared with his late leader), hoped that his arrival would put a cap on the rampant corruption.
Sasikala, on the other hand, while never holding an elected office of any kind or engaging in any public politics, has a kind of informal influence in the party of Jayalalithaa, the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhakam (AIADMK) across the state because of her role as the Ammas closest companion for decades. In fact many charge that rather than Sasikala supporting Jayalalithaas numerous machinations, it was Sasikala who hatched plots and manipulated Amma.
What is certain is that Sasikalas very close involvement with Jayalalithaa at the heart of Tamil Nadus ruling political party has enabled her to influence many layers of the party bureaucracy as well as the politicians and activists who may have been complicit in some of these machinations.
When the bulk of the AIADMKs majority group in the Legislative Assembly voted for Sasikala to replace OPS as Chief Minister, no one was surprised since the subservience of the MLAs (Member of Legislative Assembly) to Amma and her associates was well known.
Sri Lankans are familiar with similar dynamics within most political parties in this country where loyalty to the party leader is more important than competence or compliance with party objectives.
Thus, last week, Chinnamma was poised to succeed Amma. Panneerselvam, who had first given his resignation as Chief Minister, the suddenly retracted it and now remains in the post declaring his resignation had been forced on him and that Amma had nominated him to succeed her. Reports from Chennai indicate that the possibility of the Supreme Court convicting Sasikala for massive corruption may have prompted his new resistance.
Already there is a trickle of MLAs away from Sasikala. At the popular level too, there seems to be much sentiment against Sasikala who has never been known for any political leadership. Governor Rao seems to be also delaying confirming the new Chief Minister with his eyes on the Supreme Court.

LEISA, essential for plantations agrriculture
Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) is receiving increased attention, both as a sustainable alternative to Green Revolution-like strategies making intensive use of external inputs, and as a strategy of sustainable agriculture in resource-poor environments where no or very few external inputs are used
Reading views expressed by some eminent personnel in the tea industry, it is apparent that the allegation is that the country's tea industry is likely to be worsened with the ban of the Herbicide Glyphosate. But the relevance of this notion has to be viewed alongside with what is going on in the global sphere instead of looking at it from a very narrow focus.
While acknowledging that there are other issues that may qualify to be on the top of the list and the objective here is to pointout the obvious and start a discussion so that the policy makers in Regional Plantation Companies would hopefully listen.
It is still a debate whether glyphosate should be allowed or totally banned from tea plantations. It is important to realise the difficulties in practicing fully organic practices. Hence, a long term succession approach is needed.
I am no way proposing or promoting to ban chemical weeding but trying to pointing out that the over use of chemicals the harvest will effect in the long run and the prices may drop.I do not think that this is new information.
The accusation of high cost of production and low productivity was there even before the ban as well but then what have they done to tackle it. Very little from the strategic point of view. That clearly shows the impotency and lack of management will to turn around. They knew every once in two years the wage increase is coming but they were not prepared to face the issue. All we collectively agree with or without statistics is that we have an industry threatening issue that has no solutions internally at the moment.
I am not a scientist and also do not wish to be controversial and my personal experience and view is that continuous use of a single Herbicide frequently might carry a risk of a build up of resistant species which may be harmful.
Risk is part and parcel of any agriculture and it has always been there and will never go away. It is therefore very important that planters to have the capacity to understand, face and overcome this aspect. An article published in January, 2017 in Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 39328 under the title of:  Multiomics reveal non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats following chronic exposure to an ultra-low dose of Roundup herbicide'.If any individual or any association can prove that the research findings are wrong rather making silly statements showing their petty minded narrow thinking thus throwing thousands of human lives in added danger.
Most genuine planters who are patriotic but voiceless join with me in saluting the PM and Minister Navin Dissanayake for unmasking these top guns who are still tolerated by their masters for reasons best known to them. But their days are numbered as an eminent team of less than 20 genuine planters headed by Jeevaka Atapattu are heavily involved in unearthing the bitter truth of destruction of Regional Plantation Companies.
Whilst acknowledging genuine interventions of the team behind him as well, let me be very open that what is needed at this eleventh hour is not more commissions in the pretext of psychological torture. Both PA, CPS and all other leading trade unions must put their best foot forward and link up with the team headed by Atapattu and come out with the plan of damage control leading to another golden era of SMART plantations.
There is no time for procrastination.The Minister with the blessings of both the President and PM must develop the second line of defence. NIPM, IPM, ICA and PIM must be summoned to come out with a strategic plan for the entire industry with identified smart goals for each year. As long as there are intelligent inputs many investors will look at the plantations industry as a golden opportunity.
The industry must understand the value of HRM inputs even at this late stage before it becomes too late and reach a state of irreversible damage. All must understand that the clock is ticking.
Coming back to the story of Glyphosate it was used in the past in extremely small proportions to eradicate the infestation of tea fields with couch and Illuk which are generally in ravings, roadsides and boundaries.
If I am not mistaken glyphosate was introduced in early 1980s under world bank project to use glyphosate to reconditioned fields with grass prior to re-planting specially to control couch in badly infested fields uprooted for re-planting.
According to Tea Research Institute instructions (in 1980s) it is important that high yielding fields have to be kept free of couch and glyphosate to be sprayed in fields, provided the sprayed patches are left without being plucked for a period of at least three months after spraying.
The T.R.I., time to time recommended using various other Herbicides as well taking into consideration the Herbicideto be used depending on the weed species present at the time of the application and taking into account the retail price.
T.R.I, has imposed a two round spray limit annually to minimise the risk.
Weeding is an unproductive exercise. There are advantages as well as disadvantages on spraying because some time the side branches and the plucking table may get damaged and there by the yields will go down and the other hand it keeps the cost down. Therefore it has to be undertaken very carefully. Those days we had a very effective system of manual and chemical weeding programme. Once you sprayed a herbicide (not glyphosate) after one or two months later we do a kyporuku (removing weeds by hand )in order to remove the weeds resistance such as Amalay and Alavangupillu and bring them to the roadside and heap it.
The weeding programme and its cost has to be decided by the management in the estate taking into consideration various aspects such as the VP and seedling percentages or its hecterage on Division wise and some times you may have to give little extra money to some opened fields where there are more vacant patches (pottals) which not rehabilitated (planted with grass) if not the field staff cross charged the weeding workers to some other items specially on plucking and covered this cost from well covered VP fields.
This has to be within the budget given by managing agent and accordingly we handle the weeding cost and never allowed the fields to get overrun with weeds except for the fields that were due for uprooting for re-planting.
It might not be possible to develop a chemical weeding programme for the whole plantation in the short run. Therefore, the chemical weeding programme needs to be developed at estate level. This might look like an overwhelming task but this could be turned into a productive investment.
There has to be a control on using too much chemicals in the plantations. The monitoring has to be done by a reliable authority and I propose a Government authority with all the powers to take decisions on estates over the use chemicals to be appointed.
Over the years chemical weeding has become an integral part of plantations but now it is increasing.
High cost and low productivity
If you go back to history, normally over the period after pruning there will be a certain percentage of nearly 10% of die back may be due to shot-hole-borer, mite and what we did was removing those bushes and planted the rehabilitation grass in those patches and re-supplied with VP plants later and you called it Infilling and I do not know whether it has been carried out and if it would have done there should have been a crop increase over the years.
However, the million dollar question is whether Sri Lanka or the Industry has benefitted from privatising the countrys biggest asset. The RPCs have access to better management and how far have they been successful in value addition except for a few RPCs which have to be commended for their initiative in the right direction.
It should be noted with concern that by statute 3 percent of the total tea lands should be re-planted with VP each year and anyone is well advised to check whether it has happened and if so present success percentage.
Ex Planters, who were in service prior to the nationalisation in 1975, will remember how they had to forward the annual return to the PA each year indicating the acreages re-planted. It is appropriate if the Plantation Restructuring Unit attached to the financial ministry, those officials to explain whether the 22 management contracts drafted by them whether the minimum requirement or compulsion to re-plant tea/rubber is in the management contracts signed by the RPCs or they drafted the management contracts to look after the interest of the citizens or for the benefit of the RPCs.
The civic-minded public is very much concerned about the present state of some of the privatised plantations. We must focus on soil rehabilitation and safe drinking water as well as Sri Lankas ailing plantation industry in general and the tea sector in particular needs urgent intervention in order to make the industry a US$ 10 billion industry by 2020.

Aitken Spence nine month profit grows by 17%

Aitken Spence PLC recorded a strong financial performance closing the immediate nine month period with a 9.9% year-on-year growth in profits before tax amounting to Rs. 2.9 billion, and a 17% growth in profit attributable to shareholders.
The growth is attributed to strong financial performances posted by a number of key operational sectors in the reporting period.Bringing to fruition the long term investment strategy adopted by the diversified group, many of the key industry segments operated by Aitken Spence showed positive growth trends in the nine month period that drew to a close on December 31, 2016. The top line for the same period grew by 69% to a figure of Rs. 30 billion while earnings per share rose by 17% to Rs. 4.09.
The company achieved a 28% growth in profit before tax in the third quarter amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion. Earnings per share rose by 36% in the quarterly period amounting to Rs. 2.14 per share. Profit attributed to equity holders also rose by 36% to Rs. 870 million year-on-year, for the quarter. Unfavourable market conditions in foreign markets, particularly the Maldives and India, and the high costs of finance have negatively contributed towards a challenging period for the tourism sector, despite top line growth. The addition of RIU Sri Lanka in Ahungalla, Al Falaj Hotel (Oman), Turyaa Chennai and the new wing of Turyaa Kalutara contributed to the rise in revenue.
We have seen growth in revenue, and more significantly contributions from some of our new investments to the top line of the Group which is a healthy indicator of the performance of those investments in my view. Most of the [Groups] key sectors have experienced positive growth in the third quarter. Deputy Chairman and Managing Director J. M. S. Brito said

Basil DOliveira shone like a beacon on the world stage
At present our cricketers are doing battle with the South Africans in South Africa and I think it is appropriate to write about a coloured cricketer who emerged from the oblivion to shine like a beacon on the world stage. He is none other than Basil D'Oliveira who broke the shackles of colour bar.
In John Arlott's Book of Cricketers he states that a letter from D.N. Bansda an Indian journalist in South Africa, enclosed some cuttings about the performance of a young Cape Town cricketer, named Basil D'Oliveira. He made 45 centuries, including 225 in 69 minutes (out of his team's total of 236); had scored 46 runs off an eight ball over, and as a leg-spin bowler taken 9 wickets for 2 runs in the segregated cricket called Non White or Non -European to which he was confined. He had been chosen for Western Province at the age of sixteen. Mr. Banda's letter inquired whether there was any chance for the young man in English cricket.
The book states that, the question was what chance could there be for a coloured South African without the price of his passage; who had played only in minor cricket; had never faced anyone of known quality and who would have no backing - rather the reverse - from the cricket authority of his own country which was recognised by Lord's A polite report indicated- but carefully, did not spell out - the insuperable problems: and promised --- if an opportunity should occur. Some months later the young man himself wrote in immaculate green ink. Was there any possibility of a coaching course in England He has enjoyed his cricket so much and wanted to plough it back into the cricket of his own people, who needed teaching. The book also adds that a newspaper column and in broadcasts provoked no response. Direct questionings on the fringe of official circles - a grant or scholarship - produced only sad smiles; of course these people did not play real cricket. John Kay, every other cricketer's writer's pipe line to the Lancashire leagues, could hold out no hope of a professional's job there; the clubs needed men with names - and a convincing record against known opposition, states John Arlott in his book.
About once a year another letter would come: courteous, sincere, anxious, and still hoping: the oblong envelopes with the green handwriting became familiar. The same formula if something turned up, of course: knowing that there had ever been a time when a coloured South African could enter English cricket it was certainly not in the nineteen fifties yet miserably reluctant to snuff out hope by telling him that the impossible was possible. Then by a quite freakish series of coincidence it all became possible.
The book also states that in 1958 Basil D'Oliveira toured Kenya and East Africa with a representative South African non-European team and against known, near first class opposition, he had a batting average of 46 and for his 25 wickets, 11.92.In the next year, the tour of Sir Frank Worrell's West Indian team to play against non White South African sides became a political casualty. As consolation for disappointed home players, Peter Walker took a team of English professionals coaching over there to play them. Peter Sainsbury and Jimmy Gray, Lesley Lenham and Alan Oakman of Sussex, were among them. Questioned when they returned, they thought D'Oliveira was a naturally gifted forcing batsman, a steady bowler, keen fieldsman and as a personable young man as his letters had promised.
He could hardly have cut it finer; only one more such white vs coloured match was allowed in South Africa. In 1961 John Waite's white South Africans including six Test players were beaten by S.A. Haques non European XI in a three day match at Johannesburg. After that the Nationalist government stepped in and refused even to allow a return game. By then however, Basil D'Oliveira has established a bridgehead.
Back again with new evidence slight enough but something to John Kay. On 14th January long after the league clubs have generally completed their contracts for the ensuing season - he wrote, There is no hope of a league post for D'Oliveira in 1960. The prospect of the final letter was painful; but it had to be faced. Before it could be written - within a week - John Kay's own club, Middleton, needed a professional.
Their protracted negotiations with Wesley Hall to replace Roy Gilchrist who had unexpectedly fallen through; and they were pressed for a player - and for time. Would the unknown Basil D'Oliviera become their professional for the 1960 season for 450 pounds It was little enough; barely sufficient for his air ticket states the book. But the fund raising was actively organised by his underprivileged kith and kin and his dream was realised at the age of 28 years. For the first time in his life he was allowed to mix freely with white people!

Bhumika returns to Telugu films
Popular actress Bhumika Chawla is all set for a comeback to Telugu, but not as the female lead. According to a source, the actress is all set to play a key role in a film that stars Nani, directed by Venu Sree Raam.
She is playing an important role as sister to Nanis character in the film, says the source.
Initially, the actress wasnt keen on the role, but when the director narrated the script to her, she liked it and agreed to do it. The makers are also planning to rope in a popular actor to play her husband, added the source.
Bhumika was last seen in the film Laddu Babu with Allari Naresh, which was a disaster. Post that, though she had not signed any Telugu films, she did work on a couple of Hindi films. This is like a comeback for the actress and she is open to do more character roles, added the source. TNN

A Bitter Pill one size fits health care for elders
A Bitter Pill is an investigation into why the health care system does not work for old people who are in fragile health and what we can do about it. Medical treatment of elderly people is not working. Worse, it is often harmful, says author Dr. John Sloan, a family physician who has worked primarily with the elderly for more than twenty years.
Dr. Sloan argues that we must understand what people in poor health at the end of their lives really need: comfort, dignity, and quality of life. He also argues that, caregivers, sons, daughters, nurses, doctors, and social workersall of usmust assume responsibility for what happens to the elderly and give these loved ones the kind of care we hope, one day, someone will give us.
The case of a 75 year former farmer from a remote village off the NCP came to my attention. Having been treated for renal failure currently at level 3 he also had a growth lower down in his intestines making it increasingly difficult to pass stools. One of his daughters took matters into hand and sought private medical advice. They found a huge growth literally blocking any passing of stools and is currently at Cancer Hospital Maharagama scheduled for two operations.
For the 75 year rural villager all he knows is intense pain. He is at the mercy of hopefully modern medical care. This man has little understanding of whats happening or is in store for him. He quite simple does not understand language of modern medicine. Does medical care services truly understand needs and sentiments of our senior citizens
Epidemiology in medicine
Epidemiology in medicine is about people and is based on the assumption that people are similar. For example, we all have a liver, blood that circulates, a brain, weight never greater than thirteen hundred pounds. But trouble arises when we assume we all have similar characteristics that not everybody actually hasintact memory, ability to move around the environment effortlessly, liver and kidney function close to some norm, and willingness to behave according to certain rules, for example.
An assumption of similarity is necessary for most science and works perfectly when you are dealing with electrons, molecules of potassium, or volumes of a pure gas such as helium. The more complicated the things being studied, the less similar they tend to be. Epidemiology is fine as long as it is talking about something that is the same for all individuals, whether they are infant, disabled, demented, angry, vegetarian, or sick in the hospital. Epidemiology is the science, the only science, used to justify most medical treatment. Is that okay
Students trained recently are very likely to recommend identical treatmentidentical to what their classmates would recommend and identical for every patient. This trend isnt confined to medical students. Nutritionists, pharmacists, and other health care professionals coming out of their training programmes also tend to be consistent in their proposed treatment.
As we are teaching young doctors, pharmacists and nurses to practice according to reliable evidence, we might be discouraging them from thinking creatively about unusual one-off situations. As clinical guidelines for common diseases become better defined, there is less and less chance that experts will disagree with one another about the most effective treatment.
Heart attack is now diagnosed by a blood test. Heart failure, which is a different thing, to do with the hearts function, is also now defined by a measurement tool outside the hands of the examining doctor: an echocardiogram. Osteoporosis is defined by a bone-density reading from a machine. Elevated cholesterol is defined by a blood test, and so on. Its almost as if you didnt need the doctor to make the diagnosis.
Science for elders
The price we pay for greater consistency is a less flexible attitude toward treating outliers. And the fragile elderly are nearly all outliers. The medical system is wonderful as long as you can benefit from what it has to offer. Many of its assumptions are conditional: youre going to be fine as long as you resemble everybody else.
Its probable the time to diagnose ailments of an elder citizen is at times greater than what is required for a younger person. Our seniors are served by the same system already stretched significantly. An OPD at most hospitals provide graphic evidence. When more tests are required from different places, when medication requires services from different locations, when mobility of the senior is restricted, when immediate care givers are scarce, what is the practical predicament of the senior citizen
Midwives for elder care
Some months back I picked up the concept of Montessoris for Elders which teach seniors to deal with day to day functional needs. There were protests on the validity of the approach. Likewise when I suggest carers akin to midwives who deal with senior citizens by visiting them at homes, arranging for regular clinic visits, helping them understand their routine in using medicine and medical care there maybe protests which say this is nonsensical and a suggestion which stretches resources further.
The reality is we have an aging population requiring care and care givers. Counter staff, doctors, specialists, lab technicians, pharmacists, physiotherapists have all got to understand the specific needs of senior citizen patients.
The grim reality in some instances for example in cancer is pain is managed not eradicated until you die of Cancer. Similarly we are hard pressed to learn about preventive geriatric care services. It may not even be 100% curative when dealing with old engines! The one size fits health care for elders is indeed a bitter pill.

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC), which had not made profit for over 50 years, had reported a Rs. 1 million profit in January, 2017.
The CFC installed 12 outlets island-wide in the last two months of 2016. These outlets reported Rs. 1,600,000 profit. Twenty more outlets will be installed this year, the minister said.
A Rs. 72 million profit is expected this year and the CFC is capable of achieving it, Amaraweera said.

It will export processed fish along with private sector enterprises, he said.
Amaraweera said the CFC has 1,113 employees though only 745 are qualified for what they do. Wages and salaries of the workforce cannot be paid since the CFC has no profit for 2017, he said.

CMMSL, OPA-SL hosts seminar on IMO Conventions and Maritime Regulations in SL

The Company of Master Mariners of Sri Lanka (CMMSL) together with The Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA-SL) organised a seminar on IMO Conventions and Maritime Regulations in Sri Lanka at the OPA auditorium, Colombo 7 on February 9, 2017.
The seminar commenced with an open address by the President of the OPA, Ruwan Gallage. CMM Secretary Capt. Rohith Fernando introduced each speaker and the CMM President Capt. Nirmal Silva chaired the Question and Answer session. The vote of thanks was delivered by Capt. Ranjith Weerasinghe.
The first speaker, Captain Upul Peiris, Govt Ship Surveyor speaking on the subject  Acceding to IMO Conventions by Sri Lanka said that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is the United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. As a specialized agency of the United Nations, IMO is the global standard-setting authority for the safety, security and environmental performance of international shipping. Its main role is to create a regulatory framework for the shipping industry that is fair and effective, universally adopted and universally implemented.
Sri Lanka is a member State of IMO and has ratified many IMO conventions and protocols and now in the process of acceding six more conventions/protocols, he said. The second speaker, Chandaka Jayasundere, Attorney at Law speaking on the subject  Proposals for a new Maritime Regulatory Regime in Sri Lanka said that the existing legal framework relating to Merchant Shipping consists of the Merchant Shipping Act No. 52 of 1971 and Regulations made there under by the Minister of Shipping. There is also certain other general legislation which touches on employment of persons in sea going vessels and the minimum age requirement of employment in Sri Lanka. There is also several other Acts, enactments and regulations which relate to the maritime industry dealing with freight forwarding, ports.
The three main conventions relating to maritime matters i.e. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS), International Convention of Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW) and the International Conventions for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and the 1978 Protocol (MARPOL) have been given legal effect in Sri Lanka via different forms in different legislative instruments, he said.
Some parts of the MLC 2006 have been given effect to by way of Shipping Notes under the Merchant Shipping Act.
It is recommended that: an enabling Act be enacted either: as a Special Provisions Act to the Merchant Shipping Act; or as an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act; or as a new stand-alone Act.
Such an Act should bring into effect and give the force of law to the provisions of international conventions Sri Lanka has signed, ratified or acceded to and bring into one statutory instrument the various enactments dealing with various aspects of the maritime industry.
The Company of Master Mariners of Sri Lanka is a professional organization of Sri Lankan Ship Captains, who are Certified Class 1 Master Mariners (for Unlimited Tonnage and Ocean Trading Area); formed in 1992 with a current membership in excess of 300.
CMMSL is a member of the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka since 2004, leading the Maritime Profession with a great emphasis on harnessing the professional inputs of Master Mariners, endeavouring to serve the Maritime Community in particular and Shipping Industry in general.
In the absence of an appreciable national fleet of ships trading internationally, the Master Mariners of the nation in particular and Sri Lankan seafarers in general, are employed mainly on foreign vessels and in shore-based maritime ventures.
They have been identified as high-value foreign exchange earning professionals of the nation contributing a few billion Rupees annually to the national coffers, for which the state investment remains yet to be enhanced on par with that of the private sector.
Master Mariners have years of experience at sea commanding such enormous maritime property known as ships to almost all the major ports in the world. (DJ)

Deans, Higher Education Ministry map out guidelines for SAITM
The Deans of eight state medical faculties and the Higher Education Ministry yesterday agreed to submit several proposals to the administration of the private medical college in Malabe including suspending admission of students temporarily, further clinical training in several medical disciplines for those who have passed the final MBBS exam and pass a licensing exam conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
During the next six months, the Higher Education and Highways Ministry, University Grants Commission (UGC), the SLMC and other stake holders will jointly develop an operational procedure applicable to non-state medical education.
Following a discussion yesterday, the two parties agreed to propose to the administration of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to suspend admission of medical students for six months until the periodic review of the medical degree programme is conducted by the Higher Education Ministry.
They had also decided to propose that SAITM students who have passed the final MBBS examination must undergo a further period of clinical training in surgery, medicine, gynaecology and obstetrics and paediatrics, one month each, in a state hospital and at the end of the period of clinical training, the student must pass a licensing examination conducted by the SLMC.
The Deans had also agreed to discuss the proposals at the SLMC.
When contacted, Higher Education and Highways Ministry Secretary D.C.Dissanayake said the above were only proposals and will be adopted if both the SLMC and the SAITM agree to them.
Questioned whether the SLMC will register SAITM students who have passed the MBBS examination as medical practitioners in accordance with the court ruling, Dissanayake said it was up to the SLMC to decide.
The Court of Appeal which heard the writ petition filed by a SAITM MBBS graduate recently determined that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and the petitioner has legal rights to register at the SLMC as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
Dissanayake yesterday said these issues will be ironed out during further discussions in the future.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, State Minister Mohan Lal Grero, Secretary D.C.Dissanayake, UGC chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva and UGC Vice Chairman Prof. P.M. Guneratne participated in the discussions with the Deans of eight state medical faculties yesterday.

Deepwater Horizon : Doesnt dig deep enough
Deepwater Horizon lies somewhere between an epic disaster movie and a dramatic retelling of a devastating incident. But it definitely leans more towards the former.
It even follows the disaster-movie rulebook: first, we see the tiny cracks that will blow up into something bigger. Next come the happy-sleepy lives of soon-to-be victims, followed by aerial shots of the explosion site in pristine condition. And finally, were thrown into the eye of the storm.
Mike (Mark Wahlberg), Jimmy (Kurt Russell) and Andrea (Gina Rodriguez) all report to the Deepwater Horizon oil rig for duty. Jimmy soon realizes that the company that commissioned this drilling expedition is ready to overlook safety measures for quick results. He tries to put his foot down but loses to corporate hierarchy. Work resumes and soon enough, tragedy strikes.
Raise expectations
The highlight is a scene where Mikes daughter uses a soda can, a metal tube and some oil to demonstrate on a small scale, what will eventually happen on site. It is part of the beautifully cut trailer that raises expectations.
But the expectations start to plummet when, 45 minutes into the movie, you have oil rig jargon coming out of your ears. The screenplay, adapted from a New York Times article, sadly only picks up the technical details, leaving the human stories behind. The explosion thus comes as a much-needed adrenaline shot that boosts the movie into action-extravaganza territory. It is enjoyable hereon, but it beats the purpose. Instead of underlining the horrors of the incident, the movie glamorizes the explosion as a Michael Bay-esque plot point that leads to heroic survival tactics.
Informative piece
In a surprisingly understated performance, Mark Wahlberg is convincing as a regular oil rig worker who finds strength within. He even gets a few chuckles out of you. Kate Hudsons vulnerable wife act brings calm to the chaos.
As an informative piece on the catastrophe at the Deepwater Horizon, the movie just doesnt dig deep enough. But as a visually rich disaster movie, it passes the test.

Around 490,00 persons from 14 districts are facing a scarcity of drinking water due to the prolonged drought, the Disaster Management Ministry said yesterday.
Relief teams have been dispatched to worst hit districts such as Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Gampaha, Hambantota, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Moneragala, Mullaitivu, Puttalam, Ratnapura, Trincomalee, Kandy and Vavuniya, a spokesman for the ministry said.
According to the ministry, 4798 water storage tanks and 349 water bowsers and tractors have been sent to the affected areas.
They are acquiring more water bowsers and storage tanks to be deployed in the affected areas. The ministry said if rains do not arrive soon, the country will face a severe drought situation in the coming months.
The ministry said the drought situation was worsening and adverse effects of the extended dry spell were continuing to aggravate. Reports of drinking water shortage, crop damages and wild fires from several areas of the country are being reported.
The ministry said preparations were being made to face the severe drought situation with the participation of all related institutions. Attention has been drawn to dwindling water levels in the reservoirs, the ministry said.

Enamoured with tuk wisdom
Much has been made of the Gazette notification issued in early January that aims to impose new and, some say, unduly onerous restrictions and regulations on trishaw drivers.
The notification establishes limits on speed and the number of passengers who may ride in a three-wheeler at one time. It also makes it compulsory for the vehicles to have meters and spare tires. While the notice outlines many requirements, it notably does not call for the creation of a tuk regulatory authority.
Countless trishaw operators have protested in the intervening period, and some driver unions threatened legal action before withdrawing their lawsuits in favor of trying to compromise with government officials.
But the dispute has not yet been resolved and the tuk tuk driver community continues to be upset over certain of the gazettes stipulations, especially the provision making mandatory the inclusion of meters and the issuing of receipts.
There are many meters that are not standardised, and the black market dominates the meter trade. There are no government institutions that standardise the meters or provide assistance to passengers who have been charged unfairly, said Sudil Jayuruk, President of the All Ceylon Three Wheel Drivers Association.
Jayuruk was also adamantly opposed to the notifications establishment of a speed limit of 40 kilometers per hour, as he complained that such a velocity was too slow for todays tuks which have 205 cc engines. He did, however, call for a government body to deal with issues related to trishaws.
The bottom line is that we need a regulatory authority to deal with tuks, he said.
Though the issues surrounding the speed limit, meters and lack of an overarching regulatory body have dominated the headlines, another of the notifications key provisions has been overlooked: the banning of letters, figures, or digits that do not contain descriptive information on the front or back of tuks.
But what does the Ministry of Transport have against tuk wisdom
The Death of Tuk Wisdom
The writing, stickers and drawings on tuks, affectionately referred to as tuk wisdom, are staples of not only Colombos, but also Sri Lankas roads.
Whether it is pictures of Bob Marley, Che Guevera, Jack Sparrow of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, or simple sayings, both famous and made-up, that sometimes contain an error or two, there is something for everyone in tuk wisdom.
I am not cute and I know it.
Innocent Boys We Dont Like Makeup Girls.
Love is like a Chinese phone: no guarantee.
Tuk wisdom is quintessentially Sri Lankan. My day improves every time I see a funny saying or an especially poignant tribute to a family member on a trishaw. Its an important piece of self-expression that falls outside of traditional cultural outlets. Plus it can be really funny, said Dilrukshi Fernando, who works in advertising.
Despite that, almost everyone who spoke to the Daily News on tuk wisdom lauded it but the Ministry of Transport seems to consider the decorations a safety risk.
This is a polarizing issue, but it is our position that stickers on windows create poor vision for tuk drivers and that the writings are distracting for other motorists. Other drivers, especially those following behind three-wheelers, can get distracted and have accidents.
All of the regulations we release are meant to improve road safety and limit accidents This is a measure that will improve public safety and protect people, said Secretary to the Ministry of Transport Nihal Somaweera.
It seems odd to claim that writing on tuks is especially distracting, since the roads are littered with billboard advertisements. Also, regular automobiles can be decorated with bumper stickers and various other designs. According to Somaweera, however, the Ministry of Transport may draft further legislation limiting writing on all vehicles in the near future. But drivers are concerned with distractions on the road that have nothing to do with trishaws.
The new LED billboards that are popping up all over Colombo are a lot more distracting than any tuk wisdom Ive seen. Those are absolutely blinding, said C. Jayasinghe, who works in the hotel industry.
I think theyre using the pretense of improving safety to clean up the roads and make Colombo look like a classier city, he continued.
While the jury is out on the safety risk tuk wisdom poses to Colombos commuters, several lawyers said that banning it could constitute a Fundamental Rights violation.Three lawyers who spoke to the Daily News on condition of anonymity argued that limiting tuk drivers ability to decorate their rides is an infringement on their rights to expression.
This is not a proportionate measure, as the ban covers tuks but not cars, buses or trucks. Drivers should have the right to express their views on the vehicles that they own as long as they are not offensive.
I think there are grounds for a tuk driver to sue the government over this measure if he or she thinks their rights are being infringed upon, said one lawyer.
Tuk Drivers Response
H.A.K. Sujeewa stands in front of his Pirates of the Caribbean-themed red tuk. An image of Jack Sparrow features prominently on the back of the vehicle, but Sujeewas dreadlocks are tied together and held above his head, in contrast to Sparrows loose, hanging dreads.
I keep my hair and my look like this to match my tuk. Im just expressing myself. Tourists take pictures of me with the tuk and then take rides. They think its great, he said, while adding that he loves the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and spent a good deal of money to style his tuk this way.
I take pride in the way my ride looks, he said.
For Sujeewa, the gazette notification is misguided, but he maintained that he is neither in favor nor opposed to most of its stipulations. He is, however, very much opposed to the banning of tuk wisdom.
My tuk is not a safety risk. If people focus on the road there would be fewer accidents, he said.
K.A. Chanaka, the owner of an America-themed tuk complete with two subwoofers, complained that the police had already threatened to take him to court over his gaudy decorations.
My tuk used to have many more stickers and sayings, but the police asked me to take them down. It was very sad for me because I saved a lot of money and wanted to add even more writings and stickers.
I feel like I always have to change the tuk, so I take some stuff off and put other stuff on so that the police dont stop me, he said.
While Sujeewa and Chanaka are dedicated practitioners of tuk decoration, some other drivers were not as enamored of the custom.
I dont think tuks with a lot of stickers and writing look good. The new trend is to have a minimalist look. Also, sometimes stickers cause the paint to rust, said H.A. Sampath, who also added that stickers and intricate designs are getting increasingly expensive.
Some people pay 2-3 lakhs to decorate their trishaws. Its not worth it because passengers prefer pretty vehicles, he said.
Despite his own particular aesthetic tastes, Sampath did say that any tuk owner should be able to decorate the vehicle in any way he or she wants. Furthermore, he said that the argument that tuk wisdom is distracting and dangerous is simply false.
Thats a lie. Why are people looking at the writing on other peoples vehicles This is a useless law the government wants to institute. I would prefer they didnt do it, he said.
The Importance of Wisdom
But what role does tuk wisdom play in Sri Lankan society Should it be treated as a nationally important art form Or is it just simply a method of self-expression Or is it something else entirely, perhaps a form of philosophy
The tuk wisdom subculture is very amusing. Its a good way for people to display their views and life experiences.
I like tuk wisdom as long as it isnt racist or offensive, and I think it can be considered a form of art, since people make their own designs, create their own sayings, and paint their tuks all different colors. said Sunil Gunawardena, a videographer.
The sayings are absurd, but thats not an issue with which Im concerned. Its certainly a form of personal expression, but I wouldnt necessarily call it an art form, said art critic Ruwan Jayakody.
Others, however, claim to have learned important life lessons from the expressions on tuks.
There are some expressions that, as a younger person, I thought were somewhat inspirational, like He who flies not high falls now low. It sounds silly now, but that sort of inspired me to pursue my dreams, said Radhika da Silva, an accountant.
One of Merriam-Webster Dictionarys definitions of philosophy is as follows: The most basic beliefs, concepts, and attitudes of an individual or group. It seems perfectly reasonable to view tuk wisdom as a reflection of drivers realities and a portrayal of their beliefs.
The tuk driver fraternity is very tight-knit, and the trishaw decorations seem to reflect not only the drivers artistic tastes, but also their particular values and principles. It would be a shame to let tuk wisdom go, said da Silva.

Fisheries sector, among top three forex earners in Sri Lanka by 2020

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the fisheries sector will be among top three foreign exchange earners in Sri Lanka by 2020.

Gunmen kill Pakistani TV news assistant
PAKISTAN: Gunmen shot dead an employee of a Pakistani TV news channel in Karachi on Sunday shortly after launching a grenade attack on a police vehicle, officials said.
Taimoor Abbas, an assistant for privately run Samaa, had gone with colleagues to North Nazimabad neighbourhood to report on the assault on police when the van they were travelling in came under fire.
The 22-year-old was taken to hospital but died from his bullet wounds, senior police official Muqadas Haider told AFP.
Haider said the unidentified assailants had thrown an explosive device on a police armoured personnel carrier. No one was hurt in the initial attack but when the Samaa vehicle arrived the gunmen started shooting.
Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the assault but counter terrorism department chief Raja Umar Khitab said it was a targeted attack against both media and police.
Karachi, Pakistans largest city and a major business and industrial hub, is rife with political, sectarian and ethnic militancy.
A strategic operation in the city by security forces in recent years has brought a lull in violence, but scattered attacks still take place.
Pakistan is ranked among the worlds most dangerous countries for the media.
Last month unidentified attackers shot dead a newspaper journalist in Pakistans troubled southwestern Balochistan province as he returned home on his motorcycle.- AFP

Hacking new trails to travel travails!
Unquestionably, the world after 9/11 changed for all time. No sector felt the effects of the horrifying terrorist-perpetrated carnage than the aviation industry. In its immediate aftermath air travel became a humiliating nightmare for everyone. Gone were the days when flying was relaxing, when checking in for your flight took just 20 minutes and your biggest concern when boarding a flight was being seated next to a morbidly obese guy who snored while he slept.
Now with US President Donald Trumps travel ban diktat on seven Islamic nations one wonders whether voyagers will face far worse security nightmares than staring back at the immediate wake of 9/11. The airlines, because of their security lapses, had devised intrusive and humiliating measures to counter the terrorist threat. I have had my fair share of mortifying run-ins with airport security, immigration, customs officials and ground crews during that era.
Besides, I must concede that I hate flying. Yes, I like terra firma best. And the more firma, the less terra, or rather running the gauntlet of security terror. Now with security checks bound to get more stringent I thought Id share some of my tips on dos and donts to help make your next flying experience as smooth and stress-free as possible.
The first dont is: Do not look like a terrorist. Now you may ask, what does a terrorist look like Well, I cannot tell you for sure, but suffice to say if you do look like one you will be searched and interrogated. Therefore, always make sure you are abreast of the newest fashion trend for seasoned terrorists and then avoid wearing that! Also remember that as far as the fads go it isnt a beardyful world anymore for security morons. Designer fungus is not looked upon as appropriate for travellers.
Apparently most airport security dont have a sense of humour. You can get into a lot of trouble for making jokes. Personally, I think they should lighten up.
Logically, a terrorist or a drug smuggler would be as quiet as a church mouse. Only those who are innocent would feel comfortable and safe enough to crack jokes. But I have actually seen signs that read: Airport security does not have a sense of humour. Jokes about terrorism, bombs, smuggling, etc are considered a federal offence. Seems like a violation of my freedom of speech if you ask me. Ok. Ok, as they say carry your credit card with you but leave the jokes at home.
It all starts when you get to the airport and have to check in. Then the security heavies begin playing Merlin the magician. They begin by giving you a generous helping of the magic wand treatment with the usual metal detectors brandished all over you with ritualistic fervour. If there is so much as a beep they resort to the rough and vigorous patting down which I construe is a legalised invasion of my privacy as well as criminal molestation. It is part of a security technique which they say is necessary for your own safety. Nonetheless, it is a system which by any civilised legal definition is perverse and flawed.
Yes I do get fidgety and denounce the whole procedure, particularly the intimate groping with venomous distaste. How can one not remain finicky when meddlesome male fingers begin feeling you up where the hand of man has never ventured. Anyone who disagrees is a homo sapien of the deviant order who would be deliriously humming, Life is so good, Life is so gay, while he is being groped in the most intimate places. One thing most normal people must stop saying when being frisked at airports is: Ooh, that feels nice!
Speaking for myself, if the groping wasnt legalised the feeler-upper would certainly have found himself writhing on the floor in gruesome contortions of agony while clutching at his groin and jaw. It does not seem logical that I am being searched for objects interpreted as dangerous for my own safety. Now I have to undergo the humiliating inference that I could plot to kill my fellow passengers with safety pins, keys, finger nail clippers, shaving kits and other potential deadly weapons that we carry thoughtlessly concealed in our toilet bags. The airport has no place for a sense of humour. If you think you are a stand-up comedian please make sure you stay very far away from me when checking in at the airport or going through customs.
We are all chosen for the random shoe search, I self-consciously grinned to myself at the feeling of nakedness at having my shoes off before other passengers. I felt proud that my socks had no holes. Sock it to me, baby, I thought as I held my feet up for inspection even though I have no idea what could be secreted in my socks that can bring down an airplane.
They checked the 25 copies of my satire book, making sure I was no terrorist propagandist. When finally cleared of suspicion I turned back and smugly told them: These arent weapons of mass destruction, just words of mass deception! Then I got out of range before their paralysed brains could react.
Anyone who is familiar with travel will realise that belt removal is a bit of a random requirement. But if some of us do as we are told, let your trousers fall down and let them deal with the fall out. The security bloke asks me to put my arms up so I can be searched. I politely point out I can either stretch my left arm up, or the right arm as the other is holding my trousers up.
I dont want to expose my Superman underwear to the flying public now do I And what if I happened to be one among those who prefers to divest himself of all unnecessary underclothes Okay so the entire flying public with its pants down must go through the security screening without so much as making a peep.
Actually on my last visit to the Land of Uncle Sam I bought a set of colourful unmentionables that are reserved for travel. With such weapons of theatrical production I will be able to avoid being suspected of a being purveyor of weapons of mass destruction. I also hope and pray that I will be subjected to a strip search. No I am not an exhibitionist. But the words boldly emblazoned on the unmentionables read: God Bless America!

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) informed President Maithripala Sirisena that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has misused his cabinet portfolio. He should tender his resignation for the offence, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said the Health Minister had acted to hide the low quality of the SAITM by not implementing the powers vested on him through the Medical Ordinance in connection with the Technical Report issued on the SAITM by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
He has not informed the courts about the guidelines in connection with the `minimum quality' of medical educations declared by the SLMC. These details are included in five places in the the Court of appeal Judgment, he said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, since 2006, the Health Minister has been working to prevent the gazette on `minimum quality' getting passed in Parliament. As an MP, he had started his crusade in 2006 to prevent the `minimum quality' for medical education during the time of former Health Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. The evidence is in 2006 October 3 Hansard. All evidence will be released to the country by the GMOA through Hansard records. The GMOA is waiting for the President to follow his own stand which he expressed in writing during the time he held the Health Minister portfolio, Zoysa said.

Indias mobile gaming market to cross $400 mn by 2022
The countrys mobile gaming market is poised to top $400 million by 2022, driven by growing adoption of freemium and virtual reality games in the coming years, a report has said.
Freemium is a business model where basic services are provided free of charge but one has to pay for using the more advanced features.
According to the CII-TechSci Research report, revenues from mobile-based gaming stood at $265.8 million last year and is forecast to touch $286.2 million in 2017.
The number of mobile gamers in the country is also expected to grow substantially from 198 million in 2015 to 628 million by 2020 and further to 1.16 billion by 2030, it added.
Gaming industry in India has witnessed a shift from console gaming to mobile gaming, with growth and improvement of wireless connectivity in the country. Ease of playing mobile games coupled with rising mobile phone subscribers has fuelled thegrowth of mobile gaming in India over the last few years, it said.
The report added that increasing number of mobile internet users, coupled with thedevelopment of new and advanced games, has also boosted mobile gaming market in the country.
Overall, the Indian gaming industry was valued at $543 million in 2016 and is projected to grow to $801 million by 2022.
In 2016, India accounted for a share of 0.55 per cent of the global gaming industry and this is anticipated to grow significantly over the next five years, on account of macroeconomic factors such as improving demographics, rising disposable income, changing gaming preferences of the consumers, etc, it said.
Moreover, increasing focus of gaming companies towards Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) related games in the country is expected to boost Indias gaming market in coming five years, it added.
Console gaming accounted for the second largest share of 35.51 per cent in Indias gaming market in 2016, followed by computer gaming (15.54 per cent share).
The procurement cost associated with console games is very high in the country, due to which the console gaming market in India has witnessed a sluggish growth over the past decade, the report said.
Rising demand for evolved gaming consoles such as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is being witnessed in urban areas of India.
Core gamers, who do not intend to move to console gaming and make additional investments, are driving computer gaming industry in the country, the report said. (Business Standard)

India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas
Amid the hue and cry over President Trumps travel ban, news of another potential change to American immigration rules has set off a panic attack in Indias tech industry.
Major Indian tech shares took a nosedive on Tuesday on reports that Trump is planning to make changes to the H-1B visa program that allows skilled foreigners to work in the U.S.
Shares in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Indias biggest private sector employer, plunged more than 5% on Mumbais stock exchange, while other top firms like Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT) fell by more than 4%.
TCS and Infosys declined to comment. Wipro did not respond to requests for comment.
Indias vast outsourcing industry employs millions of people. Its business in the U.S., where it provides engineering and other tech services to firms such as IBM (IBM, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Citibank (C), is highly dependent on the H-1B visa.
The U.S. is worth about $65 billion to Indias tech industry. Indian media warned of a major setback ahead.
[It] is a fact that these categories of workers are in short supply in the U.S., said R Chandrashekhar, president of Nasscom, which represents Indias software industry. Restricting H-1B visas would have implications for both Indian companies and American corporations as well, he told CNNMoney.
The former U.S. ambassador to India, Richard Verma, estimated last year that 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued annually go to Indian workers. The visas, which are currently allocated by a lottery system, are hugely oversubscribed -- demand for them in 2016 was three times more than the number available.
Related: Bipartisan bill aims to reform H1-B visa system
Now, that system is under attack on multiple fronts. Three separate bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress this month aiming to curb the program in various ways.
It is also in Trumps crosshairs. A draft executive order obtained by CNNMoney calls for several changes to U.S. immigration rules, although it was not immediately clear what the specific impact on the H-1B visas would be.
I think with respect to H-1Bs and other visas, its part of a larger immigration reform effort that the president will continue to talk about, Trumps press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Monday.
Spicer added that Trump will do so through executive order and through working with Congress.
Silicon Valley lawmaker Zoe Lofgren introduced a bill a week ago, calls for removing the lottery system and replacing it with a preference for companies that can pay the highest salaries.
That would make it far more costly for Indian firms to send their workers to the U.S.
Cost was the major advantage for Indian companies, and that will get impacted, said D.D. Mishra, a research director at technology consultancy Gartner.
Mishra estimates that up to 30% of employees working on software projects for Indian firms are overseas. The proportion is much higher for hardware projects, meaning companies would struggle if they faced restrictions on the number of Indians they could employ.
There is very little room to maneuver...without disrupting the quality of work, he said.
The Indian government says it has made its view known to Trump and U.S. lawmakers.
Indias interests and concerns have been conveyed both to the U.S. Administration and the U.S. Congress at senior levels, foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said Tuesday.

Indonesia sends aid to drought-hit Sri Lanka
(File Photo)
Indonesia will help Sri Lanka, which is currently facing a food crisis because of drought, President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) said on Tuesday (14).
 The country is going through a prolonged dry spell, and more than one million of its people are facing acute water shortage and a food crisis.
 "As friends, it is appropriate that Indonesia help Sri Lanka face this difficult situation," President Jokowi said, as the country delivered humanitarian aid in the form of 5,000 metric tons of rice to Sri Lanka on Tuesday.
 The food grain was delivered following a request made by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena through the countrys ambassador to Indonesia in Jakarta. "I immediately responded to the request and asked the ministers concerned to send the aid, and Alhamdulillah, today, we can send it to Sri Lanka," Jokowi said.
 The Indian Express reported that the Sri Lankan government has declared a state of alert in response to the worst drought the country has faced in four decades. It has implemented measures such as water-use restrictions, deployed soldiers, established a presidential commission and urged its citizens to consume water prudently.
 The Sri Lankan National Water Supply and Sanitation Council on Sunday warned of the need to rationalize the consumption of drinking water as the countrys current reserve is expected to last for only two months.
 Alahudeen Ansar, head of the Council, said the demand for drinking water has increased by 15 per cent and that measures have been taken to restrict its use in many areas in the 13 affected districts.

International Schools Athletic Championships (ISAC) 2017
The International Schools Athletic Championships (ISAC), which commenced in 2001 and was the brainchild of the Founder, late R. I. T. Alles of Gateway College, has now established itself as the biggest national flagship sporting event in the school calendar of 25 International Schools affiliated with The International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL).
In 2004, Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, took over the responsibility of organizing this prestigious event from Gateway College, who had organized it for 3 years since its inception in 2001. Thereafter, the hosting of the ISAC kept alternating between the two schools every 3 years. In 2015, Lyceum took over the reins from Gateway College once again, to serve as the official organizer for the next 3 consecutive years - 2016, 2017 and 2018.
ISAC 2017 will be held on February 25, 26 and 27 at the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Homagama, Sri Lanka from 8 am to 6pm on all three days.
TISSL member schools competing in this years ISAC are:
Asian International School
Alethea Internationional School
Belvoir College International
The British School in Colombo
Burhani Serendib School
Colombo International School, Colombo
Colombo International School, Kandy
Elizabeth Moir International School
Gateway College, Colombo
Gateway College, Kandy
Ilma International Girls School
Leeds International School
Lyceum International School, Nugegoda
Lyceum International School, Panadura
Lyceum International School, Ratnapura
Lyceum International School, Wattala
Leighton Park International School
OKI International School
The Overseas School of Colombo
Regent International College
Royal Institute, Colombo
Stafford International School
St. Nicholas International College
Wycherley International School
This years ISAC has special significance for Lyceum as this will be the 8th time that we will be taking over the organization of such a challenging meet. Around 3000 athletes from the 24 International Schools mentioned above, will compete in 130 events for both boys and girls. Over 20,000 spectators including students, parents, relatives, staff members and cheering squads from TISSL member schools and those participating, are expected to be present.
The ISAC is conducted in accordance with the competition rules and regulations of both TISSL as well as the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) and will include electronic timing and measurements. The competition will also be conducted by over 300 officials as per the rules of the Amateur Athletic Association of Sri Lanka. Each competitor will also be given a unique Identity Card by TISSL for easy identification.
The ISAC is also now fully computerized with real-time web based entries to instantly access results and scores over the Internet via the ISAC website http://isac.lyceum.lk, which was designed and developed by the Department of Information Technology of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda. This user-friendly website will provide all necessary information including past meet records, the current sponsorship proposal and a full list of competitors for this years meet. Mrs. Kumari Grero, Chairperson of the ISAC 2017 and Coordinating Principal of Lyceum International Schools, stated that over the past 17 years existence of the ISAC, the standard of athletics has advanced to an extent where TISSL member schools have not only been able to produce skilled, professional athletes capable of representing Sri Lanka at International Track and Field Athletic Championships abroad, but also produce well balanced global citizens as well.
Mrs. Grero also stated that organizing an event of this magnitude would not be possible if not for the continuous support received from esteemed service providers both in higher education and the consumer market, who have always come forward to support extra-curricular activities of this nature, in their bid to promote healthy minds in a healthy body as well as team work and leadership. Sponsorship is what the TISSL association strongly believe to be a business relationship that is mutually beneficial to both the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries as it helps service providers promote their good services and products to their target market  i.e. the youth of the International Schools community in Sri Lanka.
At the last press conference, Mr. Nikitha Grero, Director of Lyceum International Schools, Sri Lanka, said The ISAC is not just an athletic meet, it is also a time of renewing old friendships and building new ones as we meet all our colleagues as well as new friends from other International Schools. Though the true spirit of sportsmanship is to learn to face defeat, our competitors aim should be victory at all times by fair means.
This years ISAC will be sponsored by several esteemed organizations; Pearson Education will serve as the Principal Sponsor of the ISAC 2017 and Revello Chocolate have taken Co-Sponsorship. McDonalds Sri Lanka has joined as one of the Special Sponsors and also very generously stepped up to support this event. Wijeya Newspapers Limited teams up as the Main Print and Web Media Sponsor and China Lanka Education as the Gold Medal sponsor. Other sponsors are Insomnia (Pvt.) Limited, Universal College Lanka, Reckitt Benckiser (Lanka) Limited, Hatton National Bank Kohuwela Customer Centre, Edu-Geek and PLANET EDUCATION - Aus Study Gateway.

## Title: Introduction to corporate debt investments
## Supertitle:

Introduction to corporate debt investments
Fixed Income could be considered the most popular asset class among retail and institutional investors in Sri Lanka with Fixed Deposits being a very popular investment tool among investors.
However, corporate debt,although not very popular among Sri Lankan investors, is also an important segment within the fixed income asset class, which might be second only to Government Securities. Corporate debt instruments could be differentiated based on the characteristics of the type of each instrument.Following are some examples of the types of corporate debt instruments widely available for investors in Sri Lanka.
1. Bank and Finance company deposits (Savings accounts, Current accounts and Fixed Deposits)
2. Debentures.
3. Commercial Paper (Commercial Paper Repo is another instrument created from Commercial Papers).
4. Asset Backed Instruments and Securitisation.
5. Promissory Notes.
Despite the range of available corporate debt instruments, only few of the above are easily accessible to the retail investors. For example, majority of the retail investors are familiar and comfortable with investing in deposit products offered by banks and finance companies. Availability, convenience and less complexity of the products might be the main reasons for the popularity of such instruments. Moreover, lack of awareness of investors and general preference for investments which are short term in nature, could also be cited as reasons for the demand for bank and finance company deposits.
However, investors should consider alternative fixed income instruments for investment purposes as there are a few instruments which are useful for retail investors for increasing returns and providing diversification benefits.
Debentures are one of such instruments which retail investors could invest to improve their overall returns in the long term. However, it is important to understand the nature of debentures and how they vary in characteristics compared to the more popular and traditional deposit products available in the market.
A Debenture is essentially a loan taken by a company through the capital market. Corporates can raise money in the capital markets in two ways. One is the popular method of raising money by issuing stocks in the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The other alternative is to issue debentures. Stocks are equity instruments and when an investor purchases a stock he essentially becomes a part owner of the company. When an investor purchases a debenture he is lending to the company and becomes a creditor or debt holder of the company.
Debentures are widely available for investments for retail investors with a CDS account. However, there are a few important characteristics to be considered before investing in a debenture. Debentures are long term in nature compared to deposit products available in the market. Thus, investors should evaluate their ability to hold to maturity of a long term investment such as a debenture.
As debentures are listed instruments, technically, an investor could trade and liquidate the investment in the market. However, market prices are subject to change and depend on many factors including demand and supply and other factors such as market interest rates which uniquely affect debenture prices. Therefore, investors should evaluate the investment taking to consideration their ability to hold the instrument till maturity.
As an investor in a debenture is essentially giving a loan to the company and he is entitled to receive interest on that loan. In market terminology the loan interest is referred to as coupons and there are different types of debentures available in the market depending on the basis of the coupon paid.
1. In most debentures the coupon rate would be fixed and will be paid based at promised intervals (monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually)
2. Some debentures carry Floating rate coupons where the coupon rate changes with market interest rates. If interest rates in the market are going up, investors would receive higher cash flows from these types of debentures and vice versa.
3. In Zero coupon debentures a coupon is not paid until it matures. The investment will accrue interest during the tenure of the debenture, however, will not be paid to the investor till maturity.
There are several factors investors should consider when deciding to invest in a debenture. If the investor requires regular cash flows for day to day necessities, they should opt for a debenture with frequent coupon payments such as monthly or quarterly. If funds are invested in debentures with semiannual or annual coupons, the investor may run in to cash flow management issues during the period of the debenture. However, if the investor's main objective of investing in the debenture is returns, he or she should consider the semiannual, annual or zero coupon options.
When trying to maximize returns, investors should always keep in mind the reinvestment risk of the coupon payments of the debentures. At the time a debenture is issued in the market, the prospectus and other marketing material for the debenture may indicate the interest rate of the debenture and the annual effective rate of the debenture (AER). It is important to note that AER is arrived at by assuming the cash flows will be reinvested at the same rate, which is extremely rare in real life of investing.
For example, if a debenture offers an interest rate of 12.60% semiannual coupons, the AER of the debenture would be 13%. If an investor invests Rs. 100,000.00 in a debenture, he would receive Rs. 6,300.00 every 6 months. However, if this coupon of Rs. 6,300.00 is not reinvested at 12.60%, the AER of the debenture would be different (higher if the reinvestment rate is higher than 12.60% and lower if the reinvestment rate is less than 12.60%).
The following example illustrates the actual effective rate an investor would receive from a Rs. 100,000 investment in a debenture paying a 12.60% p.a. coupon semi annually, depending on the market interest rates prevailing at the time the coupon is received. In this debenture each coupon payment an investor would receive is Rs. 6,300 (12.6% x Rs. 100,000 / 2).
Assume the following are the maturity value of the investment of the coupon payment of Rs. 6,300.00 at three different rates, 12.60%, 11.00% and 13.50%.
The main advantage for individual investors from a fixed rate debenture is the consistency of the interest rate for a longer tenure compared to the bank and finance company deposits. The short term nature of the deposit products offered in the market means the interest rates would be reset more frequently at the maturity of each deposit.
Finally, an investor should take into consideration the risk of their investment. Debentures are long term investments and investors should consider the ability of the borrower to pay back.
The long term nature of the debentures itself increases the risk of the investment compared to the short term investments.
The series of events that could trigger during the period of the instruments (macroeconomic and/or issuer specific) might be more, compared to short term investments. Therefore, in addition to the return, investors should understand the quality of the issuer and the kind of risk they are willing to take before investing in a debenture of a corporate.
Investors should not invest in a debenture below their risk appetite, irrespective of the interest rate offered. And an investor should not invest in a debenture if they cannot afford to hold to maturity (unless they are willing take the risk of interest rate and market volatility).
The rating of the debenture would give investors a good idea of the riskiness of the investment and should be an important consideration in their investment decision making process.

iPhone 8 Tipped to Cost above $1,000
Theres been a lot of speculation about the iPhone 8 with specifications and design changes being at the forefront. However, a fresh report sheds some light on the iPhone 8 price bracket. Reportedly, the premium device marking Apples 10-year anniversary could well be priced north of $1,000 (roughly Rs. 67,100) - thanks to the introduction of OLED displays.
Furthermore, the report also says that Apple could call it the iPhone X instead of the largely speculated iPhone 8. Fast Company cites people familiar with the matter to claim that there will be three variants that will launch in this fall. The first two variants will be presumably be - a 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and a 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus - which will sport LCD displays. The iPhone 8 will be sport a 5.8-inch OLED display that stretches till the edges. The Home Button will be integrated within the display, and the battery will be much larger than its other counterparts. The device will sport a dual camera setup just like the iPhone 7 Plus.
As OLED displays are twice as expensive as LCD displays, Apples celebratory iPhone 8 smartphone will be priced above $1,000 (roughly Rs. 67,100), according to the report. This doesnt come as a surprise as Apple is known for this kind of pricing, and its most premium variant of the iPhone 7 Plus costs $969 (Rs. 92,000 in India).
The report further adds that Apple has been working with Lumentum to bring a unique 3D-sensing technology. This technology will bring some sort of facial recognition, better image resolution for the camera app, or some form of augmented reality application. However, the actual advantage of this technology is not known yet. (Gadgets)

Its Telees time again!
The 13th chapterof Raigam Telees - the tele-awards ceremony, which is also the biggest annual event of the television industry in Sri Lanka will be held on June 3 at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre.
Continuation of an award ceremony at the highest level for thirteenth consecutive years, overcoming many challenges is a very special victory for us and we are pleased to see that today the Raigam Telees has become a very special event of all stakeholders of the industry. We share that happiness and the strength we have thus gained with the media and the general public and we gladly and proudly accept the challenge of organizing the Awards Ceremony of the Nation to encompass the whole of the tele-media.
An occasion retains its value and currency only if it evolves with the passage of time while maintaining its core values. If, in an award ceremony, award winners are queued up and given awards just for the sake of holding an award ceremony, that event will not generate any interest; at least not for very long. The audience will not have any enthusiasm as there will be nothing to arouse their interest. That is the reason why audiences in many award ceremonies applaud the award recipient so unenthusiastically. As organizers of Raigam Telees we are always committed to provide a new experience to the audience while maintaining the values of the event. Raigam Telees has established a set of norms which are very strictly adhered to in all aspects of the event.
Although the over-view of the Raigam Tele<U+201F>es has been broadened, the Raigam Tele<U+201F>es Secretariat has decided to keep the number of awards allocated for the tele-drama sector unchanged. Accordingly this year too there will be number of awards for the years best creation, acting, singing and technical talents of multi-episode tele-drama and single-episode tele-drama.
Today the most popular TV program is tele-drama, but most of the air time is occupied by other, different programs. The main responsibility of the TV media should be to telecast these programs targeting the education and entertainment needs of the audience with high quality material and updating viewers on various areas of interest. Therefore with the hope of encouraging production of creative and high value programs to sharpen the minds and tastes of the general public a number of awards will be presented to best efforts in this category including news reading, news reporting, current affairs, educational, childrens, musical, reality, and political
Programs. Awards for the best news reader and best presenter will be granted separately for each language Sinhala, English and Tamil.
An opportunity has been allowed for thousands of television viewers to indicate their most preferred tele-drama, actor and the actress under this category through an SMS poll. Raigam pioneered the use of SMS to select the winners of popular awards. This time too the general public will get the chance to use SMS to elect their choice of the most popular Actor, Actress, and Tele-drama. SMS voting will be opened from May 2 to June 2. 25 participants from SMS-voting will be selected to receive two invitations each to witness Raigam Telees 2016. The winners who will receive a message from the Raigam Telees Secretariat through the telephone number used to send the SMS will enable to receive printed invitations by forwarding the message at the gate. The telephone numbers for SMS Poll are 0772 522 522 / 0702 722 722
Honouring the pioneers and artists who had worked hard for the development of the television sector is one of the special events of the Raigam Telees. During the past Raigam Telees has honoured many senior artists, technicians and selected personalities who were instrumental in introducing television media in our country.
In 2007, Prathiba Prabha lifetime awards scheme was introduced to honour and appreciate the contribution and achievement of most prominent personalities who contributed to build and develop the TV industry. Dr. D.B Nihalsinghe, Shan Wickramasinghe, Kalashoori Titus Thotawatta, Kalashoori Sathischandra Edirisinghe, Lucien Bulathsinghala, Tony Ranasinghe, Dharmasena Pathiraja, Parakrama Niriella, Jayalath Manorathne, Cyril Wickramage and Ravindra Randeniya are the artists who have been honoured under this awards scheme.

Lets talk English
I believe English is a language which will help us to keep from destroying ourselves says Liz England.
Liz England is a professor of English as a second language and also conducts a programme called Teaching English to speakers of other languages. She mostly works in the USA where her career began. Liz counts herself lucky to come to Sri Lanka among a number of other countries for short term assignments. She has lived in Egypt for six years where she worked at the American University in Cairo Egypt. She also worked in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Institute of Education and worked in Indonesia with a programme called the English Language Fellows Programme which is a joint project between George Town University and US Department of State. The experienced professor sat down with Daily News to share her thoughts on English education around the globe.
Q. Why is learning English important
A. If you have a language you share with your enemies or with your friends you can communicate with them.
You dont have to be worried or afraid. You dont need to take a gun out. You dont have to be afraid because you can talk to them.
Even if it is different English, we can still communicate. I believe English is a language which will help the world to keep ourselves from destruction.
When people talk and listen to each other we can have a peaceful world for us and for our children.
Q. You are an English Language specialist. What does that mean Can you define your vocation
A. My focus is on University based English Language Teacher Education and the teachers not only in the USA but all over the world want to take up a Post Graduate Degree, a Masters in Teaching English as a second language.
I do research in this field while I teach classics in the University and I also get invited to do projects with the public education system in the USA. The schools that educate children from other countries need help with teacher training to teach English as a second language.
I do community service as well. In fact in programmes such as this, it might be called Service to the profession, because I am serving people who are not really my students and they are not in a USA University, so I have the opportunity to do international service which is a very big gift for me, I love doing it.
Q. Tell me a little bit about your early education and your beginnings
A. I worked with some Vietnamese refugees in the USA. I was involved with my church that sponsored some refugees. As members of the church we went to their homes to help them, since it is difficult for refugees in the beginning to settle down.
So in 1977, I was in Madison Wisconsin and looked after a Vietnamese family of 25.
And in December in Wisconsin the weather is very cold with ice everywhere. The family suffered quite a lot.
I fell in love with communicating in English which was the second language of that family.
Q. What are some of the projects you have worked on
A. In general my projects involve various aspects of English Language Teacher Education. I was recently in Russia and I did a project called English for specific purposes with Universities. Someone might be taking classes to get Masters in Business Administration, Engineering or Law. But English is special in a certain academic or scholarly discipline.
So our programme in Russia was about English for Specific purposes in the University setting. In contrast in Sri Lanka our project has been more general.
We have been linking with a variety of groups and individuals and had meetings in some Universities and the task was with teachers of English. We have worked with interns and third years students in the NIE (National Institute of Education). We have worked with a variety of people and we also did some Ministry trainer training. The Ministry has an arm that does training for teachers in service training and we recently did a project with them in Galle and had a wonderful experience. We were in Jaffna, Kandy and Colombo and Matara covering all the way from the North of Sri Lanka to the South.
Q. Why did you choose to become an English Language specialist
A. In the USA you take Bachelors, Masters and Phd. After my Phd I was offered a job at the American University in Cairo Egypt in 1984. I went to Egypt with my family and I was a professor in teaching English as a second language but we were also taught Arabic as a second language, because in Egypt people speak Arabic.
I aquired some skills there that later became very important in the world. My mother was very worried about me going so far away from my home in New York but it was very fruitful and not long after I was invited that to do a programme in the Czech Republic which is in the Eastern Part of Europe in 1992. It was my first international consultancy and there I worked with Russian teachers who aspired to become English teachers. We were given six weeks to help them speak English.
We were invited to work with 60 teacher leaders in the different schools in the Czech Republic, a smaller country than Sri Lanka.
We helped them to learn how to use and teach English to the children from kindergarten to Grade 12 in the Czech Republic. It was an extraordinary experience because the teachers were so eager to learn but had so much to teach in just six weeks and within three months a Russian teacher had to be an English teacher.
Q. What kind of work have you done for universities, ministries, and private and government agencies
A. The US government projects with which I have worked includes the one in Sri Lanka and in Nepal, our next stop.
The projects are often identified by the US embassy in that country. They will have a project or more and then the regional English language officer, finds somebody who can help the job I do as an English Language Specialist.
So I was invited to come here and do this project with the US Embassy in Sri Lanka where we got the opportunity to work with a wide range.
In some cases it is a very narrow range, but here there were many needs and there were many projects for us, out of which we chose some that seemed realistic for the time and the resources we had.
Q. Your projects focused on language programme design, implementation and evaluation. Can you give me some examples
A. In Sri Lanka we have not done much programme evaluation. We have really focused on teacher education and finding new tools to help teachers tackle issues or challenges that they identify or perhaps the ministry identifies which in return will improve their teaching. The most important point about the Sri Lankan project was the teachers were 100 per cent enthusiastic, positive and engaged.
The teachers were very keen. Sometimes the ministry makes it compulsory to take the training even though the teachers dont want it and they feel like they are being forced to take the training. We had none of those issues here. So there were very specific benefits for individual groups and leaders.
Q. Has your stay in Sri Lanka been a success
A. I have never been to Sri Lanka before. This is my first visit and I have had a very positive personal and professional experience. The programme here was well organised and there was plenty of work. For me it has been great. I believe I will go back to the USA with some long lasting friendships from Sri Lanka. So I think it was successful.
Q. You have spent ten years at Shenandoah University in 2016. What was the nature of your work there
A. We have a Masters Degree Programme which I directed there. It was a programme for the Post Graduate Students where the students have to follow a series of eleven courses in order to be prepared to teach English. Ours was an online programme and I wrote a book about online teachers education. It is very different from what you and I know, to be sitting in the classroom listening to a professor. Learning Online requires different skills. So we wrote a book that was designed to help teacher trainers and teachers to learn online in a distance environment. I think there is great potential for online and distant teacher education in Sri Lanka as well.

Michael Flynn: Trump's national security adviser quits role

White House national security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned over his contacts with Russia.
Flynn is alleged to have discussed US sanctions with the Russian ambassador before President Trump took office.
Flynn is said to have misled officials about the conversation.
Earlier, US media reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House about the contacts late last month.
They said that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.
Senior Democrats had called for Flynn to be fired.
It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and the calls happened late last year before Flynn was appointed to the administration.
In his letter of resignation, Flynn said he had "inadvertently briefed the vice-president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador".
A White House statement said Gen Joseph Keith Kellogg had been appointed as interim replacement.

In obsession with Shakespeare
Many playwrights knew success before Shakespeare arrived in the scene. The premature death of Christopher Marlow left the field open and gave Shakespeare every opportunity as enviously Robert Greene declared in a script that Bard beautified himself with the feathers of his illustrious predecessors, probably referring to Marlow and Thomas Kyd who wrote tragedies of high emotion and drama that were boarded at the Rose Theatre especially THE SPANISH TRAGESY that zoomed Kyd to a Reniassance man.
The University wits who found it hard to come to terms that Shakespeare wrote the works of his time found evidence of Shakespeare's personal life to be meager but no more that of most men of his time and rank and there was certainly enough to make nonsense of the idea that the man from Stratford did not write the plays. However his baptism and buriel entered in the register of Stratford Parish Church as well as the baptisms of his children and his marriage by special licence by the Bishop of Worcester, still exists.
Heterogeneous nature
Therefore, the University Wits drew a blank. They knew that his work as extraordinary was, came from his pen and left him alone.
Being one of Chamberilain's Men, Shakespeare knew how to exploit the resources according to the whims and fancy of nature of the heterogeneous nature of the audiences, the greatest works for production were all in place. As he left his rivals behind, and returned to the stage by end of 1594 along with such actors as William Kemp and Richard Burbage. Some moved away to join and pledged their support to Lord Howard of Effingham and established themselves at the Rose Theatre.
Permanent Playhouses were built in London to facilitate the growing theatre that demnded to showcase the work of dramatists apart from Marlowe and Kyd. Thus the Theatre, the Curtain Theatre and later the Rose, the Swan, the Globe and the Fortune had overtaken the provinces. These happenings marked a break with the past though not many good plays were performed from 1576 to 1584. Then the audiences saw such masterpieces like Marlowe's TAMBURLAINE and THE SPANISH TRAGEDY by Kyd.
The THEATRE and the CURTAIN THEATRE north of the city belonged to a carpenter by trade, James Burbage on the opposite side of Thames and west of Southward the Rose Theatre was constructed by Philip Henslowe. Following the footstep of Henslowe, a goldsmith named Francis Langley built the SWAN in 1595. Because the theatre was without a resident company, found it difficult to compete with the Chamberlain's Men, was forced to close down after a July performance in 1597.
Subsequently, James Burbage ran into difficulties attempting to renew the ground lease of the THEATRE in 1596. Cry as hard as he did, the negotiations yielded no solution and James died leaving his son Cuthbert to resolve the problem.
Young Burbage moved fast acted with daring, full of imagination on the face of the lease due to expire at the end of the year which was the 28th December 1598 and had the building dismantled by a carpenter named peter Street along with twelve workmen.
It was dismantled to a piece of land on the opposite side of Thames in Southwark, not much of a distance from the Rose. It took them only eight months to build the Globe, the best tribute to Shakespeare. A new type of association was founded between the owner of the land, Sir Nicholas Brend and the two Burbage brothers, Cuthbert and Richard along with five players from the Chamberlaine's Company. One of these was Shakespeare; in other words, he became a owner of a share in the property.
In the following year the Globe suffered from competition by the new theatre with Philip Henslowe moving across to Thames to build The FORTUNE.
All theatres were destroyed because they were used for animal fights along with theatrical performance in 1642 and 1644 under the order of parliament. One thing the audience disapproved was bear-baiting, The bear was tethered to a stake in the ring into which dogs were released for the for the attack. A bear killed a number of dogs before being killed himself occasionally, falling prey to their jaws. Animal cruelty was not an accepted form of entertainment even in that era and we can presume that the great playwright was one who was guilty of this torture of the innocence. He was guilty in letting the audience of the original Globe' s cockpit sit in a circle and place bets watching the feathered combat which amounted to cockfighting. According to reliable source, the cockfighting would continue from four to five hours. It became so famous, the COCKPIT was also the name of a private theatre in Drury Lane. Rightfully, the Government banned such acts and all theatres were destroyed under the order of Parliament.
Brilliant career
Shame for Shakespeare to have made money in acts such as these; a dot in his brilliant career.
Yet, the Bard cast his wondrous image then and now when every generation recreates Shakespeare in its own image as what one age see as his supreme merit, others ignore who look for something very different. It is a measure of the extraordinary complexity of Shakespeare's genius that uniquely among great writers, he can survive this treatment.
In a classical approach to Shakespeare during the 17th century and for most of the 18th century, criticism of the Bard tended to focus on his university...... his understanding of every human being and ability to express every kind of emotion. For the writers of classicism in their origin, he was an untaught child of nature who appeared to have produced masterpieces almost without knowing it.
To start with Shakespeare was a Man of all modern and perhaps Ancient Poets, apart from his classical knowledge and had the largest and comprehensive soul. I am right when I say all the images of Nature were still present in him and drew them effortlessly with luck. When he describe anything you may not see it but feel it with intensity. If he wanted to wallow with nature, he never needed glasses to read about them. He saw them everywhere. That was Shakespeare the genius who among his tragedies, comedies, histories etc; mixed them in their genre, never overlapping the essence found in their folds. He wrote only one play for children MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and never classified them into groups. He could not because some were tragic-comodies. The all pure comedy had TAMING OF THE SHREW, The COMEDY OF ERRORS, The MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.
What I saw at the Globe of Romeo and Juliet is not what I had studied because with time the events in this tragedy are driven forward by the incomprehension of the older generation for the young. As with the world every thing change including the way one looks at Shakespeare. Robert Wagner once said after naming the tragedy as LIEBESTOD to the myth which is the story of Romeo and Juliet. These two young Lovers face insurmountable obstacles with defiance. The narrative format and psychological events are misunderstood that finally lead them to suicide. Romeo and Juliet simulates the experience of adolescence, the intense and changing passions which often generate defiance against the adult world. Though the play rose to heights unimaginable, it was not well received by some great people who saw Shakespeare in the negative. Over the years the drama focuses on this kind of misunderstanding as I did at the Globe when I saw a play that would have stunned and surprised Shakespeare had be lived to see it with his precious Romeo, a black Romeo.
What some of the great people have to say of the Bard
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
Like Tolstoy, Shaw was irritated by the uncritical adulation given to Shakespeare whom he considered in comparison with such writers as Henrik Ibsen and himself, to be lacking in
ideas and depressingly bourgeois in his attitude to social questions.
LEO TOLSTOY
His objections to Shakespeare was unnatural, but mainly that he had no significant moral message. 'I remember the astonishment I felt when I first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive a powerful aesthetic pleasure but having read one after the other especially Romeo and Juliet not only did I feel no delight but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium'......
LETTER TO THE ACADEMIE
There have always been those who thought Shakespeare was overrated. Ironically, these critics include many of the greatest minds in European literature.
VOLTAIRE
For Voltaire Shakespeare was a barbarian. He did not deny his talent but was revolted by his
lack of classical decorum.
LETTERS PHLOSOHIQUES, 1733
Shakespeare boasted a strong fruitful genius. He was natural and sublime but had not so much as a single spark of good taste or knew one rule of the drama.

OPPO 133% YoY growth in 2016
OPPO had a strong finish to a momentous 2016 that saw 133 percent year-on-year growth for the global smartphone brand, according to the latest results from independent research firm IDC.
A core product range that paired premium design with excellent photography helped OPPO maintain its position as the no. 4 smartphone brand globally by market share, and earn the no. 1 spot in China for the two most recent quarters.
IDCs preliminarydata showed that OPPO accounted for 6.8 percent of the global smartphone market in 2016, and had four straight quarters of greater than 100 percent year-on-year growth.
In 2016, our strategy was to stay simple and focused  putting out premium-quality products with phenomenal cameras, said Sky Li, OPPO VP and Managing Director of International Mobile Business. The success we saw is because of our commitment to listening to our users and bringing them devices tailor-made for their lifestyles. Well redouble that commitment as we continue our global expansion this year.
OPPO focused on two main product lines last year its Selfie Expert F series, and the stylish R series, whose industry-leading front and rear cameras embodied the OPPO Camera phone brand concept.
The F1s, sporting a 16 MP front camera, was a resounding success in South and Southeast Asia, two key regions for OPPO. It connected with a growing market of selfie-fanatic millenials, helping OPPO to hit a 10.9 percent sales unit share in Indias offline market in December, up from 1.2 percent at the same time in 2015, according to data from research firm Gfk.
2016 also saw continued expansion for OPPO around the globe, as it extended its business to 26 countries, including new markets in New Zealand, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. In 2017, the company will leverage a recently established marketing center in Egypt to support accelerated expansion in the Middle East and North Africa region.
Meanwhile OPPO, stepped up the selfie experience in Sri Lanka and India by launching the upgraded Selfie Expert flagship model F1s - which is now available in a new variant- the Gold version.
The fingerprint recognition can assign up to five different fingerprints to different apps and contacts. Then, with one touch of the home button, you can launch an app or start a phone call to a pre-assigned contact directly without further operation.
From end of January, the upgraded F1s is available in all the OPPO exclusive showrooms and OPPO authorized dealer stores.

Pakistani court issues nationwide ban on Valentine's Day

The Islamabad High Court in Pakistan's capital issued an order on Monday, that banned the celebration of Valentine's Day across the country 'with immediate effect.'
The order prohibits the display of adverts on electronic and print media that reference Valentine's Day, bans the sale of associated merchandise and states that the day cannot be celebrated in "any public space or government building."
The court has requested Pakistan's Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) to monitor these platforms and share any information that shows that the ban has been compromised.
The court's order came after a petition was submitted by a citizen called Abdul Waheed -- who claimed that ongoing promotions of Valentine's Day were "against the teachings of Islam and should be banned immediately."
Valentine's Day backlash
In Pakistan, Valentine's Day is seen by some as amoral and an appropriation of Western culture.
Resistance against it is not completely unusual. Religious groups like the Islamic political party jamat e Islami have often protested against marking Valentine's Day in the country and hold rallies annually against the celebration on February 14.
In 2016, the local government in the city of Peshawar in the country's northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhua also banned celebrations.
The country's president Mamnoon Hussain, made a statement in February 2016, asking Pakistan's not to celebrate the day since it was "not a part of Muslim tradition, but of the West."
The Islamabad High Court's decision has also divided social media users, with some tweeting for the ban and others vehemently against it.
A chance to promote business
Though Valentine's day tends not to be celebrated widely across the country, in recent years, various companies have used the event to promote their products.
Mohammad Naveed who runs a roadside flower shop tells CNN he's invested close to $2000 on buying flower supplies for February 14.
In the first week of February, vendors start selling heart-shaped balloons and the price of red roses increases.
In Islamabad's markets Monday, florists standing amid large heart-shaped garlands of roses and bouquets of daffodils and jasmine were worried by the effects of the ban.
"We spend four to five days making these, I've got forty of them ready to be sold for tomorrow," Sultan Zaib, told CNN.
Mohammad Naveed, who runs a roadside flower shop, told CNN that he had invested close to the equivalent of $2000 on buying blooms for Valentine's Day.
Florists source flowers from abroad and from the nearby fields of Punjab. Usually they earn about $80 for a day's sales, but the amount increases tenfold on Valentine's day. "If they ban us from selling these tomorrow then it will be a disaster, we simply cannot afford this," said Naveed.

President ensures economic prosperity through agriculture
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday pledged to take all possible measures during his term of office to bring economic prosperity to the country through agriculture by uplifting the farmer economy.
He said as a son of a farmer family, he will take unrelenting efforts to uplift agriculture and the farmer economy.
The President said steps will be taken to fill all major reservoirs with water to ensure that farmers will not face any water or irrigation problem in the future.
He gave this assurance addressing a Jana hamuwa at the Welamitiyawa Vidyalaya grounds in Galewela after inaugurating the massive Wayamba Ela project which would end the lamenting story of people of Wayamba who demanded water for drinking and to feed their verdant farm lands.
The President said it was the duty of all citizens to shelve party and other petty differences and join hands to develop and rebuild the country.
Changing or forming governments could be postponed for election time and all should assist the national development effort by forgetting all differences, President Sirisena said.
The President said saving the country form the present plight and steering it towards development would not be a difficult task if politicians and government servants performed an honest job of work. The governments prime objective is to work towards achieving development goals, he said.
The government would overcome all challenges to perform its duty of rebuilding the motherland as an excellent state.
The President launched work on the first stage of the project by cutting the first sod of earth in the Wemedilla Left Bank Canal bank.
The President also distributed land deeds among people among people displaced due to the project.
The Wayamba Ela project funded by the ADB under the Mahaweli water security investment programme is aimed to uplift agriculture and solve the water scarcity problem by feeding a large number of tanks in the northern part of Kurunegala district by diverting waters of Mahaweli Ganga to the upper Mee Oya catchment area and Hakwatuna Oya.
Once the project is completed, 105,000 acre feet of Mahaweli water will be available to the northern section of Kurunegala district annually. Mahaweli water will feed 300 small tanks and eight major tanks.
This will facilitate the cultivation of 2,500 hectares under the Hakwatune Oya scheme and 3,500 hectares under the small tanks in the Mee Oya Catchment Complex.
A total of 12,000 hectares including them would receive irrigation facilities for cultivation during both seasons.

The deputy minister had called for the information under the governments Right to Information Act from Mass Media Ministry Additional Secretary H. T. S. Malkanthi and TRC Assistant Director Legal Sujeewa Rodrigo.
The deputy minister said he has been a victim of media attacks by a private TV channel over his expressing views in Parliament and his being critical of the soil mining incident in Divulapitiya.
He said he has been a regular target of the channel. He was attacked by the channel without a chance being offered to respond.
Unlike with the press in a similar case in which the affected party can go to the press commission for the redress for any apparent character assassination, I found that there is no place to go when the matter is between a person and a TV channel, Ramanayaka said.
I decided to explore the realm of TV channel licensing and frequency allocation procedures involved in such cases as a victim of circumstances, he said.

The real threats to free education
If university students, medical doctors and the JVP are really committed to free education, they should identify and help dismantle the real threats and not vent their fury on soft targets such as SAITM.
I suggest that what undermines free education in this country are the following, and that these should be the issues that are discussed and debated publicly:
n Increasingly, many government schools are demanding donations and other financial contributions from parents. The Ministry of Education is aware of such illegalities, but does nothing to crack down on principals unless a sufficient number of parents publicly protest. Given that most parents are poor and feel intimidated, such protests are unlikely to happen. The media is also indifferent. Why dont Ministry of Education officials randomly and confidentially sample parents in every district and expose schools that indulge in such acts And all it takes is for one bold journalist to write up a story about the lethargy of the Education Ministry to shake up the whole system.
n Investment in education (including universities) is not a priority for this government in comparison with, say, defence. Yes, we need a navy to control smuggling (human and contraband), and the army and air-force can be redeployed for handling national disasters (increasingly likely with climate change). But what external military threat is Sri Lanka facing that requires the continued purchase of expensive, fuel-guzzling fighter jets As for the terrorist bogey, has any country defeated terrorism with aircraft
Our Independence Day celebrations continue to be military-saturated, expensive affairs that communicate to schoolchildren that learning to march like soldiers is more important for their wellbeing than learning to think and eating healthily. As a nation we continue to pay lip-service to free education and free healthcare and we boast to others about these post-independence achievements; but these are not what are on display in our Independence Day celebrations.
Does the JVP have the courage to propose that Independence Day celebrations be scaled down and the savings added to the national education budget
n How many university graduates with good degrees are encouraged to become teachers or administrators in government schools It is not only the low pay that makes teaching unattractive, but the warped values and ambitions that our educational system (including universities) purvey. There needs to be a complete overhaul of the school curriculum, in addition to greater investment in training teachers, if we are to form citizens of the future capable not just of productive activity, but creative and critical thinking, and who are possessed of a sense of civic responsibility.
If private schools and universities turn out more of such citizens, compared to government schools, then it is the latter that should be critiqued rather than the former.
Finally, instead of disruptive street demonstrations, the Inter-University Student Federation could better display their commitment to the poor in Sri Lanka by conducting a survey of all their members of the past 10 years to find out (a) how many of them are living in Sri Lanka today; (b) send their children to private schools, and (c) engaged in jobs that are promoting economic equality and the upliftment of the poor. And they, together with the GMOA, could start demanding that those doctors who have received a publicly-funded state medical education not be employed in private hospitals for a stipulated period.

Saints Quadrangular Athletic Meet will be a keen contest
With the revival of the saints Quadrangular Athletic meet in 2015, much interest has been created in improving the standard of Athletics in the four School- St. Anthony's College, Kandy, St. Benedict's College, St. Joseph's College and St. Peter's College. The 2017 meet at St. Peter's Grounds on 25th and 26th February brings together some of most outstanding schools boy athletes of the present time and also some of younger and older past athletes. However, it would be interested to go back in history and recall some of the stars of yesteryear, who were school boy's heroes at their time.
Of the four schools St. Joseph's College probably has the best record, being a force in the schools athletic scene from 1930s to at least 1960s. Names that came to mind are Norman Mathews, a Champion Miller, A.C Dep and Lucian Dep, Pole Vaulters , in the early ears. In the 1950s and 1960s, Joes were particularly strong with outstanding athletes like Nagalingam Edirisingham, who came from Jaffna becoming the Asian Games High Jump Champion, Long Jumpers like P. Don Victor and Adolf Silva. Adolf was also a fine sprinter and his battles with Darrel Lieverz (Royal College) in Public Schools 200 Meters races are still remembered by the athletes of that era. Later sprinters like Twins Srian and Janaka Perera, Joseph Soysa , Shanthilal Fernando and Neomal Basnayake brought many victories to the Josephians.
The Peterites boasted of some excellent throwers, Ranjith Weerasena, first won the National discuss title as a Schoolboy in 1959 and successfully defended the title for ten consecutive years. During these years Peterites dominated the John Tarbat Schools Athletic Championship. Anton Perera - Public Schools Champion in the Discus, Putt Shot and Javelin events, Royden De Silva, who was probably more renowned as ruggerite and a basketballer. There were also fine runners like Godfrey Goonetilleke and his brother Andrew. The Peterites Golden Era, was probably in the late 1980s going into 1990s with brilliant athletes like Shane De Silva, Nielhaan Samaranayake,- Public schools and National schools champion Athletes. Dinesh Perera who represented the South Asian Games in 4x400 meters relay team and 110 Meters Hurdle Champion Mahesh Perera who was a member of the 1996 Atlantic Olympic Team. Preterites had an unbeatable sprint relay team - Failan Saleem, Roshan Abeygoonawardena, Shane De Silva and Dinesh Perera were the members of the team.
The Kandy Antonians too have a rich history in athletics. In the 1950s, there were some excellent feats at Public schools Meets by Ivan Boteju (220 yards), Jeeva Weerasinghe (440yards) sprinter R.L. Perera and Javelin Thrower Ranjith Samarasekera remained a diehard Antonian right until his demise just last month. Later sprinters Pradeep Waidyaratne , Thusitha Dharmaratne , J.N.L. Jayakody, Maithree Nanayakkara and Mangala Waidyratne, long distance runner S.R.Karunatilleke and Thrower Jackie Robertson brought glory to the school. In more recent times Outstanding Antonian athletes including Ruwan Kalpage (Better known as a Sri Lankan Cricketer), Thrower L.V Ekanayake and Marlon Von Hoght.
The Benedictines really came into the fore in the new Millennium. However there were some excellent individual performers earlier. Hugh De Siva and Jayantha Senevirathne were Public Schools Pole Vault Champions. Godson Perera and and Gordon Dissanyake won 100 yards dash, Jayakumar Perera and Harold Sirisena were Public Schools Javalin Champions. Nihal Soysa won High Jump at Junior Nationals, Ireneus Ferdinandez and Shelton Pietersz were Junior National Champions in 400 Meters. Godfrey Fernando exceled in long jump in 1970s. Prasad Perera won the 800 Meters at the Athletic Nationals. The turn of the Millennium saw the Bens gradually becoming a force to be reckoned with and won their very first major Athletic Trophy, winning the All Island Schools Athletic Championship in 2007 under Raveen Fernando. Currently Benedictines are probably the No :1 in Schools Athletics in Sri Lanka and hold several All Island Schools, Senior Tarbat, Junior Tarbat , Junior Nationals and All Island Relay records.
The meet on the last weekend of February 2017 should be exciting and keenly contested in a spirit of healthy rivalry and good sportsmanship. To add glamour, there will be invitation Relays for Girls and Boys, with leading schools taking part.

Shift to bio mass energy, urges Siyambalapitiya
Fifty percent of the countrys energy consumption could be met using bio mass energy without polluting the environment, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He made these remarks at the opening of a Giliricidia cultivation project in Eppawala and the foundation stone laying ceremony for the dendro power plant to be established in Muwangama, Kurunegala on Sunday.
This project will be executed as a joint project with the participation of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and Power and the Renewable Energy Ministry. The minister said 40 percent of the import expenditure of the country includes the expenses incurred to acquire coal and fuel from overseas.
We have to focus on alternative energy sources such as Gliricidia bio mass power generation to reduce this expenditure. Therefore, the project of cultivating Gliricidia plants in over 2,000 hectares will form the basis to generate dendro power within the country, he said.
Siyambalapitiya said dendro power plants would be established island wide.
The public will also be able to contribute for the expansion of dendro power within the country by means of self employment, he added.

Sri Lanka and Australia: A winning partnership
Sri Lanka and Australia have enjoyed solid bilateral ties for seven decades, having established diplomatic relations in January 1947, well before Sri Lanka gained independence. It is an event worth celebrating. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe begins a four day official visit to Australia today, where he will hold talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and will highlight the close affinity between the two nations.
Regardless of the political parties and personalities in power in both countries, this special relationship has gone from strength to strength. This strong relationship is founded on the shared history of cooperation in areas such as education (dating back to the Colombo Plan of 1950s), trade and investment, culture and development as well as links through the Commonwealth.
Sri Lanka and Australia share an eternal passion for cricket, which is the most popular sport in both countries. All Lankans remember with gratitude the support extended by Australia to Sri Lanka to gain Test status in 1981. From the stunning World Cup victory over Australia in 1996 to the Shane-Murali trophy, the cricket rivalry between the two countries will endure the test of time. In fact, the Premiers visit will coincide with the Sri Lankan teams T20 Series with Australia starting in Melbourne on February 17.
Sri Lankans have another reason for their affinity to Australia. Practically every Sri Lankan has a friend or relative who is either studying or living in Australia. There are more than 100,000 Sri Lankans permanently domiciled in Australia, mostly in the major cities such as Melbourne and Sydney. Australia has been an attractive destination for legal migration for young Sri Lankan families and every year, hundreds of Sri Lankans with professional skills take up permanent residency Down Under.
Unfortunately, Australia is also a magnet for illegal economic migrants from many countries in Asia. A few years ago, hundreds of such migrants undertook a dangerous sea voyage from Sri Lanka in rickety boats with the aim of reaching Australian shores. Most of them were rounded up before reaching Australian waters. The Navies/Coastguards of Sri Lanka and Australia worked with the International Organisation on Migration (IOM) to stem this tide and now it is unheard of. The Australian Government regularly runs TV and press advertisements in the two vernacular languages warning would-be illegal migrants that they will not be able to enter Australia illegally. However, both countries should be able to work out a formula where Australia opens up more legal employment and migration opportunities for Sri Lankans.
Both countries should also strive to improve people-to-people contact between the two nations. On average, 75,000 Australians visit Sri Lanka every year. There is a potential for increasing this number to at least 100,000, but the lack of a direct air link between the two countries is a problem. We hope Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will bring this matter up during his talks with the Australian authorities.
Direct flights to Sydney and Melbourne will see a dramatic surge in visitor arrivals at either end. SriLankan Airlines, which has operated to Australia earlier, must explore the possibility of starting direct flights, along with its Oneworld Alliance partner Qantas. Direct flights will obviate the need to change planes at Singapore Changi/Kuala Lumpur/Hong Kong and reduce travel time by several hours.
Trade relations between two countries must improve vastly. Two-way trade has grown strongly at 9.5 per cent year-on-year to A$ 951 million (2015). In 2015, Australias investments in Sri Lanka totaled A$ 47 million. These figures are encouraging, but more needs to be done. The Premiers interactions with the Australian business community will hopefully translate into solid investments.
Education plays a significant role in Australias bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka. Australia is the second most popular tertiary study destination for international students originating from Sri Lanka with around 6,000 Sri Lankan students studying in Australia in 2016. This has also become a pathway for legal migration to Australia for Sri Lankans.
Sri Lanka and Australia have unique ecosystems that have evolved over millennia thanks to relative geographical isolation. The two countries can learn from each other when it comes to nature conservation. Both countries also have indigenous populations  Wanniyela Aththo (Sri Lanka) and Aborigines (Australia). This is another sphere that they can cooperate on.
Here in Sri Lanka, we generally include Australia in the broad category of the Northern Hemisphere Western nations, but in reality most Australians (and New Zealanders too) like to align themselves with Asia. There is a debate whether Australia, the island continent, is geographically a part of Asia because it is so close to Asian countries such as Indonesia. But politically, economically and socially, Australia is much closer to Asia than to any other geopolitical bloc. Both countries can play a leading role in defining the future of the Asia Pacific region, the fastest developing region in the world.

Sri Lanka High Commission celebrates 69th anniversary of Independence in Canberra
The Sri Lanka High Commission in Australia celebrated the 69th anniversary of Independence on February 4 at the High Commission premises with the participation of over 300 Sri Lankans in Canberra.
After the hoisting of the National Flag by High Commissioner Skandakumar, schoolchildren supported by adults sang the National Anthem in Sinhala and Tamil which was followed by two minutes silence to honour all those who sacrificed their lives for the Independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
Clergy representing the Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islam faiths, invoked blessings on the people of Sri Lanka.
Thereafter, the National Day messages of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister MangalaSamaraweera were read out.
Addressing the gathering, High Commissioner Skandakumar said that the messages explicitly outlined the national unity government's vision for the ensuing year.
He thanked the community for their participation at all events conducted by the Mission and recalled that the success of the Sri Lankan festival held at the Mission on November 12, 2016 was an indication of what was possible when we came together and supported each other.
He reflected on the commendable cross nation walk a few years ago from South to North that enabled a cancer hospital to be built in Tellipalai and an identical initiative by equally dedicated Sri Lankans of all ethnicities and religious faiths who covered over 600 kilometres on October 2016, to raise funds for a similar facility in the South.
These projects, he said, underlined the true meaning of unity and reconciliation and impacted our people deeply.
The High Commissioner related an incident associated with that walk where a disabled beggar seated on the road with crutches by his side, donated his day's collection to the project, touching the hearts of all.
All of these, he said, remind us that we are indeed a nation of caring and compassionate people and expressed the hope that a year from now when we celebrate our 70th year of Independence, we can each look back on the preceding 12 months and say with conviction that we did make a sincere contribution to the government's pledge for peace, and reconciliation.

Sri Lanka SOE borrowings deteriorate

Sri Lankas state owned enterprise borrowings have started to rise steadily from September 2016, which usually points to a deterioration in their finances, with December borrowings spiking sharply, official data shows.
The central government, private sector and SOEs together borrowed Rs116.5 billion from the banking system in December, up from Rs92.6 billion in November.
Private sector borrowings were Rs78.7 billion, slightly down from Rs81.2 billion a month earlier, and were in line with the levels seen earlier. Central bank credit (printed money) was also down to Rs413 billion from Rs417.3 billion by end-December. Although statistics show Central Bank credit down by year end, barely two days later, a large volume of government debt was repaid with printed money, causing liquidity to surge in the banking system and de-stabilising the monetary system. Central government borrowings from the banking system were low during the last quarter, before the printed money surge on January 02. Sri Lanka lost forex reserves on a net basis in January.
State enterprises that were paying back debt on a net basis up to September 2016 have been borrowings since then.
SOE borrowings fell from Rs527.6 billion in January 2016 to Rs441.5 billion in September amid low oil prices. But oil prices, which fell as low as $38 a barrel, have since moved back to above $53 a barrel.
The rupee has also continued to depreciate, in recent months like in the high inflation 1980s, fuelling a vicious cycle of inflation and energy SOE losses and credit demand, which can put further pressure on the credit system. ECONOMYNEXT

Tao first visited Sri Lanka in 1940 at age 24, when working with the China South West Transport unit in Rangoon, he was offered a choice of Sri Lanka, Singapore or Calcutta for an R&R break. He chose to come to Sri Lanka and left with a most favorable impression of the people and the country.
In 1958, he commenced his business association with Sri Lanka dealing in commodities with the Ceylon Food Commissioner's office.
In the 1970's, he assisted Sri Lanka to establish the Ceylon National Shipping Corporation when he sold one ship, Lanka Rani, on credit to the Shipping Corporation. He would later receive as payment in lieu, a 20% equity share in the Colombo Dockyard.
Tao's confidence in Sri Lanka has always been rooted in the potential of the country's geographical location as a vital maritime transshipment and distribution hub combinedwith the high literacy and ambition of its people.

In 2005, another opportunity arose in Havelock City, an ambitious mega mixed- use development project, conceived and developed during the most volatile times.
At 100 years of age, he officiated at a Groundbreaking ceremony for the Havelock City commercial development after the successful completion of 450 residential apartments with ongoing development of a further 650 homes.
Tao has a deep-seated vision for Sri Lanka that secures a prosperous future for generations to come. He remains confident in Sri Lanka's pivotal role as an essential staging point in China's one road one belt strategy which will bring about transformative opportunities for the people of Sri Lanka, with their natural flair and skills in technology, to transition towards a service intensive economy and prosperity.
Latterly, especially amidst the apparent chaos in the Western world, Tao is even more resolute in his conviction in making long term investments in Sri Lanka for future generations of stakeholders.
Throughout his business career spanning some 80 years Tao has always maintained that in business there is no charity. Sri Lanka is poised for great success and prosperity.

Trump travel ban, opportunity for IT, techno industry

The proposed travel ban and work visa restrictions in USA if imposed by President Donald Trump, could turn out to be a golden opportunity for the IT and techno industry,Virtusa Chairman Kris Canekeratne said in Colombo yesterday.
He said that the ban if imposed would mean that fewer foreigners would be working in USA and some of the existing foreign employees may have to exit USA. However unlike other fields of businesses, US companies will need the services of IT professionals for their companies. Demand for technology services cannot be fulfilled by US labour within the United States.
This means they will reach out for talented technology professionals globally in Techno and IT fields. If this happens both Sri Lanka and Indian companies would get more businesses as work will shift out of America.
He said that in addition they will also get opportunities in Japan and Europe.
Canekeratne said that VirtusaPolaris, following its acquisition of Chennai-based IT firm Polaris is now looking at a major expansion in the next three years. This means that more centers will be opened and more than 3,000 new jobs would be created in both India and Sri Lanka.
He said that due to high mobility use today the world is going through the fourth industrial revolution which was revealed at the last World Economic Forum. One of the key drivers of this is mobility.
He said that due to companies switching on to mobility and use of computers new areas of opportunity has been created to provide security for online transactions, clouds and storing of date. He also said that today there are over abundance of assets in the world and he sighted UBER, Air B&B, Venmore as examples.
He also said that they also recognize and promote staffers especially in their Fintech Lab who come out with new ideas and innovation. This is how we have developed a system in USA where farmers could hire tractors for long term use from banks on lease.
The tractor is equipped with tracking divers and sensors and as soon as the lease lapses the tractor too would be immobilized.
This is also a clear example of making use of abundance of assets. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $217.2 million, an increase of 3.4% sequentially and 44.2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue increased 4.2% sequentially and 48.6% year-over-year. . This is very much higher than the global industry growth which was flat in 2016, Virtusa Vice President Madu Ratnayake said.

This investment is our foremost penetration into hydro-power related projects. Despite its electricity generation being primarily run by hydro-power, Sri Lanka still has vast untapped potential in the capacity of utilising hydro energy due to its abundance of lakes, rivers, and streams.
This is the primary main reason behind our focus. This initial project paves the way for more investments to be channeled towards the development of hydro power, Zero Plus Director and CEO Keiichiro Yatomi said.
TAD Lanka Investments is proud to be a part of this vital hydro-power project which is an indispensable requirement due to the power crisis faced by us as Sri Lankans. This investment, which is an introductory venture, opens more avenues for the promotion of sustainable energy projects by a host of other Japanese Investors of TAD, TAD Lanka Investments Director and CEO Atheeq Ansar said.

VK Sasikala Convicted In Corruption Case By Supreme Court: 10 Facts

The Supreme Court has held VK Sasikala, AIADMK chief, guilty of helping former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa amass illicit wealth worth over 60 crores in the 1990s and has convicted her. Sasikala will have to surrender immediately and will send to jail. This puts an end to her claim to be Tamil Nadu's next chief minister - she cannot hold public office or contest elections for the period of her jail term and six years after that.
Here are the 10 latest developments of this big story:
There ismassive security at key places in Chennailike Sasikala's Poes Garden residence and the Raj Bhawan where the Governor lives. About 15,000 cops have been posted across the city and the police have arrested thousands to prevent trouble.
Ahead of the Supreme Court verdict, Sasikala, 61, spent the night at the five-star Golden Bay Resort resort in Mahabalipuram, 80 km from Chennai, along with about 120 legislators whom she has sequestered for almost a week.
Sasikala's claim to the Chief Minister's post was challenged by interim Chief MinisterO Panneerselvam, who took charge of the state after J Jayalalithaa died in December.
He could now be invited by the state's Governor to prove he has majority support in the assembly.
Panneerselvam had alleged that Sasikala has held MLAs "captive" at the resort and that they will vote for him if "set free and allowed to decide."
Nine legislators including a minister have joined Team Panneerselvamover the last few days, two of them since last night.
Both Sasikala and Panneerselvam met Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao last week and presented their claim to take a trust vote ahead of the other. He was reportedly waiting for the Supreme Court verdict in the corruption case.
A trial court had convicted Jayalalithaa andVK Sasikalaand sentenced them each to four years in jail.
Both spent a few months in jail before the Karnataka High Court overturned the trial court order acquitting them.
The Karnataka government had appealed against the acquittal and the top court had reserved verdict in June last year.

## Title: World Bank asked to apologise to Bangladesh

World Bank asked to apologise to Bangladesh

Law Minister Anisul Huq has asked the World Bank to apologise to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for bringing charges of corruption in the Padma Bridge project.
He raised the demand during a discussion in Parliament on Sunday after a Canadian court acquitted three business executives of charges of planning to bribe Bangladeshi officials to get the Padma Bridge job.
He also said legal steps could be taken against the World Bank over the incident.
An enormous pressure mounted on Bangladesh when the World Bank brought the allegation, setting conditions and forcing Bangladesh to investigate the complaint.
Senior government officials, including the then bridges secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, were arrested and communications minister Syed Abul Hossain had to step down. PMs Adviser Moshiur Rahman was also sent on forced leave.
The investigation by Bangladeshs Anti-Corruption Commission found no proof of the allegation brought by the World Bank.
The World Bank, however, rejected Bangladeshs findings and withdrew the funds it had promised for the project. Bangladesh is now building the bridge with its own money.Now Canada has also found the evidence as speculation and rumour.
Following the publication of the Canadian court verdict, ruling Awami League leaders have spoken out against the World Bank and the section of media which reported extensively on the issue.
On Sunday, opposition Jatiya Party MP Kazi Firoz Rashid raised the issue in Parliament and demanded the law ministers statement.
The World Bank will have to apologise to Bangladesh, the prime minister and those accused in the case. If they (WB) do not do so, I will ask the finance minister to send a protest note, Huq said.
Huq recalled his experience as the then chief counsel of the ACC when the investigation was under way.He said the World Bank delegation, which was sent to assist the investigation, wanted to do the job itself. But the government refused the proposal.
The World Bank delegation wanted to know why Abul Hossain was not named in the FIR. There was nearly a quarrel. I said everyone would have to accept whatever the investigation finds. We suddenly heard a case was started in Canada, the law minister said.
I have names
After leaving the World Bank option out of the project, Prime Minister Hasina said there had been a conspiracy to stop the global lender from funding the Padma Bridge. (The Padma Bridge is a multipurpose road-rail bridge across the Padma River to be constructed in Bangladesh.)
Law Minister Huq told Parliament that the World Bank delegation, headed by Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, met other Bangladeshis after meeting him.
I have details about whom they had dined with at the World Bank country directors (Robert Zoellicks) house that night after meeting me, Huq said.The MPs then demanded that he make the names public.
I will tell you everything. I have details. But this is not the place to reveal the names, Huq replied Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed proposed to take a thanksgiving motion for the prime minister. We should tell her that she was right, she took the right decision, he said.
Hasina has been blaming Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus for influencing the withdrawal of the funds by the World Bank.Her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has also brought the same allegation after the publication of the Canadian court verdict.
Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury told Parliament: Dr Yunus was behind this.
Tofail slammed Ganaforum President Dr Kamal Hossain for criticising the government for backing Abul Hossain. Jatiya Partys Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu said the local agents of the World Bank should be exposed.
Awami League MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim questioned the spending of Yunus. Syed Abul Hossain, one of the persons hit hardest by the World Bank allegation, has already demanded explanation from the critics, without naming those.Jatiya Party MP Rashid asked the law minister about steps taken against those who damaged the national image.
Those, who raised their voice along with the foreigners over the Padma Bridge and undermined the government, are the enemies of the country. They should face effective measures, said Tofail. CNN
