An outstanding manager and one of the nicest in the game
Graham Taylor will be remembered by many for his unfulfilling spell in charge of England - but by plenty more as an outstanding club manager at Watford and Aston Villa and one of the nicest, most genuine men in the game.
The reaction to Taylors death on Thursday at the age of 72, and the affection expressed for him, was the true measure of his standing inside and outside football. Born in Worksop in Nottinghamshire, Taylor was the son of a journalist and rose to prominence in the game as a manager after retiring as a player with Lincoln City in 1972. He became manager and coach at the club, winning the Fourth Division title with them before moving to Watford in 1977.
It was here, in tandem with his chairman Sir Elton John, that he produced arguably his finest work, taking the club from the Fourth Division to the top flight in the space of five exhilarating years.
Taylor nurtured Watford legends such as Luther Blissett and John Barnes, remarkably finishing second behind Liverpool in their first season at that elite level and reaching the FA Cup final in 1984, where they lost 2-0 to Everton.
Taylor took Watford from the Fourth Division to the First in five seasons in his first spell at the club, and into the Premier League via the play-offs in his second.Sir Elton John posted an Instagram message to pay tribute to his brother. 
Not so long ago he joked with me, with his usual broad smile: You know I have never watched any of that game from that day to this - but I dont need to see it again to know that second goal from Andy Gray was a bloody foul on our goalkeeper Steve Sherwood.
Taylors unlikely partnership with the flamboyant rock star worked against the odds, the managers down-to- earth approach dovetailing with his chairmans lavish lifestyle. They remained friends for life, as demonstrated by Sir Eltons heartfelt tribute.
On trips abroad with when he worked as a BBC Sport pundit, Taylor would gladly tell stories of that partnership, always with a laugh and underlining the genuine affection they shared. Taylors brilliance inevitably attracted attention from elsewhere and, perhaps feeling he had achieved all he could at Vicarage Road, he left for Aston Villa in May 1987.
Villa were in reduced circumstances having been relegated to the second flight. Taylor soon put that right by winning promotion in his first season - and, not content with that, rebuilt the club with such success and shrewd management that he took them to second place behind Liverpool in 1990.
Taylors methods were tried and trusted and yet he often received criticism for what his detractors perceived as long ball football. He, with much justification, pointed out his willingness to use wingers and flair players such as Barnes and the young Mo Johnston, whom he brought to England from Partick Thistle. England inevitably looked in Taylors direction after Sir Bobby Robson left following the 1990 World Cup in Italy, where his side lost to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final.
This was, without doubt, the darkest and most frustrating period of Tayors career and is one of the reasons his other work has been so criminally underrated over the years.
Taylor took over at a tough time after the loss of England mainstays such as goalkeeper Peter Shilton and past captains such as Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He gave players like Alan Shearer and Martin Keown their first England caps - but he drew criticism for selecting players many simply felt were not international class, such as Carlton Palmer.
England reached Euro 92 in Sweden under Taylor but produced a series of disappointing performances, going out at the group stage after losing 2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm.
Taylor courted controversy and criticism in that decisive game by substituting England captain and main marksman Gary Lineker for Arsenal striker Alan Smith with a goal still needed - it never arrived and Lineker never played for England again. The manager was vilified and lampooned as a turnip in the Sun newspaper. The campaign to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994 also ended in failure, and was brutally chronicled in the fly-on-the-wall documentary The Impossible Job, which gave an intimate insight into the pressures Taylor was under. Those struggles were illustrated starkly in the game that effectively sealed his fate, the 2-0 loss to the Netherlands in Rotterdam.
The tortured Taylor is seen on the sidelines pleading with officials after Ronald Koeman somehow escaped a red card for a foul on Englands David Platt, only to be reprieved and score the brilliant free-kick that sent the Dutch on the way to victory.
He resigned the following month and stayed out of the game until returning at Wolves in March 1994. During his spell in charge he took them into the second-tier play-offs in 1994-95, where they lost to Bolton Wanderers. Taylor left in November 1995 before returning to revisit old glories. Sir Elton John was back at the helm at Watford so it was no surprise when he turned to Taylor to come back to Vicarage Road as general manager in February 1996.
It was once more the perfect fit and he was back as manager a year later, winning the third-tier title in 1998 before putting Watford in the Premier League at the end of the following season after a play-off final victory over Bolton.
Watford, despite an early win at Liverpool, were relegated and the following season Taylor decided to retire - only to change his mind and make a comeback at Villa in February 2002. He retired for a second and final time after they struggled the following season. It was the end of one chapter and the start of another as Taylor became a respected pundit on BBC Radio 5 live, a role he performed with total assurance and perception.
Taylor was part of the radio team that covered England. It was a sign of the esteem in which he was held by fans as well as players that whenever he encountered supporters abroad, he was treated with complete respect.
There was barely a reference from England followers to any of his struggles in charge of the national team. To them, Taylor was a true gentleman, to be given his due not just for his work but for his warm personality and willingness to discuss football matters with anyone he met. He may have operated at the highest level but he never talked down to supporters and was always interested in how they viewed the game. As a BBC Sport colleague, Taylor was unfailingly co-operative and the consummate professional, willing to take a call at any time, even when he was meant to be spending time with his beloved wife Rita. And as well as a fount of knowledge and a man with strong opinions, Taylor was also an endless source of entertainment and stories, just as happy to poke fun at himself as everyone else.
Graham Taylor was a top-class manager at club level and a true gentleman inside and outside of football. He will be greatly missed and perhaps now his work in management, viewed through the prism of this sad news, will finally get the credit it fully deserves.

Australian Open: Hallucinations, long nights and happiness
The searing heat sometimes makes players hallucinate, the night sessions oftengo into the early morning hours -- and one tennis superstar calls it the HappySlam.
Staged near the center of Melbourne's buzzing downtown, the season-openingAustralian Open is unlikely any of the sport's other three majors.Starting Monday, fans will see top players like Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal hit the comeback trail, while Andy Murray and Novak Djokovicwill resume their battle for the No. 1 ranking.
Here are five things to look out for in the two-week tournament:
1. It's hot but ...
Unfolding during the Australian summer, temperatures often soar. Three yearsago, the thermometer hit nearly 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit).One player, Canada's Frank Dancevic, said he glimpsed the cartoon character Snoopy while hallucinating in a first-round match against Benoit Paire. Dancevic passed out but somehow finished the contest.Until somebody dies, they're going to keep playing matches in this heat ... and personally I don't think it's fair, he fumed.
After that 2014 tournament, in which a record nine players withdrew during thefirst round and one of the ball boys fainted, organizers subsequently changed their Extreme Heat policy.
Despite the headlines the heat intermittently creates, Melbourne's weather canbe notoriously fickle. Even in the summer, the saying goes that one canexperience four seasons in a day -- temperatures can vary wildly from day to day.
Regardless, Federer has said more than once that the players should just get onwith it.If you've trained hard enough your entire life or the last few weeks and if you believe you can come through it, there's no reason you can't, Federer said atthe 2014 Australian Open. Just deal with it, because it's the same for bothplayers.
If you can't deal with it, throw in the towel.' So what does this month hold According to a forecast from the tournament's meteorologist last month, therewon't be consistent, scorching heat.
We are expecting a very pleasant period weather-wise for Australian Open 2017,Bob Leighton said in a news release.
Daily maximum temperatures for the second half of January are predicted to bearound the low to mid 20s, and there could be three or four days in the 30s,with the possibility of one day in the high 30s.
The US Open -- where high temperatures regularly mingle with high humidity --could be the most punishing grand slam from start to finish.
2. Downtown buzz
Located in southeast Australia, Melbourne has been voted the most liveable city by the Economist six years running, with culture and environment one category assessed by the magazine.
If players are keen to explore its diverse, often buzzing downtown core, they'renot far away -- it's a short walk from Rod Laver Arena.
A roughly 15-minute stroll from the tournament takes you to Federation Square, which often houses major events and is a general hangout area for tourists and Melburnians alike. Melbourne's main train station Flinders Street is nearby,too.
That isn't the case at the French Open and Wimbledon -- situated in southwestParis and southwest London, respectively. The US Open, meanwhile, takes place in the borough of Queens, far from bustling
Manhattan. Reaching Flushing Meadows from Manhattan, where most players stay during the event, is 40 minutes by car -- without traffic. Right beside Rod Laver Arena is the MCG -- Melbourne Cricket Ground -- the city's top-rated sight on Tripadvisor.
3. A night session -- every day
The US Open is famous for its night matches: New Yorkers can get loud, raunchyand raucous, holding nothing back. But the Australian Open has the US Open beat in the sheer number of night
sessions. Unlike in New York, matches are scheduled at night every day of the fortnight, including both singles finals.
The latest finish in grand slam history came in Melbourne, not Flushing Meadows,when home favorite Lleyton Hewitt beat 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis in a five-set marathon at 4:34 a.m. nine years ago.
Hewitt and Baghdatis only began their match at about 10 minutes to midnight because earlier in the day Federer needed four and a half hours on the same court to dispatch Janko Tipsarevic. They also had to wait for the conclusion of Venus Williams clash with Sania Mirza -- the first night match on center that day.
Two paid sessions per day on most days on Rod Laver Arena helped the tournament draw a record 720,363 spectators in 2016, about 30,000 more than the US Open.
4. It has a nickname
The Australian Open can lay claim to being known as the Happy Slam. It was none other than Federer who coined the expression.
You get here and are happy to play again, he told reporters in Australia in 2007. Players are refreshed after the off-season, not weighed down by eight months of wear and tear and traveling like when they arrive at the US Open.
The players have also long lauded the tournament's transport system and facilities. Europe-based pros celebrating the Christmas holidays at home can escape chilly climes once the new year comes and soak up the atmosphere in Australia, where children are still on summer holidays.
5. Nowhere has more roofs
Melbourne Park features stadiums with not one, not two, but three retractable roofs -- easily bettering the other majors.
Wimbledon and the US Open have cover on one court, while the French Open has none and was criticized > again - in 2016 when rain deeply affected the year's second grand slam.
Australian Open organizers added the third roof, on Margaret Court Arena, in time for the 2015 tournament.

## Title: Boost for foreign investment

Boost for foreign investment
The Government has placed emphasis on trade and foreign investment to boost the economy, instead of relying on loans and grants. The latter are anyway in short supply as Sri Lanka is now in the Middle Income category. It is always better to rely in trade and investment  reckless borrowing at commercial rates by the previous Government has placed Sri Lanka in a massive debt trap. It will take decades to repay these loans, some of which have been taken for useless vanity projects that just perpetuate the Rajapaksa name.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is often the best way to stimulate an economy. Just a couple of days ago, Swiss food giant Nestle started work on a Rs.5 billion manufacturing plant in Pannala, their long-time local base. Several such mega projects are now underway in various parts of the country, under the Governments new three-year plan for a sustainable economy.
But we often tend to overlook one important category  the individual foreign investor. They are usually high networth individuals who have investments in various countries. The Government has expressed its keenness to attract this type of investor as well and revealed a sound proposal. Resident visas from two to five years would be granted to foreigners who make a minimum investment of US$ 300,000 in Sri Lanka, Finance Minister Ravi Karunananyake has said.
The Finance Minister says the Government will also grant tax concessions and extension of visas to foreign investors who invest over US$ 1.5 million. It is a commendable move, given that investors would like to have unhindered access to their investments here without undergoing separate immigration procedures every time they arrive in the country.
We are somewhat late to this party, with several countries in region including Malaysia offering similar programmes. Malaysias My Second Home programme, renowned throughout the world, offers long-term visas to foreigners who invest in their country. Many Sri Lankans too have obtained this facility from Malaysia. In some countries, the investor can directly apply for citizenship (not just a resident visa) under a Citizenship by Investment programme. Among the countries that offer this facility are Portugal, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Hungary, Dominica and Malta. In some countries, an investment of just US$ 100,000 in funds or real estate is adequate to gain a resident visa or citizenship (passport) in just three months. Portugal alone has issued over 2,000 residency visas in just two years.
The Government should advertise this programme through the proper channels and websites dedicated to such Golden Visas. There is enough demand for this type of investment, but the authorities should ensure that no attempt is made to launder money by any individual. Last years Panama papers scandal revealed how the super-rich and corrupt politicians park their money in other countries through shell companies. There shall necessarily be a selection process which will help identify any such attempts.
The government has also promised to relax exchange control regulations though a regulatory mechanism will be in place when foreign exchange is taken out of the country in bulk form. This is the norm even in developed countries  individual travellers have to declare sums over US$ 10,000 if brought in or taken out. Apart from that regulation, the overall forex regulations could be eased to a great extent. This is a move in the right direction, because some of the forex regulations are archaic and serve no useful function in a modern economy. More investors are likely to come to Sri Lanka if the forex regulations are eased.
Injecting cash through commercial banks is just one form of investment. Among the other options are the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and Governments Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds. Foreigners are highly active at the CSE, which shows its value as an investment option. These options give more flexibility and choice to would-be investors who are wary of putting all their eggs into one basket and will also help Sri Lanka gain a reputation as a multi-track investment destination. These measures will help reduce debts and increase investments and thereby help market Sri Lanka as an Investment Destination. This is also a golden opportunity for Sri Lankans domiciled abroad to contribute to their Motherlands socio-economic development. The Lankan Diaspora in most countries includes influential and affluent individuals who would like to contribute in some way towards the countrys development. Unlike other foreigners they can apply for dual citizenship, but even if they do not want to do so, they can still gain a better opportunity to serve the Motherland under the new foreign investment programmes. They will then feel very much at home.
The authorities should evolve innovative approaches to seeking FDI, holding more roadshows in prominent capitals. Red tape, lethargy and corruption must disappear completely, lest the investors turn back in disgust. There is fierce competition out there in our region and beyond for investor dollars and we should not let this opportunity slip by.

## Title: BUMPY YEAR AHEAD

BUMPY YEAR AHEAD
This will be a year like no other, as there will be a thunderous clash of policies, economies and politics worldwide. We should prepare for the challenges ahead and not be only spectators
The new year has dawned. Everyone agrees 2017 will be very interesting.
It will also be most problematic. From politics to economics and finance, well be on a roller-coaster ride.
With his extreme views and bulldozing style, President-elect Donald Trump is set to create an upheaval, if not revolution, in the United States and the world.
He is installing an oil company chief as the Secretary of State, investment bankers in key finance positions, climate sceptics and anti-environmentalists in environmental and energy agencies and an extreme rightwing internet media mogul as his chief strategist.
US-China relations, the most important for global stability, could change from big-power co-existence, with a careful combination of competition and cooperation, to outright crisis.
Trump, through his phone call with the Taiwanese president and after, signalled he could withdraw the longstanding US adherence to the One China policy and instead use Taiwan as a negotiating card in overall relations with China. The Chinese perceive this as an extreme provocation.
US trade policies
He has appointed as head of the new National Trade Council an economist known for his many books demonising China, including Death by China: Confronting the Dragon.
Trump seems intent on doing an about-turn on US trade policies. Measures being considered include a 45% duty on Chinese products, extra duties and taxes on American companies located abroad, and even a 10% tariff on all imports.
Thus 2017 will see protectionism rise in the United States, the extent still unknown. That is bad news for many developing countries whose economies have grown on the back of exports and international investments.
Europe in 2017 will also be preoccupied with its own regional problems. The Brexit shock of 2016 will continue to reverberate and other countries facing elections will be less open to the world and become more inward-looking.
As protectionism, xenophobia and narrow nationalism grow in Western societies, Asian countries should devise development strategies based more on domestic and regional demand and investments.
2017 may be the year when resource-rich China, with its development banks and its Belt and Road Initiative, fills in the economic void created by Western trade and investment protectionism.
But this may not be sufficient to prevent a finance shock in many developing countries now beginning to suffer a reversal of capital flowing back to the United States, attracted by the prospect of higher interest rates and economic growth.
In 2017 Malaysia will be among the countries most vulnerable to this, due to the large foreign ownership of local bonds and shares.
As capital flows out and the currency depreciates further, the affected countries companies will have to pay more for servicing loans contracted in foreign currencies and imported machinery and parts, while consumers grumble about the rising cost of living.
On the positive side, exporters will earn more in local currency terms and tourism will increase, but this may not be enough to offset the negative effects.
Thus 2017 will not be kind to the economy, business and the pockets of the common man and woman. It might even spark a new financial crisis.
The old year ended with mixed blessings for Palestinians. On one hand, they won a significant victory when the outgoing President Barack Obama allowed the adoption of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories by not exercising a veto.
Big obstacle to peace talks
The resolution will spur international actions against the expansion of settlements which have become a big obstacle to peace talks.
On the other hand, the Israeli leadership, which responded defiantly with plans for more settlements, will find in Trump a much more sympathetic president. He is appointing a pro-Israel hawk as the US ambassador to Israel.
With Trump also indicating he will tear up the nuclear power deal with Iran, the Middle East will have an even more tumultuous time in 2017.
The commencement of floods in some parts of Malaysia during the holiday season, ironically following days of the taps going dry for millions in the Klang Valley, is a prelude to the environment continuing to be a critical issue in 2017.
Unfortunately, low priority is given to the environment. Hundreds of billions of dollars are allocated for highways, railways and urban buildings but only a trickle for conservation and rehabilitation of hills, watersheds, forests, mangroves, coastal areas, biodiversity or for serious climate change actions.
2017 should be the year when priorities change, that when people talk about infrastructure or development, they put actions to protect and promote the environment as the first items for allocation of funds.
This new year will also be make-or-break for climate change.
The momentum for action painfully built up in recent years will find a roadblock in the United States as the new president dismantles Obama-initiated policies and measures.
But Trump and his team will face resistance domestically, including from state governments and municipalities that have their own climate plans, and from other countries determined to carry on without the United States on board.
Global and national economies
Indeed, if 2017 will bring big changes initiated by the new US administration, it will also generate many counter-actions to fill in the void left in the world by a withdrawing United States or to counter its new unsettling actions.
There are opportunities to think through alternatives and reforms that are needed on global and national economies, on the environment and on geo-politics.
Most of the main levers of power and decision-making are still in the hands of a few countries and a few people, but there has also been the emergence of many new centres of economic, environmental and intellectual capabilities and community-based organising.
2017 will be a year in which ideas, policies, economies and politics will clash, thunderously, and we should be prepared for the challenges ahead, not just be spectators.

Canadian Eugenie Bouchard not listening to haters
SYDNEY Jan13: Canadian starlet Eugenie Bouchard says she has learnt to take no notice of the haters, revealing she has spoken with fellow young gun Nick Kyrgios on how to handle the intense scrutiny.
Despite a slump in form, she and the Australian are two of the sports hottest drawcards, with both having to deal with a spotlight on their professional and private lives.
Bouchard, on the comeback trail after her high-flying career plunged into a tailspin, said being seen as one of the most marketable players on tour could be a hard ask.
She has discussed the burden of expectations with the brash Kyrgios, tipped as a future Grand Slam champion but who has polarised opinion with his on-court antics.
Yeah, we have spoken about it a little bit, she said in the Sydney Morning Herald Friday. We just came to the conclusion that haters are going to hate and we werent going to listen to them.
Its really important to not listen to those people. Why would you not do something because of somebody elses opinion of you. Do you know what I mean If you think about it, its actually crazy. Why should I allow somebody else to dictate my life Thats Nicks attitude as well and I think thats really cool. I respect that. Bouchard became one of the most bankable assets in womens tennis in 2014 when she stormed to the Wimbledon final as well as the semi-finals of the Australian and French Opens.
But the confident, charismatic 22-year-old then saw her career nosedive in 2015 and her ranking slump. Now 49 in the world, she reached her first semi-final for 10 months at the Sydney International this week, before losing to Britains Johanna Konta.
She said it was a good step in the right direction ahead of the Australian Open Grand Slam next week, where all eyes will again be on the Quebec native.

China poised to take greater responsibilities on global security
China in a white paper on policies related to Asia Pacific security on Friday said that the country is prepared to take on greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia- Pacific region and the world at large.
The white paper said China will increase military exchanges and cooperation, which would support peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China will build a strong national defense force that is commensurate with Chinas international standing.
The white paper on policies related to Asia-Pacific security cooperation, which also clarified the nations stance on issues of regional concern.
The white paper was released by the State Council Information Office.
Outlining Chinas concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, the white paper explained the Chinese approach to achieving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
The policy package includes the promotion of common development; the building of partnerships; improvement of existing multilateral frameworks; rule-setting; military exchanges; and proper settlement of differences.
Noting the role that major countries in the region play in maintaining peace and development, the white paper urged them to reject the Cold War mentality, respect others legitimate interests and concerns and to pursue positive interactions.
Small and medium-size countries need not and should not take sides among big countries, the white paper said. All countries should work toward a new dialogue system instead of confrontation, and pursue partnerships rather than alliances, according to the white paper.
China said it supported the creation of international and regional rules set through discussion with all countries concerned rather than being dictated by any particular country.
Rules of individual countries should not automatically become international rules; and countries should not be allowed to violate the lawful rights and interests of others under the pretext of rule of law, according to the white paper.
China is prepared to take on greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, it said.

Country braces for severe drought
The next three months will have Sri Lanka facing one of the worst droughts never seen in the last 30-40 years.
The Meteorology Department predicted below average rain fall in the next three months and this has exacerbated an already precarious situation. In 2016, we only had 70 percent of the rain expected for that year, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said.
Though there was some rain in May and November, it was less than average and it didnt make up for the loss, Minister Yapa said. The minister was addressing a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
He added that the Met Department expects the rains to come by mid March.
The low rainfall has triggered a series of other catastrophes in the country dealing a severe blow to food production and power generation in 2017.
The President appointed a Cabinet Sub Committee at the end of December with all the ministries concerned and we are working with all the international agencies and other organisations to monitor the situation and deal with problems in a faster and more effective manner,the minister added.
Information being collected from all ministries had revealed that most main irrigation tanks were up to 27 percent capacity while 220 medium size tanks were at 30 percent capacity, he said.
In addition, this year, only one third of all agricultural lands were planted which meant that there would be less food produced during the Yala season with effects spilling over to Maha, Minister Yapa said.
We have also had less than 35 percent of the rice fields sowed in the main rice belts of the country,Yapa said and added that the government had decided to import 250MT of rice into the country to meet demand. The ministry has as of now identified the 13 districts, namely, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Hambantota, Monaragala, Kurunegala, Puttlam, Trincomalee, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Batticoloa and Mullaitivu as the most vulnerable and ministry officials have been sent there to work with other government officials and identify areas in need. Certain areas will also have water scheduled for irrigation stopped as it would be diverted for drinking purposes.
Met Department Director K.H.S Premalal said that there would be less than average rains in January and February and that hope lay in the first inter monsoonal rains in mid March.
He also explained that the recent cold spell experienced across the country was due to dry cold winds blowing from India. December- January are generally cool months but this time, the dry and cold winds from the North are driving down temperatures and in certain areas like Kandy there has been a cooling down of 5 degrees.
The winds have also led to less cloud formation and that is worsening the chances of rain, Premalal said.
Between 17-18th we expect a change in wind direction and hopefully clouds will form and we will have a greater probability of rain.This however will not be enough to solve the issues of drought, Premalal added.
The Ministry has promised to keep the public updated on the drought situation every week and urged that water and energy be used sparingly in the upcoming months.

CR will have a cake walk against CH today
CR & FC will go out as favourites to overcome the hapless CH and FC side in their second round Dialog A Division league rugby match at CR & FC grounds, Longden Place today commencing 4.00pm.

They may try to give an improved performance through their master craftsman and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa leading them from the front.
The red shirts will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Kandy with dynamic hooker cum rolling maul expert and former Royal College highest try scorer Supun Warnakulasooriya will hold the key for CRs success today but they will miss the services of their dynamic national centre cum play maker Tarinda Ratwatte due a shoulder injury which he sustained during the Kandy game last week.

Discrimination at work: Change in attitude essential
Human beings by nature are of unequal strength, talent and other attributes are clearly not units of equal weight in their societies. The inequalities of nature are reinforced by the social and economic circumstances which as people commence life, place some at an advantage over others. Far greater is the impossibility of preserving general equality for any period, however short. A permanent state of equality is only the remotest dream.
There are two famous legal expressions linked to the concept of equality, namely (1) all persons are equal before the law and (2) all persons are entitled to equal to protection of the law. The expression equal protection of the law is found in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. Article 18 of the 1972 Constitution of Sri Lanka embodied both phrases. The Indian Constitution in terms of Article 14 also uses both expressions. Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contains both expressions. Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also embodies both aspects of the concept of equality.
Equality before the law is the negative aspect implying the absence of any special privilege in favour of any individual and the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law. Equal protection of the law is a more positive concept and implies equality of treatment in similar circumstances. However, it is impossible due to the claims of society itself and of public interest to have absolute equality among all classes. Thus foreign sovereigns and diplomats are entitled to certain immunities.
The varying needs of different classes require separate treatment and the concept of equality does not take away from the State the power of classifying persons for legitimate purposes. The State is therefore permitted to make laws that are unequal and to take unequal administrative action when dealing with persons who are placed in different circumstances and situations. It aims at equality by treatment of equals. Equality can be denied, if government fails to distinguish between persons who for equal protection purposes, should be regarded as differently situated. Equal protection guarantees protection from legislative and executive tyranny and abuse of power by the judicial arm of the government by way of discrimination.
Inequality, per se, does not violate equal protection, for every selection of persons for regulation pronounces inequality in some degree. The inequality to offend the concept must be actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary. A classification having some reasonable basis does not violate this principle merely because in practice, it results in some inequality. It does not forbid reasonable classification. In order to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, viz (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group, and (ii) that the differentia must have a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Act. What is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of the classification and the objects of the law. It is now settled that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination not only by substantive law but also by law of procedure. The law is quite clear that a fundamental law will not be its own sensor. Its sensorial functions are operative only against legislation formed under it. This is an attribute of the sovereign nature of all Constitutions being the Supreme law of the land.
Formal equality and substantive equality
Formal equality is premised on an abstract individual, judged on personal merit. The formal equality insists that group-based characteristics are irrelevant; and seeks to replace their use in allocating decision-making by merit-based criteria. One of the key insights of substantive equality is its departure from the symmetry of formal equality. It is not colour, gender or some other group characteristic per se which is in issue, but the attendant disadvantage, both social and economic. This focus on disadvantage moves the anti-discrimination agenda into areas often inhabited by anti-poverty, welfare, or social exclusion policies. Welfare and anti-poverty strategies necessarily target particular groups, according to their needs.
A key insight of substantive equality is that societal discrimination extends well beyond individual acts of prejudice. To bring about real change, the State should act positively to promote equality. This in turn requires the State to take affirmative action. As Dr. Sen Noble Prize Winner in Economics, argues Equal consideration for all may demand very unequal treatment in favour of the Disadvantaged. Substantive equality entails a duty to provide.
Today it is a well accepted principle, at least in the developing world that what equal protection of the laws seeks is not mathematical equality or formal equality but substantive equality among various groups in society. Formal equality, with its focus on the abstract individual, has failed to address deeply entrenched patterns of social disadvantage. In framing an alternative concept of substantive equality, distributive justice plays a central role. It calls for a duty upon the State to take positive measures to promote equality, including, where appropriate, allocation of resources. But this poses a dilemma for judges grappling with the contested meaning of substantive equality. Resource allocation requires a complex assessment of wide ranging facts and necessitates the setting of priorities and the balancing of interest.
Role of the Courts
Many welfare States make a political commitment to distributive equality by providing for the disadvantaged groups. The political arena is therefore seen as the primary space for developing the positive duty to provide, a space which judges are rightly reluctant to invade. The courts role in applying substantive equality is then limited to scrutinizing the appropriateness of criteria for eligibility for exclusion. But because the aims of substantive equality are broadly in sympathy with provision of benefits, courts have searched for additional criteria, supplementing the grounds prohibited by formal equality, to distinguish appropriateness of criteria for eligibility from inappropriate categorization. The courts should not be substituting their decisions for those of policymakers on resource allocation. Instead, they should be demanding proper democratic accountability. This entails an explanation of the decision which is reasonable and proportionate and is based on evidence rather than generalizations or judicial notice.
In this way the courts contribute to the democratic process both by strengthening accountability and by ensuring that political deliberation includes those who would otherwise be silenced in the political arena. The duty to provide, which constitutes the core of substantive equality, remains a primarily political impetus, unless the States Constitution includes express socio-economic rights or the courts are in a position to imply such rights from civil and political rights. Nevertheless, even in the absence of such rights, courts have a role to play in furthering substantive equality 44. To ensure that substantive equality furthers its aims of addressing disadvantage in society, the courts will need to develop criteria to assess the States policies on resource allocation and the provision of benefits. On the one hand, the tradition of judicial intervention in positive state provision has been detrimental to substantive equality, using negative duties of restraint and formal equality to strike down or subvert positive and social rights.
The Indian Supreme Court in E.P. Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu added a new dimension to Article 14 (right to equality) of the Indian Constitution. The court held that: Equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies: one belongs to the rule of in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14. It further recognized that violation of the principles of administrative law also amount to a violation of the equal protection clause thus giving rise to constitutional remedies in addition to remedies in administrative law. This development took place in Sri Lanka too. The primary goal of the ILO is to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Gender equality is a key element in reaching this goal.
The ILO has promoted of freedom of association, collective bargaining, equality of treatment at work and the abolition of forced labour and child labour as fundamental principles and rights at work over period of time since its inceptions. In recent years, with the globalization and open markets and the threat to worker rights, the international community had felt the need to re-affirm the fundamental and universal character of these principles and rights embodied in the core conventions to ensure social justice and a fairer society.
Equality is a new frontier in judicial activism in Sri Lanka. Social realities have demonstrated, however that equality which the philosophers visualize is not always attainable in practice however sweeping be the pronouncements on equality in the statute book. Many of the discriminations that obtain in society cannot be countered by law alone but need a deep change in social attitudes. However, the attainment of equality is considered to be one of the time - honoured objectives of the law.

European Tour founder Jacobs dead at 91
LONDON: Former Ryder Cup captain and European Tour founder John Jacobs has died at the age of 91.
Jacobs played in the 1955 Ryder Cup and then led the European teams in 1979 and 1981 in the first two competitions to feature a combined side with players from across the continent.

Jacobs took up the role of tournament director-general of the PGA Executive Committee in October 1971 and would go on to establish a Continental Swing which embraced the French, German and Spanish Opens. The Spanish Open became the first official European Tour event in April 1972.
Jacobs was made an OBE in 1997 and in 2000 was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.
Johns legacy to golf is well-documented, Dr Kyle Phillpots, the PGAs executive director told the BBC.
In addition to his accomplishments as a player, coach and administrator, he is the person who made the European Tour happen and he is widely acknowledged as the father of modern golf coaching. Deeply saddened to learn that John Jacobs, founding father of the European Tour has passed away at the age of 91, a post on the European Tours official Twitter account read. AFP

Islandwide drought looms large
An severe drought islandwide similar to experienced during 1974-77 and 1981-83 is expected to grip the country in July 2017.
The Meteorology Department weather experts and Agriculture Department Natural Resources Management Division have issued its predictions forecasting the pattern of the drought, the agriculture authorities told Daily News yesterday.
They said paddy cultivations in the dry zone are going to be badly hit by the drought. At least 280,000 hectares of paddy fields in the dry zone will go out of cultivation due to it.
The authorities said some rice millers have hidden their rice stocks to take advantage of the situation. They have hidden them so that they can release them into the market during the drought and charge exorbitant prices from consumers, an official said.
By refraining from releasing paddy rice into the market, they have created a price increase in rice, he said.
This will not last long. Action is in place to import rice. We have been instructed to import rice to protect consumers from exploitations, he said.
When questioned Deputy Project Director P. N. N. Jayanetti about their drought mitigation preparedness to ensure food security, he said they have devised a strategy in addressing drought vulnerabilities. "Diversification programmes have been launched to minimise crop damage and to ensure availability of crops, he said. Short-term seedlings for paddy will be distributed among farmers to cultivate paddy as per predicted climate conditions. But the harvest will be less than that of the long-term seeds, he said.
Crops such as green gram, cow pea and orid (undu) will be grown to suit to the climatic stimuli or the impact of the drought as part of an adaptation strategy, Jayanetti said. We are going to grow more vegetables in Colombo, Matara and Gampaha areas, he said. As regards irrigation of crops, a water sharing management plan will be under way,
he said. There will be no shortage of rice until the end of May because we have enough stocks. There will be no shortage because we will import rice, he said. Ministry authorities will function from a centre in Kandy to mitigate agriculture issues, he added.

The Foreign Affairs Minister expressed hope that the Commonwealth would continue to fight for the values that have strengthened Sri Lanka in recent times - human rights, rule of law and democracy.
Sri Lanka is currently reviewing a new Constitution to replace the existing 1978 one, and Secretary-General Scotland said the Commonwealth was delighted to give technical assistance to the constitutional realignment to Sri Lanka - particularly to make sure minorities feel represented.
Samaraweera also appraised her of Sri Lankas plans to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to look into the accountability and reparations of events that took place during the countrys civil war.
The Secretary-General spoke of plans to open a Commonwealth Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform to provide all 52-member countries with legal support services and a platform to share ideas and experiences.
She also spoke of establishing a Commonwealth Institute for Digital Health in Colombo  a project that will move forward the commitments of the Colombo Declaration, launched in October last year, to improve health across the Commonwealth.
We have so much in common, so much that binds us together. We have people from nearly all regions of world. We have a third of the worlds population. Together we are so much stronger. We have the opportunity to lead the world on tackling climate change, and on achieving the SDGs, the Commonwealth Secretary-General said.
The Secretary-General also invited Sri Lanka to take part in upcoming Commonwealth initiatives, including activities in the month of March to end violence against women, and a Commonwealth cricket club to teach young people about health, teamwork and math.

More strength for Pakistan, Lanka ties: Navin
Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been maintaining strong and long standing ties, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He said the relationship between the two countries was getting stronger day by day.
"Even though the two countries maintain a cordial relationship in many sectors it is important to note that economic and trade relationship are vital. The Pakistan economy is the second largest economy in the South Asian region, the minister said.
He said the relationship had not reached its peak and much could be done.
The political stability of both countries and the peaceful atmosphere from 2009 in Sri Lanka is the foundation stone for strengthening economic and trade relationships further, the minister said as the Chief Guest at Pakistan Trade Fair at the BMICH yesterday.

Murray, Djokovic face testing draws at Australian Open
MELBOURNE Jan 13: World number one Andy Murray could face challenges from Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka if he is to reach a sixth Australian Open final following Friday's draw.
The Scot, coming off a magnificent 2016 with a second Wimbledon crown, a successful Olympic title defence and the year-end top ranking, has lost five Melbourne finals, four of those to defending champion Novak Djokovic.
Murray, who was knighted in Britain's New Year Honours list, faces Ukraine's Illya Marchenko first up and could meet Japanese fifth seed Nishikori or Swiss legend Roger Federer in the quarters and 2014 winner Wawrinka in the semis.
Federer, seeded 17, faces a qualifier first up and could play 10th seed Tomas Berdych in the third round as he bids to add to his record 17 Grand Slam titles.
Djokovic, in the bottom half of the men's draw as the second seed, has a tough first-round against experienced Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. Verdasco, ranked 40, has beaten Djokovic four times in their 13 encounters and the Serb had to save five match points in prevailing over him earlier this month in the semi-finals in Doha.
Last year Verdasco knocked out compatriot Rafael Nadal in a five-setter first round thriller in Melbourne.
Serbia's Djokovic, bidding for a record seventh Australian Open title, is seeded to face Brisbane International winner Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round and powerful Austrian eighth seed Dominic Thiem in the quarters.
He could then meet Canada's big-serving third seed Milos Raonic in the semi-finals.
Raonic opens against flashy German Dustin Brown while 13th seed and recent Chennai champion Roberto Bautista Agut is a likely fourth-round matchup.
Nadal, who won the 2009 Australian Open and has been in two other Melbourne finals, is seeded nine and is in Raonic's third quarter of the draw and in the bottom half with Djokovic.
The Spanish left-hander could have a third-round clash in store against rising German star Alexander Zverev.
The 24th-seeded Zverev has a string of scalps including two victories over Federer, most recently at this month's Hopman Cup.
Australia's explosive Nick Kyrgios is seeded 14 and opens against Portugal's tricky Gastao Elias and could face Wawrinka in the fourth round.
Former German world number two Tommy Haas, aged 38, is competing in his first tournament since Vienna in October 2015 and will have a first-round match against Frenchman Benoit Paire.
Australian wildcard Thanasi Kokkinakis withdrew before the men's singles draw due to a stomach muscle strain and his spot will be filled by a lucky loser from the qualifying draw. AFP

Obama screwed us, say angry Cuban migrants
PANAMA: Obama has screwed all Cubans, Yadiel Cruz, a Cuban in Panama bitterly told AFP Thursday upon learning the US president has suddenly made it tougher for migrants like him to get into America.
The 33-year-old summed up what many compatriots were feeling as they digested the news in a Catholic shelter in Panama's capital, a waypoint on their overland trek to the United States.
But, he declared, for me, I'm not going back. Around him, dozens of other Cubans expressed sadness or anger.
Much of the fury was directed personally at US President Barack Obama for announcing that he has scrapped, with immediate effect, a 1995 policy that had given near-automatic entry to the US to Cubans who set foot on American soil, regardless of their visa status.
Now, like those who attempted to cross by water, they could face deportation back to Cuba unless they convince US officials they were afraid of being persecuted or had valid humanitarian reasons to be let in.
The move, made just days before Obama leaves office and hands the reins over to Donald Trump, known for his anti-immigration stance, rattled nerves, sparked frustration and evoked tears here.
We feel sadness because we are all coming with a dream that comes from pain, hunger and a lot of work to get this far, said Lorena Pena, a woman four months pregnant who left Cuba with her husband and four-year-old daughter.
Obama, she said, screwed up, because what he's done is hurt us -- so he really isn't as good as everyone says. Ulises Ferrer, a carpenter from Havana, said: We don't know what we're going to do now. But what we're certain of is that we're not going back to Cuba unless we're dead. The shelter they were in, a simple set-up run by the Caritas charity and featuring just one bathroom, is in the Ancon neighborhood of Panama City.
It was established months ago to accommodate some of the stream of Cuban migrants who had been passing through Central America on their way to Mexico and then to the United States.
The Wet foot, Dry foot policy Obama scrapped had meant that many of them felt they were on their way to a new life in America, once they reached the border.
Their destination hasn't changed. But now the reception and easy access they had hoped for is less likely.
If they are accepted into the United States, though, a 1966 law, the Cuban Adjustment Act, is still valid and offers them a fast-track to residency and legal employment.
The Cubans in Panama were on an overland route that has already been used by tens of thousands of others.
The number of migrants from their Communist-ruled island spiked in 2015 and 2016, after Washington and Havana agreed to a thaw in their long hostile relations.
Many of those fleeing feared exactly what came to pass Thursday: that the rapprochement would see the door close on Cuban migrants being given automatic US entry and residency.
The wave of Cubans, along with a decision by Nicaragua to close its border to them, created a backlog in Panama and Costa Rica that prompted both countries last year to try to shut out arriving Cubans. But while numbers have dropped, the flow hasn't ceased. Many Cubans coming up from South America now pass through the Darien Gap -- an inhospitable, swampy, snake-infested stretch of jungle dividing Panama from Colombia. - AFP

We will all pray on this Thaipongal Day for lasting peace and reconciliation in a united Sri Lanka. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous future where expectations will be fulfilled and goals can be achieved for a better future, Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan in his Thaipongal message states.
Marking the commencement of the first month of the Thamil Calendar, the Tamil people all over the world celebrate the month of Thai on January 14 every year. The Thaipongal festival, celebrated to mark the beginning of the month of Thai, is observed by the Tamil community in a grand manner as it carries great social, cultural and religious value.
The Tamil community is guided by the Thaipongal festival to express their reverence and appreciation for nature. In the month of January, the Thaiponal festival is celebrated to offer our gratitude and thanks to the Sun. It is the Sun which helps the farmers to harvest their crops.
The Sun is what sustains human beings for the rest of the year by providing food, warmth and its glorious sunlight. So farmers as well as all others express their gratitude and thanks to the Sun on this holy and celebrated day of the Thaipongal festival for ensuring their sustenance. Even though each community in Sri Lanka has their own distinct culture, language and religion, when celebrating such festivals as the Thaipongal festival we pray for the sustenance of all human beings thus uniting us all as Sri Lankans.
It helps us unite and co exist regardless of cultural, religious and ethnic differences.

Previous regime failed to introduce changes to education sector: Akila
The previous regime failed to introduce any constructive changes to the education sector. Hence, the dark shadows of that regime still haunt the education sector, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He added that certain people used to get undue commissions from various projects and there was a great reluctance to go for change. He made this observation at the opening ceremony of the countrys first Smart Class Room at Sri Jayawardenapura Vidyalaya in Pitakotte. The project has been initiated with the intervention of the Foreign Affair Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva as a public private partnership.
The CodeGen company has granted the tabs required for the class room while the smart screen, furniture and the other required facilities have been granted by parents, the Old Students Association and some other philanthropists. The classroom would be used by the Grade Seven English medium students.
Minister Kariyawasam said they plan to improve the standard of education for the students in the country.
He added that he allocated money for 100 smart class rooms across the country through the previous years budget.
He also added that when he inquired from the officers, they said this programme was being implemented.
We have to introduce the Information Technology to the younger generation as the world is rapidly developing. The world will very soon use advanced technology to drive vehicles, Minister Kariyawasam said.
I think any limb of a body could be transplanted in the near future. We have to make our teachers and students ready for this smart world, the minister said.
The minister also suggested that Executive Director of CodeGen Company Dr.Harsha Subasinghe be appointed to the Council that formulated the lessons for the school students as an expert.
Minister Kariyawasam also promised to renovate some of the halls with archaeological value at the 185-year-old Sri Jayawardenapura Vidyalaya. Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva said it was one of his wishes coming true that he was able to intervene in the setting up of a smart class room in his area.
He added when he heard of Dr.Subasinghe, he went to see his project which was the completion of the project of a electronic racing car in Sri Lanka.
I initiated the work to introduce a smart class room with my funds with the assistance of Subasinghe, the Deputy Minister said. I hope that the Education Ministry will grant at least 10 such smart class rooms to schools within this year. This would be commendable.
Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi and Principal of the College Major D.A.D.Vanaguru also spoke at the occasion.

Propagating benefits of good governance to outside world
The book Buddhist Ideals of Good Governance authored by Prof. Francois Chenet and Ven. Dr. Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera of the Paris-Sorbonne University in France on the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena on how the Buddhas teachings and guidance can help the process of good governance, will be launched on January 16 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla.
The book will be useful to world leaders and others interested in the principles of good governance.
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage addressing a media briefing at the ministry yesterday, said the new book will highlight the teachings of the Buddha on good governance during his time to emphasise human dignity, human rights, peace, justice, religious and cultural reconciliation and social and economic sustainable prosperity.
The main aim of this endeavour is to propagate the benefits of good governance to the outside world, he said.
Bopage said Ven. Dr. Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera was born in a remote area in Bibile and obtained higher education at the Kelaniya University and has been living in France for the past 30 years.
The thera followed his PHD studies at the Sorbonne University in France. During President Sirisenas visit to France in November 2015, he requested the thera to write a book on the values of good governance as reflected through the Buddha and the Dhamma, Bopage said.
The thera compiled this book in collaboration with senior professor of Sorbonne University, Francois Chenet. This book shows how world leaders can govern their countries by adhering to the Buddhist philosophy, he said.
Bopage said on the day of the launching of the book, a trust fund titled Nidahase Maithree Daruwo' will be launched with the help of philanthropists.
A deed of the trust fund will be handed over to the President. Over 1,200 children born on January 8, 2015 will receive scholarships from grade one to university level. Children with economic issues and various ailments will also receive donations in the future, he said.
In addition, a draft paper on the establishment of the global centre of studies and research on good governance will also be presented to the President.
International Institute of Buddhist Studies of Paris Director and Buddhist Liaison Officer to UNESCO, Ven. Dr. Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera said President Sirisena was making a great effort to create a just society through a good governance concept based on the teachings of the Buddha.
"This is why I accepted his invitation. The whole world including the UN firmly believes that only the Buddhas philosophy has the answer to the problems of the people and governments. The Buddha has stated about good governance through Dasaraja Dhamma sermons. The entire world is facing various war and tragedies and world leaders are also facing problems due to this, he said.
"The world has accepted that only the Buddhas teachings can show us the way to deal with these problems. Following the Buddhas philosophy will be a great consolation for world leaders to solve their problems and this book will benefit them, he added.

We refer to the article appearing in the Daily News newspaper dated 26.12.2016 under the caption GMOA levels allegations at Malabe Neville Fernando Hospital over Womans death in which baseless and untruthful allegations and misleading statements have been made against Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital by GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Soyza, has been cited and published by you.
We particularly highlight the following misleading and untruthful assertions made by Dr. de Soyza:
Dr. de Soyza claims that our hospital operates without the guidance of the Health Ministry, thus misleading the public to presume that it is the Health Ministry that issues guidelines to private hospitals. However, private hospitals operate under the supervision of the Private Sector Health Regulatory Council and our hospital had at all times complied with the guidelines issued by the relevant authority.
Dr. de Soyza has made a further statement that the Sri Lanka Medical Council had not approved this hospital when in fact the Sri Lanka Medical Councils approval is not required either to establish or operate a private hospital. Furthermore, Dr. de Soyza is not a spokesperson for the Sri Lanka Medical Council, nor an office bearer of this Council.
Dr de Soyza has also alleged that no one is punished and nothing has been done for misplacing rugger player Wasim Thajudeens bones. The hospital or SAITM has not been charged in any Court of law or by any forum for any alleged misplacement of human bones of any person and how this statement is relevant to the issue raised by him is unfathomable.
Dr. de Soyza also states that a demand for Rs. 150,000 had been made from the family of the deceased, when there has not been any such demand by the hospital. In fact, the Hospital has reduced a considerable portion of the invoice issued by the hospital which is lawfully and legally payable by the family of the deceased at their request. The hospital is entitled to charge its patients for the services provided by them. The family of the deceased have settled the invoice and enjoyed the benefit of the discount, which was granted at the request of the family of the deceased.
The investigation into the death of a patient who was admitted to the hospital has been initiated due to the request of the family and the JMO report is pending. We verily believe this request of the family stemmed from 3rd party influences, who have a vested interest to tarnish the good name and reputation of the hospital.

Sale probed over possible concussion breach
LONDON: English Premiership club Sale are being investigated over a possible breach of concussion management protocol involving Samoas TJ Ioane.
A panel will meet to examine an incident in Sales Premiership defeat at Harlequins last Saturday in which Ioane appeared to be concussed but remained on the pitch and completed the match.
Ioane took a blow to the head while tackling Harlequins hooker Dave Ward, but the back row gingerly returned to his feet and resumed play without receiving any medical treatment.
The incident was not picked up by the member of the Sharks medical team appointed to look for instances of concussion during the match, with the assistance of television replays. The English Rugby Football Union investigation comes less than a month after Northampton were the subject of a probe into the handling of George Norths latest blow to the head.
A concussion management review group panel will convene to examine an incident in the 30th minute of the match between Harlequins and Sale on 7 January, involving Sale player TJ Ioane, an RFU statement read.
The RFU and Premiership Rugby have appointed Dr Julian Morris to be the independent chairman and will be joined by the RFUs director of professional rugby Nigel Melville and Phil Winstanley, the rugby director at Premiership Rugby.
A joint RFU/Premiership Rugby update will be provided in seven days and until that time no further comment will be made. AFP

Serenas tough draw in quest for Aussie Open No.7
MELBOURNE Jan13: Six-time champion Serena Williams was handed a tough draw Friday at the Australian Open, while defending champion Angelique Kerber has a slightly easier route towards another final.
The American powerhouse, bidding for a 23rd Grand Slam crown at the tournament starting in Melbourne on Monday, faces dangerous former world number seven Belinda Bencic of Switzerland in the opening round.
Second seed Williams, who lost the top ranking to Kerber last year, could then encounter in-form Briton Johanna Konta in the fourth round and Slovak sixth seed Dominika Cibulkova in the quarters.
She could potentially then meet her US Open conqueror Karolina Pliskova in the semi-final of the bottom half of the draw.
Williams drop to world number two was triggered by her shock defeat to Pliskova at Flushing Meadows last year, which also denied her the chance to better Steffi Grafs 22 Grand Slam victories.
Pliskova is seeded to meet two-time Melbourne Park semi-finalist Agnieszka Radwanska in the quarter-finals. World number one Kerber is seeded for a last eight clash with Spanish seventh seed and French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in the top half of the draw.
Kerber, who beat Williams to win the first of her two Grand Slams last year in Melbourne, starts with a first-round clash against Ukraines Lesia Tsurenko.
Winning the Australian Open in 2016 sparked a memorable season for the German, who followed it up by claiming the US Open.
She has two potential testing opponents early in her campaign with a re-match against Russian teen Daria Kasatkina, who upset her in this weeks lead-up Sydney International. The 19-year-old Russian, ranked 26, shocked Kerber 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 in a second-round match played in sweltering conditions.
Former Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard, who rediscovered some form at the Sydney International in reaching the semi-finals, is another potentially in Kerbers way. AFP

Shakib double ton crushes New Zealand
WELLINGTON AFP Jan13: A double century from Shakib Al Hasan and a ton from Mushfiqur Rahim hammered New Zealand as records tumbled and Bangladesh took control of the first Test on Friday.
They closed day two at Wellingtons Basin Reserve on 542-7, subjecting New Zealand to a harsh day on the field.
Shakib fell 15 minutes before stumps for 217, the highest score ever by a Bangladesh player.
Mushfiqur went a short time earlier for 159 after the pair had put together a record all-time partnership for Bangladesh of 359, eclipsing the 312 by Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes against Pakistan two years ago.
It is also the highest fifth-wicket stand by any team against New Zealand.
The 542 total is the third-highest first innings at the traditional bowl-first ground in its 59-Test history.
As the track flattened out, Shakib cruised past the milestone 3,000 runs and at the end of his innings he was on 3,146 to become Bangladeshs second-most prolific batsman behind Tamim who moved to 3,405 with his 56 on the first day.
With the wind and rain that disrupted day one out of the picture, New Zealand had early success in the fourth over when Mominul Haque fell for 64 and honours were even with Bangladesh at 160-4.
But for the next 82 overs Shakib and Mushfiqur were in command as they piled on 359 runs at nearly 4.4 an over and with an element of luck. Shakib was dropped on four by Mitchell Santner late on the first day and dropped by Ross Taylor on 189.
He survived a tight appeal on 137 when wicketkeeper BJ Watling took what appeared to be a sensational diving catch down the leg side only for replays to show he briefly grounded the ball on hitting the turf. It was Wagner who eventually claimed the wicket when a tired Shakib chopped an attempted cut onto his stumps and it was Wagner who also led the applause for Shakib as the New Zealand team acknowledged his masterful innings. Mushfiqur had a heart-stopping moment on 78 when an inside edge off Boult brushed the stumps but the bails stayed on and the ball went through to the boundary. Boult eventually claimed the Bangladesh captain with a wide delivery that Mushfiqur attempted to drive but succeeded only in edging to Watling.
He faced 260 deliveries in his innings and cracked 23 fours and a six while Shakib batted for nearly seven hours, faced 276 deliveries and hit 31 fours.
Wagner was the most successful New Zealand bowler with three for 124 while Boult had two for 121 and Southee two for 144.

Sri Lanka to be made high income country by 2032: PM
The government has introduced an economic agenda with the aim of making Sri Lanka a high income country by 2030 or 2032. We have to achieve this target, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
We will set up a set of National Policies and then the policies will remain even when regimes change. The National Unity Government was established with this aim. The people will decide who should stay and who should go, the Prime Minister said.
Addressing over 1,000 public management assistants recruited to the public service at Temple Trees yesterday, the Prime Minister said once the country is developed, all the benefits will go to the people and children.
The public service and all other sectors will be used to make Sri Lanka a high income country by 2032. Now Sri Lanka is a middle income country, the Premier said.
According to the Prime Minister, the new recruits joined the public service during a crucial time because the world is undergoing a major change. There are many technological and economic changes taking place in Asia and the Indian ocean promoting large scale development in the region,he said.
Sri Lanka has already joined this changing process and the world has undergone tremendous progress by the time the newly recruits retire in another 30 or 40 years. Some may start their own private enterprises before that, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister pointed out that since 1990, Sri Lanka implemented the free trade economy and it achieved progress and development while undergoing a recession in 2008.But, the development of Asia did not stop. In the past the peoples of India, China,Sri Lanka etc thought that the Government would provide everything.We had to wait in line to obtain two loafs of bread and only the lucky people got them. Only two yards of linen was provided for a person. I got two tyres for my four wheel vehicle per year. Those countries adopted the free trade economy, he said.
This economic system is the oldest in the world and Thapassu and Bhalluka merchants brought it to Sri Lanka. After 200 or 300 years Mihindu Thera came to Sri Lanka.Even Buddhism received from a foreign country. All techniques used to construct tanks and to build Chetiya were introduced to Sri Lanka from abroad. There will be no development if the Government tries to control everything. A vehicle cannot move when the breaks and the accelerator are used at once. A lot of recruits have come from rural areas and not from big towns. These areas need to be modernised but the Government does not have money, the Premier said.
Local investors also do not have money.We need to bring foreign investors to do it, the Premier said.
During the first decade China used foreign investors and during the second decade the local investors joined. Only during the third decade Chinese investors took over. We have to follow this methodology. We cannot do it with outdated ideas and concepts. There is no country in the world except North Korea where the Government provides employments for all,Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Government cannot carry out all development activities along. There should be an agreement to develop the country and we achieved it by presenting the `Common Candidate. This is the first step. As the second step, the two main political parties joined after the General Election. With the National policies, Sri Lanka can achieve development similar to UK within a very short time. In UK, India etc the policies do not change with the regime changes. There will be no big change in US policies with the departure of President Obama and arrival of President Trump, the Premier said. Last year was spent on reducing the countrys debt and increase the Governments income. Due to the steps taken,during the past 12 days of 2017, the Government took a giant step to introduce an initial change tothe economy. The countrys debt has reduced and with the US $ 5000 million worth investments received due to Hambantota port project. The European market is open now due to the restoration of the GSP Plus. India and Japan are helping develop the Trincomalee harbour, the Premier said
A large amount of investments are flowing in to the country and we have to develop the country through implementation of the programmes. An economic agenda will be formulated after discussions with the President. Projects to be handled by the state sector, private sector etc will be identified, the Premier said. Once the agenda is formulated all will be informed about it and a huge reorganisation process will be take place. The newly recruited will not be required to handle 50 or more files by the time they leave the public service because by that time all data will be in a small mobile phone or a laptop. India and other countries have already introduced this programme. India is a short while away from Sri Lanka by air. Once the country is developed, all can have a good house,vehicle, with the children provided with a sound local or foreign education and the people enjoying a good life, the Premier added.
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara and many others spoke. The parents of the new appointment recipients and many others were present.

Sri Lanka in familiar trouble
JOHANNESBURG, Friday - Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada plunged Sri Lanka into familiar trouble when they both took two wickets on the second day of the third and final Test against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday.
Sri Lanka were 80 for four when bad light ended play for the day, still 346 runs behind South Africas total of 426.
The first half of the day belonged largely to Sri Lanka, who have largely been outplayed in a series which they trail 2-0, as their bowlers claimed South Africas seven remaining wickets for 88 runs.
Nuwan Pradeep took four wickets in as many overs to finish with four for 78, while Lahiru Kumara took four for 107.
Hashim Amla, who resumed on 125 not out, could add only nine more runs off 44 balls before he was caught behind to become Pradeeps third victim.
Although Dimuth Karunaratne was caught behind off Vernon Philander without scoring off the fourth ball of their innings, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis put on 47 for the second wicket and saw off the new ball.
But Rabada struck soon after tea when he produced a sharply-lifting delivery which Silva had to play at, edging a second catch to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.
Mendis made 41 before a vicious lifter from Rabada had him fending a catch to gully. Dhananjaya de Silva followed in the next over when he sliced a drive against Philander to backward point. Philander took two for 17 and Rabada two for 26.
Although Pradeep was their most successful bowler, it was an impressive collective bowling performance by the Sri Lankan seamers in overcast conditions on a pitch which seemed to have more life than on the first day. Suranga Lakmal bowled superbly from the start of play after South Africa resumed at 338 for three, conceding nine runs in seven overs, four of which came from overthrows, and having South African captain Faf du Plessis dropped by Mendis at second slip.
Angelo Mathews, who opened the bowling with Lakmal at start of play, sent down five overs for nine runs and dismissed nightwatchman Duanne Olivier. Pradeep had a golden spell, dismissing Du Plessis, Temba Bavuma, Amla and Philander in the space of 24 deliveries. AFP

A suggestion for Jury Selection
Some times hollow words play an important role in the world of diplomatic exchange. Real meaning comes out slowly. Such growth of words is fundamental to understanding humanitarian law, where political figures stumble or walk tall depending on whether they should condemn or let alone, certain catastrophes.
In the recent past the decision to use the genocide term to describe the operations of the Islamic State forces provides another instance of how an important, though often abused term, is used. The words origins were based on a method with contradictions, however brilliant it might have initially seemed.
We are told that Lemkin gave it much thought, hitting upon the idea that eliminating races had been a historically neglected facet of international criminal law. In 1946, Lemkin, writing in The American Scholar (Spring, 1946), expressed the view that mass murder would not be adequate to describe what Winston Churchill had claimed was a crime without a name. They all agreed that term should connote biological destruction; thus entered genocide.
The UN General Assembly
The UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on December 9, 1948. The diplomatic tug-of-war in the discussions was themselves an object study about how problematic the use of the word would become. Reluctance to embrace its implications was everywhere.
Because all countries inherited communal clashes, as different nationality and racial groups came under geographical entity: country. Countries, in other words, were far more interested in narrowing its application than fulfilling a larger scope intended by Lemkin. The Soviet Union wished to cull the crime of its political implications; the United States feared home-grown legal insurrection by its black population over segregation and the history of slavery. The latter would only ratify the Convention in 1987 via President Ronald Reagans signing of the Proxmire Act at OHare Airport in Chicago.
Terrorist activists
Attempts to enshrine the targeting and preventing of genocide have not historically gone well, beginning with the very premise of whether one could name it or not. The copy book on punishing this particular crime has been blotted by such non-efforts in Africa, which registers customary outrage and crocodile tears among former imperial powers who only failingly intervene to rebottle the terrorist activists and pursue a relevant resource interest.
Humanitarianism is only ever donned as a necessary costume, to assuage populations back home, that wrong is being set right by moralists with weapons.
It is in this context we could look into the war crimes issue in Lanka. In a country where hundred percent Sinhala jury with a Sinhala judge give a controversial judgment, Muttetuwegama committee proposes involvement of foreign judges.
Shouldnt we correct the mistake that is obvious before making ultra solutions What about a jury of half Sinhala and half non Sinhala supervised by a non Sinhala judge Or else can we start by implementing the LLRC proposals made so many years back

Task Force to resolve drought issues
President Maithripala Sirisena has advised to appoint a Task Force to look into problems the people might face with a drought predicted during the next several months.
The President addressing a meeting at the President Secretariat yesterday, said the Task Force should be appointed to look into issues such as shortage of water, health problems, food scarcity and power cuts that might arise as a result of the drought.
He discussed with officials issues related to the predicted drought and measures the government can take to face the challenges.President Sirisena instructed officials to help the people with the support of the district secretaries, divisional secretaries and the Tri- forces. The President highlighted that the officials can seek help from international organisations and embassies to buy water bowsers and tanks. He said water bowsers can be purchased through the Disaster Management Ministry as well.
President Sirisena instructed officers of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board to identify areas that would be prone to the drought and take immediate measures to find water bodies nearby and supply clean water to the people. He noted that the World Food Programme had also pledged support to supply food for the people who might be affected by the drought.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said measures have already been taken to import rice and that there was a possibility of reducing the price of a kg of rice by Rs. 10.
It was highlighted that as there could be power shortages during a drought, arrangements should be made to produce energy from thermal and solar power. The President noted the need to create awareness among the public to use both electricity and water wisely and added that the media has a major responsibility in creating awareness.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa explained the measures that have already been taken by the ministry to face the future challenges due to a drought.

President Sirisena, in his message in lieu of Thai Pongal, said the festival rekindled the contract between man and nature, and epitomized human gratefulness.
The full text of the message is reproduced below:
Since the dawn of civilization, humanitys devotion to the sun that symbolizes the wholeness of nature has remained intact.
From among the many traditional festival and rituals of Hindus, in veneration of the sun, Thai Pongal is the foremost festival that marks the supreme status the Hindus have bestowed upon the sun throughout history.
Thai Pongal is rendered colourful by the fact that it allows us to show our gratitude to nature and renew our hopes devotedly.
Depicting the broad span of the Hindus culture evident, the devotees mark Thai Pongal as an occasion to be thankful, not only to the sun for giving us warmth, timely rain and bountiful harvests, but also to the cattle by feasting of cows, for providing us with milk.
Festivals such as these rekindle the contract between man and the gifts of nature, while epitomizing the enormity of the human gratefulness.
As the world look forward to move in the direction of sustainability, the message transmitted by Thai Pongal since antiquity, becomes ever more relevant.
I wish a happy and a prosperous Thai Pongal festival to the Hindus in Sri Lanka and abroad.

Thomas joins elite 59 club at USPGA Tour Sony Open
LOS ANGELES Jan 13: Justin Thomas eagled his final hole to card a rare 59 in the first round of the USPGA Tour Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday.
Thomas, winner of the Tournament of Champions on Sunday at Kapalua, rolled in a 15-foot eagle putt at Waialae's Country Club's ninth hole to finish the first round on the par-70 layout at 11-under.
The 23-year-old American became the seventh player -- and the youngest -- to post a sub-60 round on the US tour.
It was obviously a fun day, said Thomas, whose spectacular effort gave him an early five-shot lead in the opening round of the US PGA Tour's first full-field event of 2017.
With afternoon starters still on the course, Americans Russell Henley, Gary Woodland and Tony Finau, Scotland's Russell Knox and Australian Cameron Smith had all made it into the clubhouse on 64.
I just kind of had it rolling out there, Thomas said. All my birdies were easy -- it wasn't like I made any long putts or anything. But Thomas wasn't blind to the significance of the number.
We all know it's the magical number in golf, he said.
Most recently, Jim Furyk carded a record 58 at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut in August.
Furyk also has a 59 on his tour resume, as does Al Geiberger, Chip Beck, David Duval, Paul Goydos and Australian Stuart Appleby.
Thomas had opened his round with an eagle at the 10th, where he hit his tee shot 315 yards and holed out from 34 yards out in the fairway for a two.
He had eight more birdies and a bogey on the day, and kept his sizzing form going with a nine-foot par-saving putt at the eighth.
That save on eight was huge, Thomas said. It gave me a chance because I knew if I hit a good drive on nine I was going to have a seven- or eight-iron in. But his drive at the par-five ninth found the bunker.

A tribute to the greatest Welsh player to have beaten the All Blacks
It is given to few -- except those, such as royals, who are born to it -- to live for more than 70 years after first becoming famous. The point at which Haydn Tanner, who was born 100 years ago on January 9 1917, acquired his enduring rugby fame is not hard to pinpoint.
It was on September 28 1935 at the St Helen's ground, Swansea. He and his cousin, and fellow Gowerton School pupil, Willie Davies were Swansea's half-backs against New Zealand. The All Whites beat All Blacks won 11-3, the first ever win by a club over New Zealand, and to this day their largest margin of defeat by a Welsh team. All Black skipper Jack Manchester unsuccessfully pleaded to journalists: Don't tell them back home that we were beaten by schoolboys. Less than two months later Tanner was at it again. Still only 18, he made his Wales debut against the tourists and, partnered by Cliff Jones, played his part in the 13-12 win.
Tanner was one of those rare players who emerged complete -- a teenager with the poise and judgment of a veteran. Following his Five Nations debut, the day after his 19th birthday against England at Swansea in January 1936 he was hailed by Dai Gent -- writing with the authority of a man who had played the position * himself for England -- as surely Wales's best scrum-half in years.
Not only in years, but for years.
He was a fixed point in the Wales team until 1949, missing only the 1947 match against Australia where his deputy -- reflecting an age in which musical tastes often dictated Welsh forenames -- was Llanelli's Handel Greville. That 14-year span set a record beaten only in the early years of the present century by Gareth Llewellyn. That he won only 25 caps rather than piling up a record that might also have stood for decades was because so many of those years were lost to the war, in which he was commissioned in the Royal Signals.
He went on tour with the Lions to South Africa in 1938, but for almost the only time in his career was hit by an injury serious enough to deny him all but 10 games and a single Test. He also played 12 times for Wales in wartime services and Victory internationals, the lifting of the ban on league players reuniting him on seven occasions with Willie Davies, who had joined Bradford Northern and is remembered as a league rather than union great. The challenge he set opponents was beautifully summed up in a picture caption in John Morgan and Geoff Nicholson's fine late 1950s work Report on Rugby: Will he pass the longest, most accurate known passes. Or run the strongest, most deceptive runs known of an inside-half .
Swansea schoolboys of the era, including my father, were wont to believe that the Tanner Bank at St Helen's was named in honour of their greatest player, at least until it was pointed out that the name predated 1935 and was because it used to cost 6d to stand there. Whatever Max Boyce may have sung, the truly great Welsh tradition is not outside, but scrum-half. Tanner was the middle link in Welsh scrum-half play's holy trinity -- between Dickie Owen, who more or less invented the position and Gareth Edwards, consensus choice as the greatest player ever in any position.
Those, like Bleddyn Williams, who played with or against Tanner would tell you that he lost little if anything in comparison with Edwards. All three came from the Swansea area. Owen played for the All Whites, Edwards for Cardiff. Tanner supplies a link here as well, playing before the war for Swansea but joining Cardiff, a much easier journey from his job teaching at Bristol Grammar School , when he was demobbed.
It might seem odd that he did not score in those 25 peacetime games for Wales --although there was a match-winning try in the victory international at Twickenham. - Scrum

Trump not to Nadals taste
MADRID: Former tennis world number one Rafael Nadal said Friday that US President-elect Donald Trump was not quite to his taste while lamenting Spanish politics has also, in his view, become too razzmatazz.
Its not my style. I was in the United States when Trump was on the campaign trail, Nadal told Spanish online site El Espanol as he limbered up for the Australian Open.
It is true that I dont care for his manner of speaking -- his way of expressing himself is not a style I appreciate, added Nadal, while conceding he was no expert on the US political scene.
Also, Ill be honest -- the other option didnt do much for me either, added the Spaniard in allusion to defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Nadal consoled himself with the thought that in a globalised world Trump would not necessarily be able to have things all his own way.
The Mallorcan winner of 14 Grand Slam singles titles was more guarded in his assessment of the incoming president than actress Meryl Streep, who earlier this week used the Golden Globes ceremony to blast Trump.
Nadal did criticise a Spanish political establishment left in virtual paralysis for much of last year after inconclusive December 2015 elections before conservative leader Mariano Rajoy was sworn in to head a new minority government.

Uva Chief Minister plays Re Daniel daval Migel: UP Councillor Senarath
The Uva Chief Minister has friendly relationship with the President during daytime and with Mahinda Rajapaksa during night time following the policy of re daniel daval migel, said Uva Provincial Councillor Senarath Jayasuriya.
I got information that the Chief Minister used Provincial Council vehicles and the recently recruited employees for the Joint Opposition protest in Hambantota. I believe that the President would take action on this. Before the last years budget was presented, the Chief Minister met a few UNP councillors. They asked for our support.
We agreed to give 50 percent of job opportunities and development activities to the opposition. But things are not happening the way we expected. Many were recruited even in January this year, he said. "If the Chief Minister continues to act in this manner, we will have to decide on extending our support in future," he said.
The Chief Minister was appointed by the President, but he is not representing Presidents views. We will soon inform the President and the Prime Minister about the situation in the Uva Provincial Council, he said.

Wades thrilling ton as Australia beat Pakistan in 1st ODI
BRISBANE, Friday  Matthew Wade hit a thrilling last-ball century to set up a 92-run victory for Australia over Pakistan in the first one-day international at the Gabba on Friday.
Wicketkeeper Wade boosted Australia to 268 for nine off their 50 overs after the batting top order had slumped to 78 for five.
Seamer James Faulkner then took four wickets for 32 to help Australia dismiss Pakistan for 176 off 42.4 overs.
Pakistan were well placed with Australia five down in the 17th over before Wade and Glenn Maxwell (60) put on 82 runs for the sixth wicket to push on.
The tourists could not put any pressure on the Australians in their innings with skipper Azhar Ali injuring a hamstring and Babar Azam topscoring with 33.
Mohammad Amir struck early with the key wickets of adventurous opener David Warner and skipper Steve Smith with successive balls to have Australian rocking at 13 for two in the fifth over.
It was challenging at the top, it was swinging and seaming around, man-of-the-match Wade said.
Maxi (Maxwell) took the pressure off me, and I was just looking to get him on strike. I was absolutely cooked (by the last over).
Wade, who has been under pressure to score runs after a lean spell, hit seven fours and two sixes in his knock for his first ODI century.
Maxwell was at his quirky best with reverse sweeps and improvised stroke-making in his 60 off 56 balls with seven boundaries before he was out to a false shot.
Pakistan soon struck trouble in their innings losing the free-scoring Sharjeel Khan for 18 off 22 balls, falling to Faulkner.
Skipper Azhar Ali injured a hamstring and retired hurt only to return in pain and try and help his side late innings before he became another Faulkner victim for 24.
Babar Azam, batting at No.4, topscored with 33 off 46 balls before he edged to Steve Smith at slip off Pat Cummins.
The second match in the five-ODI series will be played in Melbourne on Sunday.

Why MR against job creation in H'tota
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday, queried as to why former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is against the provision of employment to the youth in the Hambantota district.
Addressing the gathering at the opening of the Samasaranagama housing complex of 70 houses to mark the 70 th anniversary of UNP and to mark the 50th birth day of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the youth in Hambantota will be self-reliant after the Hambantota Industrial Zone is set up and new industries come up.
He said the regaining of GSP plus has proved to be a tower of strength for the export sector of Sri Lanka.
He said: "We can export goods worth US $ 500 million to Europe as a result of regaining GSP plus that was lost as a result of short sighted policies of the previous regime."
"A period of transition will dawn on Hambantota with the setting up of the industrial zone. Hambantota needs about 2,000 industrial ventures. We will utilise 95 percent of state land. We as a country are indebted as a result of the setting up of the Hambantota seaport and other projects launched in a haphazard manner by the previous regime. The government has to pay US $ 1,900 million to settle the loans. We don't have enough funds for this. If we dont follow this, we will have to burden the people with taxes," he said.
"There were protest campaigns when we launched the industrial zone project last week. There is a possibility of establishing industrial ventures in other part of the country if Hambantota does not want them. There are requests from the ministers of other districts for the setting up of industrial ventures. But the maximum number of needy people are in Hambantota. It is our duty to set up industrial ventures in Hambantota and provide job opportunities to the youth.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said that there are 2,500,000 families in Sri Lanka and out of them, 190,000 dont have houses. About 79 percent of families in Hambantota remain without houses. About 264 Udagammana are being set up, the minister said.
