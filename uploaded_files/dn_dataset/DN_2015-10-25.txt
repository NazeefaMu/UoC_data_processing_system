[APPRECIATIONS - (26-Oct-2015)]
Sir Cyril de Zoysa:
His foresight was laced with wisdom
Among the great lay Buddhist leaders born in Sri Lanka Sir Cyril de Zoysa indeed commands a unique place, and this, for no other reason but for the invaluable services he rendered to the Sambudddha Sasana and the Sinhala community.
His services were not confined to any one single arena. It is my conviction that the reach of the call that steered him from the past to the present and from the present to the future remained equally steady. Among the unsurpassed services he has rendered, his efforts to preserve and conserve the Kalutara Bodhi have earned a very special place.
Sir Cyril who led a purposeful life in the cause of the Sasana and the Buddhist community in Sri Lanka was born on October 26, 1896 in the village of Welitota in the Balapitiya electorate of Bentara Wallalavita Korale in the Galle District.
Sir Cyril was a heroic son of the soil, a luminary who lit up not only the District of Galle but the entirety of Sri Lanka, traditionally known as the Thunhelaya.
He had his early education at St. Thomas College, Matara. Soon he left for Richmond College, Galle, continued his studies there for about one year and then entered Royal College, Colombo.
He passed the Cambridge Senior Examination and entered the Ceylon Law College to seek a career in law. After successfully completing the course of studies he took leave of Law College and in 1921commenced his practice at the Police Courts, Balapitiya.
Fate had it that before long he moved from Welitota to Kalutota (Welitara to Kalutara). Here he soon earned a reputation as an honest and clever lawyer.
During this period when the British reigned supreme, there was no quarter given to any one at all to offer devotions by offering a flower or lighting a clay oil lamp at the Bodhi.
The Government Agent of Kalutara had ordered the Police should instruct the watcher at the Bodhi to chase away Buddhist pilgrims and worshipers who venture to approach the place.
When the young lawyer, Cyril de Zoysa, learnt of this, he forcibly built an unauthorised altar before the Bodhi tree to enable devotees to place flowers upon it. This service that he commenced continued unabated. He believed that the development of the precincts of the sacred Bodhi would succeed day by day because he himself receives the benign graces of the deity who has chosen this place as his abode.
He made the Kalutara Bodhi the centre from where a broad spectrum of his services radiated for the progress of the Buddha Sasana. This place that caught the eye of young Cyril has today turned out to be a beautiful place in a pleasant setting where devotees and others could freely make their offerings and otherwise enjoy its sanctity. Right now, the Kalutara Bodhi has reached the level of a place of Buddhist worship of the prime order.
Young Cyrils aspirations did not end with a contribution towards Buddhist revival. He also aspired to bring about community development.
He realised that social service cannot be performed with the income earned by practising the law alone. He therefore started a bus service called Swarnapali bus service, which was later transformed into the South Western Bus Company. Buses of this company plied right up to the Southern end of the Western Province and back. This saw nothing but success day by day. He appealed to the passengers in his buses to drop a coin at the Kalutara Bodhi.
By this means he hoped he could instil a sense of piety and devotion in their minds and also perhaps to command community support for the maintenance and preservation of the Bodhi. He provided a prime service to the community and ploughed back the income towards the progress of the Buddha Sasana and towards community service.
As with the Buddhas exhortation Dhammo Have Rakhathi Dhamma Chari (those who live by the Dhamma are protected by the Dhamma), before long, governing authorities of the land, the Sangha and various leaders of the business world were impressed by him.
All that he touched turned to gold was the adage that came to be associated with him. Many were those that saw him and continued to see him as a rare being with a golden heart full of the twin qualities of human kindness and benevolence  karuna and metta.
He at no time sought after honour, respect or high office but embodiments of these concepts sought him out.
Sir Cyril was a Buddha-aspirant or Bodhisattva as it were, who dedicated his life, his wealth, his time, labour and wisdom to the cause of the nation, governance and the Sasana.
His services were invaluable when he worked as a member, office bearer or chairman or president of organisation such as the Scout Movement, Sinhala Sports Club, Kalutara Town Club, Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT), National Council of the Blind and the Deaf, Child Protection Association, Law Society, Mahabodhi Society, Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA), Colombo and other such organizations.
Sir Cyril de Zoysas prime resolution was to ensure that every programme initiated by him was developed and sustained, thereby providing a broad service to society. This, he achieved to the last letter. Among the many memorable services rendered by him, two that may be cited as examples are the leadership taken to construct a hall for the Young Mens Buddhist Association in Colombo Fort and for the Bar Association.
He founded Kalutara Vidyalaya and Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya to help meet the educational needs of the children of the nation. The benefits that accrued to the region are immeasurable. Centred round these schools many children received their education and reached the highest echelons of society. It is an undisputed fact that this was the result of Sir Cyrils foresight.
He made a vast contribution towards the restoration of the Kiri Vehera in Kataragama by taking the leadership in this matter as well.
So has it been in the matter of the development of Buddhist temples such as the Bellanvila Raja Maha Viharaya, Kuppiyawatta Jayasekhararamaya, Bamabalapitiya Vajiraramaya and the Kaluvamodera Kadarada Viharaya.
When Prime Minister Bandaranaikes government came into power in 1956 bus services were nationalised by 1958. On this occasion he was magnanimous enough to replace worn-out tyres of the buses belonging to the South Western Bus Company with new ones, just before the take-over.
This act too is an example of his intentions of rendering service to the community. Thus Sir Cyril de Zoysa may be seen as one who prized selflessness over selfishness.
His foresight was laced with wisdom. This is evident in his act of setting up a Trust Fund with the initial contribution of Rs. 200 million. His vision was the commitment of the interest accruing from this Fund towards the furtherance of the Buddha Sasana.
Many of Sir Cyrils aspirations were fulfilled during his lifetime.It is praiseworthy that the Kalutara Bodhi Trust continues to fulfill all these in a number of fields, all calculated towards the progress of the community and the sustenance of the Buddha Sasana. Contribution towards the restoration of the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) when it was destroyed by a terrorist attack, inauguration of the Bodhignana Library, the grant of scholarships to Bhikkus who follow courses of study in Oriental Languages, provision of shelter for those displaced in the tsunami, setting up a Fund to release cattle from slaughter, the construction and maintenance of an Aramaya or residence, near the Kalutara Urban Council, for Buddhist nuns, the construction and maintenance of a Ward dedicated to Bhikkhus, in the Nagoda Hospital, conduct of English Language Teaching (ELT) programmes, free of charge, in Dhamma schools, provision of alms food and other facilities to those who observe the eight or 10 precepts on scheduled days are among such services that the Kalutara Bodhi Trust provides.
The name of Sir Cyril de Zoysa who provided such noble service remains immortal.
May Sir Cyril de Zoysa attain the peace of Nibbana.

Ana Senevirathne:
He brought vision and meaning to Police Force
I was the Headquarter Inspector of Police at Nittambuwa in 1979 when I received a message from the Director / Personnel at Police Headquarter Douglas Ranmuthugala, then Senior Superintendent of Police that IGP Ana Senevirathne wanted me to meet him the following day at his office.
Ranmuthugla informed me that that the IGP had selected me, on his recommendation, to take over the Vavuniya Police Station as HQI for special reasons, which the IGP would explain when I meet him in his office at Police Headquarters.
I was rather apprehensive of this message received from Ranmuthugala as I knew that Ana Senevirathne was a very strict disciplinarian and steadfast in his decisions. On my arrival at the Police Headquarters, I was produced before the IGP by Ranmuthugla. The IGP briefed me on the importance of Vavuniya area explaining the circumstances which led to the murder of a team of CID officers led by Inspector Bastianpillai at Madu Road between Mannar and Vavuniya in April 1978.
He further explained that a permanent Army camp would to be established at Iratteperiyakulam closer to the Vavuniya Airbase towards Medavachchiya as a buffer to prevent any terrorist infiltrations or attacks on villages up to Anuradhapura.
The IGP had also recommended that the Police Farm at Vavuniya to be taken over for the proposed Army Camp, which is now a permanent Army camp.
After the briefing , he told me that he would be visiting Vavuniya within a month. On February 10, 1979, I reported at the Vavuniya Police Station as the Headquarters Inspector of Police. Exactly within a month, I received a personal message from IGP Ana Senevirathne about his visit to Vavuniya with strict instructions only to inform the SP Division.
He arrived at the Vavuniya police station at about 5.30 hrs from Anuradhapura and took me and the SP Division in his jeep to a hamlet called Bogaswewa bordering Padaviya. In fact, he was driving the jeep on the gravel road till we reached this hamlet with an abandoned small tank.
There were only five families living around the tank. He walked around the tank and rested at one small house of which walls made of wattle and daub, roof thatched with iluk.
He then explained the reason for his visit to this place located between Padaviya and Vavuniya. His proposal to the then government was to renovate the tank and the Army to construct a road from Padaviya to Vavuniya as a barrier to provide security to the villages, particularly to Weli Oya and Padaviya areas.
However, this proposal could not be implemented due to political protests with complaints that the government was planning to colonise the area.
Ana Senevirathne had a thorough knowledge of the geography of police areas in the North and East when he was the DIG, Northern range.
With his experience as the Head of Intelligence, then the Special Branch, he properly assessed the northern terrorist problem brewing in the north and east. I explained the facts to assert that Ana Senevirathne was a leader of clear vision.
During the 1971 JVP insurrection, he was the Superintendent of Police in charge of the Kegalle Division which was a hot bed of insurgency. He handled the situation with an indomitable spirit preventing attacks on police stations. After the situation was brought under control in the country with the assistance of the Army , he was transferred to police headquarters, on the recommendations of then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, to handle the rehabilitation work of the arrested insurgents and other related duties.
As IGP, he personally knew the officers-in-charge of important police stations in the island and sometimes he contacted the OIC directly to ascertain facts on important incidents /cases reported to the police. In the city of Colombo, he made an order for all OICs of police stations to be on peak hour duty to ensure that traffic was controlled properly without any delays or traffic jams.
This order kept all OICs aware of traffic flaws in their respective areas and to maintain an efficient traffic control plans
The IGP took various routes to go to the Police Headquarters to ensure that there were no rush hour traffic snarls and blocks.
In fact, all senior officers too patrolled their districts and divisions supervising the OICC during this period.
Being an officer with fierce commitment to his profession and later as Inspector General of Police, he brought vision and meaning to the Police Force. The delight and spirit he derived from his profession was his driving force in his quest to make the Police Force a practical outfit and restore some lost pride and prestige.
Once he told me the best District he served was Tangalle and the best IGP under whom he worked was Eleric Abeygoonawardane. He was indeed a giant of our times, indomitable in courage, steadfast in purpose, total in commitment , clear sighted in vision, irreproachable in character and simple in manner. My clearest memory of him as a Senior Officer was his sharp and probing mind. He was an epitome of gentility who was ever unassuming and unpretentious.
In recognition of his professionalism and vast contribution to the Police Force and the country, after his retirement he was appointed by the government as the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia. He was also appointed as the member of the Public Service Commission (PSC) on two occasions and he served as a member for many years.
Ananda Seneviratne was born on April 20, 1927 and passed away on September 26, 2015 after a brief illness. Ana Seneviratne was born to Irwin and Irene Seneviratne from Sapugaskanda, Heiyanthuduwa in Gampaha District.
He was educated at Royal College, Colombo from 1938 to 1946. He entered the then University of Ceylon, Colombo and completed his LLB (Hons) Degree.
After graduating from University, Seneviratne joined the Police Force in 1951 as a probationary Assistant Superintendent of Police and he was appointed as the Inspector General of Police in 1978.
He married Krishna Weeratunga from Matara. His brother-in-law was General Tissa Weeratunga, former Commander of the Army.
In the midst of lifes challenges and upheavals, my close association with Ana Senevirathne, who was my mentor, will ever remain as a shining memory.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana !

Pat Manikkavasagan :
He was a friend, an asset
I was bewildered to read the obituary notice of my esteemed senior colleague Pat Manikkavasagan at Bank of Ceylon. Immediately to ease my anguish I informed another senior close friend Terrence Hettiarachchi in Sri Lanka.
Pat as everyone addressed, was a senior colleague of mine whom I got the opportunity to work initially at Bank of Ceylon Hulftsdorp branch when he was a staff assistant in 1976. I observed that his commitment for work was excellent which inspired others.
His leadership and pioneering philosophical qualities were appreciated by all. He possessed a sturdy personality. His wisdom was innovative. The domination of the English language was supreme. On any given theme even apart from routine matters other than banking, he took only a few seconds to sketch a letter.
His vocabulary was very extensive and he knew the meaning of all English words in an English dictionary. Until 40 years later, I have yet to meet a person who had such a philosophical and passionate familiarity of the English language.
He was simply an asset to the institution. He taught us unique leadership behaviour and had the aptitude to acquire the best out of subordinates and the approach how to work as a cohesive consistent unit.
Pat led always by example. This strategy made him as an indispensable employee to the prestigious banking tradition as the maximum yield was extracted from each employee who were beneath his purview.
It was a pleasure to work with him as he obsessed an incredible wisdom of humour. Hence all subordinates rendered their unsurpassed aptitude as they felt least exhausted working under him.
This facilitated to enhance the efficiency projected of any individual which was an authentic boost to the institution. He was a son of a station master who had to change schools frequently when his father was transferred to various places.
He finally studied at St. Benedicts College, Kotahena where he excelled in English language. After completing his studies he successfully completed a proficient course in Journalism'. He worked as a sub-editor in a reputed institution for a short period before opting to join Bank of Ceylon in 1953 when he was 22 years.
His full name is Selvam Manikkavasan although popularly known as Pat.
He retired from the banks service at 55 in 1986 and since he lived at his ancestral home BRAEMAR, Sri Jayanthi Mawatha in Wattala.
His premature retirement in particular was as he was not eager to get promoted and to be transferred to outstations branches.
He was the only bachelor of a family of seven. After retirement he had the habit of reading all English newspapers which were delivered to him daily.
Whenever I wanted to know the significance of an English word instead of referring to a dictionary I used to telephone Pat. I was instantly provided the meaning.
He once told me that he knew every meaning of words in the dictionary. This could be perhaps a Guinness record. He also requested me to publish his appreciation after his death.
He used to visit the YMCA Colombo daily after retirement where he had many friends. His death was abrupt and peaceful.
Pat lived a healthy and cheerful life.
His death is a loss to all his friends. The members of the YMCA would miss his fluent oratory at the YMCA.
We wish him eternal rest.

Beating Breast Cancer
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Dr. Suraj Perera (MBBS, MSc, MD) of the National Cancer Control Programme of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry talks to T n'C about early detection and breast cancer prevention.
Early detection is the most important factor that helps save lives of women. If breast cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be cured. Later stage breast cancers cannot be cured completely. Breast self examination, clinical breast examination by a health care worker, ultra sound scan, a mammography and Non Excision Biopsy - Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and or cone biopsy are the best early detection methods available.
Breast self examination should be done monthly by all women over the age of 20 on a fixed date in every month after menstruation. Clinical breast examination should be done by all women between the ages of 20 - 40 once in every three years and annually by all women above the age of 40. Mammography should not be done for women below the age of 35 unless asked by the doctor. All women between the ages of 50 - 69 should get done a mammography once in every two years. Genetic testing plays a major role in early detection of breast cancer, especially for women with family history. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are available in Sri Lanka.
Testing is done on DNA extracted from peripheral venous blood. Genetic Consultations available at Human Genetics Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Kinsey Road, Colombo 08. Telephone: 0112689545, email:[emailprotected] Working hours: 08:00am - 04:00pm (Mondays to Fridays).
Women at high risk are those who have a past history of breast cancer or breast condition, a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, infertility, the first child birth after 35 years, low parity, not breast fed or breast fed for a short period, menopause after 55 years, use of oral contraceptive pills for five years or more, obesity after menopause, high consumption of animal fats, less consumption of fruits and vegetables, less exercise and sedentary life style, consumption of excessive alcohol, active or passive smoking and past exposure to radiation. Cancer surveillance should be done for high risk women as follows.
Annual clinical breast examination by trained primary health care worker from five years before the index case.
Annual mammogram/magnetic resonance imaging surveillance beginning at the age of 35 years, or 5 years earlier than the earliest breast cancer diagnosis in the family. Ovarian surveillance if BRCA1 or 2 mutation positive or family history of ovarian cancer (Pelvic exam, trans-vaginal ultrasound, CA-125 once or twice a year starting at the age of 25 years.), he said.
The breast cancer does not show any clinical features during the early stages. Clinical features appear only with the advancement of the cancer. They are, skin/ colour/ shape changes of the breast, dimpling / indurations of the breast, pseudo orange appearance of the breast (orange peel), ulcer/wound over the breast, nipple change or nipple discharge other than breast milk, breast lump or thickening of the skin over the breast, axillary or cervical lumps ( lymph nods), lumps in the armpits or around the neck, he added.

Drones to monitor sharks in Australia
AUSTRALIA: Drones will circle popular swimming spots in eastern Australia and listening stations track tagged sharks as part of a new strategy announced Sunday to keep beachgoers safe after a spate of bloody attacks.
The country has one of the world's highest incidences of shark attacks with 13 in New South Wales this year leaving one dead and seven injured, threatening the beach tourism industry.
In response the nation's most populous state, which has ruled out culling sharks, unveiled a five-year plan to address the issue, including next-generation sonar systems and boosted aerial surveillance.
The state's primary industries minister Niall Blair said the multi-faceted approach followed advice from experts attending a recent shark summit in Sydney and community consultation.
We are proud to be the first jurisdiction anywhere in the world to adopt an integrated approach toward keeping our beaches safe, he said.
The wide-ranging Aus$16 million (US$11.5 million) plan to protect swimmers and surfers, while minimising harm to sharks, will see the trial of drones to provide real-time vision, while boosting helicopter surveillance.
The tagging of sharks will be stepped up, sonar detecting buoys deployed and 20 listening stations built at known hot spots using 4G technology to allow tagged animals to be monitored.
The real-time information will eventually be available to the public on a SharkSmart mobile app.
A Japanese surfer died in February after his legs were torn off by a shark and there have been 12 other serious attacks up and down the more than 2,000-kilometre-long (1,200-mile) NSW coast.
There were only three attacks in the state in 2014.
Experts say attacks are increasing as water sports become more popular and bait fish move closer to shore, but fatalities remain rare.
Part of the NSW funding will also be used to continue researching new technologies, including the use of electrical barriers powered by wave energy which omit low frequency pulsed signals to deter sharks.
How to manage sharks is a controversial issue with Western Australia state last year ditching a catch-and-kill policy using baited hooks and drum lines after community protests.
Under the policy, 72 baited hooks attached to floating drums were to be put in place between November and April each year until 2017 after a spate of attacks, with captured sharks killed if considered a threatening size.
More than 170 sharks, mostly tiger sharks, were caught during a 13-week trial, with 50 of the biggest ones destroyed.
Environmentalists said the policy was flawed, with no clear public safety outcomes but a heavy environmental cost, and it has now been abandoned.

Good Bye fatigue
The iron deficiency epidemic
If fatigue has become a fact of life and your usual workout routine is becoming seriously hard work, you could be one of millions of people who are not getting enough iron.
Iron is essential for energy because it's a building block for the red blood cells that transport oxygen around the body - which explains why constant tiredness is a tell-tale sign that you aren't getting enough.
Other tell-tale clues are headaches, dizziness, tinnitus - hearing sounds which seem to come from within your body, hair loss, cold hands or feet, difficulty swallowing, feeling itchy, disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, abdominal pain, having a sore or unusually smooth tongue, or brittle or spoon-shaped nails.
If you find yourself nodding off during the day or constantly yawning through meetings, your body could be under siege from hidden energy sappers.
But instead of reaching for another coffee, it's important to find the root cause of tiredness - which could be a symptom of an undiagnosed health condition.
Here are the most common causes of fatigue - and the best ways to get your energy level back on track...
Anaemia
Around four million women in the UK suffer from anaemia, caused by lack of iron.
The symptoms include tiredness, dizziness and a racing heart.
Your body needs iron to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen around your system. Without it, you'll feel lethargic, no matter how much sleep you get.
It is better not to take iron unless you know you are anaemic.
If you do take it, it's important to get re-tested to check your levels are back to normal.
Energy solution: If you suffer from tiredness and heavy periods, then ask your doctor for a blood test for VWD (Von Willebrand's disease). This affects around 300,000 women in the UK and is caused by blood not able to clot properly.
Your doctor also needs to test your iron levels. To reduce the risk of anaemia, make sure eat a balanced diet with plenty of green vegetables.
Your workout
Not how, but when you work out could be draining your energy. You should not exercise intensely just before bed, as this will make your adrenaline, heart and respiratory rates pump and you won't be able to sleep.
Also if your exercise routine is too intense, long or vigorous for your current level of fitness, instead of energising it will be draining you. Energy solution: Do energy forming exercises such as running or aerobics in the morning and focus on milder activities later in the evening.
Try a walk at the end of the day or a yoga session to calm your mind and stretch your muscles.
If your daily exercise routine is exhausting, then adjust it. The aim of exercise is to boost your energy not drain it. But don't go the other way though and cut out exercise altogether! No exercise will trap you in an vicous cycle of tiredness. Around 30 minutes of light exercise a day can help boost energy levels significantly.
Depression
As well as loss of libido, weight gain and lack of motivation, one of the most common side effects of depression is tiredness.
Energy solution: As well as eating healthily and getting the mood-boosting effects of regular exercise - preferably in the fresh air - you may want to try some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This is recognised as effective in helping to change the patterns of your mind so that you can control stress and depression.
The herb St John's wort is also effective for mild to moderate depression.
Undiagnosed diabetes or blood sugar problems
Figures show there are more than 500,000 people in the UK with undiagnosed diabetes.
The condition is partly to do with high sugar diets, obesity and sedentary lifestyles.
It occurs when the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood is too high and your body is unable to convert it into energy, as there is not enough insulin or the insulin produced isn't working properly.
The body then breaks down its stores of fat and protein to try to release more glucose and the problem gets worse. This is why people with untreated diabetes feel tired and lose weight. Other symptoms include urinating often and extreme thirst. Energy solution: Ask your doctor for a blood test. If the test is negative for diabetes then your tiredness might be caused by your blood sugar levels.
Cravings for starchy, sweet or fatty foods before your period can mean you have a blood sugar imbalance. To keep your blood sugar levels steady avoid sugar and refined processed foods as well as juices, cigarettes and caffeine. Eat every three hours and load up on low glycaemic foods such as seafood, eggs, hummus, green vegetables and fruits such as pears, grapes and apples.
Replace pasta with basmati rice and have porridge for breakfast instead of packaged cereals.
Dehydration
Dehydration occurs when you lose more fluid than you take in.
Your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions.
Dehydration is as bad for concentration as being drunk
A study earlier this year found that getting behind the wheel when dehydrated makes you just as hazardous as being under the influence of alcohol. The research from Loughborough University showed drivers who drank 25 ml (a couple of sips) of water an hour, instead of the recommended 200 ml (a third of a pint), made twice the number of mistakes as those who were well-hydrated. Mild dehydration sets in when we lose between just 1 or 2 per cent of our body's normal water volume.
For an 11st man, whose body contains 42 litres of water, that's 840 ml - just four glasses.
But even at this mild point, people start to become confused, says research in 2010 by Tufts University, Boston.
Focus and short-term memory start to go. Mild dehydration can cause symptoms such as weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Inadequate intake of water during hot weather or exercise also may deplete your body's water stores.
More obviously, other ommon causes of dehydration include intense bouts of diarrhoea, vomiting, fever or excessive sweating.
Energy solution: You can usually reverse mild to moderate dehydration by increasing your intake of fluids, but severe cases need immediate medical treatment.
The safest approach is not to become dehydrated in the first place. Aim for 6 to eight glasses of water or herb teas a day and don't wait until you get thirsty to drink.
You can do that by monitoring your fluid loss during hot weather, illness or exercise, and drinking enough liquids to replace what you lose.
Reduce your alcohol, tea and coffee intake as these are dehydrating.
Vitamin b12 deficiency
If you feel tired and are eating a healthy diet, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, which helps to carry oxygen around the body and it is a must for energy.
Energy solution: You may want to ask your doctor for a blood test to check your levels of B12. Injections can then be administered by your doctor if needed.
Your bedroom
Almost 40 per cent of the population suffers from some form on insomnia.
A disrupted night's sleep affects you physically and mentally. In the long run, you end up with a massive sleep debt that you body can't repay no matter how much of it you get.Energy solution: To increase your chances of a good night's sleep make sure your bedroom is a calm and relaxing place and your mattress is comfortable.
Use your bed for sleeping and sex only, so you associate it with rest and pleasure only.
Block out noise and light, as light will impair the production of the sleep hormone, melatonin.
Try to sleep in a well ventilated but not cold room (around 13 -18 C, 55-65 F), as body temperature falls at night to promote feelings of sleepiness.
Underactive thyroid
Your thyroid works by producing the hormone called thyroxine, which controls metabolism and regulates energy levels.
If your thyroid produces too little of it you feel tired. You might gain weight, your skin and hair will feel dry and you may also feel depressed. Energy solution: Ask your doctor for a thyroid test. If you have an under active thyroid he or she will prescribe medication to boost your hormone levels. You should also eat a diet high in fruit, vegetables, fish and seaweed and avoid alcohol and cigarettes.
Your lunch
One in 10 people in the UK has a food intolerance which can cause lethargy and irritability. Food intolerances trigger an immune response which uses up a huge amount of energy. The most common food culprits are wheat, dairy and sugar. So if your lunch was a cheese sandwich on whole wheat bread with a bar of chocolate your body may be using up energy by simply digesting rather than converting your lunch into energy.
Energy solution: If you suspect that you have a food intolerance keep a food diary for a few weeks and see if there is a connection between your tiredness and a specific food.
Try eliminating that food and see if it makes a difference. Alternatively you can have a blood test to check for food allergies.

Hillary Clinton, helped by yoga, sails through Benghazi grilling
US: Even after 11 hours of grilling, Hillary Clinton kept her composure, fending off a Republican panel accusing her of failing to protect the US diplomat mission in Libyas Benghazi where four Americans including the US Ambassador were killed in 2012. Later, when asked about her endurance, the former Secretary of State quipped, Yoga always helps. In the hearing which had a generous share of dramatic moments, one that stood out was Republican Illinois Representative Peter Roskams act. No one recommended closing (the Benghazi US Mission), but you had two ambassadors that made several requests. And heres basically what happened to their request. They were torn up, he said, ripping a paper in half.
But analysts said Hillary Clinton managed to emerge unscathed, and instead wisely used the hearing as a presidential platform. I was the boss of ambassadors in 270 countries.
I was the boss of ambassadors in places like Afghanistan, where shortly before I visited one time, the embassy had been under brutal assault by the Taliban for hours. I am very well aware of the dangers that are faced by our diplomats and our development professionals. There was never a recommendation from Chris Stevens or anyone else to close Benghazi, she said in a statement that pundits declared made her seem like a leader.
The only roadblocks in Hillary Clintons journey to the White House could be Benghazi and her email controversy, analysts say.
The revelation that she used her personal email server for official mails while she was Secretary of State, has hurt her credibility and her trustworthiness ratings sharply nosedived among voters.
The Democrats say the probe is politically motivated, by the Republicans who want to jeopardize Hillary Clintons presidential aspirations, and has wasted 17 months and 4.7 million dollars of taxpayer money.

India paves way for women in army combat roles
INDIA: The Indian government gave its nod Saturday for women to fly fighter jets, paving the way for them to assume combat roles for the first time in one of the worlds largest militaries.
The federal defence ministry gave the green light to a proposal for recruiting female fighter pilots in the Indian Air Force (IAF), where women already fly transport aircraft and helicopters.
With this decision to open up induction of women in the fighter stream, women have become eligible for induction in all branches and streams of the IAF, a defence ministry statement published on Saturday said.
This progressive step is in keeping with the aspirations of Indian women and is in line with contemporary trends in Armed Forces of developed nations, it said, adding that after training, selected women would enter a fighter cockpit by June 2017.
The latest move not only marks the maiden entry of women in combat roles in the IAF but in any branch across the Indian armed forces.
Many countries like the United States, Israel and even arch-rival neighbour Pakistan already allow women as fighter pilots. But India has kept them out of such roles, reportedly fearing women would be more vulnerable to sexual attacks, and worries over lodging and physical fitness.
Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha expressed his reluctance to change tack last year when he said women are by nature not physically suited for flying fighters for long hours.
Since then, increasing numbers of female officers have brought court cases demanding better work conditions and permanent commissions instead of temporary terms of five to ten years. The ministry said it had carried out a review in connection with how to increase roles of women in the forces.
Once finalised more and more branches would be opened up for induction of women to give them the space which they deserve in the Armed Forces of the country, it said.
Women form some five percent of around 1.32 million active personnel and 2.14 million reservists in the defence forces, according to government figures.

It's all in your eyes
Eye is the major attraction of any face and everybody wants their pair of eyes to sparkle with good health and happiness. But Puffy eyes can make you look ill and tired. Dark circles under the eyes make you look older. Today Hasini Gunasekera ,Course Director, International Academy of Beauticians Beauty Talks with T n'c on how to get rid of puffy and tired eyes.
Q: How to treat tired and puffy eyes
Cold Spoons
Applying cold spoons in the eyes is an easy and effective treatment that anyone can try at home and as frequently as they wish. This helps to tighten up the skin around your eyes as well as relax the blood vessels, and giving relief to puffy and tired eyes.
Step 1: Chill a metal spoon in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 2: Hold the rounded portion of one of the cold spoon against your eye for a few minutes until the spoon becomes warm.
Tea Bags
Be it green tea bags or black tea bags, both can help soothe puffy and irritated eyes. They contain anti-irritant properties that help reduce swelling around your eyes. They can also relieve redness and inflammation.
Q: People spend a lot of money on artificial chemical products to get rid of under eye darkness. What is the best home- made remedy to treat dark eyes
Potatoes
Just like cucumbers, potatoes are also effective in getting rid of puffy eyes. The starch present in potatoes has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce under-eye bags. This remedy is also helpful for fading dark circles under eyes.
Step 1:Peel, wash and dry a medium-size potato.
Step 2:Grate the potato and put the shavings in a clean cotton cloth and tie it up.
Step 3:Place this cloth over your eyelids for several minutes.
Q: There are mixed views about using green tea eye wash solution on your eyes. Is it safe to use it to cleanse your eyes
Researchers say the compounds responsible for many of the health benefits of green tea are capable of penetrating the tissues of the eyes and can have antioxidant activity there. It has a high concentration of antioxidants called catechins. This is known to help protect the delicate tissues of the eyes, yet it's important to use it with great care. This is definitely not to cleanse any makeup applied to the eyes but rather for its soothing ability.
Q: How to get rid of under eye wrinkles
* Avoid the sun as much as you can
* Wear sunglasses
* Drink plenty of water
* Get adequate sleep and rest
* Avoid scratching your eyes as a habit
Q: What are the best eye care practices one should follow to get glowing healthy eyes. Also comment on the importance of wearing sunglasses, drinking water and getting adequate sleep.
Water
The easiest way to get rid of puffy eyes is to drink water. When the body is well hydrated, there is less chance of water retention that can cause your under-eye area and other parts of your body to swell. Water also helps flush toxins out of the body.
To stay well hydrated, drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water each day. In addition to this, you must reduce the amount of salt you eat to reduce water retention in the body. Also, avoid caffeinated and carbonated beverages that can be dehydrating.
Get adequate sleep.
When you don't get enough sleep, the body produces excess cortisol, a hormone that breaks down skin cells. Get enough rest, and you'll produce more human growth hormone, which helps skin remain thick, more elastic, and less likely to wrinkle.
Sunglasses
Sunglasses can block out UV rays so the fragile skin around the eyes is protected from sun damage. But, the glasses must have adequate UV filters in them.
Q: Is applying eye creams a must
What the eye area really needs are antioxidants, cell-communicating ingredients, and skin-repairing ingredients, in a soothing, fragrance-free formula, just like what you need for the rest of the face. In fact, if you're already using a gentle yet effective moisturizer or serum, it may be perfect for the eye area, too.
The exception is if the skin around your eyes is drier (which is true for many of us), in that case you need a more emollient formula, and that's where the best eye creams excel.
This is especially true for those with oily skin who may not be using a moisturizer on their face at all or are using only a very thin gel or liquid-based moisturizer. In that case, an eye cream must be purchased to only use around the eyes.
Q: What is your beauty tip for this week
A home remedy for wrinkles under eyes:
Pineapple
The juice of pineapple is known to have active enzyme known as bromelain, which is an anti inflammatory agent and a natural alpha hydroxyl acid that can help treat wrinkles. Pineapple has astringent properties as well as it helps exfoliate the skin.
Take some juice and apply on the eye wrinkles.

Maureen OHara dies aged 95
US: Maureen O'Hara, the flame-haired star of How Green Was My Valley and Miracle on 34th Street who was one of Ireland's most successful acting exports, has died aged 95, her family and the Irish president said Saturday.
O'Hara, an iconic figure in Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1940s and 1950s who was once considered one of the world's most beautiful women, also played a string of feisty women opposite John Wayne, including in The Quiet Man.
In her memoir, O'Hara recalled Wayne saying: I've had many friends, and I prefer the company of men, except for Maureen O'Hara... She is a great guy.
Her family said that the star, who had dual US-Irish citizenship and starred in more than 60 films, died at home in Boise, Idaho.
It is with a sad heart that we share the news that Maureen O'Hara passed away today in her sleep of natural causes, they said in a statement cited by The Irish Times newspaper.
Maureen was our loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and friend. She passed peacefully surrounded by her loving family as they celebrated her life listening to music from her favourite movie, The Quiet Man, they said.
Her characters were feisty and fearless, just as she was in real life. She was also proudly Irish and spent her entire lifetime sharing her heritage and the wonderful culture of the Emerald Isle with the world.
Ireland's President Michael Higgins spoke of his great sadness at the news in a statement.
She will be remembered as an outstanding and versatile actress, whose work especially in film, will endure for many years to come, he said.
Irish Arts Minister Heather Humphreys added: Maureen O'Hara left Ireland to carve a successful life in America but in the hearts and minds of every Irish person, Maureen was the quintessential Irish success story.
I've always been a tough Irish lass, O'Hara told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in a 2004 interview.
I proved there was a bloody good actress in me. It wasn't just my face. I gave bloody good performances.
Known as the queen of Technicolor due to her red hair and green eyes, O'Hara was born in Ranelagh, south Dublin, in 1920.
According to her autobiography 'Tis Herself, she started acting opposite her own shadow aged five.
Still in her teens, she was brought to Hollywood in 1939 by legendary actor Charles Laughton and her first film was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, playing Esmerelda to his Quasimodo.
In 1941, she drew critical acclaim in Oscar-winning Welsh family saga How Green Was My Valley, directed by John Ford.
And by 1947, she was appearing as mother of the young Natalie Wood in Miracle on 34th Street.
Later movies included The Parent Trap in 1961 but in the 1970s, she retired from acting to run an airline with her third husband aviator Charles Blair. After he died, she became the first woman in US history to head a scheduled commercial airline.
O'Hara was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2014.
US studio 20th Century Fox remembered the actress who made generations of us believe.
American actress Jessica Chastain, mostly recently seen in the blockbuster The Martian, praised the screen legend.
RIP #MaureenOHara from one tough redhead broad to another. Thankful for the light you shared, she said on Twitter.
According to US media reports, she will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington alongside her husband, a US Navy pilot.

Modi has let down SL Tamils - Narayanasamy
AICC general secretary and former Union Minister for State V. Narayanasamy has charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with indulging in doublespeak in pressing the Sri Lankan government for an international probe into the alleged war crimes and human rights violations during the civil war in 2009.
Talking to reporters in Puducherry on Saturday, Mr. Narayanasamy said the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and the then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, had constantly insisted that an international probe should be conducted into the war crimes.
However, the then Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had declined to accept the demand. The current President, Maithripala Sirisena, has also taken a stand against the demand for an international probe triggering strong protests from political parties in Tamil Nadu.
Mr. Narayanasamy said that Mr. Modi had visited Sri Lanka and signed several pacts.
However, he failed to persuade the Sri Lankan government for an international inquiry and had ignored the pleas of various political parties in Tamil Nadu.
Mr. Modi had been indulging in doublespeak and let down the Tamils in the island nation. The Sri Lankan government had also covered up the crux of the report and not taken any action.
Mr. Narayanasamy also wanted the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre to take immediate steps to secure the release of 54 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Karaikal who were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. (The Hindu)

People spread racism for their survival - Anura
JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday that various people spread racism for their political survival in the past and the end result was that the country had to suffer from a 30-year long war.
We still do not know the number of people dead and the exact cost spent on the war. Finally, the innocent people had to pay the price, but not by those who spread racism.
Participating in the debate on the Geneva based UNHRC report, MP Dissanayake said it was compulsory to promote harmony among all communities if the country wished to move forward and to do so, we have to accept the fact that they too have equal rights. A solution to the ethnic problem may be impossible unless the fundamental needs of the people in the North and East are fulfilled.
TNA hoped that India would solves this problem. But it did not happen. They commenced a large number of projects in the North and East such as renovation of the Northern Railway track, but not a single job was given to the youth in those regions.
They have also exploited the fish of our innocent fishermen in the North and East. Not only India, but also many Western Nations, including the US had not genuinely helped us to solve our problems. This is only a part of their political agenda. Today Jaffna has turned into a den of India's RAW spy service. They attempt to create political instability in Jaffna. We should put a stop to it.
It is a right of every citizen to know what exactly happened during the post conflict period. If we do not expose them, the rulers would continue to repeat such mistakes. We wish to to know what really happened to those who had been abducted during the time of the war. Lalith and Kugan were abducted. We still do not known what had happened to them.

Police try to identify bodies from French horror crash
FRANCE: French investigators on Saturday began identifying the 43 victims of a horrific coach crash, while combing the burnt wreckage for clues to what caused the countrys worst road accident in three decades.
A coach carrying members of a pensioners club on an excursion collided with a lorry and burst into flames on Friday near the village of Puisseguin, among the vineyards of the Saint-Emilion area near Bordeaux, plunging southwest France into mourning.
President Francois Hollandes office said he will lead a memorial on Tuesday for those killed in Frances deadliest crash since 1982, in the tiny nearby village of Petit-Palais-et-Cornemps, where many of the victims came from.
The ferocity of the blaze reduced the coach to a charred shell and police experts say DNA tests and dental records will be needed to identify the victims, many of whom were burned alive.
Officials said the identification process could take up to three weeks.
Four bodies -- those of the lorry-driver and his three-year-old son as well as two of the bus passengers -- were removed from the wreckage and transferred to a morgue in Bordeaux.
At the scene of the collision, around 20 investigators in white overalls pored over the remains of the two vehicles. More specialists are expected to arrive on Monday to probe the crash, including why the fire spread so quickly.
Only eight people managed to escape, including the coach driver. One survivor told Saturday of the horrifying speed with which the blaze took hold, and of the desperate efforts to rescue people from the burning vehicle.
The fire broke out straight away -- it was like lightning, retired carpenter Jean-Claude Leonardet, 73, told Le Parisien newspaper.
We went back to pull two people who were trapped on the stairs and couldnt get out. We couldnt go back there -- the fire and the smoke were overwhelming.
In the absence of bodies, 43 white roses were laid out at the local mortuary in symbolic tribute to the victims.
Investigators will study the lorrys tachograph, a type of black box that records the vehicles speed and journey time, for clues.
But Ghislain Rety, police colonel in the Gironde region, warned it was in a very, very damaged state.
Its too early to say if it will be usable, he said. The wreckage of both vehicles will also be examined to try to establish the circumstances of the crash.
The specialists work has similarities with the identification of air crash victims, and some of the investigators worked on the Germanwings disaster that killed 150 people in the Alps earlier this year.
The experts must still determine exactly how many passengers were on the coach as the only official list was on board and burned in the fire. The pensioners had been heading south to the nearby region of Landes to visit an outlet and museum specialising in Bayonne ham, a local delicacy.
In Petit-Palais-et-Cornemps, with a population of just 756, residents seemed overwhelmed by the tragedy, gathering in the village square to console one another.
We are here to help our friends who are still here, our friends who are left, said Gerard Garem, 70, who lost a number of friends in the crash.
We have no words to say.
The crash is the deadliest in France since August 1982, when 53 people including 44 children were killed in a motorway pile-up in the eastern Burgundy region.
The lorry driver was identified as a 31-year-old man from the village of Saint-Germain-de-Clairefeuille in northwestern France, where locals said they were stunned by the tragedy.

Potter now a middle-aged father of three!
Rowling reveals two-part play based on her books depicts wizard 19 years after leaving Hogwarts
For almost two decades, children have grown up enthralled by the adventures of Harry Potter as an aspiring young wizard, pitching his wits and wonder against his nemesis Voldemort.
But a new play presents a rather more prosaic picture of the former pupil of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
In what will come as a shock to his legion of fans, Potter is now a middle-aged father of three, trying to cope with an overburdened in-tray in his job at the Ministry of Magic.
His youngest son, Albus, is struggling to cope with growing up as the son of a celebrity wizard.
Based on a new story by JK Rowling, the author of the seven Potter novels, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will have its West End premiere next year.
The play is being staged in two parts, intended to be seen in order, either as a matinee and evening performance or on consecutive evenings.
The device effectively guarantees that audiences will pay twice to see the full show.
The play, written by Jack Thorne, is expected to sell out quickly, given the success of Rowling's books, which sold more than 400million copies worldwide, and their film adaptations.
On Twitter, Rowling told fans yesterday: So now you know it really isn't a prequel: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child starts 19 years later!
She added: The story only exists because the right group of people came together with a brilliant idea about how to present Harry Potter on stage.
I'm confident that when audiences see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they will understand why we chose to tell this story in this way.
Rowling, Thorne and a third writer, John Tiffany, said they wanted to explore Harry's world in a brand new way through the live form of theatre.
They added: Collaborating on this story is exhilarating for all of us, and we can't wait to present the eighth story next summer.
The publicity material promises a show as enthralling as the novels.
It states: While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.
As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.
Four special preview performances are planned for the end of May, details of which will be announced at a later date. The main previews begin at London's Palace Theatre on June 7, with the opening performances on July 30.

Russia offers air cover for anti-Assad rebels, urges polls
RUSSIA: Russia said Saturday it was ready to provide air support for Western-backed moderate rebels battling both jihadists and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as Moscow presses on with its diplomatic offensive over the conflict.
Speaking after a surprise summit between Syrias embattled leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin this week, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged moves towards presidential and parliamentary polls in the war-torn country.
Representatives of Syrias Western-backed opposition sounded incredulous, saying Russia should first stop bombing moderate rebels and that talk of elections was premature.
On the ground, Syrian troops backed by Russian air strikes battled fighters from the Islamic State (IS) group in a bid to restore a key supply line to second city Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
At least 28 IS fighters and 21 troops and pro-regime militia have been killed in the battle for the road leading to the government-held part of Aleppo, it said.
The monitors also reported Russian strikes in northern Hama province and said six people, including three children, were killed in what was believed to be a Russian strike on the village of Al-Barqun in Aleppo province.
Russia and the West have been at loggerheads over Assads fate, a major sticking point in efforts to solve a crisis that has killed more than 250,000 people since 2011 and sparked an exodus of around four million refugees.
Seeking to shake off months of Western isolation over the Ukraine conflict, Putin last month launched air strikes in Syria and has since launched negotiations with the wars key regional players, including some of Assads worst enemies, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

Seetha Devi in 3-1 win
Seetha Devi Girls College, Kandy put up a superlative performance to defeat the visiting Queen Margaret College (London) United Kingdom 3-1 in a thriller in a hockey match played at the University Grounds, Peradeniya. At half time the scores were deadlocked at one all.
The standard of hockey rose to high standards and the visiting girls put up a gritty performance on a grass court which they are not familiar. They could have even reversed the results if this match was played on astro turf where they could have had better ball control.
Seetha Devian drew first blood when centre forward Shenali Fernando scooped a pass to centre half Charuka Abeyratne who sounded the boards.
But hardly had the shouting died down the visitors fought back to equalise through centre forward Amelia Gayodan. With the scores level the teams went for lemon.
The second half saw a bitter fight with the visiting team more on the offensive.
On one such occasion Seetha Devi's right back Madhumali Karunatilleke decided to have a go and with a long and strong drive caught the visiting team's defence on the wrong foot. Madhumali's strong drive converted into a pass was collected by centre forward Tharaki Paranagama who in turn took play into the semi circle and beat the visiting teams custodian to score.
Seetha Devi's third goal too was fashioned by right back Madhumali Karunatillake whose desperate clearance reached substitute centre forward Ahimsa Devatillini who sold a dummy to the visiting defence to score.

More specifically, saying that hello at 11.17am could be the difference between winning or losing the day. The reason for this, the survey found, is that this time is the point of the week at which we feel most unhappy.
But it's not all doom and gloom. Actually, it's pretty easy to keep us happy - and truly, it's the little things.
This research has revealed that 90 per cent us believe that it only takes something tiny to spice up a previously rubbish day. These include stumbling upon a bargain, a spontaneous hug and even having a car stop to let us cross the road.
Half of those surveyed said that taking the time to do a good deed for someone else cheers them up, suggesting that we're not merely a nation completely obsessed with me-me-me.
Psychologist Jo Hemmings isn't completely surprised by this. We think it's the big things - the dream house, expensive holiday or flashy car - that make us the happy, but the secret is so much simpler, she says.
Holding open a door or saying good morning can make a real difference to someone's day; and the good news is that it will make you feel better too!
These were the top 10 small things that Plusnet found would improve your day. But which one would make you feel good

SL to release 86 Tamil Nadu fishermen
Eighty-six Tamil Nadu fishermen, who were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy in the past two months, would be released on October 28, the state government said today. The state government would also release two Sri Lankan fishermen in its custody on the same day, it said.
"The Union government has informed that Sri Lanka would release 86 fishermen (hailing from Tamil Nadu) on October 28," an official release said.
Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has ordered all steps to bring them back.
The release of fishermen was the outcome of Jayalalithaa's "continuous efforts", the release said.
The Tamil Nadu fishermen belong to Nagapattinam, Pudukottai, Tuticorin and Ramanathapuram districts were arrested and lodged in jails in Sri Lanka between September 22 and October 14 this year.
"They were apprehended while fishing in their traditional fishing areas of Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar," the release said.
Following this, Ms Jayalalithaa took up the issue strongly with the Centre. She had written seven letters to Prime Minister Modi seeking his intervention at the highest political level with Sri Lanka for the release of the fishermen. (NDTV)

On TukTuk for a worthy cause!
Forty Asia-based European and Asian senior corporate executives reached their final destination in Matara, ending their ride which commenced in Jaffna under the banner Pimp My TukTuk Sri Lanka - 2015. This rally was sponsored by David Pieris Motor Company Ltd, the first automotive company to introduce the Bajaj three-wheeler to Sri Lanka.
Participating in a charitable ride to raise US$ 100,000 to set up a reverse osmosis plant for water purification in Anuradhapura and a Boys orphanage in Valvaagam in Jaffna, these drivers covered a distance of 1,000 km, riding from Jaffna to Matara, with stopovers at major towns en-route.
In Ratnapura, participants were warmly received by the staff of David Pieris Motor Company Ltd, who served them traditional Sri Lankan Helapa, Pol Roti and Beli-Mal drink, to the accompaniment of music provided by much-loved Sri Lankan Papare band. Upon reaching Matara, they were served refreshing Thambili (King coconut) and traditional short eats such as Kewun, Kokis, Aasmiand Kiribath. A fitting culmination of a long, yet, enjoyable journey.
David Pieris Motor Company, as sponsors, played an immensely supportive role throughout this rally, providing the riders with the skills required to handle the three-wheelers, as well as familiarization with the terrain. In addition, the riders were accompanied by the Bajaj Service three wheeler and crew members, who provided technical and maintenance support to ensure their safety and well-being.
The expatriate drivers were most appreciative of the support extended by David Pieris Motor Company and the Bajaj team. They were also pleased with the cheering and camaraderie shown by the extended Bajaj family of three-wheeler drivers, dealers and spare parts vendors all along the way.

Use snail mail to thwart spies, Assange tells journalists
US: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has urged journalists to use regular postal services to thwart government spying.
My recommendation, for people who dont have 10 years experience in cryptography, is to return to old methods (and) use the traditional postal service, Assange said in an interview published Saturday.
Journalists are treated by intelligence services as spies, he told the Belgian daily Le Soir. The same methods used against spies are used against journalists, and now journalists must learn counter-espionage methods to protect their sources. On Thursday WikiLeaks released a second instalment of documents from CIA director John Brennans hacked personal email account, including his contacts list.
Assange, in another interview with the Belgian daily LEcho, reiterated that WikiLeaks would release more of Brennans documents on Monday, which he described as documents awaited by many human rights activists and lawyers, but also people who were tortured.
He added that WikiLeaks would soon post information about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).
In August, WikiLeaks offered 100,000 euros ($110,000) for a copy of the trade deal.
Assange is to contribute by video conference to a debate Monday on political transparency and protection of privacy to be held in Brussels.
