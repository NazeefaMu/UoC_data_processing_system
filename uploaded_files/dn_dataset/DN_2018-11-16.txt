Deraniyagala, Kithulgala record highest TB patients in Kegalle
Deraniyagala and Kithulgala have recorded the highest number of tuberculosis (TB) patients in Kegalle. A female health officer who had checked patients for tuberculosis had been transferred to a national hospital without a replacement. As such, steps should be taken to fill this vacancy immediately, Deraniyagala Urban Councillor member from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) M. Ruwan Chaminda Perera said.
He was addressing other urban councillors at a meeting held on November 8. Deraniyagala UC Chairman A.B.W. Lakshman Rajakaruna said schoolchildren could not attend school on time as the Deraniyagala Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Depot's school bus, which was scheduled to leave the Deraniyagala bus stand to Erathne via Malibada at 7.00 am, was now departing at 7.30 am.
United National Party Councillor R. Indika Prasad Ranasinghe said fish stall owners at the Deraniyagala public market had incurred losses in sales since a brother of a former chairman was engaged in van sales in the area using a fish market van. This was an injustice for traders who had leased stalls through tenders, he added.
UC Chairman Rajakaruna said the Deraniaygala town had become unclean due to fish strewn around the town, adding that he would take immediate action with the assistance from the police and health authorities.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Councillor P. Sujeewa Nanda Pathirana said the construction of houses in the Asamana Kanda housing scheme earmarked for landslide victims had been postponed halfway. Chairman Rajakaruna said beneficiaries of the scheme had been provided with five to seven-perch lands through the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) and the Estate Management and Valuation Department to build houses with their own labour contribution.
United National Party Councillor W. Govindasamy said the daily wage of estate workers should be increased to Rs.1,000 since they could not make ends-meet with the present wage. Thereafter, the chairman introduced the council Budget for 2019 and it was approved by one vote, with 10 members voting in favour and 9 members opposing it.

Mud fever : Leptospirosis in dogs
Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection in dogs coursed by organism called L. Pomona. This organism damages the organs in the entire body, reproducing in the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, eyes, and reproductive system. The extent to which this bacteria affects the organs will depend on your dogs immune system and its ability to eradicate the infection fully.
The Leptospira spirochete bacteria is zoonotic, meaning that it can be transmitted to humans and other animals and it is lethal to human. Children are most at risk of acquiring the bacteria from an infected pet while they handle the pet dog.
Spread of organism
This bacterium has special characteristic as it can burrow through the skin of the dog. Leptospires are transmitted to cattle via maintenance hosts. Maintenance hosts are a constant source of infection and typically do not show clinical signs. As silent-carrier animals, they maintain the bacteria and transmit Leptospires to other animals.
Transmission is efficient, with incidence of infection relatively high. Maintenance hosts can be carriers for months, years or even a lifetime. In the case of L. canicola, the sole maintenance host is the dog. As such, only dogs transmit the bacteria, infecting each other and other animals (cattle and pigs)
Area the organism live
The Leptospira spirochete infection mainly occurs in subtropical, tropical, and wet environments. Leptospira spirochetes are more prevalent in marshy/muddy areas which have stagnant surface water and are frequented by wildlife. The Leptospira bacteria in infected water, soil, or mud, while swimming, passing through, or drinking contaminated water, or from coming into contact with urine from an infected animal.
Most susceptible animals
Younger animals with less developed immune systems are at the highest risk for severe complications.
Signs
The organism affect the whole body of the dog getting sudden fever, sore in muscles, reluctance to move, stiffness in muscles, legs, stiff gait, shivering, weakness, depression, lack of appetite, increased thirst and urination, may be indicative of chronic renal (kidney) failure, progressing to inability to urinate, rapid dehydration, vomiting, possibly with blood, diarrhea - with or without blood in stool, bloody vaginal discharge, dark red speckled gums, yellow skin and/or whites of eyes  anemic symptoms, spontaneous cough, difficulty breathing, fast breathing, irregular pulse, runny nose, swelling of the mucous membrane, mild swelling of the lymph nodes
Leptospira spirochetes can remain in the kidneys, reproducing there and infecting the urine. Infection of the liver or kidneys can be fatal for animals if the infection progresses, causing severe damage to these organs.
Diagnosis
In Sri Lanka most of the Veterinary clinics have facilities to diagnose Leptospirosis. Urine and blood cultures will also be used for examining the prevalence of the bacteria.
Treatment
There is no complete cure for the disease when the animal gets the disease. The supportive treatment such as fluid therapy, support for the affected organs, calm and quiet environment will help. Also it is advised to keep the dog in ICU under strict veterinary supervision.
Prevention of the disease
Vaccination is the prevention method practiced in Sri Lanka. The vaccine is a triple vaccine called as DHL where the L stands for Canine Leptospirosis. The vaccine should be given to all pet dogs as an initial vaccine, booster vaccine and annual vaccine. The vaccine present in Sri Lanka is against L. canicola. Strict kennel sanitation, rodent control, and strict isolation of infected animals are all appropriate to decrease exposure to and the spread of Leptospirosis
Vaccine schedule in Sri Lanka
The 1st vaccine for pet dogs is given at the age of 8 weeks and booster vaccine is at the age of 3 months. Thereafter annual vaccination is needed.
Handling Leptospirosis affected dogs
As all body systems damaged and the disease is fatal you should give maximum comfort to your animal.
Prevention of human infection
First and utmost important precautionary measure is the timely vaccination of your pet dog. Also protect your dog at young stage until the booster vaccine is given to maximize the immunity. You should not share the chairs, beds with your pet dogs. While cleaning the kennel you should wear protective gears. In order to minimize the human infection protective latex gloves must be worn at all times, and all body fluids will be treated as a biologically hazardous material. Urine, semen, post-abortion discharge, vomit, and any fluid that leaves the body will need to be handled with extreme caution.

Ant illustrations
For those with a fear of creepy crawlies, the thought of using live insects to create art might send shivers up their spine. However, artist Iantha Naicker finds the idea enjoyable and does so by incorporating real, live ants into her animal illustrations.
Naicker bribes the ants with sugar, coaxing them to gather on her artwork in certain areas.
She explains, [I leave] tiny amounts of sugar on a piece of paper to lure them into my drawings. From a lions mane to rhino tusks, the insects scurry around the page, creating the missing animal elements. However, this unconventional medium doesnt stay in one place for long, so Naicker quickly snaps photos of her work to capture the ants at the right moment. She reveals, It gets tricky because they move around quickly and I have to record as fast as I can.
In addition to using real insects, Naicker also creates nature-inspired illustrations, featuring hundreds of hand-drawn ants. Similar to pointillism or dot art, each tiny, incredibly realistic ant joins to create a full image. This concept illustrates the insects mentality to work as a team to achieve better results.

Anuradhapura farmers seek relief under Bimsaviya land grant programme
Farmer organisations in the Anuradhapura district request that the conditions in relation to the Bimsaviya land alienation scheme be revised and the surveying and other fees be reduced.
The representatives of Mahakanadarawa, Rajangane, Padaviya, Wahalkade, Nachchaduwa, Nuwarawewa and Galenbidunawewa farmer organisations made this request to the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the Additional Government Agent (Land), at a recent meeting of the Anuradhapura Land Commissioners district agriculture committee.
Referring to the matter, Rajangane integrated farmer organisations Chairman Nihal Wanniarachchi said that the majority of land being surveyed for issuing Bimsaviya ownership certificates belonged to low-income group farmer families and it was not justifiable to levy a sum of around Rs. 75,000 per allotment for surveying, etc.
According to the Land Commissioners Department, under the present system, low-income group landowners were required to bear expenses such as payment to the government Survey Department for supervision and the licensed surveyor for surveying the particular land for becoming eligible for a Bimsaviya ownership certificate.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake commenting on the matter told the Daily News that he has instructed the Anuradhapura Deputy Land Commissioner Sandya Abesekara to take up the matter with the Land Ministry for granting some relief since the low-income group families face the problem of heavy charges under the Bimsaviya programme.

Admiral Clancy Fernando: A patriot beyond compare
The 26th death anniversary of Admiral Clancy Fernando, the 11th Commander of the Navy, falls today. His name is etched in history as the highest-ranking military officer to make the supreme sacrifice in Sri Lanka. He was an admiral of fiery enthusiasm and unswerving commitment to his country. Admiral Fernando was assassinated on November 16, 1992, at 8.35 am on the Galle Face Centre Road in the heart of Colombo, when an LTTE suicidal cadre rammed an explosive-laden motorcycle into his vehicle. He was on his way to Naval Headquarters at Flagstaff Street in Galle Buck, Colombo 1, from his official residence, the Navy House at Longdon Place, Colombo 7. He was travelling in his official car, a Mercedes Benz, clad in his white naval uniform with the Naval Ensign fluttering in the flag stand and the distinguished Star Plates displayed in the fore and aft. Thats the way Admiral Fernando moved about during his tenure as the Commander of the Navy.
It was a sunny day and I called the Admiral at the Navy House to explain how a series of strange events prevented me from joining him on the drive from his official residence to the Naval Headquarters. By then, he was getting ready to leave and said, Thank you, Ill be there, not knowing that it was the last telephone conversation he would ever have.
After a few minutes, I switched on the communication set to monitor his movement. Suddenly, I heard a confused exchange of messages and my office telephone started ringing. On the line was Monica Fernando, the wife of Admiral Fernando; she could only say Shemal.
Within seconds, I whisked off in my vehicle and as I drove past the old Parliament along the Galle Face Centre Road, I saw it all. As I approached the scene, many things crossed my mind. Until I saw Admiral Fernando lying face-down inside the car which had turned turtle, I did not believe that he was dead. Then I realised that it was all over and that terrorists had snatched from our midst a courageous admiral.
To die with no time for fear or regrets, doing what he enjoyed as a brave naval officer to the end; not with a whimper, but with a bang that reverberated around the worldthat truly was the fate he would have chosen for himself. That was my recollection of the gruesome assassination of Admiral Clancy Fernando. I deemed it a privilege to have known him, received his wise counsel and enjoyed serving him as his Aide and Personal Secretary throughout his tenure of office, which spanned from August 1, 1991 to November 16, 1992. He was indeed an admirable admiral.
I wish to briefly comment on his career, especially on the qualities that struck me most about him during the times I spent under him: firstly in the picturesque Naval Dockyard in Trincomalee in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and then at the Naval Headquarters in 1991 and 1992, as it is impossible to pay an adequate tribute to cover his entire life.
Admiral Clancy Fernando was born on October 10, 1938, as Wannakuwatta Waduge Erwin Clancy Fernando and later received his education at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. In the 1950's, the Royal Navy was not merely the greatest fighting force afloat, but had also been so since far beyond living memory and assumed that it would remain so always. It was, indeed professional, performing what it was taught to do with skill and dedication. To be a Naval Officer and to be able to be trained at the greatest and most efficient service the world has ever seen was to belong to an exclusive elite. The most usual practice was for aspirant naval officers to join as cadets and undergo initial training in the Royal Ceylon Navy and continue to the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, United Kingdom.
Young Clancy Fernando decided that a life on the seas was his destiny; he joined the Royal Ceylon Navy on December 17, 1957. His path into the navy was smoothed by ardent desire; his success within it was owed to his merit and efficiency. Admiral Fernando once recalled those days at Dartmouth: The cadets wore a uniform of a heavy cloth that never kept its shape and boots and starched collars were compulsory. Everything was done at the double, whether or not there was need for hurry. To toughen the boys in mind and body was a constant preoccupation.
Most of his early days in the then Royal Ceylon Navy were at Trincomalee, Tangalle and Karainagar besides his long spells at sea. He had served on board the HMCyS Aliya and HMCyS Gajabahu, a frigate which was the then Flag Ship. He also commanded the HMCyS Diyakawa, SLNS Ranakamee and the SLNS Samudra Devi, the Flag Ship of the Sri Lanka Navy in 1980.
Into every pursuit he hurled himself with an abandon that was always invigoratingand sometimes alarming. He demanded the highest standards from himself and from everyone else. Yet, his professionalism was not cold or calculated; he took enormous pleasure in everything he did and communicated it to everyone around him. He attended the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, India, in 1977. He was then promoted to the rank of Commander on March 1, 1978. He held the appointments of Commanding Officer of the SLNS Tissa in the East, Commanding Officer of the SLNS Elara in the North, and as the Master of the Ceylon Shipping Corporations M/V Lanka Kanthi.
On June 30, 1983, he was made the Director Naval Operations and with his promotion to the rank of Captain on January 1, 1984, he was appointed the Commandant of the Naval and Maritime Academy and made invaluable contributions towards moulding young officers and men. If naval officers genuinely wanted to get onto achieve success in some activity, however trivialhe would go to endless pains to help them. I recall his inspiration to improve my journalistic skills. A man best qualified for the Naval Service, he was spectacularly successful. Hard work and efficiency made him a constructive and thoughtful architect for the future. He was elevated to Commodore on July 1, 1986 and held key appointments as the Commander Western Naval Area, Commander Eastern Naval Area, and Security Forces Commander of Trincomalee, where he proved his strengths as a competent and an efficient administrator.
Then he was elevated to the position of Chief of Staff on April 4, 1990. He held memberships of the British Institute of Management, the Nautical Institute of UK and the Royal Naval Institute of Navigation, UK. He possessed a Masters Degree in Defence Studies and had been conferred with the Master Mariner Certificate. He was the first President of the Sri Lanka Branch of the Nautical Institute, UK. He was promoted Rear Admiral on March 29, 1991.
Admiral Fernando was in good stead when his career took its next and decisive turn; he was made Acting Commander of the Navy on August 1, 1991. This ultimate promotion consoled him for some, at least, of the pains and fortified him for the struggles that lay ahead. It did, but until the official letter arrived he did not allow himself to be certain that he had achieved the ambition of his lifetime to reach the helm of the Navy.
First Day as COMNAV was his diary entry for Day 1. From the word go, I saw him work towards the betterment of the navy. Everything seemed to take off the ground all at once. For his 50-odd years, he displayed an energy and enthusiasm that would shame a younger officer. In what his greatness laid is harder to define. What he could do with superlative aplomb was to identify the object at which he was aiming, select the method, and force it through to its conclusion.
A powerful analytical mind of crystalline clarity, a superabundance of energy, great persuasive powers and endless resilience in the face of disaster rendered him the most formidable of Commanders. His was a dynamic personality blended with charm and magnanimity, but it was his quality of gentleman leadership that always stole the show. Wherever he went, whatever he did, he blazed the trail for others to follow. Undoubtedly, he inspired all who served and sailed under him. During this time, he played an active role in all military operations and was a familiar sight on the frontlines. In Vettilakeni, Pooneryn, Nagativanturai and Elephant Pass, and even regularly travelling on small naval crafts on the Kilali Lagoon, he took great risks to boost the morale of his men and exhort them. He was a dedicated leader to his men who gave his commitment to defending the national cause of peace, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
He rendered splendid logistic support to the successful joint operations that were carried out in the North. It was the naval backing that enabled the forces to expand the forward defence line in Jaffna. His courage, energy and determination were unrivalled. Reluctant or not, he took considerable pride in his performance. I could still remember him walking on the unclear path leading to Elephant Pass within minutes after the siege was broken. His patience, integrity and devotion to duty struck me as extraordinary.
The admiral was unfailingly courteous and considerate. His tolerance was extraordinary; his readiness to respect and listen to the views of others was remarkable throughout his life. He would always say Dont worry, every problem has a solution and explain carefully what should be done next. He was infinitely resourceful, quick in his reactions, and always ready to cut his losses and start again. He did not know despair.
He always had time for each and everyone who sought his advice or assistance, and with patience of a monument listened, he advised and helped them even in the smallest way possible.
The little acts of kindness he did from day to day were remarkable. He strode the navy like a colossus during his tenure of office, always giving his best. For achievements he never took credit alone; spread applause thick, sharing it with his peers and colleagues; but blame and criticism was received by him and him alone. He attended the prestigious National Defence College in New Delhi, India in 1987. As a devout Buddhist, he displayed the quality of equanimity to its fullest. I was amazed when at times he faced triumph and disaster alike. Similarly, Admiral Fernando accepted any defeat and faced many in his day with a sense of stoic calm. It was he who revived and formed Buddhist, Christian, Muslim and Hindu Councils in the Sri Lanka Navy in 1991.
This resulted in the conduct of religious events to commemorate the Navy Day annually, as well as to bestow blessings on the Navy, Naval personnel and their families. Admiral Fernandos idea of relaxation was to turn to his pastimes. He took a keen interest in naval history and displayed his scholastic skills by publishing several articles. His book on Customs and Etiquette of the Services depicts his vast experience and knowledge of the subject. By devising the first-ever cryptographic system Sinhale in the Sri Lanka Navy, he exhibited the miracles of modern communication. It replaced the Royal Navys Britese System. He took a lively interest in the affairs of the retired naval personnel as well. One significant event he personally organised with great pride was the Sea Burial of ashes of the 4th Commander of the Navy, Rear Admiral Royce de Mel. It was also him who initiated action to construct a monument in honour of the war heroes of the Sri Lanka Navy in Welisara in 1991.
Admiral Fernando was the brainchild of the Navys President Colours and Staff. His enthusiasm towards tracing the history of naval guns and canons was noteworthy and the same paved the way for the establishment of the Naval Museum in Naval Dockyard, Trincomalee. He was instrumental in introducing the new look Navy List in 1991.
Admiral Fernando was an all-round sportsman and rendered yeoman service to uplift sports in the navy. Someone once asked him which he preferred: tennis, shooting or golf. After a moments reflection he replied, Well, golf, after all, is a professionals game. He was in his early 50's when he embarked on golf, but he really enjoyed it. His was a place for family reunion: a few friends were asked to stay, but only if it was known that they would fit in happily with the established patters of existence. To his family and close friends, Admiral Fernando was the wisest, most honourable of men. His was a Naval family, and his happiness was centred on it.
He was a devoted husband to his wife Monica and loveable father to his sons Nishan and Dinukh and daughter Sashi. Even after his demise, the family continued to value rich customs and traditions of the 'Silent Service' he belonged to. If you read the poem If by Rudyard Kipling and A Fathers Prayer by General Douglas MacArthur, you might tend to wonder how close they would have been to Admiral Fernando. He used the media more effectively through hospitality and regular briefings. As with every flamboyant, determined and above all, successful figure, his activities took on a different air according to the angle from which they were viewed.
A man of strong reactions, he inspired strong leavened by a grudging respect; he inspired strong reactions in others. He was a leader for whom men would die, who inspired absolute trust and loyalty. The days as the Commander of the Navy were no doubt the best days of his life. The lines of the English poet, Why did they fell this mighty oak beneath whose benevolent shade so many found refuge often comes to my mind. I was travelling with Admiral Fernando when the news of the Araly blast which took the lives of General Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Rear Admiral Mohan Jayamaha and Major General Wijaya Wimalarathne on August 8, 1992, was conveyed to him on the communication set. We were returning from Marawila after attending a wedding of a naval officer. The sad news broke his heart; it was undoubtedly the saddest moment of his tenure as the Commander of the Navy.
He initiated steps to conduct a Memorial Service in honour of all officers and men who were killed at Araly within a few days at All Saints Church, Colombo 8. The Chief Celebrant was present Cardinal Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith who applauded the admiral's magnanimity. At his final voyage, I had the honour to be the Insignia Bearer as per naval ceremonials and proudly carried Admiral Fernandos medals right behind the majestic Gun Carriage, which bore his coffin draped with the National Flag.
It was Admiral Fernando who designed the Navys Gun Carriage and the same remains in the Sri Lanka Navy as a lasting monument to his memory. This tribute is an attempt to retain Admiral Clancy Fernandos life and ideals fresh in our minds.
The fragrance of his memory remains green in the minds of the vast array of Sri Lankans who were privileged to make contact with him. The nation bade farewell to him with full naval honours and with heavy hearts. The epilogue of the funeral oration still lingers in my memory, Sir, though you have departed from us, your name and service shall be remembered by us forever as a great patriotic officer and a gentleman, a true son of Mother Lanka who made the supreme sacrifice to defend our country. As you fade away beneath the waves, we will steer your course guns blazing.
Rear Admiral Dr. Shemal Fernando

ASEAN, China economies need to stay connected to build on positive momentum - PM Lee
The economies of Southeast Asia and China need to stay open and connected to one another to sustain the existing economic dynamism, Singapores Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday (Nov 14).
Speaking at the ASEAN-China Summit, he gave suggestions on how to build upon the current positive momentum in relations between the regional grouping and China. Singapore was the immediate past coordinator for dialogue relations between the two parties.
This can be done by fully implementing the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area Upgrade Protocol, which is expected to give businesses easier access to the Chinese market, he said.
During his opening remarks at the summit, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also spoke about the Upgrade Protocol, likening it to Singapore remodelling its old buildings while building new ones.
We are upgrading our existing FTA, not starting anything new, he said.
Working towards the full liberalisation of the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement, mobilising private capital and using international financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank to close ASEANs infrastructure financing gap will also help, Lee said.
ASEAN and China have benefited immensely from a free, open, and rules-based multilateral trading system, he said.
He added that China has been ASEANs top trading partner for eight consecutive years. In 2017, ASEANs merchandise trade with China reached US$442 billion (S$610 billion), accounting for 17 per cent of ASEANs total merchandise trade.
ASEAN and China should continue to identify new areas of collaboration and work together to bring their people and economies closer, he added. He said the ASEAN-China Joint Statement on Science, Technology and Innovation that was adopted on Wednesday is a positive step.
I also welcome Chinas proposals to deepen cooperation with the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, he added. The networks goal is to improve the lives of ASEAN citizens using technology.
Lee also said that ASEAN and China need to continue to engage in dialogue and practical cooperation to enhance peace and stability in the region, as well as deepen mutual trust and confidence.
On the South China Sea, in which China has overlapping territorial and maritime claims with several ASEAN members, including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, Lee said: I am encouraged by the good progress made in the negotiations of the Code of Conduct (COC) since its official commencement earlier this year.
Premier Li also said that while the two sides have some differences, they have never shied away from them.
We have been working to handle our differences, in a proper way, and we have set a great example for that effort. We have found the way to properly manage and properly diffuse differences, he said, giving the example of cooperation on the South China Sea issue.
Premier Li also said that ASEAN and China have agreed to finish the first reading of the text in 2019, and that China is ready to work with all ASEAN countries towards concluding COC consultations within three years.
Lee echoed the same commitment, but said there would be complex and challenging negotiations. In the meantime, all parties should maintain restraint, keep a conducive and stable environment for the COC negotiations to proceed smoothly, he said.

Be sport loving!
Playing sports is an emotional, mental and physical adventure. You have the opportunity to learn what you're made of and to determine if you're a team player or a maverick. And, as with any adventure, there are risks involved; but experts agree that the advantages are worth it. Participating in sports -- if you play safely and smartly -- can enhance your overall well-being.
The Greatest good
Learning how to function as part of a team is one of the most important advantages of playing sports. Teamwork involves both being dependable as a teammate and learning to rely on your teammates to achieve a positive outcome. Teamwork breeds accountability and challenges you to be responsible for your actions on and off the field. Being part of a team allows you to learn social skills and gives you an opportunity to be a leader.
A Fine Balance
Discipline is another advantage of playing sports. Most organized sports revolve around a strict training and practice schedule. Until you are a professional athlete, you might spend a lot of your time as a student-athlete, balancing academics and athletics.
Playing sports builds the discipline you need to adhere to a rigorous athletic schedule while being successful in the classroom. By playing sports, you'll learn the discipline you'll need to fulfill your responsibilities as an athlete and a student.
Body Boost
Regardless of your fitness level when you start playing sports, you'll notice an increase in your overall physical fitness once you're involved. Nearly every sport requires some level of physical activity and has you practicing the skills needed to be competitive. Most training regimens include running or some type of cardiovascular endurance, and strength training, so playing sports is going to make you more fit. Basketball players focus on strength training and short-interval cardio training, while football players work on speed and agility and track athletes train through longer runs.
Positive Mentors
If you play group sports, you'll be part of a team that takes direction from a coach. By being part of this group, you might develop a nurturing relationship with your coach or an older teammate which will have a positive impact on your life. Playing sports gives you a chance to be exposed to thoughtful, caring and skilled mentors who focus on developing not only a well-rounded athlete but also a well-rounded person.

Chambers expresses concern on current  political development
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL), Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) and The Womens Chamber of Industry & Commerce (WCCI) in a joint Press Release issued yesterday says that they are deeply concerned about the current political situation in the country.
It is our view that the executive and the elected representatives have a duty to ensure that decisions are taken with regard for due process and the Rule of Law.
The events of the last few weeks have resulted in absolute instability which is a situation that Sri Lanka simply cannot afford. This will no doubt hinder development and have a significantly adverse impact on the social and economic trajectory of our country.
It is observed that the entire administration of this country has come to a standstill and the public officers are paralyzed being unable to discharge their functions. The ultimate victims are the people of our country.
We recently witnessed the most unacceptable and abusive behavior displayed in the Chamber of the Sri Lanka Parliament. The conduct of some of the elected representatives was both shameful and an embarrassment to our country.
We call upon all those responsible to accord the highest priority to national interest and refrain from pursuing any path that will result in an economic downfall which will have an adverse impact on the country and the people. We call for urgent and sensible action, the statement said.

Bravo Prime Minister!
The Parliament finds itself in a mess of its own making. The August assembly is now headed by a prejudiced parliamentarian in the capacity of Speaker with the Opposition headed on a suicidal-mood collision course. The hidden agendum of the Opposition came to light on Thursday close on the heels of Prime Ministers special statement.
The first signs of the conflict arose when the UNP parliamentarian Lakshman Kiriella raised an objective against the Premiers speech. In doing so, the parliamentarian directly affronted the peoples sovereignty on the very grounds the same shall be put into exercise. In laymans terms, Kiriella stood for the Oppositions election phobia. The conflict reached escalation, when Speaker called for a vote which is not only random, but unnecessary as well. Be it as it may, this brief essay is written in awe of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksas revolutionary speech made on Thursday. Everyone must have had a sentimental moment when they watched the Premier leave the Chamber on Wednesday. Crocodile tears or otherwise, it was a national moment for mourning. But all that evaporated into thin air, as the Premier made a comeback better equipped this time. The August assembly reached its cutting edge when the Premier began making his special statement.
Speaker made things easier for the Premier to go for a witty, yet remarkable, opening. Speaker chose to address the Prime Minister simply by name albeit with the honourable prefix in his own wisdom. The nation, however, is well aware that Rajapaksa does not need any presidential or premiership stakes to glow. In fact his presence adds much glamour to the respective position.
The Thursday speech leaves enough room for content analysis on the part of political science students.
Prime Minister Rajapaksas speech brimmed with wit. His decade-long political experience had provided him with ample ammunition to rise as a knight in shining armour above the hecklers cum errant knights.

Climate change awareness campaign
A self-described whimsical scientist locked himself in a small air-tight plastic foil tent with 200 plants to see if they could covert CO2 into oxygen fast enough to keep him alive.
Kurtis Baute sealed himself in a 3m by 3m plastic-wrapped biodome in his brothers backyard in British Columbia, Canada, last week, but he announced his audacious plan to his YouTube fans, in August. He hoped to find out if by surrounding himself with plants, enough of the CO2 he breathed out could be converted into oxygen to allow him to survive in the sealed enclosure for at least three days. Unfortunately, he had to abort the experiment after only 15 hours, as CO2 levels reached a dangerous point where he risked suffering brain damage or even falling into a coma.
I could probably survive in the jar three days, Baute wrote on his website last week. But my goal is not to just not die, my goal is to end this project without having turned blue, developed brain damage, gotten heat stroke, or just generally caused lasting harm to my body.
But as it turns out, thats exactly what he risked as the 200 plans he took with him into the air-tight biodome couldnt keep with his needs. Apparently, a cloudy sky prevented them from receiving all the sunlight they needed to perform photosynthesis, so they couldnt recycle CO2 fast enough.
Plants are great at soaking up CO2, they love the stuff.. But they can only handle so much, and since it isnt a bright and sunny day (its overcast) they arent getting the light they need Which means CO2 just keeps rising. Will have to abort today if this keeps up, the young experimenter tweeted on October 24.
15 hours into the experiment, Baute reached the set danger threshold and called it quits. Still, he called the experience a huge success as his main goal was actually the devastating effects of climate change and CO2 emissions.
The messed up thing about my experiment is that some of my abort values (eg If CO2 is too high I escape) are just everyday experiences for many people on this planet. Everyone deserves clean air, but not everyone has it, he wrote.

Colombo Plan CCM hailed a success
The 46th Consultative Committee Meeting (CCM) of the Colombo Plan hosted by the Vietnam government concluded successfully in Hanoi, Vietnam.
The Plenary Sessions of the Meeting were held on October 30 and 31. Twenty-two member states representing Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United States and Viet Nam took part in the conference.
The CCM is the highest review and policy-making body of the Colombo Plan comprising all member governments.
Its biennial meetings provide a forum for the exchange of views and review the work of the Colombo Plan in economic and social development within its regions.
The venue for the 46th CCM was the Government Guest House in Hanoi.
The inaugural ceremony was graced by Vietnams Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Minister Dao Ngoc Dung as guest of honour. Highlighting the cooperation between the Vietnam government and the Colombo Plan, he said that ever since its accession to the Colombo Plan, the Vietnam government had organised substantive and meaningful events for the Colombo Plan in Vietnam.
He expressed his gratitude on behalf of his government to the Colombo Plan for helping to train over 500 Vietnamese officials in many fields such as drug prevention and addiction treatment, public administration, environment, private sector development, and gender equality.
Vietnams Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Hoai Trunge xpressed his hope to strive to participate more actively in the Colombo Plans management. He noted with appreciation that the Colombo Plan had a Vietnamese appointed as Director of the Drug Advisory Programme during the period 2009-2011 and most recently, the appointment of the Secretary General.
He made special emphasis on an area that Vietnam wishes to continue collaborating with the Colombo Plan: gender equality and womens empowerment.
He stressed that Vietnam is ready to work with the Colombo Plan and its member countries in organising Gender Focal Points Conference in Vietnam next year.
The Colombo Plan Council President Mohamed Hussain Shareefand the Colombo Plan Secretary General Ambassador Dr. Phan Kieu Thu also addressed the inaugural ceremony highlighting the way forward for Colombo Plan for the next two years.
In addition, the Secretary General and the current member states welcomed Chile to join the Colombo Plan as a new member.
At the conference, the Vietnam Womens Union presented the Country Theme Paper on Gender Equality in Vietnam, which depicted the importance and priorities of Vietnam on gender equality.
Sri Lanka volunteered to host the next CCM in Colombo in 2020 and was elected as the Deputy Chairperson to the 46th CCM. It has become a tradition at recent CCMs that the leader of the delegation of the next host government is chosen as the Deputy Chairperson of the CCM.

Construction sector gets S$4 mn to boost digitalization
The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) on Wednesday (Nov 14) launched the Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) implementation plan to encourage companies in the built environment sectors to go digital.
The IDD implementation plan is one of the thrusts of the Construction Industry Transformation Map announced in October last year.
To help more companies adopt the plan, BCA and the Infocomm Media Development Authority launched a S$4 million joint call to develop digital platforms for the building sector.
This will enable firms across the construction project-cycle to communicate and exchange information with various partners and innovate by pioneering new ways to work, BCA said.
This announcement came after Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee visited the construction site of the upcoming JTC Logistics Hub at Gul Circle to find out how JTC and its contractor Kimly Construction has benefited from the implementation of IDD.When completed in mid-2020, the hub will be Singapores first high-rise multi-tenant facility that incorporates storage of containers, warehouses and a heavy vehicle park.
IDD refers to the use of digital technologies to integrate information and work processes among all stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of a building  from the design of the building to its construction, and facilities management once it is completed.

He said that showers or thundershowers will occur at times over the Northern Province and several places in the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces. Several spells of showers will occur in Anuradhapura and Puttalam districts while strong winds (50-60) kmph, gusting up to 70kmph can be expected over these two districts. He further said that sea water inundation may occur in the low lying areas in the near coast from Mannar to Kankasanturai.
He said it is very likely to move west-southwestwards. The deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensified into Cyclone Gaja on last Sunday is expected to cross South Tamil Nadu coast and the center of the system is very likely to move approximately 120 km away from the northern coast of Sri Lanka yesterday evening. The system is likely to move away from the country by today. Hence windy and showery condition in the Northern part of the island and Northern sea area is expected to reduce gradually from today.

Discover Ceylon in French
Title: LUXURIANTE JUNGLE - French translation of John Stills Jungle Tide
Author: Mahendra Pathirathne
Jungle Tide is a book written by John Still, an Englishman who served in the colonial Ceylon as a planter then as an archeological surveyor under H. C. P. Bell for nearly half a decade. He undertook the massive task of travelling all over Ceylon before he commenced writing this book which is now considered a landmark in the field of literature not only domestically but also in the world at large. Among the English educated elderly, there is hardly anyone who has not read it. Any English educated person in Sri Lanka would find it embarrassing to have to admit that he is not familiar with Jungle Tide.
Why this entire harangue, you would ask. Well the exciting news is that a Sri Lankas veteran French scholar Mahendra Pathirathne, has just published the French translation of John Stills Jungle Tide.
Well, a French book Wholl read it Some people might wonder. Well, so did I at the beginning. It is true that the readership is limited. But it is not dauntingly low at all. At the University of Peradeniya Professor Ravily, a Frenchman, was already teaching French as a subject to undergraduates in the fifties. The Universities of Kelaniya and Sri Jayawardenepura followed suit. Since then Sri Lankan system of education and of course the Alliance Franaise network must have produced thousands of graduates and students conversant in French. Hence, Luxuriante Jungle will be received delightfully by many local readers. At the same time any French speaker who would like to know what sort of country Sri Lanka is, Im sure is going to benefit enormously from reading it.
In at least some of our universities; francophone literature is a domain being exploited. In addition, in some of our universities, a subject by the name translation methods is taught. Im sure this wonderful Luxuriante Jungle will be immensely useful in those two fields.
A word about the translator himself, Pathirathne is a man of a rare breed. Instead of undertaking a task which would have been financially more rewarding, he decided to attend to this formidable task of translating Jungle Tide into French as French is a language after his own heart. Right from the beginning he had realized how hard this task would be. He has spent six long years to translate the entire book while attending to his day-to- day work.
The specialized task of going through the translation to correct it if necessary was entrusted to two native French speakers Gilles Gaveau and Chantal Martyre who in their turn worked for three more years to perfect the translation that it is.
This excellent book among, other things, fills up a gap that has constantly perturbed G .C. E. Advanced level teachers and students who are involved in learning and teaching French. This gap created by the lack of reading materials in French. This book, will fill up the whole of his two year learning career with the result of giving him or/her a sound knowledge of the language. It will not be a crutch but a ladder!
I have known Pathirathne for over fifteen years. But it was only recently that I came to know he has done his Masters at the Sorbonne, Paris where he studied applied linguistics under the guidance of eminent professor Danielle-Laroche Bouvy in the late eighties.
He also owes a debt of gratitude to late professor Ashley Halpe, former Dean of the faculty of Arts/ professor of English, University of Peradeniya with whom he had discussed the translation. So, it is no wonder that he has completed this massive task in a manner that will satisfy the most fastidious critic.
However, this is not the first time that Pathirathne has contributed to enhancement of learning and teaching French language in Sri Lanka. As a teacher of French he is excellent and his lessons are often spiced with subtle humour which not only renders them interesting but also helps students remember key points. He has written a book of model answers Les annales du bac- seventeen years of G.C.E. Advanced level question papers from 1990 to 2016. In addition, he has to his credit a book entitled Pratique de la comprhension crite which helps students with reading comprehension. This is a book containing 40 sample texts accompanied by 720 exercises followed by solutions at the end of the book.
He has translated a few childrens stories into French (Asian Publications Distribution Agency) and compiled a book of literary extracts from great French authors for G .C. E. A.L. students.- edited by late professor of English, Ashley Halpe and Exercices pour lapprentissage du franais for G.C.E. A/L students. Very recently he translated into French the script of Sudath Mahadivulvewas film Red Milk.
As I went through Luxuriante Jungle there were many of its features that struck me. To begin with, I did not come across any expressions or words which would be identified as Franglais, which is often the characteristic of French written by the English -educated Sri Lankans. Secondly, the smooth flow of the language gives you the impression that it has been written by a native speaker of French.
Thirdly as I was already familiar with Jungle Tide, when I was asked to read this translation, I should have noticed any oddities in the text.
The curious fact was that I never even once had the impression that I was already familiar with either the background or the incidents.
When I read Pathirathnes translation Luxuriante Jungle it was very pleasant to read such quality, style and strength of the language the translator has adopted. They make the reader step into a world that he has never before heard of.
If not for my limitations of French vocabulary, I would have read it from cover to cover in one go.

Elections the answer
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday gave expression to what no doubt a majority of the public would desire at this particular juncture when the nation is at a crossroads. Making his inaugural address to Parliament since being sworn in on October 26, Premier Rajapaksa said the only option before the country now lay in holing a General Election to resolve the present gridlock between the Executive and the Legislature. The country is in a state of drift while the political tussle is continuing in earnest.
True to form, yesterday too Parliament was plunged into anarchy when MP Lakshman Kiriella demanded that a confidence vote be taken on the Prime Ministers address. When Speaker Karu Jayasuriya gave the option for the Members to decide if the vote was to be taken by name, all hell broke out in the Well of the House resulting in the Speaker finally having to vacate the Chamber with proceedings once again in disarray. For how long can this state of affairs continue With the final decision of the Supreme Court on the dissolution of Parliament set for December 7, the country cannot remain in this chaotic state until then.
Both sides appear to be sticking to their guns, with the UNP and its allies claiming victory on the one hand and the Government holding onto the same position. The Speaker too appears to be intransigent and adding to the chaos. On the one hand President Sirisena is firmly of the view that all his actions were derived from the Constitution while Opposition is claiming otherwise. Legal opinion on both sides are based on partisanship with the only option open being to go before the Supreme Court for a clear ruling.
The UNP understandably is reluctant to resort to such a course, perhaps, wary that the Presidents position would be vindicated, like it is wary of elections. No doubt the February 10 drubbing is still haunting the minds of the UNP hierarchy who would not want elections if they could help it. Considering the burdens the Greens heaped on the people during the three and half years of Yahapalanaya rule, elections no doubt would be a daunting prospect for the UNP. Besides a simple calculation would show that the combined vote obtained by the SLFP/UPFA and the SLPP topped the 55% mark which the UNP could never hope to achieve as a single party.
There is also the demand by the party rank and file that Ranil Wickremesinghe should step down from the leadership for Sajith to take over. Compounding the misery is the fact that the Green Party may have to face an election sans State power at its disposal.
But there is no other option but a General Election at this point of time if the country is to be salvaged. Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is known for his wisdom should seriously consider this option and offer his party's support for a two thirds majority in Parliament leading to dissolution and a General Election. The JVP which has a much less prospect of winning an election than the UNP had offered its support in this regard for which Premier Rajapaksa expressed his genuine appreciation in his address to Parliament. After all elections are the lifeblood of democracy.
Meanwhile, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has come in for heavy flak from the Government for the manner in which he is conducting affairs of Parliament post October 26, and not without justification. They claim that the Speaker's whole attitude was partisan and he was bent on protecting the interests of the political party he belonged to. True, his conduct has raised many an eyebrow particularly in the way in which he bulldozed through the vote called by the Opposition to demonstrate its majority in Parliament.
Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardena declared that the vote taking was invalid since it was done after he had moved for the adjournment of the House and when the Mace, which symbolizes the official conduct of Parliament business, was not in its due place. There were also allegations that he acted unconstitutionally in the whole affair of calling for a No-Confidence vote against the Prime Minister by suspending Standing Orders.
As the custodian of the rights and privileges of all 225 members of Parliament the Speaker is bound to act evenhandedly to ensure that no party or individual is placed at a disadvantage. No doubt Speaker Jayasuriya is functioning under tremendous pressure from all sides, reminiscent of the former Speaker M. H. Mohamed, during the Premadasa impeachment drama. The late Speaker was the target of a mighty fusillade of the then Opposition when it was alleged he conspired to thwart the impeachment motion and his propriety called into question.
The antidote for all this unpleasantness no doubt will be to go before the people for a clear verdict. This will resolve the current impasse and put the country back on the rails. Continuation of the present political drama, no doubt, will also have dire consequences on the socio-economic landscape.

THAT FIVE-RUN PENALTY
At a time when Sri Lanka were struggling to gain a first innings lead they conceded five penalty runs to England which was added to their first innings total making it 290. The incident happened in the 85th over when Roshen Silva failed to ground his bat at the non-strikers end after hitting the ball to third man. Silva may have thought the ball had gone for four but it was fielded by Moeen Ali. The umpire Marais Erasmus of South Africa noticing that Silva had not grounded his bat running the first run and had turned back for the second immediately signalled one short to the scorers, but on second thought after consulting his colleague S Ravi of India he changed his mind and signalled dead ball and awarded England five penalty runs that was added to their first innings which was changed from 285 to 290.
The Law states: Five penalty points are awarded to the fielding side if the batting team: Attempts to steal a run or deliberately run short.
Law 18.5 on Deliberate short runs.
18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batsmen deliberately ran short at that umpire's end, the umpire concerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has occurred and apply 18.5.2.
18.5.2 The bowler's end umpire shall - disallow all runs to the batting side - return any not out batsman to his/her original end - signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable - award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side - inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded - inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for this action.

fixed broadband subscribers to reach 2.9 mn by 2028
Sri Lankas fixed broadband subscribers could reach 2.9 million by 2028, Associate Research Analyst at Kagan and author of the research, Wangxing Zhao, said in a report.
He said that the rise in fixed broadband service adoption is due to strong economic growth and poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas fixed broadband customer base reached 1.2 million connections in 2017, first time ever hitting the 1 million mark. Broadband penetration increased from just 1.3% in 2007 to 22.1% by 2017 year-end, the highest among its regional peers in South Asia the report said.
We expect Sri Lankas fixed broadband subscribers will grow over the next 10 years, reaching 2.9 million by 2028, a 47.1% penetration rate.
He said that Fiber would become the leading platform in Sri Lanka over the next 10 years, while Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) subscribers will shrink.
As of 2017, DSL remained the dominant fixed broadband platform in Sri Lanka, serving an estimated 606,000 subscribers, nearly half of the market. Fixed wireless and fiber currently serves around 447,000 and 167,000 customers, respectively.
We expect fixed wireless to become the most adopted broadband technology by 2020. However, fiber is anticipated to take over fixed wireless as the leading platform.
Our model indicates both fiber and fixed wireless services will each serve more than 1 million subscribers by 2028, whereas DSL subscribers will start to decline.

Heeded the voice of the majority - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas letter to President Maithripala Sirisena in response to the letter sent by the President.
Your Excellency,
I acknowledge the receipt of the letter dated 14.11.2018 addressed to me by you. It is obvious that the resolution passed by 122 Members of Parliament yesterday (14.11.2018) has been challenged by you.
Those 122 Members of Parliament included Members of Parliament of the United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Tamil National Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and a few Members of Parliament and Ministers of the new government.
It is regretting that you have forgotten that you ascended to the post of President and Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe to the post of Prime Minister on 8th January 2015 upon the mandate of the people given thence.
I consider it my duty to remind to you that I went around the country with you addressing over 140 public rallies in order to seek a mandate from the people to make you the President and Hon.Ranil Wickramasinghe the Prime Minister. I also wish to remind to you that conferring the Premiership occurred on the agreement of everybody in the then government.
On this particular occasion, the change of premiership was not effected with such concurrence or having regard for the majority of Parliament.
I wish to thank you for reminding me the responsibility of acting independently as the Speaker. It is the stand of the democratic, civilized society that standing up for 122 Members of Parliament is heeding the voice of the majority which should not be construed as being biased.
After assuming duties as the Speaker I can, true to my conscience, state that I have not stepped in to Sirikotha, the headquarters of the United National Party. Further, I have not participated, even at a minor level, in any political activity of the party.
I wish to remind you that allegations were preferred against me by the ruling party members led by the United National Party for allocating more time for the Members of Parliament of the Opposition and it was also suggested that I should be replaced as the Speaker.
I was astonished by comments made by you as a seasoned parliamentarian and a matured representative of people which referred to the way I conducted affairs in Parliament yesterday as being inconsistent with the Constitution, the Standing Orders and the parliamentary traditions.
The Ministers of the new government, having realized that they do not have the capability of demonstrating the majority of Parliament, gathered at the well of the House denigrating democratic and parliamentary traditions with absolute disregard for the Standing Orders, hurling most vituperative and abusive words while trying to grab the mace was a far cry from the term Honourable Members of Parliament. By watching the compact discs of the proceedings of the House yesterday, you may well be able to understand how some Members of Parliament deliberately tried to prevent a vote by their ugly conduct.
I also wish to state with responsibility that all 122 Members of Parliament who voted for the motion were present at the House yesterday. Amongst them were some Ministers and Members of Parliament of the government. Though I made a respectful request thrice appealing for their support to duly take the vote, I was not given any opportunity for taking such a vote and accordingly, in terms of the Standing Order 47(1) I had to take the vote by voices and declare that it had been passed by the majority.
Your Excellency,
The country has plunged into a serious disorder owing to the decision taken by you on the 26th of October. The economy of the country, living conditions of the people, arrival of tourists, the goodwill earned by Sri Lanka at the international arena and the reputation you earned during your long political career are in the process of rapidly diminishing at the moment. An unnecessary conflict between the executive and the legislature has been created as a result.
It is with great respect that I urge you on behalf of all the citizens of the country and the future generations to come, that expeditious measures be taken to save the nation from this catastrophe by lending your ears to the majority view of Parliament without further delay.
I will send you a response explaining the constitutional perspective and the other matters stated in your letter, after having obtained the instructions of the legal experts.
Although we had an appointment today at 8.30 a.m. it is the opinion of the party leaders that such a meeting would serve no purpose, given the attitudes that are explicit in your letter.
In conclusion, it is with a patriotic gesture that I emphasize the fact that, I firmly believe that this dilemma can be unraveled through negotiations , for the sake of the august good governance objectives for which we all appear for and as a state which possess a legacy of matured democracy throughout seven decades.
Arrangements will be made to release this letter to media, since your letter too had been released thus.
Thank you, Yours Sincerely,
Karu Jayasuriya, Speaker

The Supreme Court has not issued a determination cancelling the Presidents decree on dissolution of Parliament for an election. What it has done is temporarily halting it with an interim decision, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva said yesterday.
Asked how Parliamentary proceedings may be carried out given such an order being issued, Silva said, they could have sought an interim injunction from the Supreme Court, but such orders have not been issued by it.
Asked what will be the best course of action to relax the tense situation prevailing in Parliament and outside, he said with reference to the legal perspective and the situation of the country, the best option for the country is to go for an election.
The appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister is a decision made for the benifit of the country and it stands as a temporary measure at this moment, he said.
The power of a country to control its own government, fundamental rights and franchise are in people and are inalienable in the context of exercise of sovereignty in Sri Lanka.
The judiciary, the Supreme Court and other Courts of law in the country are only carrying out those powers, he pointed out.

Hot ice cream 
Describing an ice-cream as hot might seem strange, but when talking about the Respiro del Diavolo (Devils Breath), its actually an understatement. Made using an assortment of hot chillies, the bizarre treat scores over 1.5 million units on the Scoville scale of hotness, making it the worlds most dangerous ice-cream.
Respiro del Diavolo was brought to Glascow, Scotland, by Martin Bandoni, owner of the Aldwych Cafe and Ice Cream Parlour, but he claims the recipe has been a closely-guarded secret among Italian gelato makers for centuries. It has been used as a test of bravery at yearly gatherings among masters of the trade, but Bandoni thought it could become a commercial hit as well, so he put it on the menu of his ice-cream parlour in Glasgow. So far, the response has been crazy, with people from all over the UK stopping by to try the fiery treat.
It started in Italy, Lee Bandoni, Martins brother, said. There was a place called Devils Bridge and with that, the Italian ice cream families used to meet up once a year and discuss how the year went for them. At that point, if there were any men that showed bravery then they would eat this ice cream. So, because of the Devils Bridge, they called this the Breath of the Devil.
Every year it still happens over there and this year when Martin was away earlier in the month he brought back the idea that was passed down to him, Lee added. The recipe is very secret, very few of us know it and when the time is right Martins children will get to find out about it and they will go to Italy and learn the ins and outs of it.
In case youre wondering just how hot Respiro del Diavolo ice-cream actually is, its rated at a whopping 1,569,300 SHU on the Scoville scale. For reference, the Carolina Reaper Pepper, until recently the hottest pepper in the world, is rated between 1.4 million and 2.2 million units. Thats hot enough for Bandoni to request that customers be over 18 years old and sign a waver before trying the hot ice-cream.

How small states can be significant
In the current global context there has been a trend where small states have emerged as success stories in the international arena. This is important as many of the independent and sovereign countries that constitute the international community are indeed small states in terms or geographical size or population.
There is no broad definition to what really constitutes a small state and the question then arises whether Sri Lanka does fall within this category. Sri Lanka is indeed a small state when compared to its very large neighbours in South Asia such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, but had this country been located in the Caribbean, the Middle East or the South Pacific, the perception would have been different.
Small states have indeed at various times played a significant role and often this has been within the framework of international groupings. One can think back of the past role of Ceylon/Sri Lanka as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement.
However in more recent years small states have earned recognition as economic success stories and even in some cases models to be emulated by others. The countries that come to mind are Singapore, Dubai, Ireland, Luxembourg and Iceland.
Hence a point that needs to be considered is that geographic size, demography or even the existence of natural resources are not pre-requisites for development and economic success but are other factors, approaches and policies that these small, nimble, adaptable and business friendly states have introduced and assimilated.
While many of these small states have a variety of political systems and some may not be considered democracies by any definition, they have often adopted a general culture of broadmindedness and tolerance. They have also embraced and assimilated technological advances very easily in areas such as production, trade practices, logistics, telecommunication, information technology and services.
Information technology
Iceland is one case of a small state which has developed rapidly and indeed radically, in recent years. At the beginning of the 20th century it had a population of about 100,000 inhabitants mainly engaged in fishing or related activities. But today Icelands population of 300,000 enjoys one of the highest GDP per Capita in the world.
Iceland has ranked 4th in the world in 2017 with US$ 70,248.
The Icelandic miracle was the result of a successful adoption of Information technology as well as mobile telephones and internet connections.
In addition, the country has over the years developed a strategy where its natural resources are utilized in a sustainable way. Furthermore, excellent business practices have made this small countrys enterprises active players in international business. Despite their relative small size their successes have received considerable coverage in leading international publications.
Another success story which is closer to home is the well documented case of Singapore. Singapores example is well known and this city state which has a GDP per capita of US$ 60,000 (or the worlds sixth highest from just US$ 320, fifty years ago) has been often suggested as a model that Sri Lanka could will emulate.
Singapores initial history was as a part of Malaysia, but the city state was expelled from the Malaysian Federation due to the complex nature of the regions ethnic politics.
Post-independence problems
The country was able to address many of its post-independence problems such as unemployment, urban slum dwellings where much of the population lived in and challenges from regional neighbours such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Other issues were the lack of natural resources, sanitation, infrastructure and even water.
Singapores leader Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew developed a comprehensive economic plan which focused on labour intensive industries and the country from the onset made every effort to connect with the outside world, to secure a manufacturing base in Singapore.
This was a difficulty in a country without a tradition of industrial production. The emphasis was to attract multinational corporations to Singapore.
At the same time, considerable efforts were made to create a predictable and stable environment which was corruption free, with low taxation, and without industrial action. This form of autocracy had a zero tolerance policy towards crime, notably drug trafficking but also with those engaged in divisive politics. The result was undoubtedly a very business friendly environment conducive to attracting investors.
Once the economy picked up, Singapore focused on developing its human resources as well as the infrastructure. Technical schools were established and international corporations were even paid to train skilled workers in cutting edge industries such as Information Technology, electronics and petrochemicals.
This fostered economic transformation as Singapore moved successfully from the textile / garments/ basic electronics industries to an economy where logistics, biotech research, pharmaceuticals and aerospace engineering have become the leading sectors.
Currently Singapore has become a world leader in several key areas. The Port of Singapore is now the busiest transshipment port overtaking Hong Kong and Rotterdam. It is the second busiest Port after Shanghai.
Singapore has also emerged as a leading banking centre, rivaling Switzerland. The biotech industry has attracted plants from leading manufacturers including Glaxo Smith Kline and Pfizer. Another important industry is oil refining.
Tourist destination
Singapore is also well known a tourist destination with 10 million visitors arriving annually. Singapore with a small land area has developed attractions such as a nature reserve, luxurious Casino Resorts at Marina Bay Stands as well actively promoted medical tourism and culinary tourism.
Ireland has long been considered a model to small countries to emulate particularly in the area of investment promotion.
From being a country that has for centuries exported its population due to economic hardships, Ireland in GDP per Capita terms is ranked third in the European Union. (US$ 68,710 in 2017).
Many of the reasons that have been attributed to the Irish Miracle include excellent human resources and education, the knowledge of the English language and a business friendly environment. This has resulted in hundreds of companies setting up offices or plants in Ireland.
Iceland is a hub for specific industries such as aviation with many aviation leasing companies and supporting companies are established there. The same goes for services including IT. But what is remarkable is the success of Ireland in the area of economic inclusiveness.
Ireland is in fact ranked 8th in a measure formulated by the World Economic Forum that looks beyond the traditional economic growth data to include socio economic measures such as living standards, environmental sustainability and the protection of future generations from indebtedness.
This approach, which Ireland is actively following, addresses in strategic and consistent manners the dangers of pursuing short term gains and allowing inequality to grow.
The lessons that can be learned is that small states can achieve growth that is both inclusive and promoting sustainable development.
The countries that have scored high on this measure are by and large European countries with small populations and quite often small territories.
They include Norway (first in the list), Iceland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland among the highest ranking.
It can therefore be argued that well managed Small States can indeed become success stories and combine economic growth with sustainability and inclusiveness.
However free from the concerns of large states such as balance of power questions, many small states can focus directly on the very problems that concern them and whose solution will lead to betterment.

I told you so - President
The facts mentioned in the special statement by President Maithripala Sirisena on November 11 became a reality at 10.00 am on November 15.
I paid serious attention to this development. Members of Parliament from both sides issued various statements in the media, that there would be a big clash when Parliament is convened on November 14. Some speculated that even members could face death, the President said in his special statement on 11th.
It appeared to me that, if I allowed Parliament to be convened on the 14th, without dissolving it, it could have brought about commotion and clashes, in every city and every village.
This would lead to a very unpleasant and difficult situation for the average citizens of my beloved country, the President said in his statement.
As such, the best solution was not to allow those 225 members in Parliament to fight each other and allow that to develop into street fights in every part of the country. It is my duty and the responsibility to allow democracy to guide us, and create a situation for the 15 million voters in this country take the ultimate decision by choosing their members to the Parliament through a free and fair election. As such, given the corrupt practices among Parliamentarians as well as the conduct of the Speaker, the best and fair solution to the political crisis that emerged was to allow the people decide in keeping with the principle of democracy. It was with that noble intention of upholding democracy that I dissolved Parliament. I must state that a permanent and a clear solution to the current situation can be reached through a General Election, the President said.

## Title: Iran was closer to a nuclear bomb than Intelligence Agencies thought

Iran was closer to a nuclear bomb than Intelligence Agencies thought
A secret Iranian archive seized by Israeli agents earlier this year indicates that Tehrans nuclear programme was more advanced than Western intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency had thought, according to a prominent nuclear expert who examined the documents.
That conclusion in turn suggests that if Iran pulls out of the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal that U.S. President Donald Trump has already abandoned, it has the know-how to build a bomb fairly swiftly, perhaps in a matter of months, said David Albright, a physicist who runs the nonprofit Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C.
If Tehran pulls out of the 2015 deal, it could have a weapon in a matter of months.
Iran would still need to produce weapons-grade uranium. If it restarts its centrifuges, it could have enough in about seven to 12 months, added Albright, who is preparing reports on the archive.
Nuclear deal
Before the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal mainly negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, that would have taken only two months, but under the accord Iran was required to ship about 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country and dismantle most of its centrifuges.
Experts say the revelation that Iran had more advanced capabilities to make nuclear weapons themselvesas opposed to its ability to produce weapons-grade fuel, the main focus of the nuclear pactis a surprising and troubling finding in the new intelligence.
The archive is littered with new stuff about the Iranian nuclear weapons programme, Albright told Foreign Policy. Its unbelievable how much is in there. One of his key conclusions from studying the documents was that the Iranians were further along than Western intelligence agencies realized.
The archive, which is well over 100,000 pages long, covers the period from 1999 to 2003, a decade before negotiations on a nuclear deal began. But the trove of documents demonstrates that Washington and the IAEA were constantly underestimating how close Tehran was to a bomb.
The U.S. was issuing statements that it would take a year at least, perhaps two years, to build a deliverable weapon. The information in the archive makes it clear they could have done it a lot quicker, said Albright. He added that the French government, which was then saying Iran could achieve a weapon in three months, was much closer in its estimates.
North Koreas nuclear programme
Analysts were still sifting through the archive, said Albright, who is also known for tracking North Koreas nuclear programme and for investigating Iraqs weapons of mass destruction programmes going back to the 1990s. I dont think even the Israelis have gone through it all, he said. Every day when they go through it they see something new.
Mossad agents seized the archive in a daring nighttime raid on a warehouse in Tehran at the end of January. In late April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed some of the content in a speech that was panned as a melodramatic attempt to prod Trump into leaving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal. These files conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons programme, Netanyahu said.
Irans deputy Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, called Netanyahus presentation a prearranged show with the aim of impacting Trumps decision, or perhaps it is a coordinated plan by him and Trump in order to destroy the JCPOA.
Trump announced the United States was withdrawing several days later.
In the period described in the Iranian archive, current Iranian President Hassan Rouhaniwho later signed off on the JCPOAwas national security advisor. According to a draft of the first report by the Institute for Science and International Security, which was obtained by FP:
Rouhani was a central, ongoing figure in the nuclear weapons programme in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It is difficult to find evidence that his support for nuclear weapons ever ended.
While Netanyahus presentation highlighted Irans deceptiveness, the institutes analysis focuses on how Iran managed to put in place by the end of 2003 the infrastructure for a comprehensive nuclear weapons programme intended to initially produce five nuclear warheads, each with an explosive yield of 10 kilotons, according to the draft.
The analysis was done by Albright, Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director-general for safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Andrea Stricker, a senior policy analyst at the institute. The three concluded that by the late 1990s, Iran had already developed a full range of technical competences and capabilities, not just some, as characterized by the IAEA in late 2015.
The authors also indicate that much is still unknown about what remains of Irans nuclear weapons programme. The programmes remains, and likely some activities, have continued up to today. The question of where all this equipment and material is now located is more urgent to answer.
Albright, who has gone to Tel Aviv several times to comb through the archivemost recently two weeks agosays he is certain the information, which has also been verified by the U.S. government, is authentic. It is consistent with the thrust of what the IAEA had collected, he said, but more detailed.
Obama administration
The archive casts no light, however, on whether Iran was observing the 2015 deal, and most experts say Tehran was cooperating at the time that Trump withdrew.
Alexandra Bell, a former Obama administration official who worked on compliance reports for the JCPOA, said that even if the intelligence from the archive is accurate and Tehran lied in the past, its behaviour should be judged by whether it is complying with the deal now. There shouldnt be oversight through media reports, Bell said. As with any agreement, issues come up and they should be dealt with in the proper channels. They should be addressed by the JCPOA parties.
She noted that before it withdrew from the deal, the Trump administration twice declared Iran in compliance, and the IAEA has done so 15 times. The JCPOA is working, Bell said.
Even so, the existence of the archive under the authority of a mysterious Iranian organisation has raised concerns among some governments and the IAEA over whether Iran is preserving its ability to build nuclear weapons in the future. Under the JCPOA, Iran must mainly relinquish its ability to enrich and reprocess weapons-grade fuel, subject to rigorous IAEA inspection.
Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a former Bush administration official who worked on Iran, said the revelation that Iran never came clean on all this, where they were on the weapons back then, thats a biggie.
The question is where they were at the time of the JCPOA. Thats why some people in the intelligence community were so keen on getting a dealIran had so much breakout ability at the time of the deal.
As to what happens now, with Tehran still nominally observing the nuclear pact, the likelihood that Iran does anything very publicly is very small, Levitt said. The question is how far do they go in a clandestine fashion, given that they know what we know.

Joe Root reprimanded for showing dissent
England captain Joe Root has received an official reprimand and one demerit point for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the second days play in the Pallekele Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.
Root was found to have violated Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision during an international match.
The incident happened in the 76th over of Sri Lankas innings when Root appeared to show dissent at umpire Marais Erasmus decision by shaking his head and then kicking the turf after Dilruwan Perera had been given not-out off Moeen Ali.
Root pleaded not guilty to the charge and, as such, a hearing took place after the days play following which the match referee found the England captain guilty of dissent as charged and handed him an official reprimand and one demerit point.
The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Erasmus and S. Ravi, third umpire Chris Gaffaney and fourth umpire Ranmore Martinesz.

KUMAR SANGAKKARA, Rhapsody on and off the field
He belongs to the World's Cricket Hall of Fame. And he brought glory to his country. He Captained Sri Lanka Cricket with distinction. And decorated his Club the Nondescripts Cricket Club with his stellar achievements.
He led Sri Lanka into the World Cup 50 Over Tournament Finals against India. And this Colossus of a Cricketer had his upbringing at Trinity College Kandy where he was a distinguished Ryde Gold Medalist, the highest honour the School confers on one schoolboy all-rounder in a year.
And to round it all up on the world stage, he delivered what was one of the most acclaimed speeches at the Lord's when he delivered the Colin Cowdrey Lecture at the MCC.
If that was a breathtaking introduction, it is only a mere synopsis of the highlights of Sri Lanka Captain KUMAR CHOKSHANDA SANGAKKARA's achievements.
SANGAKKARA got statisticians working overtime in entering his name is the books of being the first batsman in the world to reel off four centuries in a row at the 2014/ 15 World Cup played in New Zealand and Australia. It was an effort that's monumental and could never easily be equaled or surpassed and will last the test of time. It was a batting RHAPSODY.
A left hand batsman in the classical mould, stylish, elegant and with the knack of rare timing, SANGAKKARA was king when he was in the scene and has been described as batsman for young cricketers watching this role model as an example.
Rolls Royce of batsmen
He can be described as the Rolls Royce of batsmen. When at the wicket he exuded confidence, never did he look uneasy as he quickly read the bowlers repertoire, be it pace or spin, got quickly into action and caressed the ball through the field or over. His bat was a magic wand in his hand.
He has been described as the most polished and prudent of batsmen in the game. And the writer can vouch for this fact having watched his magic from his school days, where he served notice of his prowess not only as a batsman but also wicket keeper like the great England wicket keeper of old Godfrey Evans.
Not only did SANGAKKARA excel as a cricketer but was a speaker much in demand and left a permanent seal when he delivered the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey lecture at Lords. It stunned the audience and to use cricketing parlance, he hit all round the wicket that took the Sri Lanka establishment and global cricket administrations by storm . He was the youngest to deliver this lecture on the invitation of that famous cricket writer Christopher Martin Jenkins.
Audience spellbound
The lecture was of one hours duration and he held the audience spellbound and glued to their seats as he let go with the no holds barred lecture.
The highlight of his speech was when he said: accountability and transparency in administration and credibility of conduct were lost in a made power struggle that would leave Sri Lanka with no clear, consistent administration. There were loud cheers when he concluded. The speech was described as the most important speech in cricket history.
SANGAKKARA in school at Trinity indulged in many sports like badminton, tennis, swimming, table tennis and cricket and had good potential. But it was cricket that held his fancy and he played for his school from under 13 to the first side. He was fortunate to have as his coaches former Dharmaraja captain Upananda Jayasundera and that dream coach, Thomian, SSC and Ceylon all rounder Bertie Wijesinha to nurture him in his formative years. Wijesinha has coached many champions.But Sangakkara was the prize win.
Prestigious prize
At just 19 he was spotted by the selectors as a promising wicket keeper/batsman and tossed him into the Sri Lanka A team that toured South Africa in 1998/99. But it was the swashbuckling 156 he made in a one-day game against Zimbabwe that shot him to orbit and stardom.
He made his Test debut on July 20, 2000 as wicket keeper batsman for Sri Lanka against South Africa in a Three Test series. He made his first three figure score which he will always remember when he made 106 against India when they toured here for a Three test series. He made his first double hundred against Pakistan in 2002 in the 2nd Asian test championship in Pakistan.
First double hundred
After making his first double hundred, making a string of double hundreds came naturally to him, so much so that in all he made 11 double hundreds, falling short by one more to equal the 12 double hundreds made by the late great Australian batting sensation and captain Sir Donald Bradman. He would have equaled the great Don, but a mix up by the scoreboard attendants in a Test at Galle against Pakistan made him remain unbeaten on 199. He would have gone past the Don and hugged the top slot of double century makers in Test cricket of all time, but was unfortunate to be ruled out at 197 caught when the ball was nowhere near his bat in a Test in Hobart against Australians.
But SANGAKKARA was not disappointed nor did he brood about the unfair dismissal or the scoreboard attendants mistake. He played a straight bat and took his challenges in his stride.
Legion of awards
He has been credited as the fastest batsman in Test cricket to reach 8,000, 9,000,11,000 and 12,000 runs. The awards he received were legion. He was ICC Cricketer of the year in 2012, in the same year Test cricketer of the year. He won the ODI cricketer of the year many times in 2011 and 2013. He was named Wisden's Leading Cricketer in the World in 2011 and 2015.
When his buddy Jayawardena quit the countrys captaincy, SANGAKKARA was the automatic choice to take over and he continued the excellent work initiated by Jayawardena and settled down to the onerous duties as captain with aplomb and had the distinction of leading the country to the World Cup final in 2011 in India against India.
How Sri Lanka lost that final after making a huge score of 274 and having India at 31 for 2 with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar gone cheaply was a matter that was inexplicable.
Rewriting record books
After writing and rewriting the cricket record books in all forms of the game, he retired from the shorter format in 2014 and the longer format in 2015. On retiring from captaincy he is on record having said 
Captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly . Its rarely a job you will last long in. I also had a two year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field when our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half-years, especially in the shorter form of the game.
All good things must come to an end, it is said and so it was for SANGAKKARA and in a poignant moment it would have been galling for him to shed bats and gloves at the conclusion of the Second Test against India at the world famous Colombo Oval June 27. 2015.
Best scoreboard
The P.SARA OVAL which has probably the best scoreboard in the world and maintained meticulously by the authorities and which ground is also a picture where all the greats have played, was gaily decorated fittingly for the occasion with banners that read  THANK YOU SANGA  and CLASS NEVER RETIRES.
Many tournaments
SANGAKKARA has played in many tournaments abroad which are too numerous to record. But his three year stint with Surrey in the English county scene would have been the most he enjoyed scoring heavily for the county. Like his good buddy Mahela Jayawardena he also showed his competence as a TV commentator joining the SkySports channel. His reading of the wicket, the game and tactics to be adopted were excellent and well received by viewers.
SANGAKKARA is the son of Anuska Surangana and Swarnakumara Sangakkara and has two sisters Thusari and Saranga and an elder brother Vemindra. He is married to Yehali and has twins, a girls and a boy named Swynee and Kavish.

## Title: Lets go for a General Election
## Supertitle: Prime Minister tells MPs:
## Section: Local

Prime Minister tells MPs:
Lets go for a General Election
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday asked for the support of all Parliamentarians to go for a General Election to let the people decide a Government of their choice to get out of the prevailing political standoff.
Addressing Parliament for the first time since assuming duties as the PM, he reminded that all Parliaments elected in 1947, 1951, 1956 and 1960 were dissolved prematurely to hold elections under similar situations in the past to let the people enjoy their sovereign powers to elect a Government of their choice.
The PM began his speech replying to the UNP MPs, who claimed that he was not the PM but an MP following the No-Confidence Motion.
Remember that I have held various titles before, including the tile of the President. I have held the Prime Ministerial portfolio and various Ministerial portfolios before. I do not care about titles. This post is no big deal for me. It does not matter for me if I become an MP or PM or just Mahinda Rajapaksa. Do not think that I am speaking because I want to be the PM, he replied.
Then he explained the circumstances which made him accept the PM post. The President had explained the reasons for dissolving the former government and establishing an interim government till the next general elections. As at October 26 People were under tremendous pressure owing to the former governments economic mismanagement caused by the fuel price increases from a pricing formula and the depreciation of rupee value.
The cost of living was increasing rapidly every single day and there was an unprecedented tax burden on people following the robbing of central bank through the means of Treasury bond scam. Interest rates had been doubled. The airports, harbours and profit making public ventures were up for the sale to foreigners. There were moves to outright selling of lands to foreigners and laws were amended to suit those moves. Actions had been taken to enter into trade agreements giving callous disregard to the opposition, of opinions of experts and local businessmen. Huge bribes had been asked from investors. There had been public displeasure against the former government owing to those reasons among others, he noted.
We saw the President dissolving the former National Economic Commission and striving to mitigate the damage on the economic front. We have also heard of arguments during the cabinet meetings between the President and the former Prime minister who were at loggerheads. It is in that context we witnessed the expose with tape records of a conspiracy by a group of UNPers with some police officers to assassinate the President, former Defence Secretary. It is owing to these developments that the President took a decision to remove the UPFA members from the government, he added.
With the pulling out of the UPFA members the coalition government that had existed thereto was dissolved. Thereafter, the President with the powers vested in him invited to me accept the Prime Minister post and to form a government. There were two choices before me  one was to accept the invitation or to reject it. I could have responded to the President by telling him to continue with the UNP as he did for nearly four years because there was one more year to go for the completion of that governments term. But we are the main force in the opposition. We are the biggest political party in the country. We are bound by the duty to come forward to avoid the country being sliding into disaster. We have a responsibility to support the Presidents effort to prevent a disaster and to uphold the national interests. Accordingly I accepted the responsibility of saving the nation from further chaos and crisis, he pointed out.
I also had a question as to what would happen to our country if it would continue one more year under the former government. From January 2015 the UNP government had obtained foreign loans amounting to 21 billion US dollars. That uncontrolled borrowing was the biggest damage to the countrys economy. What we established is only an interim government till the next elections. That was why only a few Joint Opposition MPs obtained ministerial posts. While the nation was plunging into the depths of disaster, we as the Joint Opposition continued to call for a general election to solve the crisis, he reminded.
However, the former government had rolled up the election map. For them it took three years to hold elections for the local government bodies which were dissolved in March 2015. They meddled with the local government election system and delayed elections under the excuse of errors in delimitation. Finally, the government was pushed to hold the elections by the chairman of the Elections Commission. As at today more than one year had passed since the dissolving of councils of Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern provinces. Three more provincial councils including the Northern Provincial Council were dissolved last month. But there are no elections for them, he observed.
When the President using the powers vested with him from the Constitution dissolved Parliament and called for an election the JVP and UNP went before the courts for the first time in the history to oppose elections. It is the very same combine who acted shamelessly to muddle the local government electoral system by introducing amendments to the electoral act from backdoor. They deprived the people of their right to franchise, he added.
While I was coming to Parliament this morning I saw a poster which was asking whose rights would be deprived from a general election. That is a pertinent question. All Parliaments elected in 1947, 1951, 1956 and 1960 were dissolved prematurely to hold elections to let the people to enjoy their sovereign powers to elect a government of their choice. That was how sovereignty of the people was protected. Similarly, on this occasion too, the President did the right thing as he was convinced that the former government was not able to solve the problems of the country. That was why he invited me to accept this post. As soon as I was sworn in as the Prime Minister there was a reawakening of the country with a hope, he remarked.
Our Speaker, in accordance with his partys and Western embassies wish, says that there was a passing of a No-Confidence Motion against me and government through the voice vote. You cannot pass a motion from a voice vote. There is a new trend stating that the former Prime Minister back in office after the so-called No Confidence Motion and some former ministers have their former offices too stating that they are in power now. It is the President who appoints the Prime Minister and governments, not the Speaker of Parliament. Neither Parliament nor the Speaker has been given such powers by the Constitution. The Speaker must be unbiased, he stressed.
Now, there is a conflict of opinions between two parties in Parliament. I propose that there is no mean in attempting to solve this problem by 225 members here and to refer it to electors numbering over 15 million in this country. Let them decide the government they need. That is the Parliament tradition. As politicians we all must understand that as per our constitution sovereignty is with people not with Parliament. I am happy to hear that JVP was stating yesterday that they would support if there is a motion to the effect of going for a general election after dissolving Parliament. I would like to ask the UNP what their standpoint over the matter is. I hope they would inform parliament today of their standpoint, he said.

LOW GROWNS MEET WITH FAIR DEMAND
The weekly tea auction which ended on Wednesday ( 14) saw Low Growns meet with fair demand. Select best BOP1 / OP1s held firm, whilst others gained in value. OPs sold at dearer rates. Well-made OPAs held firm, others appreciated.
Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC Director/ Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake told Daily News Business yesterday that Pekoe / Pekoe1s gained in value all-round. In the Tippy Small leaf catalogues select best FBOP1/FBOPs sold at lower rates. Below best and others appreciated. Few select FBOPF1s held firm.
Others declined in value. FBOPFs sold at lower rates. Few select best BOP/BOPFs held firm, whilst others sold at lower rates. In the Premium Flowery catalogues long leaf and small leaf tippy teas discounted sharply.
There was less general demand in the Ex-Estate catalogues. Better Western BOPs declined Rs.20 to Rs. 30 with some withdrawals; others lost a further Rs. 10. Select Coloury BOPFs held firm, but others declined Rs. 20 to Rs. 30. Nuwara Eliya BOP / BOPFs were lower all-round.
Select Udapussellawa BOP were firm to dearer on special inquiry; others and BOPFs were lower Rs. 20 to Rs. 30. Uva BOP / BOPFs declined Rs. 20 to Rs. 30; others and the BOPFs lost Rs. 20 on average.
Few select best CTC PF1s were firm. Below best declined Rs. 10 to Rs. 20, poorest eased further. A few Better BP1s were firm; others declined Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.
Meanwhile, Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd Director Jehan Algama said that improved weather conditions with better sunlight have been experienced in the plantations during the last few days following several days of heavy rainfall. Workers in the High and Medium category plantations too have now returned to work after one week of holidays for the Deepavali Festival.
Crop harvests are now poised to increase, and Estate Managers need to keep a close scrutiny on the green leaf quality that is accepted for manufacture. During cropping periods, past experience will tell us that the vast majority of poor leaf, plain liquoring teas have got neglected and even been difficult of sale, whilst, well made, true to grade teas have invariably attracted reasonable prices, Algama told Daily News Business yesterday
He said: This year will be no exception and critical attention is therefore required to monitor the standard of leaf that is accepted for manufacture from now onwards
The Sri Lanka Tea Board has released the data of orthodox teas sold during Jan/Oct. which indicates a total volume of 224 million kilograms that have been sold through the auctions at an average of Rs.590.04. The Low Grown sector has sold 147.7 million kilos at Rs.607.29 whilst Western High Growns have sold 30.4 million kilos at Rs.600.40.
A weight of 20.4 Million kilos representing CTC manufacture has also been sold during the period under review at an average of Rs.512.94. The combined total of both Orthodox and CTC teas reveals that a total weight of 244.4 Million kilos have been sold during the first ten months this year at an average of Rs.583.61.
It is salient to note however, that all sectors have performed lower than during the corresponding period last year, both in terms of quantity and price.
The 2.5 million kilos of Low Growns on offer this week met with good demand. In the leafy grades segment, the better made BOP1s/OP1s and OPs/OPAs were fully firm although Pekoe grades were barely steady. FBOPs in the Tippy catalogue were firm as were select best FBOPF1s. Others were irregularly lower.
There was sustained demand from Saudi Arabia, Syria, U.A.E and the C.I.S whilst Iran was less forceful. Buyers for Turkey were more selective.
Ex-Estate teas met with less demand resulting in much lower prices. The greater majority of offerings had plain and uninteresting quality, and these teas lost Rs. 20-40/- per kg.
A very limited selection of best Westerns that had maintained quality however, were in receipt of firm prices. Buyers from Japan and Europe were selective.
CLIPPER LAUNCHESPLASTIC-FREE TEABAGS MADE FROM BANANA
Tea giant Clipper is to launch a new plastic-free teabag that will be made from a type of banana.
The green alternative is part of the companys ambition to lower its carbon foot print and reduce the environmental impact of its tea products.
A number of leading tea brands currently use polypropylene, a sealing plastic, to fasten tea bags and make sure they keep their shape.
Clipper announced that, as of October 20, it has moved all production to a new type of tea bag that, instead of the plastic polypropylene seal, will use natural plant-based materials.
The tea bags will be made using a blend of abaca, which is a species of banana, and a biopolymer made from a non-GM plant material known as PLA.
The new bags will also be biodegradable and compostable to industrial standards, making them more eco-friendly.
The tea company, one of the UKs biggest, is believed to be the first brand to introduce a plastic-free tea bag.
Other leading companies, like PG tips and the Co-op, said earlier this year they both plan to switch to biodegradable tea bags by the end of the year. (Source: Evening standard.UK).
CHINA BUYS $1 MN OF INDIAN BLACK TEA
Indias ongoing campaign to increase tea exports to China paid off this month with an order for $1 million in black tea to supply COFCO (China Tea Co.) the largest of Chinas tea companies.
Jay Shree Tea & Industries will ship several hundred thousand kilos of Assam cut, tear, and curl (CTC) tea, in the latest and largest of several transactions between the worlds major tea producing countries.
Year-on-year growth in tea sales was 29 percent in 2017 with China paying $25 million for approximately 9 million kilograms of Indian teas.
Prices were not disclosed but Shree is likely to have negotiated a higher average rate per kilo based on quality. COFCO benefits from the higher price Chinese are willing to pay for tea.
China is now Indias 10th largest tea export destination, the result of a concerted effort by the Indian Embassy in Beijing and Indian Consulates in Shanghai and Guangzhou to promote Indian tea.
Jay Shree Industries is part of the B. K. Birla Group, a conglomerate with substantial holdings in chemical production, fertilizer, sugar production, and real estate. The tea divisions 27 gardens account for 3 percent of Indias total output and 11 percent of the Darjeeling harvest.
It is the only tea company in India with large estates in every major tea growing region. Jay Shree also has substantial holdings in East Africa. Under the supervision of Managing Director D. P. Maheshwari the company has invested in modern packaging equipment located at the factories to preserve freshness and reduce outlays to middle men.
Technological up gradation and modernization is a continuous process, writes Maheshwari of the China outreach. The deal was signed during Chinas first global import expo in Shanghai, an event that resulted in $57.83 billion in trade deals across many sectors.
The week-long China International Import Expo (CIIE) attracted 400,000 buyers and 3,600 exhibitors from 172 countries, according to a report by the China Internet Information Centre.
Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, driven in particular by its increasing popularity in China, accoounting to The Economist Intelligence Units (EIU) monthly forecast of consumption growth. EIU predicts a relatively high 4.6% average in 2019-20 that is in line with the long-term historical average.
Tea consumption will continue to be dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2018, up from 48 percent in 2010, according to EIU.
Most of this growth is due to the rising demand of Assam CTC black tea, known for its strong colour and flavour, which goes well with milk-based tea drinks. (Source: WTN).

May wins Cabinet backing for Brexit deal
UK: British Prime Minister Theresa May won the support of her bitterly divided cabinet on Wednesday for a draft divorce deal with the European Union that has put both Brexit and her leadership at stake.
May emerged from a five-hour meeting with ministers that had sent the value of the pound gyrating to announce she had the governments collective backing to move ahead with the plan.
The collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration, May said outside her Downing Street office.
A spokesman said the meeting ended without any explicit threats of resignation and everyone unwinding with a glass of wine and some snacks.
But the embattled leader conceded that she could face even stronger resistance when she takes the 585-page text to parliament for approval next month.
Rumours of ministers quitting and a plot by eurosceptic MPs in Mays own party to unseat her saw the pound plunge one percent in a wild hour of trading that ended with the currency on the upswing.
The European Unions chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the divorce was making decisive progress that still required lots and lots of work.
The blueprint agreed on Tuesday capped a year and a half of politically fraught negotiations aimed at unwinding nearly 46 years of British EU membership.
Its announcement saw May come under attack from both those backing a cleaner break with Europe and those dreading a future in which Britain strikes out on its own.
Mays government is split between the two camps -- as is parliament and much of the country.
The premier said she engaged in an impassioned debate with her ministers -- and that there will be difficult days ahead. But she added: The choice before us is clear.
This deal, which delivers on the vote of the (2016) referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union -- or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all. May did not explain how Brexit might still not happen on March 29 -- a possibility rooted on passionately by many of those who lost the 2016 vote by a 52-48 margin.
Barnier said the two sides had crucially found the right formula to avoid a hard border between British Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland -- the main sticking point in the talks.
The agreement sees the whole of Britain staying in a customs arrangement with the EU as a backstop if the two sides fail to reach a broader agreement within a 21-month transition.
EU Council president Donald Tusks office said he would give a Brexit statement on Thursday in which he could announce the date of a snap EU-UK summit the Irish aimed at finalising the deal.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he expected the 28 leaders to meet on November 25.
Appearing before the House of Commons earlier Wednesday, May confronted the anger of lawmakers who may yet try to oust her government in the weeks to come.
Conservative Party MP Peter Bone, a leading eurosceptic, accused May of not delivering the Brexit people voted for.
In Boston, the town in England with the highest Brexit vote in Britain, residents agreed.
Its crap, retiree Kathrine Denham, 74. Shes reneging on everything we voted for. More ominously, the Northern Irish party propping up Mays government threatened to break their alliance over leaks about a special arrangement for the British province.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she expected to be personally briefed about the deal by May, warning that there will be consequences if the leaks were true.
Northern Ireland would have special status under the backstop proposals, which would align it with the European single market.
This means that some checks will be required between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country on farm products and agriculture.
The arrangement has not gone down well in Scotland, where the pro-independence and europhile government also questioned the deal.
Its nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon asked why Northern Ireland should have a special status that would effectively keep it in the European single market while Scotland should not.
Importantly, its outlines won the backing of big business, whose support is vital for May as she tries to sell the plan.
The Confederation of British Industry said the draft moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice.
The governing body for Londons City financial district said the text provides welcome clarity and a foundation for financial services. - AFP

Microsoft partners with SLASSCOM  at inaugural AI Asia Summit
Microsoft partnered with the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) last week, to help lead a growing conversation around AIs transformative potential in Sri Lanka.
At Sri Lankas first flagship conference dedicated to the topic of AISLASSCOM AI Asia Summit 2018, Microsofts Senior Solution Architect for Data and AI, Christoper Gunawan, addressed 320 local business decision makers, IT decision makers, developers and startups. He unveiled Microsofts latest developments in AI across application, research and adoption alongside critically acclaimed international and local speakers.
In his keynote, Christoper explained how organizations of varying sizes and industries are leveraging the power of AI, and the cloud, to accelerate performance. This new era of AI is driven by the combination of almost limitless computing power in the cloud, the digitization of our world, and breakthroughs in how computers can use this information to learn and reason much like people do. Microsoft is offering an open and flexible platform with powerful tools and services for developers to enable business innovation with digital agents, intelligent apps and business processes. By partnering with SLASSCOM at their inaugural AI summit, we believe we can actively drive Sri Lankas AI transformation. At Microsoft, we believe AI holds the key to a new era of innovation, one where computers begin to work intelligently on our behalf. Its an era where technology will become more intuitive, more conversational, more intelligent, enabling local businesses to better know and serve their customers in ways previously unimaginable, he added.
The decision to host Sri Lankas first conference and workshop dedicated to the topics of AI followed discussions with the local community and SLASSCOM. The event highlighted the IT industrys potential to become a US$ 5 billion industry by 2022creating 200,000 direct job opportunities, and enabling the launch of up to 1,000 startups.
Sri Lanka needs to diversify its export-based services in order to climb up the global value chain, said Hasitha Abeywardena, Country Manager, Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives. Were excited about the opportunities that AI bring to people and its ability to help us achieve more. But its important to us that we build upon an ethical foundation. We believe everyone should have access to the benefits of AI, including the tools needed to create and transform work. We want to remove the barriers that are preventing people from creating the next generation of AI-powered products.

Parliament erupts in chaos
Dramatic scenes of chaos ensued in Parliament yet again yesterday after Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who on Wednesday directed a no confidence motion at breakneck speed against incumbent Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government and passed the same by taking a voice vote, called for the approval of the House to take another vote, in which the representatives of the House must call their names against the Premier and the Cabinet.
Speaker Jayasuriya called MPs to take a vote by name against the so called no-confidence motion in the Premier after the latter had addressed Parliament yesterday. The Premier was not given the opportunity to make a statement at the opening day of Parliament on Wednesday as was set out in the schedule.
At the beginning of the session, the Speaker ordered vociferous lawmakers to conduct themselves as Parliamentarians as they were shouting and yelling preventing the address of Prime Minister Rajapaksa for the second time.
What is the message you give to the world by behaving in this manner the Speaker asked, Let honourable Mahinda Rajapaksa address Parliament.
Some members shouted on this occasion insisting that Mahinda Rajapaksa be removed from his Prime Minister post calling him an MP.
Rajapaksa responded. I may be Prime Minister Rajapaksa, or MP Rajapaksa or just the regular and modest Rajapaksa, but even the most regular and the most modest Rajapaksa cannot be put away to be dispensed with.
You may remember this well, he said. He said that the Prime Minister post is not something of the sort super colossal to him. May be it is so for some other characters, but not for me. He said.
I had been a Prime Minister and had run the office of a Prime Minister before. It is not something monumental in my case.
So do not think I am talking with a swollen head as a Prime Minister, he told the House.You may do well to remember that I was in Parliament even as an infant, because men in my lineage had always been in these chambers.
This has never been a game of positions. The President of this country has explained to the nation what led to the establishment of a new government.
By October 26 last month, the countrymen were living under tremendous pressure. There was a huge disapproval by the public against the government over its infamous fuel price formula, depreciation of the rupee, rising cost of living unprecedented taxations, Central Bank robbery, interest rates that soared by double due to this, selling of profitable state own vital assets such as harbours, airports and government properties, and the eagerness to sell such assets, introduction of new land laws to sell State lands for permanent ownership, ignoring and disregarding ideas of intellectuals and local business community in the country, entering into foreign, soliciting astronomical bribes from foreign investors and many other pacts without heeding to advice offered by intellectuals and local businessmen.
We observed how the President had dismissed UNPs economic management committee and tried minimising the damages otherwise could have been inflicted on the country. We learned how that there had been disagreements and altercations between the Cabinet and the Prime Minister concerning these issues.
It is in this context an attempt to assassinate the President came into the fore with allegations levelled against a group of UNP MPs as being behind the conspiracy. We get to hear the recordings of attempts to assassinate the President with evidence.
It was after this that the President decided to take out the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) from the government. With UPFA walking out of the government, the unity government has been dispersed.
It was under these circumstances, the President, under the powers vested in him by the Constitution, called me to take over the position of Prime Minister and to form a government.
I had the opportunity to accept or reject his offer - if I wanted I could have said that the UNP may continue to run the government as they have been running it for nearly four years. There was only one year remained. But we are the main group of opposition, although the Speaker did not realise us as such.
We are the biggest political party in the country. We have a duty to accept the Presidents offer as a responsible opposition. Accordingly, I accepted that responsibility.
My main concern was what will be the outcome of the fate of this country if UNP governs this country any longer, he said.

Peace Air ties up with Chinese company  to purchase 8 Bell helicopters
Peace Air Pvt. Ltd signed up an helicopter purchase and maintenance agreement with Chairman, Jinlianan International Investment Consultant (Beijing) Co., Ltd. Chongqing, China. This is to launch a domestic Helicopter aviation service in Sri Lanka.
Vice President, Peace Air Pvt Ltd, Ireha C. Wethasinghe said that they hope to purchase 8 Bell helicopters (5 and 18 seater) under this agreement and two would be delivered by early next month. Our total requirement is 8 helicopters and we hope finalize the complete deal by end 2019. The domestic operations would be operated under Peace Air Helicopter Service.
She said that they will launch daily flights to most of the domestic airports from both Ratmalana and Colombo international airport. We will also use the smaller aircraft for domestic charters.
A local airline crew consisting of mostly former Air Force officers would be recruited to for the operation and they will also launch an online ticketing platform so that passengers could plan their journey in advance.
Chairman, Jinlianan International Investment Consultant (Beijing), Li Xianglin, said that they have observed that Sri Lanka tourism sector is growing rapidly and decided to assist Peace Air Pvt Ltd, to raise capital not only for their Helicopter Service but also for their international airline operations which would be launched on Independence Day on February 4.
He said that the Chinese government has now allowed several domestic airports to operate direct flights and Peace Air would be flying to these destinations. There are around 18 million Chinese that travel overseas and I think Sri Lanka can easily attract 30% of this market which would be about 5. 4 million passengers per year.
Chairman Peace Air, Gamini Wethasinghe said that they will also look at operating to new European destinations and also to routes like Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Hong Kong which were abandoned by SriLankan.

Let us keep innovating and providing an optimal service to our passengers and driver partners, commented Ajit Gunawardena Chairman PickMe.

Pickmes game changing attributes include a fair and transparent pricing method, passenger and driver safety as well as faster and accurate ETA (estimated time of arrival).
Within a short span of three years, PickMe has been able to use technology to change the way people access vehicles in Sri Lanka successfully. Our technological capacity is the linchpin of our success. Hence we decided to make a strategic move forward by allowing our IT department the freedom and the comfort of a separate location.
This move will help us improve the effectiveness of our services and create the next generation of artificial intelligence algorithms, to help improve safe and efficient transportation, commented Jiffry Zulfer CEO PickMe.
The PickMe Advance Technology Centre is well equipped in terms of professionals and facilities to allow the Company to explore various avenues to adapt and improve its platform and services in line with the constantly changing environment of technology and cyber security.
PickMe will continue to innovate in order to understand, predict, and to improve efficiency of the experience of both passengers and driver partners.

PIM conducts annual student research day
The Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), the Nations Management Mentor conducted its 5th Annual Student Research Day on October 30, at its premises.
MBA students of the PIM presented their research work. The day also provided an excellent opportunity for a meaningful intellectual interaction among research students and leading academics. The aim of the research day is to strengthen management research, which will make the PIM a center of management excellence in South Asia. Furthermore, the research day showcased the efforts taken by the PIM Research Center to create a vibrant research culture at the Institute in particular, and in the country at large.
Another noteworthy event at this occasion was the launch of the monograph on employee engagement titled Measuring the Engagement Level of Employees in Sri Lankan Industries  A Sri Lankan Perspective with Special Emphasis on FMCG, Polymer, Banking, Insurance and Finance Sectors. This monograph is, in fact, a unique contribution to the existing literature on employee engagement. Its findingshave been based on an exhaustive survey conducted with a sample size of 12000.
Prof. Lester C. Massignham, a leading Management Consultant and Researcher was the chief guest. He expressed his delight at seeing the PIMs vital role in promoting management research, and highlighted the importance of research for higher education institutes while identifying several critical aspects of research with respect to impact and relevance.
Prof. Ajantha S. Dharmasiri, Director, PIM, emphasized the importance of research in the PIMs deliberations as it is one of the key pillars of the institutes edifice of excellence. Prof. J.A.S.K. Jayakody, Head of the PIM Research Centre, thanked all paper-presenters for their hard work, and said that the conduct of the 5th research day amply proved the PIMs ability to sustain its commitments.

Police notified to probe knife wielding MPs inside Chamber
Complaints have been made to police against two MPs who smuggled knifes into the Chamber and instigated violence yesterday, Consumer, Cooperative Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister Johnston Fernando said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo yesterday he said a written complaint has already been made to the IGP and the lawyers are now preparing relevant documents to institute action against the offending MPs for their behaviour. This act is illegal and police should conduct a full investigation into the breach of security inside the Chamber, he said.
MP Indika Anuruddha said harmful objects were brought into the Parliament and MP Ranjan Ramanayake had pulled out a knife from his waist and threatened them. State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said only the Speaker and the President do not undergo security checks before entering Parliament and all the other MPs need to undergo a security check.
It is baffling how two knifes entered the Chamber without any detection, he said.

Police seek AGs advice in Malaka case
A case involving an incident where Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had allegedly assaulted on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo has been referred to the Attorney General for his advice, police informed court.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident had informed Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court that they have sought Attorney Generals advice regarding two counter cases. Police further told that they were yet to receive Attorney General's advice regarding the incident.
At a previous occasion, court decided to name Scotsman James Francis Casserly as a suspect in a case where he had allegedly punched Malaka Silva in the face during the scuffle at a nightclub in Colombo 3, in 2014.
Further magisterial inquiry into the two counter cases fixed for May 30 next year.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva were arrested over an alleged assault on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3 on October 31, 2014. Police complaints were subsequently lodged by both parties claiming they had been assaulted.
As a part of the investigation regarding the Scotsmans complaint, police had arrested and produced in Court seven suspects including Malaka Silva. They are currently on bail.
Malaka Silva's lawyers alleged that police had failed to take legal action regarding their complaint that Malaka Silva was severely assaulted by Scotsman and even had a scratch on Malakas nose.
Taking into consideration the evidence placed before Court, the then Additional Magistrate decided to name James Francis Casserly as a suspect.

Political crisis could have a negative impact on SL - Moodys
Uncertainty about the direction of future policy following the recent political crisis could have a large and lasting negative impact on international investors confidence, undermining Sri Lankas ability to refinance forthcoming external debt at affordable costs, says Moodys investor service in their 2019 Global Emerging Market Outlook report published yesterday.
Sri Lankas large external financing needs and substantial foreign currency government debt raise its vulnerability. External payments due over the next year are materially higher than foreign exchange reserves, reflected in our forecast of an EVI of 161% for 2019, the report further added.
The governments gross borrowing requirement of about 16%-20% of GDP and significant foreign currency borrowing on commercial terms also make Sri Lanka sensitive to external financing conditions. Lengthening average government debt maturities mitigate this risk.
Moodys commenting on the regions says that trade tensions are the biggest risk to Asia Pacifics broadly stable outlook, with tightening global liquidity posing another risk.
Most economies will continue to grow at a solid, if slowing pace. However, growing trade tensions between the US and China could hurt growth and sentiment. For financial institutions, tightening dollar liquidity and rising interest rates pose some risks. Structured finance transactions will continue to perform strongly in China, but some delinquency rates may rise in India.
For corporates and infrastructure and project finance issuers, our expectations for earnings stability or growth support our stable outlook. But we expect a more challenging year for a number of sectors.
Slower global growth, rising interest rates, trade protectionism and geopolitical tensions pose challenges for emerging markets in 2019. Our broadly stable outlook incorporates the likely resilience of most EM issuers to these challenges, thanks to a range of different buffers including strong balance sheets, domestic growth and supportive policy.
 Nonetheless, credit stress could emerge for issuers operating in countries with macroeconomic imbalances or rising political risk, particularly those highly reliant on international financing.

Those five runs penalty:
Roshen didnt do it deliberately says Karunaratne
PALLEKELE, Thursday: Sri Lanka Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne sprung to the defence of team mate Roshen Silva and said that his failure to ground his bat at the non-strikers end while taking a run was not done with deliberate intentions.
I dont think Roshen did it deliberately he thought the ball had gone for four and he came back to his partner to give a high five. Those things can happen it is part of the game. We dont blame him. We are not so worried about the five runs, said Karunaratne at the end of the second day of the second Test at Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
The manager spoke to the umpires and they (the umpires) thought Roshen did it deliberately, he said.
Praising Silva for his knock of 85 that has enabled Sri Lanka to gain a useful 46-run first innings lead over England, Karunaratne said, Roshen is a good player of spin. We saw him in Delhi where he played against Jadeja and Ashwin. He has one option and that he can use it to his advantage. Thats why on a turner like this he can take the option of rotating the strike instead of going for big shots.
We can see how important it is when Roshane bats because when he keeps on rotating the strike its difficult for a bowler to bowl on one spot. When Akila (Dananjaya) and Roshane were batting England found it difficult to bowl. That is the importance of having a player like Roshane. His success from school till now and for him to perform well in domestic cricket is because he has a good mind set.
Karunaratne stated that if Sri Lanka can pick up two early wickets before England wipe out the 46-run deficit tomorrow morning they will be able to put them under pressure.
We have to reduce their boundary options and allow them to score only in singles because they scored in fours and sixes in the first innings. That is what they did to overcome the spin. We will have to stop them from going for those big shots and try to play with their patience, said Karunaratne.
England hit a total of seven sixes and 24 four in their first innings of 290.
On Sri Lankas improved batting performance yesterday, Karunaratne said, We didnt talk much but its all about the mindset. We were thinking that England will play like South Africans but they played a really good game at Galle. Their batsmen were good against our spinners playing sweeps and reverse sweeps. When they scored 300 plus we were under pressure and we lost a couple of wickets in the morning thats why we finished on the losing side.
We discussed a few things about the mindset with the coach and we wanted to be more attacking and put them under pressure instead of playing defensive. The coach said to play with an attacking mindset.
About his run out Karunaratne said that it was very unfortunate and that it was a lesson to be learnt for the future.
England were struggling to break the partnership I had with Dhananjaya (de Silva). They tried a lot of things but we managed to counter them, however we took a wrong call. We neednt worry about that because we will learn from them. The next time we will study the fielder before making a run. Ben Stokes has a strong arm so we will be cautious against him the next time.

England gets taste of own medicine as Lankan tail wags :
Roshen Silva leads fight back with 85
PALLEKELE, Thursday  Roshen Silva led Sri Lankas fight back in the second Test with a characteristic innings of 85 to give his team a crucial 46 runs lead on the first innings over England on a turning Pallekele International Stadium pitch.
Thanks to half-centuries from Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhananjaya de Silva and Roshen Silva who received excellent support from the tail Sri Lanka reached a total of 336 in reply to Englands 290. England survived one over before the close of the second day of the second Test to be nought for no loss and trail by 46 runs.
Silva was also involved in an unusual incident that resulted in England gaining five penalty runs (which was added to their first innings total) when he failed to ground his bat at the non-strikers end and umpire Marais Erasmus of South Africa handed over five penalty runs, which could prove decisive in a close game. [See separate story on incident]
Silva came to the wicket with Sri Lanka five down for 146 and was last man out for 336 holing out to mid-on after defying the England spinners for 217 minutes and 174 balls during which period he struck four fours and a six.
More importantly his presence in the middle blunted Englands three-prong spin attack as they managed to give back to England a taste of their own medicine when the last four Lankan wickets contributed a valuable 171 runs to the total.
Silva who was left out of the first Test but was included for the ongoing one because of the injury to captain Dinesh Chandimal made full use of the opportunity to cement his place for the rest of the series. Being a fine player of spin  he proved it with a match-saving of 74 not out against Indian spinners Ashwin and Jadeja on his Test debut at Delhi last year  Silva took on the England spinners with a lot of confidence the key to his success being able to rotate the strike often that forced the bowlers to change their line and length all the time against a left-hand/right-hand combination.
With Niroshan Dickwella (25), Dilruwan Perera (15), Akila Dananjaya (31) and stand-in skipper Suranga Lakmal (15 n.o.) he forged valuable partnerships of 46, 41, 56 and 28 respectively to frustrate England.
Prior to his arrival at the wicket, Sri Lanka had recovered from losing nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara as early as the third over to post a total of 127 largely through a 97-run liaison between Dimuth Karunaratne and Dhananjaya de Silva who both made fifties apiece.
The pair was motoring along the highway nicely with England getting desperate for a breakthrough when it was handed to them on a platter through a run out. Karunaratne responding to De Silvas call was run out by a direct throw from point by Ben Stokes, one of the best fielders in the England side.
Karunaratne perished for 63 scored off 125 balls (4 fours) and nine runs later England had another wicket when Stokes was again in the act plucking a blinder of a catch at slip to send Kusal Mendis packing off for one.
England continued their advance into the Lankan batting after the lunch break when in the third over of the afternoon De Silva who had played fluently for 59 off 98 balls (6 fours) got an outside edge to a leg-break from Adil Rashid and was snapped up by wicket-keeper Ben Foakes.
The Foakes-Rashid combination also accounted for Angelo Mathews when he too perished playing a similar shot to be dismissed for 20. At 165-6 Sri Lanka were in danger of conceding a big first innings lead to England.
It was at this stage that Roshen Silva decided to display his batting talent and put an end to Englands push. His display with the bat has placed Sri Lanka in a strong position to go for a series-levelling win if they can reproduce their first innings bowling performance on a pitch that has increasingly become difficult for batsmen to survive.

Rowdy scenes in the House
Pandemonium reigned in Parliament yesterday as members of both sides were on a collision course, which ended up in a show of their muscle power, unfolding a series of ugly scenes in an intensely heated brief sitting.
The House met with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya presiding and as he assumed his Chair the UPFA MPs hooted at him. The Speaker reacted with a Thank you and reminded all the MPs to act with restraint. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed the PMs seat while former PM Ranil Wickremesinghe chose to sit in a back row of the Opposition as same as on Wednesday.
At the outset, the Speaker announced that he would not recognize any MP as the Prime Minister, Minister, State or Deputy Minister, Chief Government Whip or Leader of the House as the Cabinet of Ministers stands dissolved after the No-Confidence Motion on Wednesday. A new Prime Minister and Cabinet of Ministers are not yet appointed. There is free seating for the convenience of business of the House today, he said.
I also remind you that according to the Standing Orders, the final decision on all Parliamentary affairs lies with the Speaker. Such a decision can only be challenged inside the Chamber, he added.
Leader of the House Minister Dinesh Gunawardena interrupting the Speakers speech said that he should first read President Maithripala Sirisenas letter which said that the President does not accept the NCM. The Speaker replied that he would read it aloud with the reply letter sent by him to the President. Then he gave the floor to PM Rajapaksa to make his speech.
As PM Rajapaksa concluded his speech, MP Lakshman Kiriella moved a motion which said that the House has no confidence on the statement made by Rajapaksa and called for a division by name for it. As the Speaker let the House decide as to whether there would be a vote on it, the UPFA MPs started protesting.
MP Thilanga Sumathipala hurriedly went near the Speakers Chair and both were engaged in a heated argument. Sumathipala was followed by a group of UPFA MPs and in a while the Speaker was under complete siege. UNP MPs Ranjan Ramanayake, Kavinda Jayawardena, Kabir Hasheem, Hector Appuhamy, Asoka Abeysinghe and Mangala Samaraweera also rushed near the Speakers Chair and formed a protective ring.
MPs exchanged blows near the Speakers Chair while Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando held the Mace in his hand to prevent the MPs from grabbing it. A water bottle, a dustbin, a copy of the Constitution were among the items hurled at the Speaker by the UPFA MPs. Amidst the free-for-all in the House, MPs Prasanna Ranaweera, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Harin Fernando and Naveen Dissanayake were seen exchanging heavy blows.
Caught up in the melee, MP Sidney Jayaratne and a few others fell on the floor. Some senior MPs of both sides including Patali Champika Ranawaka, Vijith Vijithamuni de Soysa and Sajith Premadasa were seen trying to separate the clashing MPs. PM Rajapaksa and former PM Wickremesinghe were seen seated throughout the fracas.
MPs Ananda Aluthgamage, Prasanna Ranaweera, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Piyal Nishantha, Udaya Padmashantha and Palitha Thewarapperuma were noted for their violent behaviour and many UPFA MPs repeatedly hurled abused at the Speaker. MP Ananda Aluthgamage grabbed the Speakers microphone and MP Dilum Amunugama injured his hand while trying to break the microphone. MP Amunugama was then taken to a hospital.
Ministers Dilan Perera and Pavithra Wanniarachchi led the slogan Moota vada Paba hondai. The beleaguered Speaker then left the Chamber, while the UPFA MPs cheered Jaya Wewa. After the Speaker left PM Rajapaksa and former PM Wickremesinghe also left the Chamber. While the UNP MPs came up with a slogan Mahinda hora penala giya, the UPFA MPs replied Benku hora penala giya. The JVP MPs joined with them with a slogan, horu dennama penala giya. As the Speaker left the Chair, the House stood adjourned. The MPs, who remained in the Chamber even after the adjournment, were seen sitting on the steps near the Speakers Chair. MP Susantha Punchinilame sat on the Secretary Generals Chair and was seen video recording the entire episode.
The Party Leaders, who met after the adjournment of the House, decided to have the next sitting at 1.30 pm today.

Sabarimala pilgrimage begins tomorrow
The Sabarimala pilgrimage season begins tomorrow; the first day of the Kasthikai in the Hindu calendar. Thousands of Ayyappan devotees will take part in the pilgrimage in Kerala, India.
Sri Lankan devotees at the All Ceylon Ayyappan temple on the Aluthmawatha Road in Colombo 15, are staging a 60-day fast before beginning the pilgrimage.
The temple had made the necessary arrangements for the journey.
Ayyappan is the Hindu God of growth and is the son of Shiva and Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu.
In Hinduism, he was born with the powers of Shiva and Vishnu, to confront and defeat the demon Mahishasura. He was raised by a childless royal couple and grew up as a warrior of dharmic living. In South India, Ayyappan images depict him riding a tiger, but in certain countries such as Sri Lanka, he is shown riding a white elephant.
Ayyappans popularity has grown in many parts of India, with the most famous Ayyappan shrine located in Sabarimala. The shrine receives millions of pilgrims every year in late December and early January. Many of them prepare for weeks before climbing the hill barefoot, making it one of the largest active pilgrimage sites in the world.

Silent stalkers
Juliet Coombe spends three days camping in Noel Rodrigos Leopard Safaris with award winning wildlife photographer Sajith learning all about the leopards secret world.
The wind howled behind me, rattling the trees as Sajith, Noel Rodrigo Safari Camp Manager spoke in hushed whispers to the group about Wilipattu National Park, a raw formidable wilderness, still rarely visited, with natural lakes - land of lakes is the English translation of Wilipattu, this north western oasis. Here, National Geographic leopard interactions have been recorded and, although there are fewer sightings, they are way more exciting. It was the drought season, explains Sajith, so, the ten lakes had dried up and Noel and myself had been driving round and round all day, but saw nothing. However, when we came out of the dust, we heard terrifying alarm calls from other jungle animals, and we tracked their screams to Villu, a natural water basin. Sure enough, out of the bush appeared a huge leopard that swished its tail defiantly and lay down in the opening.
Everyone round the camps dinner table was so gripped by the story they fell silent as he went on to explain, Then a few minutes later, as if out of a scene in the Jungle Book, a happy youthful sloth bear arrives looking for termites to eat. The bear, oblivious of the dangerous situation ahead, starts rambling playfully towards the leopard, who sits near a dried up muddy red termite mound, packed no doubt with millions of termite snacks, the perfect camouflage for the jungles King. Only when fifteen metres from the leopard does the bear realise, too late he has wondered into the leopards reach, as the leopard gets to his feet, bristling with anger. The bear rises to its full height and stands with his chest fully puffed out and his claws fully extended, showing the leopard his jungle prowess.
The scene was like a moment out of Fight Club as the leopard, with its lethal claws also fully extended, first mock pounced towards the bear, then lunged, trying to slash the body of the sloth and going for its jugular by using its hind legs as springs from which to jump. The ferocious bear, now showing its gritted teeth, nose pointing high in the air, fought back like a heavyweight boxer in the ring. He punched the air with his big furry paws, and realising he could not win against the leopard, growled ferociously and galloped away to escape being killed.
Sajith says, The funny part was that the leopard was not bothered and walked away slumping back down on the ground to carry on its forty winks, as in truth they prefer to eat more defenseless and delicious prey like deer and, being from the cat family, they are proud, not wishing to damage their beautiful spotted coats. Unbelievably, within minutes of the first action packed scene, a second huge male bear appeared and the leopard became even more angered by the disturbances. He went into a proper standoff position and there was a mock charge between them ending an epic day in the jungle.
This is just one of many extraordinary stories you will hear from Sajith over dinner and, despite a decade in the field, his enthusiasm for nature is positively infectious. He works between Sri Lankas two most important national wildlife parks, alongside his guru leopard visionary, Noel Rodrigo. Together, they capture both in pictures and word the secret world of the kingdom of leopards. Sajith loves the wildlife as he feels so much can be learnt from it and so, getting up at 4.30am every day to the hum of insects, is never an issue. Each morning safari is a unique adventure, whether it is sharing a shower with a Whip Scorpion or having to move a jungle snake out of the main path to the kitchen, on his way to check tea and coffee being made. Even the bananas are checked for being ripe enough but not over ripe, as, at Noel Rodrigo Leopard Safaris, every detail really matters, however small.
Clients on a Yala trip can come from any one of eight tents that range from doubles, to family size with a seated area in the middle, and even uber luxurious with tree trunk double beds and ensuite jungle bathrooms lit only by the full moon. At 4.45am a safari camp supervisor with an orange glowing lantern does the round of daily wake up calls through the netted windows of each tent until he hears we are really up and not opening one eye and going back to sleep. We gather our things before showering in the starlit open air bathroom and wash our teeth in a terracotta pot hanging from a tree branch, as the native people of the island would have done since the dawn of time. Turning on our torches and checking the pathway as we go, so as to not stamp on any of the little frogs or be caught out by a snake in search of its last nocturnal snack, we head along the windy trail past the salt water swimming pool to the Sun Sail meeting point for a shot of coffee over a pre-dawn briefing, which covers all the dos and donts in the park. Then, we are off to Yala Block 1.
Yala is an incredible reserve of nearly 10,000 hectares of pristine nature, where nothing or just about everything can happen, depending on the weather conditions, time of year, animal activities and the trail we pick. Sajith, being a highly experienced jungle guide, listens for the whistles of the jungle birds and movement of the trees. He points out along the way the mating dance of the peacock, a male bird showing off his feathers in all directions, like he is doing a dance routine for the Moulin Rouge to impress the pea hens with his posturing movements, who amuse us as in most cases they look fairly disinterested, preferring each others company. We learn in the quiet moments how leopards mark their territories with urine musk, the drips of urine telling us each ones territorial area and, in many ways, reading like a newspaper that indicates the age of the leopard and whether or not it is time for mating.
As the sun rises in the inter-monsoon period, the evergreen jungle is an orchestra of sounds and we count ourselves lucky to be here, for the first time in over two months of drought when Yala is shut to the general public, so the animals can mate in peace. We start our first wildlife safari by Kara Wak Lake, which is full of lively crocodiles snapping up fish, and overlooked by Sithulpawwa rock temple, a significant Buddhist site built in the 2nd century BC, boasting over 2,200 years of history. A place where one of the oldest pilgrimages in the world circles through the reserve and, like its name translates, makes peace with whatever troubles you. From Yala, the pilgrims are given special permission to walk on foot through the wildlife park during July and August, while making their way from Jaffna to Kataragama for the ancient water cutting ritual, which is defined by the position of the full moon and changes from year to year.
Heading onto Patanangala Rock, we learn more about pilgrim experiences on foot through the park, including one amusing story about a sloth bear that went into a camp during the night, and warmed its paws by the pilgrim fire. Sajith, as he passes around snacks, bean bags for us to rest our cameras on, and monopods, starts telling us about some of the 5,000 smaller creatures that inhabit the park and make it this incredible biosphere hot spot, as opposed to just focusing on the big five that attract people from all over the world.
Sajith explains that although the leopard is the parks showstopper, it is important to talk about the whole ecosystem and link things together, from the range of butterflies to the plants used by the nomadic island people, the Veddahs, who use everything in the jungle for medicinal and practical purposes. Interestingly the leopards eat grasses when they get fur balls and like so many other animals know which plants can help in the healing process.
As the day reaches its hottest point, we return to Noel Rodrigo Leopard Safaris camps site for breakfast and a cool dip in the pool. Some of the kids play match the animal footprint to the card game in the main lounge, while others catch up on forty winks or read books in the library. At 3pm, we are off again for another exciting adventure in Yala National park and more extraordinary wildlife moments.

The non-core vertical which includes Automobile and Leisure together contributed 4.8% to Group turnover while the IT sector made up 5.2% of Group topline, said Chairman, Ashok Pathirage.
Gross Profit grew 10% to Rs. 12.3 Bn during the 1HFY19holding GP margins at36% (35.9% in 1HFY18). Quarterly Gross Profit also improved 13.2% to Rs. 6.5Bn resulting in a GP margin of 35.6%.
Synergy and economies of scale protected profit margins, although there is severe pressure due to waning business sentiment and the ad hoc macroeconomic adjustments imposed by policy-makers.
Distribution expenses declined marginally by 2.7% to Rs. 1.5 Bn while administrative expenses increased 11.8% to Rs. 7.1 Bn during 1HFY19. This resulted in the total operational expenses to increase 8.9% to Rs. 8.7 Bn during the 1HFY19 leading the operational cost margins to improve slightly to 25.4% in 1HFY19 from 25.6% in 1HFY18. Resultantly, total operating costs increased 14.3% to Rs. 4.5 Bn during the quarter.
Other operating income declined 67.1% to Rs. 283 Mn during 1HFY19 as the comparative period had registered one-off disposal gain(Rs. 185.5 Mn in 1HFY18)while fee income from new loans at Softlogic Finance nearly halved consequent to a change in their product mix during the period. Similarly, other operating income for the quarter also reduced 81.5% to Rs. 86.6 Mn owing to the one-off disposal gain registered in 2QFY18 (Rs. 184.9 Mn) Softlogic Life Insurance recognized a deferred tax asset of Rs. 2.4Bn during 1HFY19 by utilizing the available brought forward tax losses already provided for in the books up to 31st March 2018.

This is currently the Groups most capital-intensive sector which is redefining the countrys retail landscape with several new projects in the pipeline.
A 100% cash margin was imposed on refrigerators, TVs, air-conditioners and phones seriously impacting cash flows due to the recent policy of removing bank accommodation for import bill refinancing requiring cash upfront for establishing import LCs. The imposition of applicable restrictions on selected import items, especially, in the electronics and footwear sector defeats the long-term vision of establishing Sri Lanka as a shopping destination to compete with other regional tourist destinations. Short sightedness of policy makers could result in several adverse side effects reverberating in the retail sector which is inextricably intertwined with the tourist industry as a whole.
ODEL Group and Softlogic Retail continued to be dominant contributors to the sector performance.

Squirrel feeding tips
Since they will eat almost anything you give them, its important to make sure youre not feeding them junk food. You want to make sure youre feeding squirrels foods that are high in nutritional value. Unfortunately, our furry little friends are vulnerable to something called metabolic bone disease, or for short, MBD.
This is a very damaging disease because it causes a squirrels bones to weaken. A lot of people help rehabilitate wild animals, and theyve noticed an increased occurrence of MBD. Since these furry little guys love sunflower seeds and peanuts, its easy for people to get carried away and feed them too many.
Its not that sunflower seeds and peanuts are incredibly harmful to squirrels; its just that they have very low nutritional value. Raw peanuts can be especially dangerous because they can harbor toxic mold.
Our furry little friends need a proper balance of essential minerals because these minerals are crucial for maintaining adequate bone health. Its important for squirrels to consume a balanced mixture of nuts, seeds, corn, fruit, leaves, fungi and bark.
Wild squirrels get their calcium intake from gnawing on deer antlers and animal bones. If you cant find these specific bones mentioned, you can go to your local pet store and ask them about bones that you can give to them  they should understand what you need!
Ever wondered how much water they drink As it turns out, squirrels actually drink a lot of water, and they need even more water during warm weather, lactation and pregnancy.
Its crucial that they have a clean source of water, and if they cannot get this from their natural environment, then there is nothing wrong with helping them out.
Some squirrel feeders come with an attachments for fresh water, or you can purchased a product that is specifically designed to provide them with fresh water.
A great natural food to give squirrels is the hazelnut. However, in other areas, there are many other natural foods that can be given to squirrels.
You can even grow or purchase hazelnuts and feed them to the little furry creatures in your backyard. A lot of people actually plan their backyards landscape to make it beneficial for squirrels, birds and other types of wildlife.
If you have a burning desire to feed the ones in your backyard, then that is perfectly fine, but its important to be respectful of your neighbors. There are some people who absolutely hate squirrels, as hard to imagine as that might be.
Even if your neighbours dont like them, you can still feed your furry little friends, but you should avoid placing food near the property line. Set up your squirrel feeders in an area that is in the middle of your property, towards the back. At the end of the day, nature watching and squirrel feeding should be enjoyable.

Sri Lanka bowlers defend modest target for first win
GROS ISLET, Wednesday: Sri Lanka struggled against the Bangladesh bowling attack to post just 97/7 in their 20 overs, but came back strongly through their pacers to complete a 25-run win in Match 11 of the ICC Womens World T20 2018.
Bowling first at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia on Wednesday, Bangladesh kept it tight in the Powerplay. Jahanara Alam picked up a wicket in the very first ball with a peach, and came back later to dismiss the experienced Shashikala Siriwardene to finish with figures of 3/21.
Siriwardene looked the most comfortable of the Sri Lankan batters, showing intent and top scoring with 31 off 33, while Nilakshi de Silvas cameo at the end took their total just short of three figures.
Sri Lankas pacers responded fiercely. Bangladesh too lost a wicket in the first ball, although a review might have saved them, as Udeshika Prabodani began proceedings with a double-wicket maiden.
The batters just couldnt break free and half the side was back in the hut for 36. Seven Sri Lankan players took the ball, and six finished with at least a wicket.
Bangladesh, who have lost all three of their games so far, play South Africa in their last game of the group stage. Sri Lanka next play the Windies on 16 November.

Taylors career best 4/12 sees Windies home
ST LUCIA, Wednesday - Stafanie Taylor, the Windies captain, led from the front with the ball as the hosts successfully defended their modest 107/7 by 31 runs against South Africa to get their second win of the ICC Womens World T20 2018.
Shabnim Ismails fiery three-over opening spell of 3/8 had laid a great foundation for South Africa to make it two wins in two, but the hosts brilliance on the field and Taylors career-best T20I figures of 4/12 in 3.4 overs helped the defending champions emerge victorious.
Choosing to bowl at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia on Wednesday, 14 November, the South African pacers made good use of the conditions and were smart about the wind. Ismail ran through the Windies top order, with good support from Marizanne Kapp and Moseline Daniels.
Natasha McClean and Kycia Knight scripted a recovery from 29/4, without ever going into their shells under pressure. Knight, the top scorer, was the last wicket to fall.
South Africa made a circumspect, if not spectacular start. At 48/1 in the 12th over, they would still have backed themselves to chase the target, but two pieces of spectacular fielding changed the momentum.
Having got out for a golden duck earlier, Taylor made amends by running through the South African middle order. With the pressure building and the crowd fully backing the home side, the batters folded meekly for 76.
The win took the Windies to the top of the Group A table.
They will play their third match on Friday, against Sri Lanka, while South Africa take on England earlier that day.
Scores: West Indies Women 107-7 in 20 overs (Kycia Knight 32, Natasha McLean 28, Shabnim Ismail 3/12, Dane van Niekerk 2/8)
South Africa Women 76 in 18.4 overs (Lizelle Lee 24, Marizanne Kapp 26, Stafanie Taylor 4/12)

Snake Bites:
Traditional cure loses allure
A.M. Siripala (71) lives in the village of Welegoda, Pohorawatte, Moragollagama, in the Polpithigama Divisional Secretariat. His father, grandfather and great grandfather have also lived in this same village. They were all ayurvedic practitioners or practice what is locally known as Sihala vedakam. This knowledge passed down from generation to generation, is the most valuable asset Siripala owns today. His familys speciality has been treating people for snake bites and their fame in curing people with snake bites has spread far and wide in the region. Whether Siripala can hand it down to the next generation however remains doubtful. The modern generation which is more interested in technology and gadgets, is fast moving away from what Siripala has to offer.
Treating snake bites
I received this gift from my father. From the time I was 20 years old, I have been accompanying my father on his medical visits. I am not even sure of the number of people I have cured with these two hands of mine. I have been practising these skills for the last 51 years. But these days we do not have a suitable environment to keep doing this. There are hospitals all over the place, and people who get bitten by snakes run to the hospital first. Earlier, we were the first to run to a patient who has been bitten by a snake. The world is changing fast. People are not so ready to accept our snake medicine now, but I still do my best to cure people in the way I know. I dont like to be idle. I have cured thousands of people in my lifetime, but today, my life is very difficult, said Siripala, as he sat in his hut, chewing betel.
The years have been unkind to his body as it looked frail and worn out. HIs face too had aged beyond his years, each wrinkle etched with years of experience and knowledge.
No matter how many patients I cured, I never did this for money. I sourced herbs and plants needed for the medicine from the jungle and I would make my own mix to remove the poison from the body. Thereafter, I would take that to the patient who needs treatment. At times, I would stay with the patient for three to four days and treat him. But I never thought of commercialising this medicine or selling it to people for money. That is why I dont even have a proper place to live in. I dont think I would have anyone take on my profession after me. But as long as I can, I will continue to do this work.
He however stated that his health was frail now and did not have much energy to do a lot of work. Eight years ago, his wife fell ill.
Hard times
I had to mortgage my land and paddy fields to treat her. I dont regret that. The doctors said they were not sure whether they would be able to cure her. But I spent everything I had and cured her. In the end, they said that she had a thyroid problem. Even today, she has to be under medication. It was in the midst of this that I was also diagnosed with a kidney disease. Usually when patients are bitten by a snake, I remove the poison by first sucking it out from his blood. Having done this for years, these poisons have accumulated in my own body, so today I have problems with my kidneys. My wife and I go to clinics every month now. We have to spend a lot of money for our medicines.
In his old age, he is helped by his 25-year-old son, a labourer earning a daily wage. Their home, built with clay and plaster, is breaking apart. The structure is crumbling and he is not sure how much longer it would last.
Amitha Kumarihami (51) who has stood by her husband for decades, expressed her regret thinking of how fortunes have fared for them. He would walk for miles to get to a patient and even then, he would not take much money. He was really committed to curing his patients, that is all he cared for. I just hope that we would be able to build ourselves a two-room hut to be able to die in peace in the final years of our lives, she said.
Their hope is that someone would come forward to help them with their home, given the situation they are in. This story is not just that of Siripalas. Many ayurvedic practitioners in our villagers have been left impoverished, unable to compete with commercialisation and the power of Western medicine. Their knowledge built over generations is also disappearing, with no one to record or document what they have been practising for generations.
A study published in the journal, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases in July 2016 showed that Sri Lanka had an annual hospital admission rate of 30,000 for snake bites and their study over 12 months showed that there were 400 deaths recorded islandwide due to snake bites alone.
Another study published in Science Daily in July 2017 showed that it cost the Sri Lankan government more than US$ 10 million every year to treat snake bites and led to a loss of nearly US$ 4 million for individuals affected by them.
This shows that if measures were taken to improve the livelihoods of these local practitioners, they could lower treatment costs as well as get to patients in a timely manner. Further, those who have served for people for years will have a better quality of life.

Uber posts US$1 bn loss in quarter as growth  in bookings slows
Uber Technologies Inc said on Wednesday (Nov 14) that growth in bookings for its ride-hailing and delivery services rose 6 per cent in the latest quarter, the third quarter in a row that growth has remained in the single digits after double-digit growth for all of last year.
The San Francisco-based firm lost US$1.07 billion for the three months ending Sep 30, a 20 per cent increase from the previous quarter but down 27 per cent from a year ago, when the company posted its biggest publicly reported quarterly loss on the heels of the departure of Uber co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.
Uber is seeking to expand in freight hauling, food delivery and electric bikes and scooters as growth in its now decade-old ride-hailing business dwindles.
The company, valued at US$76 billion, faces pressure to show it can still grow enough to become profitable and satisfy investors in an initial public offering planned for some time next year. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was US$592 million, down from US$614 million last quarter and US$1.02 billion a year ago.

UPFA denounces Speakers conduct
The UPFA yesterday vehemently denounced the inappropriate conduct of the Speaker and urged for a General Election observing that Parliament cannot function under a biased Speaker. The UPFA also held the Speaker responsible for the unfortunate situation that occurred yesterday with MPs from both parties behaving aggressively in House. They also said that they cannot accept the No Confidence Motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa based on the manner in which the voting was carried out by the Speaker.
They said the Speaker has violated the constitution, standing orders, rules and the tradition of the House. This is in turn has led to a very unfortunate situation. This is not good for the country and its people. We hold Speaker was responsible for all the chaos, Chief Government Whip S.B. Dissanayake pointed out.
Dissanayake said Lakshman Kiriellas attempt to have a vote on Mahinda Rajapaksas speech in the House was a joke.
Dissanayake was speaking at a press brief held at the Parliament premises yesterday afternoon together with Susil Premajayantha, Bandula Gunawardena, Tilanga Sumathipala, Udaya Gammanpila, Dallus Alahapperuma, Dayasiri Jayasekara and several other UPFA members.
Susil Premajayantha said there is no provision to suspend standing orders in such a way. Therefore, the Speaker violated SO of Parliament and with his biased intention allowed the Opposition to raise their requirement. JVP MP Vijitha Herath ran to the Speakers chair handed over a document to Secretary General and without even going through the contents of the document, Speaker asked for a vote. He decided to take a vote by listening to the sound. It is very unethical not regarding the Standing Orders and not knowing the document given to the Secretary General.
Premajayantha who criticized the attempt to vote against Rajapaksas speech in the House said someone can attempt to pave way for a Federal government in the middle of this chaos using the majority. He alleged that the UNP led opposition is planning to separate the country.
Dayasiri Jayasekara alleged that the Speaker was trying to assist Ranil Wickremesinghe to declare a government while remaining in the left side of the Chamber. Jayasekara said the seating arrangements of Wickremesinghe and Gayantha Karunathilake were suspicious and implied a malicious plan. According to Jayasekara, the UNP was trying to declare a government after the vote against Rajapaksas speech while remaining in the left side of the Chamber. In tradition, the governing party occupies the right-side of the Chamber while the Opposition remains in the left-side of the Chamber.
Bandula Gunawardena said that not even a community based society acts in the way in which the Speaker handled Parliamentary affairs in the last two days.
Udaya Gammanpila said diplomats who were present in the House expressed their happiness when the UNP led group declared a majority in Parliament. He said that such an expression shows that the UNP has pledged their support to western countries and are ready to sell the country to the West.

The LTTE attempts to eliminate Gota and CBK:
VIPs who survived assassination bids
The two LTTE suspects who were found guilty by High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka have been sentenced them to jail terms of 290 and 300 years to be served concurrently in 30 years as the HC case on Town Hall bomb explosion that killed 26 persons and seriously injured nearly 100 during the presidential election campaign on December 18, 1999. Earlier the court ruled that the confession made by the second accused was a voluntary one, thereby indicating that the Tigers were responsible for the assassination attempt. The two tragedies, what caused them, and subsequent expressions and conspiracy theories are so sickening and repulsive.
When the inquiry was taken up accused Velayudhan Vardharaja, Satyawel Ilangeswaran, Chandra Iyar Ragupathy Sharma and Wasanthi Ragupathi Sharma were produced as main accused. One of them, who confessed, however, had said that he signed a document written in Sinhalese and that he did not understand its contents. Victor Ivan, the investigative journalist, the political critic who wrote Queen of Deceit a book based on the life of former President Kumaranathunga put forward a conspiracy theory too. Ivan wrote that CBK, who lost one eye, herself, planned the attempt on her life in order to get a sympathy vote in the presidential election.
According to Ivan, Ragupathy, one of the three men accused was imprisoned in the Boossa camp; a jailor there had told Ivan that it seemed that Ragupathy had presented the bomber, as his patrons had promised him a fat sum of money; he details the bomb blast in his book, Queen of Deceit. Interestingly, Ivan mentions the name of Ragupathy Sharma, in the assassination attempt. The plan, as had been told, was to take into custody the woman along with an empty explosives belt at the venue of the meeting. Two explosions took place on the same day. The first was at a UNP rally in Ja-Ela at 8:50 pm and the second half-an-hour later at the UPFA rally at Town Hall. Ja-Ela bomb killed Major General Lucky Algama and 15 others.
A man named Abdul Gayum appearing before the magistrate confessed to having assisted in bringing the explosives used in the attack. Ivan also relates that on May 24, the police had produced four; Sinathambi, Rudra Ignatius, Bassist Fernando and Raja Sathyadran asserting that they met with LTTE leaders in Batticaloa in plotting the crime. However, following a brief confinement, on the 30th the court released them on bail due to lack of evidence. Interrogations revealed that this person had been asked to make a bogus confession on the assurance that action against him would be withdrawn on another crime for which he had been charged.
Ivan says, if the people who entered the venue were body searched, the bomber had to enter the place through the VIP entrance, and whether she entered through this gate with or without explosives belt is not certain. The prosecution had informed the court that the LTTE suicide bomber Manikkam Leela was from Thalamkudamunmune in Batticaloa and that her mother and sister of had identified her body. During the Magisterial inquiry, evidence given by ASP Nihal Perera of PSD as per Victor Ivans account he adds; the security forces were conscious of the threat to President Kumaratunga's life at the rally, Inspector of Police Linton Ratnayake  was only a junior police officer who handled the investigation on behalf of state. He cast doubts over the inquiry by stating that inconsistent evidence was presented to point out that an investigation was being carried out. However, the DNA test conducted following a magisterial request at the Glasgow University had negative results.
Ivan says a secret document for which he had access was prepared by O.K. Hemachandra DIG, that was sent to the IGP and it casts doubts on both explosions; according to it a person called Kudu Mahinda had been involved in it with a group of army officers who carried out the Ja-Ela bomb; a video footage had discovered that some of his men had attended Town Hall premises too.
Meanwhile, R.K.N. Ananda, an expert in explosives of the Katunayake Air Force Base, had spoken to Ivan and told that he was sent along with Nihal Karunaratne PSD Chief to Germany to see the work on bulletproof BMW car used by her, and according to Ananda he had met CBK soon after the tragedy; the President had said, Ananda if the car had been one inch higher I would have been okay. Ivan continues, CBK on hearing that Anuruddha Ratwatte had selected a team to probe the attack, she warned him not to get involved in things that doesnt [sic] concern him.
Tragedy at Pittala Handiya
Girls at Bishops College, in the close vicinity, were practising a Christmas carol service when the bomb exploded; students had been ordered to lie down on the floor as a protective measure.
A valuable piece of evidence had surfaced on the gas mask that was found in the vehicle in which Gota travelled on that day.
The bomber struck as the convoy stopped due to traffic, an eyewitness said. The LTTE suicide bomber, carrying a ten-kilogram bomb had been following Gotas convoy in a three-wheeler. A backup vehicle cut across the path of the three-wheeler just before he detonated himself. Rajapaksa, unhurt because of the bulletproof vehicle he was travelling, was immediately pulled out of his vehicle and rushed to the Temple Trees while commandos cleared the area of traffic.
The three-wheeler driver, as per this report, had been an informant of the defence intelligence, a spy who spoke Tamil fluently, and also the three-wheeler was given to him by the forces. The Defence Ministry had been crediting monies to his account for his services. In the abovementioned bomb blast, seven civilians and seven members of the security staff of Gotabhaya sustained injuries. Two of them died. Eight vehicles were damaged.
How it became Pittala Handiya (Brass Junction)
In the early 80s, a family from Pilimatalawa set up an open shop on the little border on the right side of the street. After the bomb blast, the lone salesman was arrested saying he was in a key position to be a spy, sitting there watching traffic, movements of security. After questioning he was asked to leave the area. However, a neighbour intervened and explained that without them the name Pittala Handiya would not have survived. On their guarantee police allowed the family to continue selling their brassware.

Why American oil hasnt been a total game changer
The United States in recent years has stunned the globe by becoming the worlds biggest oil producer, a remarkable about-face for a country that a decade ago reeled from reliance on pricey imported crude. So why does it seem so hard to translate that so-called energy dominance from rhetoric into reality
President Donald Trumps tweet-borne rage with the oil-price rollercoaster in recent months, and OPECs subsequent efforts to fix the market by adjusting the amount of oil it pumps, illustrates the frustration many in Washington feel when they see what looks like a huge US energy boom failing to deliver on promises of dominance or independence.
But the reality is that the notion of energy dominance, as repeatedly trumpeted by the administration, is at heart a hollow idea. Even Americas position as the top producer in the world isnt enough to shield it from rising prices, free it from Middle East entanglements, strangle foes with sanctions, or even give it many additional foreign-policy tools.
The ultimate irony is that what created the US energy revolution  nimble, private-sector companies using new technologies to extract previously untapped crude  keeps the United States from wielding its energy strength in the way that Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other big producers with state-owned firms willing to put geopolitics above profits do.
Ironically, the precise strength of the US energy sector  that it is driven by the market and not by a government  also means that it is not a stick to beat people with, said Bruce Jones, the director of the foreign-policy programme at the Brookings Institution.
Nobody can deny the historic size and speed of Americas transformation from energy importer to major producer and exporter in its own right. The United States currently produces 11.4 million barrels per day, with forecasts of more than 12 million barrels a day next year. Since the beginning of the shale boom a decade ago, the United States has essentially discovered the resource equivalent of another Iran and a Kuwait trapped in Texas and North Dakota shale formations.
Its a stunning turnaround, and it has enormous benefits economically and to some extent geopolitically, said Jason Bordoff, the director of Columbia Universitys Center on Global Energy Policy.
The economic benefits, at least, are a little clearer. By producing more oil and importing less from abroad, the energy boom helps US GDP by keeping dollars at home. And it helps shrink the trade deficit  a dividend of about US$250 billion compared to where the United States would have been without the shale boom, according to a new study from the consultancy IHS Markit.
At the same time, all those extra barrels of American oil sloshing around, even if they arent physically exported, keep the world as a whole better supplied, meaning that nasty geopolitical surprises cause fewer price spikes than in years past. Jones called US production an important shock absorber for the global economy.
And there are some foreign-policy benefits to newfound US energy dominance, if not quite the bonanza many boosters seem to still expect. US natural gas production and exports have limited Russias ability to gouge customers among US allies in Europe, even if Moscow is still increasing its market share there. And the fact that the United States produces and even exports record amounts of oil gives it a different way to engage with neighbours such as Mexico, which once feared American designs on its black gold.
It liberates our foreign policy to deal with other issues, said David Goldwyn, the head of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an energy consultancy. In that sense, its a positive, for the flexibility it provides.
But none of that makes the United States immune to oil-price shocks or able to impose its will on other countries  or even able to add many arrows to its geopolitical quiver. Regardless of how much oil America produces, its still a global oil market. That means that prices for gasoline in the United States are largely determined by what happens with the other almost 90 million barrels of oil produced and consumed every day around the world.
And the United States is even more vulnerable than most countries to sudden pain at the pump, due to low taxes on fuel. That makes the up-and-down price of crude an even bigger driver of US gasoline prices than in other countries, noted Goldwyn, who was a top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.
The biggest reality check for policymakers bewitched by Americas record levels of oil production is that sheer size doesnt matter that much. Saudi Arabia produces less oil every day than the United States, but it plays an immeasurably bigger role in the world oil market than America does or ever will. Thats because Saudi Arabia has most of the worlds spare production capacity, millions of barrels of oil that can quickly be brought on line (or shut down) as the government orders to keep prices around an elusive Goldilocks level.
That ability to open or close the oil spigot on demand is real leverage, said Bordoff, who was a White House energy advisor in the Obama administration. And thats not something the United States has, or likely ever will. Real influence stems not just from how much you produce, but from the ability to quickly add or subtract supplies, and really that is only Saudi Arabia.
Even the signature achievement of the Trump administrations energy-powered foreign-policy success squeezing Iranian oil out of the market with sanctions, while using growing US production to blunt the price shock  is less than clear-cut. From 2012 to 2015, and again this year, the United States has sought to pressure Iran by limiting the amount of oil it can export to fund its foreign-policy agenda. In both cases, the million-odd barrels of Iranian oil taken off the market were essentially replaced by a million new US barrels, keeping prices reasonable and limiting domestic political blowback.
But even greater US production isnt a perfect substitute for missing Iranian barrels. India, for example, has trouble refining anything but Iranian crude. That explains why both the Obama and Trump administrations have been forced to allow India to keep importing Iranian oil, blunting the effectiveness of the sanctions campaign.
And the Iran examples dont mean that Washington can bank on its own oil strength to use sanctions with abandon. In both cases, Irans export limits happened to coincide with a period of intense, rapid growth in US production. Even if US oil output reaches stratospheric levels next year and stays there, its not likely to keep growing too much more. At that point, American oil production will just be part of the global baseline  not a fresh, annual injection of new supplies  limiting Washingtons ability to use oil sanctions as a lever in the future.
And no matter how much oil the US pumps, that gusher alone wont free the United States from involvement in the Middle East.
Decades ago, the United States was interested in keeping stability in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region both as a source of oil imports for itself and as a lubricant for the global economy. While America imports much less Persian Gulf oil than it ever did, it is still heavily invested in defending Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, limiting instability in big oil-producing countries, and protecting critical sea lanes such as the Strait of Hormuz.
The Western concern is a stable oil market. As the worlds largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia is crucial and will be until electric cars are more common than gasoline ones, said Simon Henderson, the director of the Washington Institutes programme on Gulf and energy policy.
That link between Saudi Arabias importance to global supplies and thus global prices helps explain why the United States seemingly cant escape making sometimes unsavory deals with unsavory regimes.
Shale oil means that US dependence on imports is now much less, but an increase in gasoline prices [from a Saudi supply shock] would be very unpopular. So we have to work toward a deal with the Saudis, Henderson said, even if it means swallowing the story that dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggis killing was not authorised by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Young scientists to the fore
Sri Lankan scientists are exposed to the world more often than not when they take employment in NASA or at universities in western countries.
Little that we know there is a breed of potential scientists here within the country, at this moment, being groomed by their mentors to become forces to be reckoned with.
It is high time we identified the value of these future scientists and support them with finances and other facilities needed for their research work. The public and private sectors in the country have great responsibility towards offering them with a helping hand to continue with research work.
With a proactive approach the country could retain these scientists without letting them become victims of brain draining process.
Postgraduate researchcommunication day 2018
The research and higher degrees committee of the Colombo Universitys faculty of medicine held Postgraduate research communication day 2018 with a view to encouraging their young scientists towards bringing their innovative research work to the public eye.
The event took place at the faculty of medicine at Kynsey Road, Colombo with the theme, Simplicity in research  the ultimate sophistication.
The program was comprised with two major segments, postgraduate and academic presentations.
Postgraduate presentations branded as Bus Stop Talks focused on communicating research work currently being done by postgraduate students.
Bus Stop Talks
The Postgraduate students of the medical faculty who currently work on innovative research work were given a chance via Bus Stop Talks to present their works to an audience comprised with professors, faculty and the media.
Each student was allocated maximum of three minutes to present his/her work in the simplest manner.
The objective was to bequeath postgraduate students with skills of simple communication to bridge the gap between the research community and people that includes the general public, the government, private sector and the press.
Heavy jargon in medicine was not used in these presentations.
A panel of judges individually assessed and analyzed each single-slide power point presentation to evaluate best student researchers who were eventually presented with certificates.
Communicating in simple manner would create awareness within the society of our work. Finding ways to explain our work to laymen is of great importance in many aspects.
A person in a bus-stop should understand what we say in a minimum possible time, said postgraduate student of the department of bio-chemistry and molecular biology, Suvini Karunaratne.
Research has to be imparted into the public community, she said.
Valuable inputs
Out of the 16 postgraduate Bus Stop Talk sessions, significant ones included, The cancer cell killer - wonder fruit from Sri Lanka (Udeshika Yapa Bandara), Significance of non tuberculosis mycobacterium in lung infections (Dharshika Jayasuriya), Leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka - Superior host or inferior parasite(F H Riyal).
U Mannapperuma on her research on mood stabilization of patients with Bipolar disorder (manic depression) in Sri Lanka shed light on side effects of drugs given and offered recommendations for better monitoring of patients.
Are our patients taking medicines as prescribed According to our findings, only 35 percent take medicine as expected. Younger age, poor knowledge of medicines and occurrence of side-effects affect them from not taking medicines properly. In our research we checked the level of quality of the drugs in the blood of healthy people by comparison with scientifically validated ones, she said.
Expert comments
Prof Thashi Chang said Sri Lankan scientists can do global research with necessary funds.
He stressed the need to have good grant evaluators and said there should be a mechanism for start-up grants.
Students should have the right attitude and enthusiasm. Stay focused and do correct justification to your research work. You need to communicate with peers constantly for collaborations, he said.
Dr Jithangi Wanigasinghe said interest and passion is the driving force for researchers. Dr Yamuna Siriwardene emphasized on the need to create a culture of collaborative interaction with peers.
All great discoveries are not made in laboratories but you cannot research by yourself. Always discuss about your research with peers. Good discoveries have happened in collaborative manner. Setting up postgraduate students society would be a good initiative, she said.
Research and higher degrees committee chairperson Prof Vajira Dissanayakes speech was titled, From PhD research to an academic career in research.
Convert your research to an academic career. You got have some entering and a professional mentor would guide you. Innovation would take you to global platform, he said. Prof Vajira Dissanayake is a medical geneticist who has received many local and international awards for his innovative global research work. He has made a gamut of orations locally and internationally.
He received SLMA oration award for medical research in Sri Lanka on competitive basis in 2008 for his oration on Genetics of Pre-eclampsia and the weight of babies at birth.
