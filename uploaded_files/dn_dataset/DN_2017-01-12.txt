Believers in Glass highlights  perils of plastic
'Believers in Glass', a group that makes people aware of the dangers of storing foods, drinks, and medicines in plastic vessels, held a press conference yesterday at JAIC Hilton to illustrate the perils of plastic on human health.
A panel of doctors discussed the effects of chemicals that leach from plastic into the human body.
Plastic is now inside of us, as plastic leaches dangerous compounds that can increase blood pressure, cause miscarriages and act as endocrine disrupters, said Dr. Mamta Jain of Mumbai.
The panelists highlighted that the longer foods and liquids stay in plastic containers, the more leaching of chemicals like bisphenol A and PVC would occur.
Chemicals that come from plastics mimic the actions of normal hormones and can disrupt the usual body processes, said Dr. Kolitha Sellahewa of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine. He said exposure to plastics from a young age can increase the risk of diabetes and obesity. Dr. Suranga Hettipathirana, a gynecologist and obstetrician, said exposure to the chemicals in plastic can lead to higher chances of infertility in men and women. The panelists discussed how kidney function can decrease, while chances of breast, testicular and prostate cancer can increase due to exposure to these chemicals.

Air-borne video reporting in Hambantota: TV drone buzzed on diplomatic  space, impinged Court order

The drone camera of a private TV channel which had ignited a debate over its being seized by the police while it was taking pictures and videos of the scale of demonstrations at the inauguration of the Sri Lanka - China Industrial Zone in Hambantota, would not have suffered that fate, had they notified the Police about their high-flying reporting venture into the space of diplomats with remote control equipment, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayaka said yesterday.
Ramanayaka said when he questioned as to what had happened in Mirijja, Hambanthota and why had the police seized a drone camera, Police higher-ups told me they had to proceed with full-scale security and could not have afforded any flying electronic equipment get in the way of the security of the diplomats.
Police Media Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody told me that the TV channel had not apprised them of their sending a drone camera to the area to report the incident, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang were present. The Security had been stepped up in the area for the safety of the Prime Minister, the Chinese Ambassador, the ministers, deputy ministers, diplomats and other dignitaries, he said.
DIG Jayakody told me in addition to providing security to the Prime Minister and the Chinese diplomats, they also had to act in line with a Court order.
The TV channel concerned had not consulted the Police nor obtained permission as such to speak or informed them that they would send a drone camera to the area, he explained.
Asked if it was necessary for the media in a country that boasts of peoples right to information among other things, to obtain permission from the Police to cater to the peoples right to information, Minister Ramanayaka said,  there is a way to go about it, but not at the expense of violatingthe space of security measures or law and order in force, he said.
Enjoying media freedom is definitely allowed, but going wild and crazy with it or abusing it at the cost of the order of things cannot be allowed, he said.
What if a TV channel let loose a drone camera when a man is on his honeymoon he asked.
When questioned whether he was worried about the people in Hambantota whom the police dispersed using tear gas and water cannons, Ranjan Ramanayaka said, Apparently they were not protestors. As Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had put it, they were a gang of supporters of certain politicos in Hambantota who had come forward to instigate clashes between the Police and the people and if one of them got killed by the Police, they could gain petty political advantage over the government by such tactics, he said.
According to Ramanayaka, the Hambantota protest took place by the persuasion of some Pradeshiya Sabha MPs who had received hundreds of acres of land from Hambantota through the grace of MP Namal Rajapaksa, who were in fear of losing them. Also behind the protest are some of Namals associates from the Blue Brigade and his union of friends at the Carlton, said Ramanayaka.
There is no need for the people of Hambantota to be unhappy about the industrial zone which the government is trying to set up, as the youth in the district would receive thousands of job opportunities as its result, he added.

An alternative treatment for dengue
Recently my son, having infected dengue and being in a critical condition, was admitted to Asiri Central Hospital. I was in dilemma over his situation. At the Hospital, as there is no prescribed medicine for this illness in Western Medicine, he was given saline drips with total bed rest, measuring intake and output of liquids, blood tests, administering antibiotics and other tests were the treatment.
My friends and well-wishers always pressurized me to meet a well known Ayurveda Physician at Aluthwala, Baddegama, and bring a bottle of medicine as it is proved to be an efficacious treatment for dengue. Although I was unable to make a decision at first, later I decided to meet the physician, considering the severity of the patient. I left early morning on the third day and reached Aluthwala in three hours. After bringing the bottle of medicine we started giving him by 50 ml doses hourly. This was not disclosed to anyone in the hospital.
On the following day, the blood count started to improve. Yet little by little as the patient had various bodily issues that are attributable to slow recovery. On the sixth day of admission blood count increased up to 55,000 and later he was discharged.
I never underestimate the service at the hospital. But I am sure the indigenous medicine had effectively improved his position. All who recommended me this treatment had their personal experience. Hence I can recommend this treatment for all dengue patients. Save valuable lives from dengue. May all authorities and others pay their attention to this medicine.

Ban Ki-moon returns to South Korea in bid to lead It

SEOUL: Ban Ki-moon, a former United Nations chief and prominent international figure, returns on Thursday to his native South Korea in an increasingly uphill effort to succeed the nations recently impeached president.
After leading the polls for months, Bans support has recently eroded due to perceptions his policies would be aligned with President Park Geun-hyes graft-tainted administration and his support of an unpopular deal with Japan to settle a World War II-era rift.
The New York indictmentof Bans brother and nephew in a foreign-bribery case on Tuesday risks further harming his candidacy even though Ban himself has no ties to the case. He hasnt commented on it.
Meanwhile, Bans rivals have been sniping at him, exploiting a perception that hes an elite old-guard bureaucrat out of touch with voter grievances such as corruption, slowing economic growth, youth unemployment and the power of the countrys conglomerates. Such concerns sparked mass demonstrations late last year.
Underscoring his ties to South Koreas political elite, Ban is set to receive the Order of Civil Merit, one of the countrys highest civilian honors, upon his return.
Hes a bureaucrat of the old school, and thats not what I think Koreans want to elect now, saidRobert Kelly,a professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea. Voters feel that Ban Ki-moon is not the kind of guy who is going to bring change, Kelly said. Ban is quite milquetoast, and this is a pretty big year where youve got hundreds of thousands of Koreans demonstrating on the street.
Bans spokespeople didnt respond to requests for comment.
The countrys Constitutional Court must decide within weeks whether to remove Park from office. The snap election that decision would trigger has sparked a full-on campaign by South Koreas leading presidential candidates.
Ban, the U.N. secretary general for a decade until December, enjoyed 28% support as recently as August, according to polling data from Gallup Korea. That sunk to about 20% in December, about on par with both Moon Jae-in, a leader of the opposition Democratic Party who lost narrowly to Park in the 2012 election, andLee Jae-myung,the mayor of a satellite city of Seoul,whose support has surgedin recent weeks.
Still, political analysts say a splintered left-leaning opposition could give Ban an opportunity to win an election with a plurality of votes.
Ban is expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon and offer remarks on his plans. He will then take the subway into Seoul from the airport, according to his campaign, part of an effort to present himself as a man of the people.
Parks impeachment, the result of an influence-peddling scandal, has inflamed anger against the conglomerates that dominate South Koreas economy and the traditional political class, casting doubt over many of Parks signature policies.
Those include Parks decision to deploy a controversial U.S.-built missile-defense system on South Korean soil to protect against North Korean threats, and a deal she struck with Japan to settle issues related to Korean women forced into sexual service for Japanese soldiers during World War II.
Souring public opinion against the comfort women deal, which didnt include consultations with the handful of survivors, has already sparked criticism of Ban for his praise of the agreement while at the U.N. The other leading candidates have repudiated the agreement.
The New York indictment of Bans brother and nephew makes him a much less attractive candidate, Scott Seaman, an analyst with Eurasia Group in Washington, wrote in a note to clients. Even if Ban argues effectively that he had nothing to do with his relatives alleged indiscretions, the press and his enemies will hound him, making it difficult for him to maintain the squeaky clean image that he has cultivated.

Barack Obama gets new job offer
I'm still waiting for my job at Spotify ... Cuz' I know y'all loved my playlist," Obama had said in an Instagram post.
US: Barack Obama ends his eight-year tenure as US President in a couple of weeks but he might not be out of a job for long as the world's leading streaming service Spotify "offered him a job".
Spotify advertised an opening for "President of Playlists", and said it was looking for someone with "at least eight years experience running a highly regarded nation", reported CNBC on Tuesday.
The opportunity was tweeted by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek on Monday.
The streaming service said that the role requires someone with a Nobel Peace Prize, which Obama won in 2009. It further said that "knowing famous artists is a plus". "Have good relationships with a wide range of artists and musicians.
Ever had Kendrick Lamar play at your birthday bash We'd love to hear about it!," the tongue-in-cheek Spotify job posting reads.
Another favourable characteristic of the candidate is the ability to "speak passionately about playlists at press events."
"Let us be clear, you should be nothing short of one of the greatest speakers of all time," the job posting said. It follows a quip Obama made recently about waiting for a job offer from Spotify. "I'm still waiting for my job at Spotify ... Cuz' I know y'all loved my playlist," Obama had said in an Instagram post.
Obama has previously curated playlists for Spotify and his list this summer featured an eclectic mix of songs from Rock Steady by Aretha Franklin to So Ambitious by Jay Z and Pharrell Williams.

Hence, we are facing grave difficulties but we have decided not to have power cuts as yet. We will continue using our other power plants and technology to pull through. We will take a decision in the future if the situation worsens, he added.
The Deputy Minister appealed to the general public to use power sparingly and to switch to solar or other sources whenever possible. Perera also encouraged those interested in self-generation schemes to sell power to the government which would be purchased at Rs 36.50 per unit, We hope to generate at least 350MW through such methods,the Deputy Minister said.

End this disorder
Law and order is pivotal for a nation's health. Lawlessness in a country spells disintegration, and disorder leading to anarchy. Recent events in this country points to such a trend. University students, trade unions etc. have routinely taken to the streets and engaged the police in running battles. Not only that, there have been invasions into state institutions by unruly mobs causing damage to state property, as was seen recently at the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Hardly a day passes without a mob trying to break through police barriers, leading to the Presidential Secretariat or Temple Trees. The outstations too have seen many such unruly scenes in recent times.
Hambantota witnessed a new low, with mobs even trying to storm a venue occupied by foreign dignitaries and diplomats, in the presence of the Prime Minister and other government VIPs. Even the country's courts were not spared such indignities, if one recalls instances in the recent past, where our halls of justice were desecrated with the invasion of mobs, some in saffron robes. The day would not be far away when even our police stations would be invaded by gangs to challenge the authority of the law. Nay, it had already happened. The last thing a country needs is a challenge mounted on the fountainhead of the law and order establishment- the police.
On Tuesday, the FCID, an arm which comes under the Police, was virtually stampeded by supporters of MP Wimal Weerawansa, who was brought there for questioning, over misuse of public property, when he was serving as a Minister under Mahinda Rajapaksa. The police officers had to fight their way through the chanting crowd to get the MP out of the venue to the courts. Weerawansa was also seen breathing fire, ripping the government and the law enforcement to shreds, while the police remained mere spectators. Slogans were being liberally chanted, with one particular TV camera deliberately focused on a protester belting out a slogan against the Prime Minister with regard to the alleged Central Bank bond scam. This particular TV channel devotes its entire news segment to attack and vilify the country's Prime Minister, with the government reduced to a mere onlooker. How can a media institution act in this manner and still retain its broadcasting license must be baffling to many. The Davasa group was sealed by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike for much less.
There is also another TV channel whose Morning News reader gives his own interpretation to news items in the press, putting the government in poor light. This channel went onto give lengthy coverage to the Hambantota incident, with selected footage to portray the government as the chief offender. It is also promoting communal tensions, by innuendo, in its coverage of news and interpretations of events. But the government has left it to its own devises.
Be that as it may, a strong view should be taken by the law enforcement authorities with regard to demonstrations carried out in front of police stations, or any other arm of the police, such as the FCID. If allowed to continue, the authority wielded by the country's law enforcement is bound to diminish in the eyes of the public. This would lead to the dangerous situation where unruly elements will become emboldened to act with impunity, leading to the complete breakdown of law and order. There is still a whole host of stalwarts of the former regime billed to be questioned by the FCID where arrests are imminent. Is the government going to permit demonstrations by mobs opposite the FCID every time such an arrest is made
This begs the question as to who leaked the news of the arrest of Weerawansa beforehand, which enabled the MP to mobilise his supporters Are there moles among the SLFP segment of the Unity Government, still loyal to Mahinda Rajapaksa, giving out the details How did Mahidna Rajapaksa happen to divine the arrest of Weerawansa two days ahead
The Government must probe who in the FCID or the Attorney Generals Department and other arms of the law enforcement, who were privy to the arrest, gave out this information that enabled Rajapaksa to predict the arrest well before hand. Who is the mole (moles) in places of authority trying to undermine the government's efforts to bring to book the crooks of the former regime Is this the reason why some important cases pertaining to corruption are being dragged on
The Yahapalanaya regime should ferret out those, who, as the saying goes, are playing a double game while remaining in the fold. It (the government) is already taking heavy flak from the public who voted it into office expecting speedy justice to the corrupt, for its foot dragging. Little wonder that those in the Joint Opposition has thrown the government's anti corruption drive in its face, daring it to arrest even a single of its members accused of corruption. If the government fails to act, and act decisively, even the public will begin to wonder about the allegations made in this regard.

## Title: Fetters that bind us to cycle of samsara
## Supertitle:

Fetters that bind us to cycle of samsara
The Buddha taught that the self-view is but the best form of self-referent belief we have. Once this mental construct has been seen through, a great deal of work still remains. The Buddha's clearest description of what we initially see through and what remains is the formulation of the Ten Fetters. The fetters provide us with a vivid description of the self-referent obstacles in our path, and thus the very nature of the path and goal.
A fetter is a shackle for the ankles or feet of a prisoner for restricting movement. A fetter limits the freedom of movement and an obstruction or a hindrance to progress. In Buddhism, a fetter (samyojana) is a restriction or limitation, in the sense that binds one to samsara (the cycle of rebirth).
Pali Canon lists ten fetters:(1) self-illusion/belief in a permanent self (sakkaya-ditti), (2) skeptical doubt (vicikicca), (3) erroneous rights and ceremonies/obsession with rules and rituals (silabbata paramasa), (4) sensuous craving (kama raga),(5) hatred and ill-will (viyapada), (6) craving for Form Realm (rupa raga), (7) craving for Formless Realm (arupa raga), (8)conceit (mana), (9) restlessness (udhdhachcha), and(10) ignorance (avijja) respectively.
Of these the first five are known as 'lower fetters', as these binds one to rebirth in the Desire Realm (kama loka/kama dhaatu). The remaining five are known as the 'higher fetters' since these binds one to rebirth in the Form and Formless Realms.
1. Sakkaya-ditthi is translated as "personality belief." It is the delusion of self. This concept is explained in the Suttas as the misconceived belief that the five aggregates which constitutes the individual, namely rupa, vedana, sanna, sankhara, and vinnana ( form, feeling, perception, mental factors and consciousness respectively.) taken separately or as a whole contain an unchanging entity that migrates from birth to birth. This is a major obstacle to spiritual progress. Not only are we attached to the idea of self, we even glorify it.
2. Vicikiccha means "skeptical doubt." In particular, doubt about (a) the Buddha, (b) the Dhamma, (c) the Sangha, (d) the disciplinary rules, (e) the past (for example, "What have I been in the past"), (f) the future (for example, "What shall I be in the future"), (g) both the past and the future (for example, "From what state to what state shall I change in the future", "Who am I", "What am I", "How am I", etc.), (h) the doctrine of dependent origination. The Buddha said that this kind of doubt is like being lost in a desert without a map.
3. Silabbata Paramasa
Adherence to (heretical) rites and ceremonies. 'Sila' means nature or habit. Vata means a religious observance or rite.'Silavata' or Silabbata in heretical religions were ascetic practices performed with fervent devotion hoping through them to realize the Supreme Bliss according to each religion. This Fetter is the belief that by performing such ascetic practices one could achieve moral purity and realize the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana. Performance of rituals for any mundane purpose would not fall within this description.
Instead the Buddha emphasized the importance of making individual effort in order to achieve our spiritual goals. He compared it to a man wanting to cross a river; sitting down and praying will not suffice, but he must make the effort to build a raft or a bridge.
4. Kama-raga,
Lust for Sense Desires. The word Kama literally means 'desire' and subjectively mean 'sense desire' It is used in two related meanings: (i) Desire for sense objects (ii) Desire for sense gratification senses. The word raga means passion; accordingly, kama raga means sense passion. It is the most formidable of the obstacles to moral and spiritual perfection. It is the unwise attention (ayoniso manasikara) directed towards objects of sense desire that causes Kama-raga, taking things impermanent as permanent, painful as pleasurable and unsubstantial as substantial
5. Vyapada,
Ill will or malevolence. The word 'vyapada' is derived from the meaning 'to do harm. Hence 'vyapada' means to harm or injure another will or malevolence which is normally accompanied by hatred and produced by a notion of selfishness. Pursuing a malevolent quest the worldly indulges in wrong conduct in deed, word and thought. It is a root cause of unwholesome action. (akusala hetu)
6/7. Rupa/Arupa Raga
Attachment to material and formless states are fetters. It is likely that these two terms refer to subtle attachments to meditation states, because although sakrdagamins practise samadhi moderately when they become anagamis they practise samadhi in full. This may lead them to indulge in such practices, and fetter them to the extent that it even affects their re-birth. This meditation can lead to powerful states of equanimity. If monks relish and treasure this equanimity, they inevitably become attached to it, and this prevents their final liberation. They are therefore reborn in the Pure Abodes and get enlightened there. This happens because they are attached to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, which is the highest attachment. This attachment could be called attachment to formless states (i.e. arupa-raga).
If people are extensively involved with samadhi practices, however, they get attached to those states instead. Such people are reborn, and get enlightened, in destinations other than the Pure Abodes.
8. Mana literally this means "measuring" and is often translated as "conceit, arrogance, self-assertion or pride," but measuring is a better term because it means all forms of evaluation. Feeling oneself to be superior to others (the superiority complex) is indeed a form a conceit. But mana also includes measuring in the sense of judging oneself to be inferior to others (the inferiority complex) and also equal to others. Even in spiritual matters, e.g. how many do you observe precepts how long do you sit for meditation Certainly, we are all different, but it is not helpful to engage in comparisons between oneself and others.
9. Uddhacca means "restlessness." It is the confused, distracted, restless state of mind, in which there is no tranquillity or peace. It has been defined as, "the excitement of mind which is disturbance, agitation of the heart, turmoil of mind." It is the opposite of one-pointedness. Number four of The Five Hindrances.
10. Avijja is translated as "ignorance," but this is ignorance in a special sense. It does not mean ignorance as it is used in the everyday sense, but it means specifically ignorance of the Four Noble Truths and the delusion which prevents us from seeing the real nature of impermanence and Dukkha.
When a Fetter has been eradicated, this is permanent, it does not come back again. One who has eradicated the first three Fetters is a Sotapanna. He has had a glimpse of Nirvana, like someone walking in the foothills of a mountain has a glimpse of the top of the mountain through the clouds. He has entered the stream that leads to Nirvana. He has complete confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, and perfect moral conduct.
The next stage is a Sakadagami, which is marked by the reduction of the next two Fetters. They are not yet eradicated, but are suppressed. When these two Fetters are completely eradicated, then the third stage has been reached. This is a Anagami.
The last stage is the Arahat, and is marked by the eradication of the last five Fetters. This state is not restricted by age, sex or social status. It is open to lay people as well as ordained monks. The Arahant will continue to live for his body's natural span, but he has eradicated all craving which binds ordinary people to the process of rebirth.

The amendment which speaks of a Bill to provide provisions for securing the right of detainees was drafted in 2016 but was later withdrawn due to civil society objections against the proposals.
One of the more controversial aspects was that the amendment would deprive suspects access to lawyers until their statements were recorded- a violation of a suspects fundamental rights.
A new committee comprising the Sri Lanka Bar Association and Attorney Generals Department was also appointed to prepare a more acceptable draft.Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe thus received Cabinet approval on Tuesday to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft the new legislation in this regard and publish it in the gazette and subsequently presented to Parliament for approval.

The Governments rigorous commitment towards reconciliation, democracy and securing human rights in the last two years has paved the way for the EUs decision to restore the GSP+ trade concession, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Releasing a special press release, Premier Wickremesinghe said the EUs decision is not just a victory of the Yahapalana government but for all of Sri Lanka.
Textile and other Sri Lankan export products will have more access to the European market with the GSP+ facility, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further stated in his release.

GSP+ on the horizon: EU proposes facility to SL
IN RECOGNITION OF LANKAS COMMITMENT TO 27 INTL CONVENTIONS
The European Union(EU) yesterday proposed to restore the GSP+ trade concessions to Sri Lanka after taking the countrys unwavering commitment to strengthen good governance, human rights, labour conditions and environment protection into account.
The EU in recognition of Sri Lankas commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on five spheres including Human Rights, has made a proposal for the restoration of this facility to Sri Lanka. These one way trade preferences would consist of the full removal of duties on 66 per cent of tariff lines covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries.
The European Parliament and the Council now have up to four months to raise potential objections before the measures become effective.
The EU decided to withdraw the GSP+ facility in 2010, over the previous regimes inability to assure human rights, promote reconciliation and to comply with international labour regulations. These trade concessions were designed to support developing countries.
EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malstorm said the GSP+ preference can make a significant contribution to Sri Lankas economic development by increasing export to the EU market.
But it also reflects the way in which we want to support Sri Lanka in implementing human rights, rule of law and good governance reforms. I am confident of seeing timely and substantial further progress in these areas, and the GSP+ dialogue and monitoring features will support this reform process,Malstorm said.
This should include making Sri Lankas counter-terrorism legislation fully compatible with international human rights convention,she added. However, she said that granting access to the GSP+ scheme does not mean that the situation of the country with respect to the 27 international conventions is fully satisfactory.
It offers the incentive of increased trade access in return for further progress towards the full implementation of those conventions,she said .
It also provides a
platform for engagement with beneficiaries on all problematic areas,the EU Trade Commissioner points out.

Kandy SC show their class
On Saturday Roshan Weeraratne and his merrymen did Kandy Sports Club proud by beating CR & FC in their inter-club second round rugby match at Longden Place. Heres a quick look at one of the big talking moments from the game. One is how Kandy S.C. played in the first half and the other was the delaying of decisions by the TMO.
In this game referee Dinka Peries who did a good job with the whistle, had a few doubts in some decisions and he consulted the TMO, whoever it was failed to offer the advice and result in time and due to this delay the play got messed up. It was a dragging and delayed affair in decision-making. Nearly 22 minutes of play was lost, but the referee made up for the lost time and covered it up which led to a dragging affair for the players. Most of the rugby lovers were not in a position to enjoy the game due to this error. The TMO should be handled by people who know how to operate it. There have been incidents in the past where similar incidents have occurred. One hopes the people responsible have learnt from their mistakes and should not allow a repetition of it. If there is no proper equipment they should not have it in play.
Minutes before the kick-off one of CR & FCs former player Shah Doole, Sri Lankas rugby representative in USAs West Coast was introduced to the two teams by CR & FC president Ravi Gunaratne. Dole learnt his rugby at Trinity College and later played for the Red shirts and the country as a top class fly half. A big hand should go to secretary Hamza Hassanally and his team for a superb job in match arrangements.
The run of play in this game was vastly different to previous affairs by the winners, especially in the first half. With team spirit high after the two teams hard work, it was a hotly contested first half which ended with Kandy SC 17-0 in front at the break and the winners brought real experience to a well-drilled unit enjoying a good amount of early possession through some great work on the ground by Roshan Weeraratne and Arshad Jamaldeen who were instrumental in presenting some good rugby.
From the kick off, it was a hard fight, but Kandy ruggerites were full of confidence in beating a talented Longden Place club. After the restart CR & FC held on to the ball brilliantly, opening up space for the backs to race through to score. Perhaps the toughest test of the day came from the winning teams forwards. Some outstanding defence from the Red shirts saw them limit the opponents ball handling in the last quarter of the second half. The CR & FC XV failed to wake up in time, they should take the blame for the errors, and if not for them they had every chance of pulling off the game. They superbly finished the last quarter and got the crowd on their feet. The Red shirted unit worked hard with each other to score a couple of tries. Despite this, Kandy regrouped and a ruthless second half performance saw they go through with a hard-fought win. Whatever said and done Kandy tacklers rediscovered their ruthless streak and began to dominate with some good loose play. They know how to end a game with a win. Anyway CR & FC made it harder than what the result showed.
As the game moved on their tiredness was there for all to see however, some astute rotation enabled them to get the best out of the players who all made fantastic contributions to provide Kandy with a well-deserved victory.
Kandy will now be looking forward to next Sundays game against Navy SC which will be played at Nittawela. Kandy will go all out do well and redeem the damage after the shock defeat in the first round.

## Title: Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara  Perahera

Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara  Perahera
Devotees filled every nook and corner of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara and the smell of flowers and incense embedded in the air. Despite the numbers, the temple was, however, enveloped with a deep sense of honour as devotees chanted Buddhist stanzas. Walking through the premises looking for Nayaka Thera was not that hard as his abode stands at the centre of the temple and people were seen flocking to worship him. Several women were seen sewing the costumes the elephants for the perahera (procession) would later adorn.
The Nayaka Thera while speaking to the organisers about the arrangements for the grand perahera, approached and asked us to follow him. The perahera has always been highly venerated by the people and is one of the main religious events of the island.
The Chief Incumbent of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, Ven. Prof. Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkhitha Maha Thera, entered into the Sasana (Buddhist order of monks) in the 1960s and studied scripture at the Hunupitiya Gangarama Temple and graduated from the Vidyalankara Campus of the University of Ceylon in 1979.
The Thera was awarded thereafter a two-year scholarship to conduct researches at the Sorbonne University to gain a postgraduate degree in French language leading to Masters and doctoral research at the University of Delhi.
The perahera is a form of respect or offering to the Buddha, Nayaka Thera said.
This is different from the other processions in Sri Lanka. The Kandy and Kataragma processions have a special ritual called the Kap Hituweema or Diya Kepeema, performed to worship gods. We dont have that with the Kelaniya perahera. We have only Buddhist rituals like dhamma talks and Buddhist ceremonies. This year we have 63 dhamma talks, he explained.
The Nayaka Thera said the history of the Kelaniya temple could be traced back to the pre-historic era.
Among the many Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka, the Kelani Viharaya stands out as one of the most exquisite examples of the sculptors art. Its history runs back to more than 2,500 years. In the days of yore, it always received full royal patronage and to this day, it has been highly venerated by the Island people as well as by visitors from the Buddhist countries. Its significance as a place of Buddhist worship is clearly evident in the islands folklore.
According to the island history book Mahawamsa, the Gautama Buddha visited the temple after the Dagaba (stupa) was built. According to the Ramayana, after king Ravanas death, Vibhiaa was crowned at Kelaniya as King of Lanka by Lakshmana. Enshrined outside the temple, murals depict the crowning of Vibhiaa . The Kelani River is also mentioned in the Valmikis Ramayana, Indian epic poem, and Vibhiaas palace was said to have been on the river bank. Though Kelaniya has been a place of worship for over 2,000 years, the present temple buildings date mostly from 1880 to 1940.
The Kelani River is most significant today in the practical sense since it is the main water source across the Western Province. The temples chief patron being the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe himself, the perahera too is organised under his guidance, who is also the Dayaka Sabha President.
The sacred temple derives its religious and historical significance mainly from the Buddhas third visit to the premises on the banks of the Kelani River. Since it is a highly venerated occurrence, the perahera is organised annually to invoke blessings of the Noble Triple Gem and gods to all living beings, marking the Buddhas first visit to Sri Lanka, which took place on the Vesak full moon poya day.
The Kelaniya Durutu Perahera Pooja Festival was halted for sometimes during colonial rule but was recommenced in 1927 with the guidance of Ven. Mapitigama Buddharakkhita Thera, the then chief incumbent of the temple, under the generous patronage of Helena Wijewardene Lamatheni. Then onward, this religious festival marks one of the major religious events in the island.
The annual religious ceremony of Kelani Rajamaha Viharaya began on last Saturday with the handing over of the Relic casket to Chief Basnayaka Nilame Dhammika Attygalle by the Chief Incumbent Ven. Prof. Kollupitiya Mahinda Sangarakkitha Nayaka Thera.
The Nayaka Thera said they earlier had nonstop chanting for seven days but as it was hard to keep all the monks for seven days, the number of days was reduced to four.
The festival has four processions; Deva Dhootha Perahara, Uda Maduwe Perahera, Veethi Perahara, and Maha Perahera. The Maha Perahera comprises four sub Peraheras; Dhathu Perahera, Vishnu Perahera, Kataragama Perahera, and Vibhiaa Perahera. Three traditional dance groups, Udarata, Sabaragamuwa, and Pahata Rata as well as Tamil dances among others also take place in the perahera. We have another special ritual called Manniyakkika Naagaraja - one of the special rituals of the Kelaniya temple, he explained.
The perahera displays the ancient traditions and the cultural heritage of the island. This highly respected perahera and related ceremonies demonstrate to the world the islands traditional folklore, folk music and dance forms and drum beats developed throughout the ages around Buddhism and Buddhist practices.
The perahera is held at night on three consecutive days prior to the Duruthu (January) full moon. It commences with a series of sermons (Dharma Desana) held each night, followed by pirith chanting ceremony (paritrana desana). The ritual then culminates in the famous procession - the perahera. Before the commencement of the procession, the divine insignia of the respective gods are ceremonially taken out of each devala amidst the beat-sounds of hevisi drums and are securely placed on the decorated repository on the back of the respective tuskers.
The first-day perahera on the upper temple terrace is called Udamaluwa Perahera. The second-day perahera is more colourful than the first, and is performed on a more extensive and elaborate scale. The third and the final procession called the Randoli Perahera is the climax of the whole festival. It is usually held on the pre-poya day of the Duruthu moon. This is the most colourful and magnificent spectacle that the Sri Lankan Buddhists look forward to with great fervour and enthusiasm.
The Nayaka Thera said the biggest crowd turn-out for the Viharas annual perahera can be seen when people and elephants alike are dressed in their finest for an unforgettable pageant on the final day of the procession.
The Kelaniya Vihara treasures the hair relics of the Buddha. Thousands of people gather to worship the Buddha. We conduct the perahera to pay respect to the Buddha. May all the people in the country irrespective of their differences lead a happy and prosperous life, the Nayaka Thera blessed.

Loeb storms to stage win, takes overall lead
Salta: French driver Sebastien Loeb put in a storming performance to not only win stage eight of the Dakar rally but to also overhaul the overnight leader Stephane Peterhansel on Tuesday.
Loeb completed the shortened 417km split route in 4hrs 11min 02sec to arrive at Salta in Argentina 3min 35sec faster than his compatriot and Peugeot team-mate Peterhansel.
The result leaves Loeb 1min 38sec ahead of the 2016 champion who had a far slower start before reducing the deficit the late on.
On the dirt sections hes faster than me but Im beating him on the road sections, Loeb said after the stage.
Its really tight, and its going to be really tight all the way.
Earlier, Spains Joan Barreda won his second 2017 stage in the moto category, as more wet weather played havoc with the gruelling race.
The Honda rider thundered across the eighth stage from Uyuni in Bolivia in 4hr 28min 21sec, ahead of the KTM duo of Matthias Walkner of Austria (3min 51sec behind) and Britains Sam Sunderland, who was three seconds behind his team-mate to retain the overall lead by 20 minutes.
Barreda was also victorious in last Wednesdays third stage of a scheduled total of 12, but lost the overall lead of the motorcycle category after picking up an hour penalty for illegal refuelling in a subsequent stage.
Tuesdays special took two hours longer than expected because of heavy rain that lashed the course and the race has been hampered in recent days by the weather.
The rain forced race officials to change the route of stage eight because of rising water levels in a river bed. AFP

Is meat consumption an unwholesome act
In the Milindapanha the King Milinda conveys the idea that if the recipient is not mindful of a gift of merit being presented, the giver gets no advantage thereby. Naagasena quotes a few examples to prove that is wrong. The disagreement is that the act of transfer is an act of selflessness and the feedback of the action on oneself has a cleansing effect, as well as on the individual to whom the act is aimed at. Naagasena tells Milinda, If a person transfers merit, that merit develops and grows more and more, during the act of transferring it, and the merit of that performance he is able to
distribute it to whomsoever he will.
The Buddha first visited Sri Lanka on Duruthu Poya Day, arriving at Mahiyangana, Mahanaga Garden in 528 BC and in the ninth month of Buddha hood. On this day the Yaksa Clan spread in the island congregated there for a meeting. The Yaksas were converted to Dhamma and the Buddha was also successful in getting Maniakkhika of Kelaniya, the head of Naga clan to Mahiyangana, who listened to his preaching. It was one of the earliest recorded social conflict resolution strategies in the world. Buddha suggests that in a society oppressed by differences and conflicts, a person called Mahasammata elected from among them should uphold and preserve peace through laws of righteousness. He should adhere to standards of authority, transparency and answerability. In Maha Sudassana and the Chakkavatti Sihanada Suttas Buddha elaborates this when he discussed the Dhasaraja Dhamma.
Merit Transfer
Acts of merit bring Joy and contentment to the doer in this world and in the next.
 As a stream must flow and reach and fill the far-away main,
what is given here will reach and consecrate the spirits.
Water poured on mountain top would soon tumble down and fill the plain
like what is given here will get to and bless the feelings there.
- Nidhikanda Sutta
Punna in Pali is a concept in Buddhism/Hinduism. As a result of good deeds Merit is accumulated and carries over through the life and the subsequent births. There are a number of ways in which merit can be gained. The Sutra suggests ten different ways in which it can occur. According to The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutta of Mahayana fame one can transfer one-seventh of the merit of an act to a loved one who is no more, to lessen the deceaseds misery in their new lives. Mahyna or a Theravada Concept
Some Western scholars of Buddhism, believed that the transfer of merit was a Mahayana concept developed at a late period and that it was rather discordant with Buddhist perceptions of karma theory. Heinz Bechert, believes the doctrine in its developed form to an era between the 5th and 7th centuries. However, Anthony Barber differs in his views, notes, merit transfer was an integral part of Buddhism practiced from Buddhas times in India. Buddhism teaches that the accumulated merit can be transferred, can be shared with others; it is reversible and the persons who receive can be either living or dead.
The mode of transfer is quite simple; the doer has merely to wish that the merit he/she has gained accumulate to somebody in particular, or to all beings, a wish purely mental or expressed by words. All actions, according to the Buddha, what really matters is thought. Transference is mainly an act of the mind. Tirokuddha Sutta  Khuddakapatha says, there is no use in weeping, lamenting, feeling sorry and bewailing; such approaches are of no consequence to the departed ones. Some simply waste on meaningless rituals and performances in remembrance of departed ones. They do not realize that it is not possible to help the dead simply by constructing graveyards, tombs, Monuments and other paraphernalia; instead doing some meritorious acts like building orphanages , schools, temples, libraries, hospitals, or distributing religious books and other numerous related charitable deeds.
Milindapanha
In the Milindapanha the King Milinda conveys the idea that if the recipient is not mindful of a gift of merit being presented, the giver gets no advantage thereby. Naagasena quotes a few examples to prove that is wrong. The disagreement is that the act of transfer is an act of selflessness and the feedback of the action on oneself has a cleansing effect, as well as on the individual to whom the act is aimed at. Naagasena tells Milinda, If a person transfer merit, that merit develops and grows more and more, during the act of transferring it, and the merit of that performance he is able to distribute it to whomsoever he will.
In the Theravada tradition rebirth is an immediate happening after a persons death, so transfer of merit as performed, cannot rationally be of any advantage to the deceased person. He would have to shoulder the weight for the kamma that is owing to him. The transfer of merit for a deceased will though benefit the giver as it should make a sense of loving kindness in that person.
Whatever the arguments may say, in transferring merit to dead, the most popularly practiced ritual is by inviting Maha Sangha to the residence of the deceased on the seventh day and on completion of third month followed by on an yearly basis on the death anniversary, along with large gathering of relatives, friends and neighbors. A large majority use huge quantities of carcasses of innocent animals brutally slaughtered for food in preparation of dishes for the Bikkhus and lay devotees to satisfy their palatal greed.
How do they know, or what makes them so sure that the carcass of the seer fish that they bought encouraging the slaughterer to kill more next day and make those sumptuous deep fried slices does not belonged to their loved one who died a few years ago and reborn an aquatic animal They now enjoy the flesh along with the high priest of the very temple the deceased was a Dhayake and a host of friends and relatives joining them.
Alms and Flesh Eating
There is a long passage in Lakavatara sutta, prohibiting consumption of flesh, killed or dead. In fact Buddha predicted in the Sutta that later monks will hold spurious writing to be authentic Dhamma, and will concoct their own suttas and claim that Buddha allowed eating carcasses of dead animals. A passage shows Buddha speaks out very forcefully against eating meat, that it is undesirable and karmically unwholesome, and is unequivocally in favour of vegetarianism.
In Dhammapada, Danda Wagga verse 129 says,
Sabbe bayanti maccu no Na hanneiya- na ghayate, Na Ghayate means NO CAUSE TO KILL.
Jivaka Sutta says, Meat should not be partaken under three situations: when it is seen or heard or suspected that animal has been slaughtered for the eater; when it is not seen or heard or suspected, in which meat can be eaten.
The meat prepared for eaters do not belong to Thricotika parisuddha category: it is a myth created through erroneous interpretations by those who are greedy for flesh: if you eat you contribute to the crime; its killed for you! A completely vegetarian diet is a natural and logical outcome of the moral precept against killing. If at least half the Buddhist population stopped eating meat, we could avoid the sacrifice of millions of animal lives every day.
In a country with a 70% Buddhist population , it is regrettable to learn that only an insignificant number of monks or laymen practise vegetarianism.
Let me conclude with an anecdote, which goes as, the fisher folk in the village invited the Village Headman and his wife for a meal at his residence. Presenting two dishes of fish of two different varieties to the virtuous man and mentioning the name of the variety, he said, Sir, this one I caught especially for you, and vice versa.
The Headman, avaricious though realize the folly. If he eats, it becomes obvious that it is not thricotica parisudda and as such the noble man he, would be committing a sin.
Witty man rejoined, I say, you serve this to my wife, and let me have the one which you killed especially for her.

Media Ministry to implement RTI Act
The responsibility of implementing the Right to Information Act has been vested in the Ministry of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media. A Gazette notification relating to it will be issued on February 3, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said when he met the Chairman and members of the RTI Commission for a special discussion at the Parliamentary Complex on January 10. Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranawithane and Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage were also present on the occasion.
The Chairman of the Commission is Mahinda Gammanpila. Its other members are Kishali Pinto Jayawardene, S.G. Punchihewa, A.W.A. Salam and Silvi Thiruwandran.
Minister Karunatillake said once the Gazette notification is issued on February 3, every citizen would have the right to obtain any information he or she desired from any government institution. The RTI Act was designed to ensure transparency in administration and an opportunity to minimise corruption.
The implementation of the RTI Act fulfilled one of the major election pledges of the government.
The RTI Act introduced in Parliament on August 4 last year gained the unanimous approval of all 225 MPs in the August assembly. The Act stated that it should be implemented within six months of its approval by Parliament.
Karunathilake said, initially, the Ministry created an awareness about the Act among heads of institutions, including Ministry Secretaries.
Awareness had been created among Government Agents, Divisional Secretaries and Provincial Council Secretaries too .Workshops were also held for the benefit of media personnel especially provincial journalists.
Several other workshops are planned within the ensuing week. Minister Karunatillake said almost all Ministries and institutions have already named information officers after making selections. It is hoped to provide a training for all of them as well by summoning them to a single venue and thereafter present official appointment letters to them.
It is hoped to implement this exercise in all institutions after February 3. Minister Karunatilleke said they were extremely happy and pleased to have introduced the RTI Act after obtaining parliamentary approval to ensure its implementation within six months to make it a reality within a given time frame.
The Act clearly stated the information people could obtain. There was no possibility to provide any information considered inimical to National Security. Similarly, an individuals private information ,such as medical reports, also cannot be obtained. The actual benefit of this Act would accrue to the people.

Moves to draft national fisheries policy
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry will develop, conserve and manage Sri Lankas fisheries and aquatic resources towards a sustainable national fisheries policy.
The Norwegian government will provide technology and basic facilities for this. The Ministry in a press release stated that there was no national policy in place with regard to the conservation of aquatic resources.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed the ministry to formulate a sustainable national policy and focus on promoting methods for management and conservation of resources, take initiatives to make public aware of conservation of resources, introduce conservation strategies to protect and conserve aquatic life and implement new laws to ensure protection of resources.
Norway is one of the countries that implement an effective fisheries policy and management. Minister Amaraweera requested Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg to extend their support when she visited Sri Lanka last year. The Norwegian government sent a group of fisheries experts to Sri Lanka following the request. Norwegian experts are engaged with the Sri Lankan officials in formulating a sustainable fisheries policy, ministry sources said.

A note on openness
The sudden entry into general circulation of a familiar term with a new ambience of meaning often has a significance that goes beyond mere philological curiosity. Since language is molded by thought at a level prior to and more basic than that of deliberate design, such changes in linguistic currency may well signal deeper changes taking place in the mental make-up of those who use the term. They can be seen as barometric indicators of transformations in the sphere of consciousness  in our patterns of thinking, in our attitudes, in our goals.
If there is one term that might be chosen to characterize the intellectual and moral climate of the present day, it would be the word "openness." This seemingly colorless word has come to mark the fulfillment of the centuries-long struggle against the oppressive weight of established tradition in so many diverse departments of human concern. Its three syllables are a hymn of victory for the triumph of the empirical method over formulated dogma as the key to knowledge, for the primacy of individual conscience over prescribed morality in the domain of ethics, and in our private lives, for the replacement of the reign of the superego by a new-found liberty to explore the subterranean channels of impulse and desire in whatever direction they might lead.
Perhaps most importantly, the notion of openness also points to a particular attitude toward experience, an attitude which has quietly permeated our culture so thoroughly that it now seems almost an innate human disposition. Briefly, this attitude might be described as a soft and affable affirmation of experience in its totality, coupled with a pliant receptivity to its full range of forms. This attitude, it must be stressed, only rarely solidifies into a consciously held conviction; more typically it lingers in the background of the mind as an unverbalized intuition, a fluid and shifting orientation toward the world. Historically rooted in the widespread decline of belief structures centered upon a transcendent goal of human life and an objectively grounded scale of values, the philosophy of openness takes all truth to be relative, all values personal and subjective. Thus it holds that our task in life is to open ourselves as fully as we can to the unfolding miracle of existence and to celebrate its infinite possibilities.
The spread of this attitude through the general culture has left its stamp on current interpretations of Buddhism as well. We thus find that for many of today's Buddhist teachers the Dhamma is essentially a method for arriving at the consummation of all that the notion of openness implies. From this perspective Buddhism is not a doctrine with its own distinct body of tenets, not a discipline guiding us to a supramundane goal, but a tool for opening to the here and now. The most basic flaw at the bottom of human suffering, it is held, is our tendency to close ourselves off from experience, to lock ourselves with our concepts and judgments into a limited compartment of reality. By developing through meditation a non-discriminating "choiceless" awareness which allows whatever arises to hold its ground, we are enabled to break through our constraints and merge with the stream of events, to dance with the "ten thousand things"  accepting them all yet without clinging to them.
While the advocates of openness are usually adroit in assimilating their principles to the classical Dhamma, a careful examination would reveal gaping differences between the two. Here I want to focus only on some crucial differences in their respective orientations toward experience. It should be noted at once that whereas the school of openness bids us to drop our discriminations, judgments and restraints in order to immerse ourselves in the dynamic flow of immediate experience, the Buddha prescribes an attitude toward experience that arises from carefully wrought judgments, employs precise discriminations, and issues in detachment and restraint. This attitude, the classical Buddhist counterfoil to the modern program of openness, might be summed up by one word found everywhere in the ancient texts. That word is heedfulness (appamada).
Heedfulness denotes an attitude of critical scrutiny directed toward one's own mind both in its internal movement and in its reactions to external affairs. The term suggests diligent effort and acute attentiveness, and it further sounds a note of moral caution and care. It thus implies, as the Buddha intended it to imply, that we are constantly exposed to danger  a danger born from within that becomes ever more imminent to the degree that we allow heedfulness to slip and we slide into its opposite: into heedlessness or negligence (pamada).
Such caution is necessary because deeds have consequences that extend beyond themselves. Whereas the school of openness tends to subordinate concern with the consequential aspect of action to a stress on abiding in the present moment, the classical Dhamma taught by the Buddha asks us to recognize that all willed actions, even our fleeting thoughts and impulses, are seeds with roots buried deep in the mind's beginningless past and with the potency to generate results in the distant horizons of the future. These long-range consequences of action are of enormous importance to us; for however far they might lie from our vision now, when the time comes for our deeds to ripen, it is we ourselves who must experience their fruits. As these fruits are invariably determined by the moral quality of our actions, diligent self-examination  that is, heedfulness  is urgently needed so that we may restrain ourselves from those deeds that seem pleasant but bear painful results, and so that we may apply ourselves to those deeds that may be difficult but yield long-term benefits.
The mode of thinking based on openness rejects duality as a product of discrimination and deluded concepts. It tacitly presupposes that existence as such is ultimately benign; that beyond our deluded concepts, the rich and vivid diversity of forms has a single taste, a taste that is sweet. In contrast, the attitude of heedfulness is grounded upon the view that existence is textured through and through by dualities that are profound and inescapably real. The world bears testimony to this vision in the contrast between the charming, delightful surfaces of things and their underlying hollowness and inadequacy; our minds bear testimony in the ongoing contest between the wholesome mental factors and the unwholesome ones, between the upward urge for purification and the downward pull of the defilements.

Origins of Buddhist diplomacy
It is very interesting to note that Sri Lanka had the good fortune of being blessed with the presence of the living Buddha, the most sacred event in human history. This was the most significant and the most unparalleled event in the history of the island as well, as the sasana. Not once but thrice on various occasions. These sacred visits had preceded the introduction of Buddhism by thera Mahinda in 247 BC. In the Pre-Mahinda era the greatest blessing to the island was Buddhas first visit to Mahiyangana in the nineth month after the enlightenment.
Celebrated religious event  Soon after, with the delivery of the first sermon and sending the disciples on the great on the great mission Buddha himself set out on the sasanic tour and Sri Lanka was the first place to attract his attention. It was the first poya in the Buddhist calendar (Duruthu) that this celebrated religious event adorned Sri-Lankan. It is recorded that when Buddha visited the island he foresaw that the doctrine that he discovered and preached in Jambudweepa will be preserved in its pristine purity by the devotees in Sri Lanka. It became a well renowned country as Dharmadweepa when Buddhism had already declined in its place of birth. The ancient chronicles reveal that the Buddha arrived in Mahanagarana, the most splendid park in Mahiyangana, on the right bank of river Mahaweli. What was the area like when the Buddha arrived could be concluded by the descriptions made by the British the Imperial Masters centuries later. Richard Broke in 1832 the first Englishman to explore Mahaweli, which was according to him the biggest river in Sri-Lanka.
Mahiyangana  location - It flows through most of the wildest and also some of the most beautiful areas in Ceylon the country through which Mahaweli flows is beyond doubt extensively cultivated and any casual observer visiting, must be surprised at the vast manual labour spent in the construction of canals and tanks now totally neglected. One of the main high ways in Kandyan times followed the course of Mahaweli eastward from the capital to Aluthnuwara. It is said that Aluthnuwara or Mahiyangana was an important river port. Pre Christian Sinhala literature poetry and history gives it great importance. Then one can just imagine now Mahaweli Mahiyangana must have been during Buddha time.
Yakka tribe subdued  Chronicles also provide definite evidence of the tribes living here. The island at the time of the Buddhas visit was inhabited by Yakkas and Nagas referred to as Amanussa. Here reference may probably be to the primitive state of civilization in the island.
The Buddha himself is said to have rid the island of the Yakkas and made it suitable for human habitation. Buddha was aware that in the island his teachings was to flourish. How ever the sudden appearance of the Buddha in yellow robes radiating the glow (Budu res) the Yakkas who were overwhelmed with their rough behaviour had thrown away their weapons and listened to Buddha and finally they have had the good luck to be blessed with the teachings of the Buddha. Subsequently he preached Dhamma to a great gathering of Gods. God Mahasumana of Mountain Samanala (the guardian god) who on this occasion attained the state of Satapanna after listring to sermons requested the Buddha to give something to worship. He gave him a handful of hair from his head as on object of worship.
The first stupa-Mahiyangana chaitya  God Mahasumana placed it in a golden casket and enshrined in a stupa embedded with blue stones built at the place where the great Master was seated at Mahiyangana considered the most sanctified spot, in the vicinity of Mahaweli. This was built to the height of seven riyanas (a measure) and later improved at various stages. After the parinibbana of the Buddha and the distribution of the sacred relics, the remaining neck relic (Greeva Dathu) was brought to Sri  Lankan by Arahat Saraba, a pupil of Ven. Sariputta and enshrined in Mahiyangana stupa raising it to 12 riyanas. Later it was built to a height of 30 by king Uddaculabhaya, king Devanampitiyatissas brothers son who covered it over afresh. Still later king Dutugamunu built a mantel chetiya over it completing it to a height of 80 riyanas which exists to this day as an amazing marvel, and also a national treasure. This is given much significance not only because it is the first stupa, but also it is the first one built by a divine being, on the spot where the Buddha made his first visit to the island.

President can work  with Mahinda: Isura
President and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Leader Maithripala Sirisena can work with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa without any problem, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing the media at his office at the Western Provincial Council in Colombo yesterday, he said that it is President Sirisena who hated the UNP most. He works with the UNP without any problem now, he said.
President Sirisena worked with former President Rajapaksa for three or four decades. If the President can work with the UNP, he can easily work with the former President. When President Sirisena becomes the next Sri Lankan President in 2020, the country needs a Prime Minister.
The Chief Minister said President Sirisena was the common candidate for the 2015 Presidential Election, but he contested as the General Secretary of the SLFP. He is the leader of the SLFP and not the common candidate any more. He has no deals or agreements with the UNP or any one else.
He will never let down the people who voted for him. He can contest for the next Presidential Election as the SLFP Leader, Devapriya said.

President says, happiest  day in his life
President Maithripala Sirisena declared January 11 as the happiest day of his life since he was able to provide a permanent solution to end a burning issue of the people of Rajarata.
The President noted that the Rajarata people were affected by an acute scarcity of water for decades as there was no proper irrigation system.
The President made these observations while commissioning the Moragahakanda reservoir project, under the joint Moraghakanda - Kaluganga reservoir development scheme, yesterday(Jan11), with the commencing of filling water to the Moragahakanda reservoir.
The Moragahakanda project completed at US$ 1,150 million will end the water scarcity in several districts including Matale, Polonnaruwa, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura etc. The project, which consists of two irrigation channel systems and the construction of the Rajarata channel system was initiated by the President yesterday in line with the commissioning of the project. The Rajarata channel system is 102 km long and will connect to the Mahakanadarawa Tank via Huruluwewa. The construction of the 96 km long Wayamba Channel system will commence in February. The project cost of US$ 200 million has already been allocated. Both channel systems will supply water to 1,500 small tanks in the dry zone. Upon completion of the two channel systems around 94,000 hectares of paddy land can be cultivated throughout the year.
Apart from providing water for agriculture purposes, the project will provide drinking water to millions in the dry zone who are severely affected by health issues such as kidney disease. The project will also add 25 megawatts to the national grid by the power house attached to the main dam of Moragahakanda.
Today is the happiest day of my life. But someone may ask me whether the day I became the President was not the happiest day. But when I became the President, I felt a sence of duty rather than feeling happy he said. Addressing the large gathering ,the President noted that the water filling ceremony will mark a joint leap in the irrigation field of the country. Moragahakanda is not an isolated project as it will be followed by several other irrigation, hydropower projects such as Kaluganga, Upper Elahera and a few others.
These projects will make a significant contribution to the countrys economy while blooming fresh hops in the hearts of the Rajarata people, who were stricken by the water scarcity for decades, the President added. Speaking on the Moragahakanda  Kaluganga project ,the President said that even though he commenced the project on January 25, 2007 as the then Mahaweli Development Minister, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not give any support or assistance to carry out the project. He added that he made an untiring effort to seek funds , but was not allocated even a cent for the project. As a result of that , the project was stagnating for five years. Even after five years of laying the foundation, it could not be started. It has been scheduled to release water for irrigation in 2012  2013 if the project went ahead as planned.
The President pointed out that Sri Lanka has inherited a sound irrigation system and a unique hydro culture, which is not second to any in the world. As a result of this sound technological methods of our ancestors in the field of irrigation, an ancient sluice was discovered by a team of Canadian engineers who were engaged in constructing the sluice of the present Maduruoya reservoir. The ancient sluice gate was at the very place where the new sluice gate was intended to be constructed at the Maduruoya reservoir.
The President while thanking to the people who sacrificed their lands for the project said that they have made a unique contribution to the country and to strengthen countrys economy. He added that the entire project will add a value amounting Rs 200,000 million to the national economy. It will be a tremendous boost for the governments effort to obtain sustainability in various sectors, including the agriculture sector.
The President speaking on the present weather situation said that the government was s duty bound to provide rice.
Sometimes rice will have to be imported to meet the demand. But it is regrettable that certain narrow minded politicians are leveling allegations on the governments measure to protect , both farmer and consumer. The President added that a subcommittee appointed to look into the consequences of the drought, has recommended to import rice. Accordingly, the imported rice will be available in market place in the next few weeks. The government has focused attention on providing relief to the people, who are badly affected by the drought. It is a six month program. Besides, a one year program will launched to face the drought strategically, he noted.

Raviraj murder case: AG wants a new trial
The Attorney General yesterday filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal seeking a re-trial into the murder of TNA former MP Nadaraja Raviraj.
The appeal was filed before Colombo High Courts registrar and it is to be referred to the Court of Appeal in due course. On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
In its appeal, the Attorney General observed that it was inappropriate and imprudent of expecting the jury to consider the facts and laws in the trial that was heard December 23, 2016 until after midnight.
The Attorney General maintained the trial process was not appropriate and reasonable to make a just and fare verdict.
The Attorney General further observed that there were several deficiencies in the summing up of the trial judge. The Attorney General contended that several important legal concepts which are relevant to the case were not considered by the trial judge.
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code.
Three accused who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.
Raviraj was shot dead near his residence at Manning Town in Narahenpita between November 9, 2006 and November 10, 2006 when he was driving his vehicle along Martha Road. The CID recovered the trishaw and the weapon alleged to have been used in the killing of the former Parliamentarian.

Reconciliation move:  potentials and liabilities
The dust may yet to settle on the second anniversary of the National Unity government. The ruling United National Party (UNP) and the mainstream faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) held a sombre ceremony to mark the event where President Maithripala Sirisena categorically stated that, despite the challenges it faced and the occasional critical comment from within the government itself, it would survive until 2020, when the next national elections are due.
The main challenge to the government comes from the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the SLFP. Its de facto leader, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has already declared that 2017 will be the year in which the government will be toppled. He has also stated that he is willing to serve as Prime Minister under President Sirisena.
That is, in effect, an admission of defeat of sorts for the JO. This is because it is also an acknowledgment that, without a general or presidential election until 2020 and the Constitution now preventing a premature dissolution of Parliament, there is no way for the JO to regain power unless it demonstrates a working majority in Parliament.
Even if the JO achieves this nearly improbable target, President Maithripala Sirisena is already on record saying that he will never appoint Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister. In fact, in the lead up to the 2015 general election, he made an address to the nation to convey exactly these sentiments to the country!
Ethnic question
Nevertheless, challenges to the smooth functioning of the government remain. Although swept off the headlines now, chief among them is the resolution of the ethnic question.
There are two critical components in resolving this issue: the degree of devolution of power granted to the regions and the inquiry into alleged war time atrocities during the final phases of the Eelam war. The latter had been a constant irritant for the Rajapaksa regime, which had the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) passing successive resolutions against it in Geneva.
In trying to address the issue of accountability for alleged war time atrocities, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed a Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF).
The Task Force consisted of eminent persons of many ideological persuasions and was chaired by Attorney at Law Manouri Muttetuwegama, the widow of late Sarath Muttetuwegama, the stalwart Communist party parliamentarian who once played a lone hand in Parliament against the steamrolling J R Jayewardene government.
Others in the Task Force were Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu (Director, Centre for Policy Alternatives), Gamini Viyangoda (columnist and social commentator), Visaka Dharmadasa (Founder of the Association of War Affected Women and Parents of Servicemen), Shantha Abhimanasingham (President of the Jaffna Bar Association), Sitralega Maunaguru (a retired professor from the Eastern University), K W Janaranjana (Attorney at Law and journalist), Daya Somasundaram (Senior Professor of Psychiatry at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna and a Consultant Psychiatrist), Dr. Farzana Haniffa (an anthropologist and Senior Lecturer in Sociology at the University of Colombo), Prof Gameela Samarasinghe (a Clinical Psychologist and an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology, University of Colombo) and Mirak Raheem (a researcher and a human rights activist). Their credentials speak for themselves.
What created controversy was their final report. The report was presented last week to former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. This was in her capacity as the Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).
The most disputed recommendation of the Task Force was that there should be a majority of national judges and at least one international judge on every bench to try war crimes and serious violations of human rights that allegedly occurred in Sri Lanka.
It will be recalled that the issue of appointing international judges to any war crimes probe has always been a bone of contention. The international community and the UNHRC have always called for this. Conversely, the Sri Lankan government has consistently defended its right to make its own decisions in this regard. It has also been pointed out that the appointment of international judges could be potentially violating the Constitution.
Domestic mechanisms
The report of the CTF said that consultations in the North and East in particular, as well as in some areas in the rest of the country, revealed the overwhelming lack of trust in the State, its institutions and mechanisms. The belief was strongly expressed that exclusively domestic mechanisms would not be credible.
At the same time, consultations outside of the North and East and with the armed forces, revealed strong opposition to international participation in any inquiry. Many however did recognise that given the limitations of existing capabilities in specialised areas, international expertise should be engaged, the CTF noted.
The CTF recommended that changes be made to Sri Lankan law to facilitate an inquiry into war crimes. International crimes such as war crimes and crimes against humanity must be criminalised and incorporated into Sri Lankan law immediately through legislation, it proposed. Recommending the creation of a special court to hear such allegations, it suggested that this court shall ensure that there will be a majority of national judges and at least one international judge on every bench.
Reactions to these recommendations have been swift and surprisingly have come more from the government itself than from the ranks of the Opposition which will predictably condemn them. President Maithripala Sirisena is yet to publicly react to the findings of the CTF. However, addressing a hurriedly called press conference at the Presidents House, State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said he was clarifying the Presidents stance on the issue.
President Sirisenas position was very clear on this matter and he has more than once said there will be no foreign judges in the local judicial mechanism and it will not be a hybrid court as suggested by certain groups, Abeywardena explained.
The Minister said that only logistical assistance would be obtained to expedite the judicial process, when the judicial mechanism was set up to probe the alleged crimes. He also noted that Sri Lankas Constitution or the Criminal Procedure Code do not provide for the establishment of a judicial mechanism with foreign judges to adjudicate alleged war crimes.
Also expressing his dismay at the CTF report was Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The minister said he had no confidence in the CTF. No one is complaining about the independence of the judiciary anymore. We have reconciliation and peace processes in place. This report, at this juncture, is totally unwarranted. Therefore, we dont have to follow these recommendations by the CTF, the Minister said. Having foreign judges in local tribunals is also a violation of the Constitution, he noted.
CTFs recommendations
In comments at a public event on Tuesday, Kumaratunga acknowledged that the CTFs recommendations had been rejected by some in the government but argued that they need discussion. We are not opposed to them. We are not under obligation to implement all of them, Kumaratunga observed, stating that the government will have to decide on this.
In the weeks and months to come, this is likely to become an even more controversial issue. The CTF was appointed under the auspices of the government by the Prime Minister. It has now emerged with a set of recommendations that may have unfavourable consequences for the government: if the government upholds them, the opposition will quite gleefully raise alarm, claiming that the government is betraying war heroes.
On the other hand, if the government chooses to ignore the recommendations of its own Task Force, it risks censure from the international community and the UNHRC at a time when a lot of hard work has gone into repairing Sri Lankas image and credibility on the world stage.
Perhaps more importantly, the country must still come up with a mechanism of inquiry into the alleged war crimes that would satisfy all stakeholders: the aggrieved parties, the armed forces, the Sri Lankan voter as well as the international community and the UNHRC. It is no easy task. The government will need to handle this issue which extends beyond party lines, extremely carefully. Potentially, it could also be a familiar theme heard during the campaign for the Local Government elections, the next poll that the country will face. Interesting times lie ahead.

Russias Parliament wants to decriminalize domestic assault

Russia looks likely to enact a lawdecriminalizing domestic violence, downgrading first offenses from a criminal act to a misdemeanor punishable by fine.
The bill was approved by all but two present members of Russias Lower House on Wednesday, theMoscow Timesreports.
Critics say the bill is a clear backslide on womens rights; it would remove most legal and disciplinary distinctions between violence in the family household and street assaults, which were decriminalized in Russia in 2016. The offense carries a penalty of about $500 if prosecuted.
The new legislation wasproposedby ultra-conservative lawmaker Yelena Mizulina, who also successfully lobbied for the passage of a law banning so-called gay propaganda in 2013. She argues for decriminalizing domestic violence on the grounds that parents in Russia should have the right to hit their children.
In Russian traditional family culture parent-child relationships are built on the authority of the parents power, Mizulina told lawmakers before the vote, according to the MoscowTimes. The laws should support that family tradition.
Asreportedby Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the new legislation fits within Russian President Vladimir Putins socially conservative agenda.
One of the bills authors, Olga Batalina, reportedly told her fellow lawmakers that the amendment would only concern assaults causing bruises or grazes. RFE/RL also cited ruling party official Andrei Isayev as saying that domestic assault would only be considered a misdemeanor on the first offense, but a criminal offense on the second.
Domestic violence is endemic in Russia, and overwhelmingly affects women, who account for about 74% of victims of domestic violence in the country, according togovernment figuresfrom 2013 with 91% of those incidents perpetrated by husbands. Most research on violence in Russialinks abuse to alcoholconsumption.
According to the Moscow-based ANNA National Center for the Prevention of Violence, women already see little point in seeking legal recourse for abuse, a situation that could worsen if the bill is enacted. Some 74% of women who sought assistance from a national help-line never reported abuse to police, the group said.
A 2003studyby Amnesty International concluded that 36,000 women were beaten by their husbands each day in Russia, while government figures from 2008 said that 14,000 women died each year at the hands of their spouse or other family member.

SLFP CC wants another term for President Sirisena
The Cenral Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is of the opinion that President Maithripala Sirisena should be the next Presidential candidate of the SLFP in 2021, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
He made this observation yesterday, at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Head Office in Colombo.
Questioned by the Media, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the President had not changed his stance of remaining in the position for only one term as he promised during the election period.
However the Central Committee is of the opinion that he is the most suitable person who can win the trust of all communities at the next presidential election, Minister Jayasekara said. The President as the chairman of the SLFP has to listen to the Central Committee and he does so unlike in the past. He also added that the President Sirisena summoned all the extremist groups of the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim Communities and listened to them. Earlier this did not happen  Minister Jayasekara said adding that the President was not a dictator.
Jayasekera said that the government took measures to abolish the Executive Presidency. A motion was moved in Parliament.However the Supreme Courtt decided when the Bill was challenged, that a referendum is required for this . However if it isnt to be abolished in the future, the Central Committee of the SLFP is of the view that President Sirisena is the most suitable candidate to stand as the candidate at the next Presidential election, from the SLFP.
Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa and Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Fiszer Musthapa also spoke.

South Africa move on from disruption
Johannesburg: South African captain Faf du Plessis admitted on Wednesday that Kyle Abbotts Kolpak defection had been a disruption ahead of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka starting at the Wanderers Stadium on Thursday.
But, he said, the team had moved on and were fully focused on completing a clean sweep in the series.
Abbott had his Cricket South Africa contract cancelled immediately after he revealed during the second Test in Cape Town that he had signed a Kolpak contract with Hampshire, which will rule him out of future matches for South Africa.
"Its definitely had an effect, said Du Plessis. Its taken a bit of the shine off our Test series win but its time to move on and build a new bowling attack.
Du Plessis said South Africa had failed to take an opportunity for a clean sweep in Australia last month.
"In international cricket you have a lot of tough times. You dont get opportunities like this very often. It is an opportunity to do it now."
Du Plessis said left-arm seamer Wayne Parnell would replace Abbott but Du Plessis did not rule out a first cap for Duanne Olivier, 24, in an all-seam attack.
"Its the first time Ive seen him bowl but theres something there," he said.
Du Plessis praised Hashim Amla, who will make his 100th Test appearance on Thursday, and said he was not concerned about the batsmans recent string of low scores.
"He has been the rock of our batting. Together with Jacques Kallis he has probably been the most consistent player South Africa has ever had."
Even when Amla wasnt scoring runs he was an asset to the team, according to Du Plessis.
"He brings a calmness to the dressing room and adds a lot of value. Hes had two lean periods in his career but we know that a double century is just around the corner."
Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews admitted that his team had been humiliated in the first two Tests.
"We have to look forward. We havent played our best cricket. We need to hit our straps. We have pride at stake."
Mathews said Sri Lanka had played good cricket in patches but needed to be more consistent, with the batsmen in particular needing to concentrate for long periods.

Supreme Court told: Udayanga deposited  US$ 1.5 m. and Rs. 3.04 m. in 18 bank accounts
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that the FCID conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft deal had revealed that former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga had deposited US$ 1.57 million and another Rs.3.04 million of funds in the 18 bank accounts.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made this revelation, when the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Udayanga Weeratunga seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by Colombo Fort Magistrate was taken up before the Supreme Court.
ASG Kodagoda further informed Court that the funds had been remitted by overseas entities, especially from Ukraine, Panama and the Mauritius.
On October 20 this year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa ,over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Udayanga Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner.
In his petition, Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv,Ukraine.
The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved the Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner. The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the constitution.
The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the constitution by the purported decision to suspend and suspension of debit transaction of the bank accounts of the petitioner in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner.

Survival and the mind for more
Salutations and top regards to all our regulars just getting ready for a cracking conclusion to the league championship in sunny Sri. Fair to sit back and pretend not to feel that pressure and fair too, that the faint hearted, settle for crumpets and tea at the impressive Cinnamon Grand. Best leave our resident experts to speculate on the quality of scones or crumpetrather than fuss the points and form going into week 10. Infinitely better we ship our google and fb qualified rugby gurus to England for the RBS 6 Nations next month. ...give them a freebie to inspect the match venues and running surface from Cardiff to Twickenham...prior to perhaps the most anticipated home unions battle since the Normans storming the neighbours bastions many seasons prior perhaps some strategic advice from Blackadder
The focus for all rugby hearts is still the lack of television coverage on terrestrial channels ...which should be a priority for the stakeholders and those who partner our island game. To broadbase and truly spread the word of rugby to all corners needs the same push and support international cricket gets throughout our tropical haven...every school kid and family understands why our captain Mathews is up defending his team to the world, after they folded up against conditions, class and genuine pace in South Africa.
The fact that pretty much mostly all the cricket team is desperate for news from home and injury updates... will the SRI rep players be fit available and injury free for Kandy ...We have to be sharp to understand the nature of injury and its survival...for the last 2 match weekends. It will be a brave man who bets against Kandy to quietly hand the league title to Havies or Navy ...lets test the theory
I firmly believe and back the fitter players to take the league and defy Science ...that will depend on how efficient the conditioning coaches have been, with the strategy, training and pure attitude of the possible XV The skill to survive and translate all that to work and responsibility in the middle ...so as a team they are mighty supportive of each other in the thick of things...
Life under pressure in the middle is about absorbing everything the opposition throws at you... being patient and able to turn on the charm and score as required... The finishing is key ...and the team with designated finishers ...professional runners who smell the line from 75 meters out and can slice through defences, add dimension and magic to the game, and for us fans to scream...
Spare a thought for the back room boys working furiously to recover a range of niggling injuries all week... that add quality and make the Navy v Kandy game at the Nittawela cauldron of pain ...a real old fashion grudge battle, a total bruiser of a match, with no love lost and not an inch given.
The fans who want to see true gladiatorswill be thrilled to bits ...as I believe skill might be compromised for brute force and more mauls on the cards.
Navy will focus their defence to stop Kandy getting clean ball and trying to pressure the no. 9 Roshan Weeraratne at the base if Kandy have the luxury of possession ...expect Danushka Ranjan and Nigel Ratwatte to cause all sorts of problems for Navy.
What a delicious confrontation in the hills ...all roads will certainly lead to the tunnel at the bottom of the hill at Nittawela. A good hard graft 80 minutes ...billed to thrill, especially after that first round loss in Welisara.
The championship race is mesmerizing ...and means that Havelocks, Navy and Kandy are all in with a chance ...experience, talent, fitness and planning all value pillars of the side that goes all the way ...but its pure unadulterated hunger that will define the winner. Who will have more fire in the belly Who is the hungriest team in the league Your guess is a mighty statement and hints at ability to read a game based on form and stats ...Enjoy!
A final word on the gladiator spirit that will shine through all performance indicators this year ...rugby is about power, endurance and skills...those who are blessed at birth and those who strive to acquire that magic all their lives ...finding the right class, attitude and discipline makes the search a very real quest.
Sri Lanka needs inspiration on every level and we need our own brand of rugby that magical quality which defines our rugby on the Asian platform for starters.
The U18 and U20 boys have given us the luxury of two historic Asian 7s championships...which we build from and secure consistent form all through the grading process in Asia 2017 and performance eyes on the 2018 Commonwealth Games and beyond. We need protection for these young guns and professionals protecting and sharpening those natural skills to their max ...travel them to NZ for conditioning etc... invest in our 7s future and be proud of these young islanders.
I live for that day our flag rules the podium and Sri Lanka takes its place at the top ...bula bula to all the real fans who live and love the code ...blessings to all who believe!

Trump tells Jack Ma: Well do Some Great Things
US: President-elect Donald Trump and Chinas billionaire founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba held great talks in New York on Monday focused on creating US jobs and enabling trade with Asia.
The incoming Republican president, who will be sworn in as commander-in-chief in less than two weeks time having never previously held elected office, has made job creation a key promise of his incoming administration.
His team said the meeting between the 70-year-old real estate tycoon and China richest man was focused on how Alibaba can create one million US jobs by enabling one million US small businesses to sell goods into China and Asia.
We had a great meeting, Trump told reporters afterward in accompanying Ma back down to the lobby of his Trump Tower headquarters.
He hailed the 52-year-old self-made Chinese billionaire as a great, great entrepreneur, one of the best in the world.
He loves this country and he loves China, Trump added. Jack and I going to do some great things. Small business, right he added.
Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba, said it had been a productive meeting and that the focus would be on small business and American agricultural products.
We discussed about helping American small business selling things through Alibaba platform to China and to Asia, he told reporters.
The Alibaba founder said the meeting focused on how to support one million small businesses, particularly in the Midwest, in selling products to China and Asia.
The meeting comes after Trump has taken a hard line with China, threatening to impose 45 percent import tariffs on Chinese goods and saying the worlds second biggest economy has stiffed the US through currency manipulation and illegal subsidies.
That antagonism has raised fears among US businesses that their exports to China will be threatened, especially since Beijing has signaled it will retaliate.
Ma said he and Trump agreed that China-US relations should be strengthened, should be more friendly and do better.
He said the door was open for discussing the relationship and trade issues, and praised Trump as very smart and very open-minded in listening.
Ma said he had conveyed his ideas on how to improve trade, and that the US president-elect had concerns and he has solutions, that he wants to discuss with China and us.
Alibaba shares were up 1.11 percent on the New York Stock Exchange during trade on Monday.
Trump also met LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault on Monday. Arnault told reporters that his company was going to expand its production in the United States. - AFP

Two Influenza H1N1 deaths at Kandy hospital
Two kidney patients in Kandy Hospital died of Influenza H1N1 yesterday. Two out of the three deaths reported from the Kandy Teaching hospital were caused by H1N1.
The deceased are two males,one is 35 years of age and the other an elderly individual.
Asked if the MRI has confirmed the cause of deaths Kandy Teaching Hospital Director Dr.R.M.S.K.Ratnayake said the Kandy Hospital has access to similar facilities that the MRI has to confirm the cause to be H1N1 positive.
The third death was caused by final stage pneumonia, Dr. Ratnayake said.
It is reported that eight employees of the Kidney Transplant Unit staff including a doctor, are diagnosed with influenza and have taken leave.
The Kidney patient ward (No 69) has ceased to admit patients due to the influenza.
Dr.Ratnayake said the ward has been disinfected.
Dr.Ratnayake further said they suspect the spread must have been caused by a patient who had already contracted the H1N1 virus, when hospitalised.
A team from the Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit is investigating the matter.
Six more patients in the kidney patient ward, are suspected to have contracted the H1N1 virus.
Dr. Ratnayake further said patients with low immunity, such as kidney patients, children, pregnant mothers are vulnerable to the H1n1 virus.
An awareness programme on the spreading of the virus is to be launched, Dr.Ratnayake also said.

Whither Sri Lanka,  our dear Motherland
The time has come for all of us to put our hands together to the plough and begin seriously the process of rebuilding our country making it a land abounding in prosperity and regaining its lost international image that has been stained through a series of tragedies that had overtaken her in the last few decades. It is a matter of urgency both for the citizens at large and in particular for the politicians in whose hands they have placed their trust and confidence in voting them to power.
It is sad to note that a country that had been so much blessed with potential to become a naturally vibrant democracy and an economy that would have been our pride and one of envy to others in the Asian region, has since its independence had cogged her wheels for the last almost six decades. Our neighbours like Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea have made gallant strides on their way to economic prosperity and political stability. Many critics in the field of national and international politics as well as local and global economics are prone to lay the blame squarely at the feet of the politicians who at the expense of the ignorance of the majority of people have played their opportunistic games to grab and keep their power, not to mention the fringe benefits accrued there-from.
Party politics is a healthy national system to keep alive the structures and the smooth working of democracy. But when political parties succumb merely to the greed for power and forget the greater interests and urgent needs of the people, it has always proved a disaster, a catastrophe.
Political parties
It is the paramount duty of political and religious leaders, to work hard in creating a sense of
Sri Lankan identity while not infringing on distinct features as race, ethnicity, language etc. There are many countries where despite and notwithstanding ethnic, language,
racial and religious differences, it has been possible to evolve a national identity without however disrespecting these same differences  
The two main political parties in the national arena, the UNP and the SLFP that had swayed power alternatively, though have achievements to their credit, have plunged this nation into an array of complicated situations from which we are still struggling to liberate ourselves. Problems keep lingering that needed urgent solutions which would have helped to avert the terrible national tragedy of a thirty-year ethnic war and two youth insurrections.
This is a history from which both politicians and the people should wisely and humbly learn some good lessons. It merely boils down to the fact that it is a matter of social justice, prosperity and security for all the people. The people of this country are used at every major decisive election to vote to power the party they think had made the best of promises and pledges of extraordinary hope. Yet, in the course of its period of government, there had been more failure than success in carrying out their election pledges.
The devastating ethnic war and youth insurrections could have been averted if the minorities were justly treated as equal citizens of this country with due honour to their language and culture. The youth insurrection of April 1971, the ethnic riots of July 1983 and the social unrest of late-eightees would not have made the soil of this Dharmadeepa turn into a Karmadeepa soaked in the warm blood of our youthful generation, if equal opportunities of education and employment had been provided for them. The rural youth felt a terribly neglected lot in terms of their hopes for good education and dreams of satisfactory employment. They took the social philosophy of Marxism to its extreme and turned to violence and revolution seeking regime change putting the very edifice of democracy into radical questioning. It was leftist trends taken into its violent forms of doing away with state authority, social and political institutions that were the hall-marks of national progress and security.
Both the ethnic war and the youth rebellions were quelled by a counter state-violence with exercise of military force. Violence was met with violence and it is not the best of the religious teachings to take to this path of armed conflict and struggle on the part of any one. The causes and issues for which the northern terrorists fought and the issues on which the youth took to an armed struggle in the South, are still to be completely solved. In the mean time, the country had run into formidable debt having to go with the begging bowl habitually to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ensure economic security.
Home-grown solution
The Human Rights Commission of the UNO hurled serious accusations at Sri Lanka in the matter of violation of human rights and destruction of fundamental freedoms connected with the war and its aftermath. We are still to win this battle and clear our good name with the world powers that be who hover over us. The people of the country are still confused as to the best political structures that would bring in solidarity and reconciliation on the national level and what the best home-grown solution would be for the national problem: ethnic and economic.
This is not the time for politicians to advance their sectarian interests, whether they be from the two main parties, the joint-opposition or from other minority Tamil parties. Instead every passing day is warning us that the only way out of this morass is for all to work together as national leaders who love the country and the people. There must be a give-and-take policy in a spirit of genuine and sincere dialogue in an honest type of exercising party politics.
As of now, there is much to be desired from all the political parties as regards their spirit of dialogue and sincere involvement with the national issues. Unless political leadership goes beyond party interests and try to strike common ground in a spirit of understanding among them selves and with love for the country, the chances for a prosperous era to dawn on this our dear Motherland of Sri Lanka are just too dim.
We are on the top of a volcano. It is the people who are the butt-end of adversity caused by greedy politics that has brought this pearl of Indies into rack and ruin. Even now, we do not see mature efforts and discernment in looking for practical solutions acceptable to all. There are blatant contradictions in political statements that really bewilder and confuse the minds of the hoi-polloi. To page 17

Yakkhas overwhelmed by fear
Duruthus prestige rests not on the calendar, but on the Buddhas first visit to Sri Lanka. It ushered in the Buddhist diplomacy between two countries established by Arahant Mahinda at a later date. The Buddhas journey to Sri Lanka is not scripted in the Pali Canons, probably for its historical esteem rather than philosophical element.
The modern calendar ranks Duruthu as the first poya of the year. Sinhalese year dawns with Bak followed by the leading Poya, Vesakha. Buddhisms steady growth kept track on its followers observing Sil on any full moon day staying away from worldly commitments long before Gregorian standards stepped in.
Mahawamsa reworks the Buddhas three visits to Sri Lanka between 563 BCE and 483 within the very first chapter.
The legend has the Buddha mellowing out at Anotatta lake, one of the seven great lakes of Himava, when he noticed a conflict in the neighbour country.
Mahawamsas hotly-debated narrative is reproduced to kindle interest:
To this great gathering of that Yakkhas went the Blessed One, and there, in the midst of that assembly, hovering in the air over their heads, at the place of the (future) Mahiyangana-thupa, he struck terror to their hearts by rain, storm, darkness and so forth.
The Yakkhas, overwhelmed by fear, besought the fearless Vanquisher to release them from terrors, and the Vanquisher, destroyer of fear, spoke thus to the terrified Yakkhas: I will banish this your fear and your distress, O Yakkhas, give ye here to me with one accord a place where I may sit down.
The Yakkhas thus answered the Blessed One: We all, O Lord, give you even the whole of our island. Give us release from our fear. This key event has been traced in many ways. We can well gather that the Buddha must have looked like an invader to the islanders especially at a moment of crisis.
On the other hand many Sutta sources report instances people being traumatised by nature for not heeding the Buddhas advice. Anybody who does not heed a holy mans good-willed advice will be naturally burdened and this must have been the chronicles definition.
The description does not figure out the Buddha to have caused terrors on the islanders; it was naturally caused. Some sources let on that the Buddha used Yama Maha Perahara the miracle he performed earlier to convince his relatives of his enlightenment. Definitely it must have been amazing for the islanders to see a foreigner with fire and water at the same time. Which must have watered the fiery hearts.
God Sumana Samans episode stirs up a multi-positioned controversy. As some sources let on Saman is one of the deities who listened to the Buddha on his first visit. Whereas some sources observe Saman as a prince who became a god in the following birth. Both these accounts, however, have no disagreement with the fundamental Buddhism.
The Buddha acknowledged the existence of celestial beings such as gods and Brahmas, born upon developed virtues. The celestial realm is not the goal in Buddhism; it is in fact far behind the Nibbana.
Celestial realms, like human worlds, are impermanent and unstable, equipped with birth, existence and death. Prince Saman must have been sotapanna - stream-winner, the first stage of Buddhist sainthood - hence chances are more for him to be a god the following existence. Importantly Sumana Saman is not identified as a Hindu god.
Prince Saman requested the Buddha for reverence object. The Buddha gave him a lock of hair from his head and it was enshrined in the Mahiyangana stupa, the first Dagoba constructed in the island during the lifetime of Buddha.
Prince Saman had received the sacred lock of hair in a golden pot and he put the sacred object on a heap of multi-coloured gems, seven cubits round, stacked up at the Buddhas seat and covered them over with a shrine of sapphire.
The existence of Arahants as well as their link with Sri Lanka was evident even following the Buddhas demise. Arahant Sarabhu, the student of Arahant Sariputta, got hold of the Buddhas collarbone and brought it down to Sri Lanka to lay it in the same shrine. Covering with gold-plated stones, the Arahant had made it 12 cubits high before leaving the isle. King Dutugemunu was to make the shrine 80 cubits high later on.
