Sri Lanka struggle before rain intervenes
DUNEDIN, SUNDAY: Tim Southee took two wickets as New Zealand tightened the screws on Sri Lanka on the fourth day of the first Test Sunday, but rain threatened to derail their victory hopes.
New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum set the stage for a tantalising conclusion at Dunedin's University Oval with a sporting declaration that offered Sri Lanka more than five sessions to reach a 405-run target.
But the tourists' response was disrupted by three stoppages as southerly squalls swept across the ground. Further showers are forecast for the final day.
At stumps on day four, with an hour's play lost because of the weather, Sri Lanka were 109 for three, requiring a further 296 runs to pull off an epic victory.
Dinesh Chandimal is not out 31 and captain Angelo Mathews has yet to face.
Sri Lanka's highest fourth-innings chase is 352-9 against South Africa in 2006 and the highest by any side in New Zealand is 348-5 by the West Indies in 1969.
McCullum declared New Zealand's second innings at 267-3 to go with their 137-run first innings advantage.
Sri Lankan openers Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Mendis set about building a foundation reaching 54 in the 27th over when New Zealand struck twice.
Southee had Karunaratne, Sri Lanka's top scorer in the first innings, caught behind for 29 and 10 runs later debutant Udara Jayasundera fell to Neil Wagner for 3.
Mendis, in only his second Test, persevered for 150 deliveries and benefited from dropped catches on 13 and 25 before he was caught behind off Southee for 46 with the score on 109.
Before his replacement Mathews could reach the crease a hail storm brought play to a halt for the third and final time.
The dismissal of Mendis gave wicketkeeper BJ Watling a New Zealand record ninth catch for the Test.
With seven wickets left he has a chance to reach the world record of 11 jointly held by England's Jack Russell and South African AB de Villiers. After New Zealand resumed the day at 171-1, McCullum called an end to the innings after he belted his second six to equal the world record for the number of sixes hit in Tests.
It took his total to 100, joining Australia;s Adam Gilchrist as the most prolific boundary busters in Test history.
McCullum was 17 not out when he declared, with the 23-year-old opener Tom Latham unbeaten on 109, having notched up his third Test century.
Kane Williamson, who reached his half century with the second ball of the morning, was out for 71.
It was the 20th time he has passed 50 in all forms of international cricket this year including eight times in Tests.
Latham offered two chances which were not taken and had a nerve-wracking wait on 99 when Sri Lanka challenged a rejected lbw appeal.
Several replays proved inconclusive and the Sri Lankans were helped by the ball-tracker technology not working. AFP

Tears, cheers and selfies as climate pact sealed in Paris
FRANCE: They erupted into cheers, broke into tears, took selfies and quoted great figures of history after the gavel came down in Paris on Saturday, launching the quest to save mankind from global warming.
The roughly 2,000 ministers, negotiators and activists in the cavernous plenary hall on the outskirts of the French capital took to their feet in a joyous uprising as their French hosts beamed onstage.
After almost three minutes of cheering died down French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who presided over 13 days of gruelling talks, picked up the green leaf-shaped gavel and brought it down again.
It may be a small gavel but it can do big things, he said, drawing more elated cries and clapping.
In bringing down the tiny hammer, Fabius sealed an agreement that French diplomats spent more than a year criss-crossing the globe and preparing with meticulous detail.
The mood in the room was celebratory even before the emotional approval of the accord, with broad smiles, back-slapping, hugs and handshakes.
Former Vice President Al Gore, who co-won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change, posed for pictures and selfies with admirers.
Suspense was high right up to the end, with the session to approve the accord starting about two hours late.
When Fabius finally took the stage -- to thunderous applause -- he told the crowd: There had been a couple of questions to settle.
It turned out the negotiators, bleary after two sleepless night spent hammering out the agreement had left a few mistakes in the text. One was a whopper.
A key section of the text on emissions-cutting obligations -- erroneously -- said rich nations shall take the lead in undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets.
In a complex legal agreement such as the Paris accord, shall carries a more onerous level of responsibility. It was supposed to say should, which does not have the same binding nature.
Pascal Canfin, a senior climate advisor at the World Resources Institute, wrote on Twitter the difference could have forced the Paris deal before the US congress for approval.
For the accords boosters, that possibility was terrifying as the Republican-dominated legislature would have -- with near-certainty -- rejected the agreement.
Among those fighting for the accord it must have felt like deja vu, with the US failing to adopt the carbon-cutting Kyoto Protocol, which the Paris agreement will succeed when it takes effect in 2020.
But Fabius, showing the calmness that became a hallmark of the French diplomatic effort, then reassured ministers the text would be tweaked to reflect the correct language. The final hurdle blocking the agreement dropped away.
Many ministers, who were brought in on Monday to close the deal following talks among lower-level negotiators, noted the history-making nature of the moment, referring to great figures of the 20th century, especially South African democracy hero Nelson Mandela.
We hope that Paris will mark a new beginning where commitments made will be fulfilled, said Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar.
It is Indias hope that the Paris agreement will fulfil the wishes of Mahatma Gandhi who used to say we should care for a world we will not see.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased 0.54% W-o-W (or LKR 15.85bn) to LKR 2911.37bn cf. LKR 2927.21bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Healthcare sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 66.23% (or LKR 7.67bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Asiri Hospital Holdings which accounted for 99.37% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 12.46% (or LKR 1.44bn) of the weeks total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Commercial Bank, Peoples Leasing, HNB and Sampath Bank which accounted for 80.72% sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Peoples Leasing and Asia Asset led foreign purchases, while Access Engineering and Commercial Bank led foreign sales. In terms of value meanwhile, Peoples Leasing and JKH led foreign purchases while Commercial Bank and Access Engineering led foreign sales.
Point of view
Significant foreign activity dominated market turnover this week, boosting turnover value to a ~16-month high. TPG Growth III SF Pte Ltd acquired 27.87% of Asiri Hospital Holdings from Actis Investments Holdings SL Ltd, dominating the weeks turnover.
The transaction (LKR 7.6bn) which accounted for approximately 94.2% of the days turnover helped push daily average turnover value to LKR 2.32bn and the Y-T-D average to LKR 1.09bn (cf. LKR 1.06bn last week).
The significant foreign turnover stemming from the transaction boosted both foreign purchases and sales due to both parties being foreign firms. Foreign purchases increased to LKR 9.38bn (+172.96% W-o-W) while foreign sales too increased to LKR 9.65bn.
The net foreign position for the week however, remained in negative territory as net outflows of LKR 0.41bn on Thursday and Friday offset net inflows over the remainder of the week.
The ASPI meanwhile declined 37.21 points W-o-W despite the significant volumes as retail activity remained dull. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Trade Deficit narrows in September 2015
Sri Lankas external sector strengthened in September 2015 helping improve the countrys international reserve position. Gross official reserves rose to 4.2 months of imports from 4.0 months in August 2014, while tourism earnings (+35.9% Y-o-Y) and workers remittances (+1.6% Y-o-Y) too gained in September.
The B-o-P meanwhile, recorded a deficit of USD 2316mn between Jan-Sept 2015 (cf. surplus of USD 1996mn in Jan-Sept14). The countrys financial account was supported by net inflows into the Colombo Stock Exchange which amounted to USD 5.4mn as at end October 2015.
The trade deficit meanwhile, narrowed for the 3rd consecutive month declining 4.1% Y-o-Y in September 2015 as import expenditure declined 5.1% Y-o-Y.
The drop in import expenditure was led primarily by lower expenditure on Investment goods, particularly Transport Equipment (-47.9% Y-o-Y) although this decline was mainly due to a higher base effect in September 2014.
Earnings from exports meanwhile, declined 5.9% Y-o-Y in September 2015 as Industrial Exports  particularly Rubber products, Gems and Printing Industry products  recorded a significant Y-o-Y decline.

UNP and SLFP should work together - Eran
The UNP and SLFP should work together realistically and it is fundamental to the success of Sri Lanka, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne making said.
The minister said so delivering the keynote address at the Mayors Forum on Future Cities organised by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to commemorate the 150th Anniversary.
In order to develop policies, there has to be a dialogue and understanding within the political establishment, between politicians and the people and amongst the people as well. We can only drive forward the government through discussion. Dialogue and unity are important not just between ethnic communities, different religions, politicians and the people, but also between the UNP and SLFP. Dialogue and unity is something we must not just preach but practice. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are showing the way through example. They have a common vision, they have common values, and they are putting forward a common action programme. It is important to lead by example than just to talk about visions and plans. That is what the new leadership is doing, he said.
The Deputy Minister also stressed that the public transportation in Sri Lanka is entirely outdated and needs to undergo genuine modernization.
The previous government poured in millions to build in ports and airports, yet failed to make lives better for the ordinary man who takes an over crowded bus or a train every day to work. By installing the GPS system on buses the public can track the routes, arrival times, and estimated time to destinations.
This would save people the anxieties over bus delays and considerable amount of time wasted. There is much to be done in the area of public transport. The Fort Railway station has not changed since independence. The Government has already identified heavy road congestion as one of the major issues facing Colombo. I dont think that these kinds of issues should be just left to the central Government, but the city should take its own initiative he said.
He also noted the development initiatives carried out in the cities must be people-centric.
According to the Global Innovation Index Sri Lanka is ranked poorly at 85 out of 141 countries. Contrastingly, Singapore is ranked 7th, Hong Kong is ranked 11th.
This highlights the lack of an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation in Sri Lanka and under investment in our human capital. I have a blueprint to develop Moratuwa as an industrial park, knowledge park, and to set up a world class carpentry school. The hospital will be linked digitally to the other hospitals n the country. A public safety network will be set up he noted.
Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran pointed out the legislation pertaining to the land ownership and the ownership of condominiums etc. must be revised soon as those are muddied and unclear.
The present government set out the creation of a mega polis as a key investment and economic policy platform to take its agenda forward. The idea is that we make Colombo and its environs the most livable city in South Asia. In reaching this target, one critical area that has to be addressed is the issue of land ownership. I believe the new government has plans to address this issue because for any mega city to thrive, there has to be a very clear legal framework in terms of the ownership of property and property rights he observed.
We are lucky we are having the investors like the Shangri-la group which opening up a big complex right opposite the port. We have the prospects of the China Harbour Engineering Company coming in and building a three square kilometer port city adjacent to our port which hopefully will become down south business district in the next decade. That I think will crucially link Colombo and indeed the whole Sri Lanka to the global value chain. Colombo has tremendous prospects to go forward and it has all the elements needed to be a great futuristic city. The real issue is can we enact and implement effective policies to make that happen he commented.
Colombo Mayor A. J. M. Muzammil said his aim is to develop Colombo as the smartest, greenest, and most sustainable city of Asia.
The city of Colombo has become one of the fastest growing cities in the South Asia. It has built up close international relationships. During the next 10-20 years 70 percent of the population will be moving to the major cities. The cities have to gear to face this challenge he said.

Woman wins seat on Mecca Municipal Council in Saudi polls
SAUDI ARABIA: A Saudi woman won a seat on Meccas municipal council in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabias first-ever elections open to female voters and candidates, the countrys election commission announced Sunday.
Salma bint Hizab al-Oteibi was elected to the council of Madrakah, a region in the holy city of Mecca, the official SPA news agency reported, citing election commission president Osama al-Bar.
She was running against seven men and two women, he added.
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with some of the worlds tightest restrictions on women, including a ban on driving.
It was the last country to allow only men to vote, and polling stations were segregated during Saturdays vote.
Among the 6,440 candidates were more than 900 women, who overcame a number of obstacles to participate in the landmark poll.
Female candidates could not directly meet any male voters during their campaigns.
Female voters said registration was hindered by factors including bureaucratic obstacles and a lack of transport.
As a result, women accounted for less than 10 percent of registered voters and few female candidates were expected to be elected.

Bourse adopts sector classifications to enhance trading
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) adopts Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) to classify its listed companies. This was officially launched at the ceremony held on December 2, 2015 to mark the 30th anniversary of the CSE. In this interview Colombo Stock Exchange's New Products and Research Head Nishantha Hewavithana explains the new system.
Excerpts of the interview.
Q: Why sector classifications matter
You may have heard investment advisors and other investment gurus saying you should diversify your portfolio: this is commonly stated by the idiom Dont put all your eggs in one basket. The idea is that if you dont put all your eggs in one basket, you are able to diversify your risk into different stocks or securities. Clearly your investment should be diversified across different business sectors. For example, having purchased only 5 banking stocks you cant say your portfolio is well diversified, because you are still exposed to just one industry, which is banking in this example.
Therefore by diversifying your portfolio you can, and should spread your risk across different industry sectors. The fundamental idea behind this is the premise that all industries will not be doing bad simultaneously. In order to facilitate investors to diversify investments across different industry sectors, stock markets all over the world classify companies into different business sectors.

The fundamental idea behind this is the premise that all industries will not be doing bad simultaneously. In order to facilitate investors to diversify investments across different industry sectors, stock markets all over the world classify companies into different business sectors.
Q:How important is to have a common standard
In the modern world, with the increased global focus of equity investments, geographical demarcations do not matter. Moreover it is different industry sectors that play a crucial role. However, across different geographies when different classifications are used comparisons are made difficult or sometimes impossible.Hence it is ideal to have a common classification which will make comparisons easy and meaningful.
Q: What is Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)
The Global Industry Classification Standard or GICS in short, was jointly developed in 1999 by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) and Standard and Poors (S&P) to fulfill the requirement of the global investment community for a reliable, standard industry classification system.
GICS classification has a wide global reach and thus covers 42,000 companies that account for 95% of the global market capitalization.
The hierarchical GICS structure has four levels from Sectors, Industry Groups, Industries and sub-industries. The Sector is the most general level while the sub-industry being the most specific level. Overall there are 10 sectors, 24 industry groups, 68 industries and 154 sub-industries.
Q: How do you compare the existing classification used by the Stock Exchange with GICS
There are two main differences. First, the GICS is obviously an international standard while the existing classification framework was locally developed. Second, the GICS is structurally hierarchical with four different levels. The existing framework is a single layer system with 20 different sectors.
Q: How is a listed company classified according to GICS
Standard & Poors and MSCI jointly assign a company to a single GICS sub-industry according to the definition of its principal business activity. Revenues are a significant factor in determining principal business activity; however, earnings analysis and market perception are also important criteria for classification in case where revenue analyses do not provide a clear direction. For this purpose, only public information is used so that anyone can replicate the assignment.
Likewise any company will be assigned to the most appropriate sub-industry, i.e. the 4th level of the GICS hierarchy. The other levels pertaining to the classification of the particular company, i.e. 3rd, 2nd and the 1st level is derived from the pre-defined GICS hierarchical tree.
Therefore, each company will have its own sub industry, industry, industry Group and a Sector which would provide an immense flexibility to analysts.
The detailed version of a methodology is available in the public domain and a simple web search with the search term GICS Map book will help.
Q: Companies might get into new business areas in time.Will GICS be in a position to capture these dynamics
Of course. Once a classification is assigned to a particular company it is reviewed annually, at a minimum. In addition to this, companies are under constant surveillance for corporate actions. For example if a particular major corporate action redefines a company's primary line of business, a new appropriate reclassification is carried out.
At a minimum, annual reviews are conducted to ensure that a company has not redefined its line of business through a series of smaller events.
Q: The GICS structure is hierarchical with four levels. Are the number of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub industries constant
No. The GICS structure is also reviewed annually based on a survey conducted publicly among the finance community. Accordingly, as the global economy changes, sectors, industry group, industries and subindustries may be added or divided to represent more meaningful and reliable structure.
Q: Which particular advantages do you expect to have by adopting GICS to classify listed companies on CSE
The use of this global standard helps foreign investors compare companies outside of their local markets and CSE attracts their attention. The GICS enables fund managers and investment research community to make comparisons by industry. The GICS helps market participants determine whether stock performances are locally based or are part of a broader global trend. The GICS structure is such that grouping dissimilar companies together is very unlikely.
Four classification levels allow for a more varied level of analysis - for example compare a particular analyst who is interested in running the analysis in more general level as against a one who wants to do the same at more granular level.
Of course GICS is ready facilitate both. The former analyst will do the analysis at the sector level (1st level of GICS hierarchy) while the latter analyzing at a more bub level 2nd, 3rd or even 4th level of GICS hierarchy.
Likewise we expect to make our market more appealing to investment community globally and increase the visibility of our listed companies internationally. This kind of robust, standard classification will not only help foreign investors but also to local investor community to truly diversify their investments.
However it should be noted that since our market is a smaller market we will not be able to do the same at more granular level since number of peers in a particular group will be very low. Hence we have limited the implementation of GICS at CSE only to the 1st and 2nd level.
Q:How is the successful implementation of GICS at the CSE ensured
We, at the Colombo Stock Exchange, strongly believe that stakeholder consultation plays a key role in a successful implementation of a project in this nature.We have taken two measures.First is that, in order to ensure the comfort of our stakeholders, including listed companies, institutional investors such as unit trust management companies, broker firms and custodian bankswe engaged in face to face and mail consultations.
Second, we decided to run GICS classification as an alternative by way of a pilot project of one year along with the current classification system. Even the pilot project, we implement gradually. We first introduced the classification started publishing in only on our website last week, then we will introduce the sub-indices and then we plan to expand the dissemination to daily printed publications etc.
After the pilot period we will take a decision to fully migrate to GICS or not based on another round of stakeholder consultations.We believe this will ensure a smooth transition.

In the modern world, with the increased global focus of equity investments, geographical demarcations do not matter. Moreover it is different industry sectors that play a crucial role. However, across different geographies when different classifications are used comparisons are made difficult or sometimes impossible.Hence it is ideal to have a common classification which will make comparisons easy and meaningful.

There are two main differences. First, the GICS is obviously an international standard while the existing classification framework was locally developed. Second, the GICS is structurally hierarchical with four different levels. The existing framework is a single layer system with 20 different sectors.
Q: How is a listed company classified according to GICS
Standard & Poors and MSCI jointly assign a company to a single GICS sub-industry according to the definition of its principal business activity. Revenues are a significant factor in determining principal business activity; however, earnings analysis and market perception are also important criteria for classification in case where revenue analyses do not provide a clear direction. For this purpose, only public information is used so that anyone can replicate the assignment.
Likewise any company will be assigned to the most appropriate sub-industry, i.e. the 4th level of the GICS hierarchy. The other levels pertaining to the classification of the particular company, i.e. 3rd, 2nd and the 1st level is derived from the pre-defined GICS hierarchical tree.
Therefore, each company will have its own sub industry, industry, industry Group and a Sector which would provide an immense flexibility to analysts.
The detailed version of a methodology is available in the public domain and a simple web search with the search term GICS Map book will help.
Q: Companies might get into new business areas in time.Will GICS be in a position to capture these dynamics
Of course. Once a classification is assigned to a particular company it is reviewed annually, at a minimum. In addition to this, companies are under constant surveillance for corporate actions. For example if a particular major corporate action redefines a company's primary line of business, a new appropriate reclassification is carried out.
At a minimum, annual reviews are conducted to ensure that a company has not redefined its line of business through a series of smaller events.
Q: The GICS structure is hierarchical with four levels. Are the number of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub industries constant
No. The GICS structure is also reviewed annually based on a survey conducted publicly among the finance community. Accordingly, as the global economy changes, sectors, industry group, industries and subindustries may be added or divided to represent more meaningful and reliable structure.
Q: Which particular advantages do you expect to have by adopting GICS to classify listed companies on CSE
The use of this global standard helps foreign investors compare companies outside of their local markets and CSE attracts their attention. The GICS enables fund managers and investment research community to make comparisons by industry. The GICS helps market participants determine whether stock performances are locally based or are part of a broader global trend. The GICS structure is such that grouping dissimilar companies together is very unlikely.
Four classification levels allow for a more varied level of analysis - for example compare a particular analyst who is interested in running the analysis in more general level as against a one who wants to do the same at more granular level.
Of course GICS is ready facilitate both. The former analyst will do the analysis at the sector level (1st level of GICS hierarchy) while the latter analyzing at a more bub level 2nd, 3rd or even 4th level of GICS hierarchy.
Likewise we expect to make our market more appealing to investment community globally and increase the visibility of our listed companies internationally. This kind of robust, standard classification will not only help foreign investors but also to local investor community to truly diversify their investments.
However it should be noted that since our market is a smaller market we will not be able to do the same at more granular level since number of peers in a particular group will be very low. Hence we have limited the implementation of GICS at CSE only to the 1st and 2nd level.
Q:How is the successful implementation of GICS at the CSE ensured
We, at the Colombo Stock Exchange, strongly believe that stakeholder consultation plays a key role in a successful implementation of a project in this nature.We have taken two measures.First is that, in order to ensure the comfort of our stakeholders, including listed companies, institutional investors such as unit trust management companies, broker firms and custodian bankswe engaged in face to face and mail consultations.
Second, we decided to run GICS classification as an alternative by way of a pilot project of one year along with the current classification system. Even the pilot project, we implement gradually. We first introduced the classification started publishing in only on our website last week, then we will introduce the sub-indices and then we plan to expand the dissemination to daily printed publications etc.
After the pilot period we will take a decision to fully migrate to GICS or not based on another round of stakeholder consultations.We believe this will ensure a smooth transition.

Ircon International assures SL Railways of continued support

Ircon International Limited after the successful completion of the 265 km reconstructed rail network in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, is looking to expand its footprint in Sri Lanka and assures the government of Sri Lanka of their continued support to uplift the transport sector and develop further the rail infrastructure of the country.
The Govt. of Sri Lanka is actively considering the utilization of the available Indian Line of Credit for financing these projects. Furthermore a new line of credit amounting to USD 318 Million was also announced during the visit of the Indian Premier to Sri Lanka in March 2015.
The Line of Credit is being extended by the Govt. of India as a soft loan having very attractive terms and very low interest rates. The issue of the upgrading of the railway track using Indian expertise and financial assistance was also discussed extensively during the visit of the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickramasinghe to India in September this year.
The Minister of Transport along with his team comprising senior officials from MOT & SLR, have also expressed their satisfaction of the projects executed by IRCON in the Northern Province, with the Minister expressed his views during the site inspection of works on October 3, 2015.
IRCON is hopeful that consequent to the formation of the new National government in the country, the process of upgrading the rail tracks especially in the Northern Province would accelerate.
Further, MOT /SLR are also in the process of preparing a master plan for 2020 and it is expected that all the projects under this plan shall be monitored by a special team nominated for this purpose. It is also understood that of top priority in this master plan is to ensure that the Colombo to Jaffna and Colombo to Trincomalee train journeys are reduced to less than 5 hours which is a long cherished dream of many Sri Lankans.
According to IRCON, the upgradation of the railway network in the country is very essential for providing a safe, fast and efficient public transport system to citizens, which helps in the overall development of the country. I
RCON also said that Rail Transport is the most environmental friendly means of transport and hence upgradation works must be taken up on priority. Rail Transport is also considered as an indicator of economic development and prosperity of a nation and is essential for tourism development which is a main source of foreign exchange earnings for Sri Lanka.
Project Director, IRCON, S.L. Gupta expressed satisfaction of the newly constructed tracks. He commented that SLR is operating six pairs of trains to Jaffna every day and all trains are learnt to be running full, thereby earning huge financial revenues for the Govt. of Sri Lanka. He also expressed satisfaction of the many new employment opportunities created due to the construction of these railway lines and the benefits derived due to the many Corporate Social Responsibility endeavors undertaken by IRCON locally.

Irish police go hi-tech to combat Christmas tree thieves
IRELAND: Fed up with roaming gangs stealing their Christmas trees, farmers and police in Ireland have turned to smartphones and helicopter patrols to ensure they can keep delivering festive cheer to customers.
In mountainous County Wicklow, south of Dublin, growers faced a crisis four years ago, with up to 2,000 trees a year being stolen, costing them up to 100,000 euros ($110,000) in lost revenue.
One of the growers around here was tied up and robbed at gunpoint so a few of the local growers went to the local police to do something, said Christy Kavanagh, a Christmas tree farmer in the small town of Newtownmountkennedy.
What emerged from that meeting became known as Operation Hurdle, an annual campaign led by Irish police, or An Garda Siochana, to target tree thieves.The whole object of the exercise is crime prevention, to prevent the theft in the first place.
Down on Kavanaghs farm, he instructs a pair of men as they load netted trees onto a truck, stacked almost three metres high, before they drive down the hill towards the motorway -- and customers in Dublin.
There are 100,000 trees growing on the farm at any one time, mostly Noble Fir, which sell for between 40 and 70 euros and can take up to 14 years before they are ready for harvest.
If someone steals something youre producing for 14 years after all the effort and expense, its not very pleasant, Kavanagh said. That is why the 53-year-old has installed security cameras, higher fences and solar-powered motion detection cameras that send images to his smartphone if there is any sign of a rustling among the firs.
Dermot Page, chairman of the Irish Christmas Tree Growers Association, said 550,000 trees will be sold this year, including 200,000 which will be exported to Europe, particularly Britain, France and Germany.
The value of the industry to Irelands economy is estimated at 21 million euros per year.
Page, a farmer in County Wicklow himself, has increased security around his 80 acres of trees, including hiring private security teams and installing more cameras, plus trip wires which trigger alarms.

Key IT Forum encourages women's involvement in ICT

"I am saddened that women in leadership do not surpass 10% in practically every sphere of life, whether it is the public sector, private sector or may it be in politics. We need to change this cultural mindset and fix this problem", the Deputy Head and spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office Rosy Senanayake said.
She was the guest of honor at the 'Women in IT Forum' held at the BMICH, Colombo recently.
The Forum began with an opening address by ICTA Chairperson, Chitranganee Mubarak, who emphasized on the role ICT plays in empowering women and the importance of harnessing that power, whether it is through a stay-at-home mother following her dream of baking cupcakes promoted through a Facebook page, or a young woman who wants to rise to the top of the field.
Ho Se Mun, Executive Director, Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation, sharing insights on Singapore's inclusiveness of women in IT, said: "What do you picture when you think of IT Guys in slacks with keyboards looking very geeky. And it's up to us to change that and ensure the industry is made of more than just 'programmers'".
"Education is the key. I think it's important that we not only educate the students, but actually the parents as well," she noted, explaining the many instances that girls have told her that their parents have discouraged them from pursuing a career in the IT sector.
The speech was followed by a panel moderated by TechAdvisor.lk editor Mihiri Wikramanayake, an online tech website, which included women leaders from the local IT industry - Vidumini Ranasinghe (Project Director, MillenniumIT), Vishaka Nanayakkara (Senior Lecturer, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa), Yashinka Jayasinghe Alles (Education Programs Manager, Microsoft) and Shamini Wickremasekera (Chief Risk Officer at LOLC).
They shared their thoughts, career paths and how they manage to 'do it all'. The women urged the young students to reach for everything they aspire to be.
Event partners, MillenniumIT CEO, Mack Gill said, "We're extremely happy to have been a part of this event. Earlier this year, we held a similar event for university students, and the response was terrific. We hope to spread our empowerment message to more young women across the country and encourage them to develop a dynamic career in IT. "As a company, we create opportunities for women to balance their personal and professional lives, through flexible working hours, work-from-home options and the on-site crche for the children of MillenniumIT employees''. "As an industry, ICT is the fourth largest contributor towards our country's GDP but very few women are involved in it. So it's essential that we do something to change this. Last year, Google became the first tech company to release its diversity statistics and many other big names such as Facebook, Yahoo, LinkedIn, etc., followed suit. With only one in three employees being women in most of these companies the lack of diversity in the IT has become a global issue", FITIS Chairman Chinthaka Wijewickrama said .

ISRAEL: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus dog was behind bars Saturday after biting a lawmaker and a Cabinet ministers husband during an event to mark the Hanukkah Jewish holiday.
Last night we lit the fifth Hanukkah candle with all the family present before we were sadly obliged to send Kaiya to quarantine as required by law, Netanyahu wrote Friday in a Facebook post reported by media Saturday.
The premier said the experience brought home to him flaws incompatible with logic and compassion in Israels public health regulations, which mandate that dogs who bite, even if they have received all the necessary inoculations, be confined for 10 days. The mixed-breed bitch was adopted by the Netanyahus from an animal shelter in July.
Kaiya nipped lawmaker Sharren Haskel from the prime ministers Likud party as well as the husband of Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely during a festive candle-lighting ceremony on Wednesday night.
Neither was badly hurt during the event at the premiers official Jerusalem residence.
Netanyahu tweeted a photo of himself and his new dog in August. How much light Kaiya brought into our home! he wrote of the 10-year-old. If you want a canine, find an adult dog to rescue. You wont regret it!

He made these observations joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget Proposal for fiscal year 2016 under the financial head of Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry on Saturday.
When we took over the government in January, there was an infamous and dark era for the mass media, Minister Karunatileka said. I am very pleased to speak at the wake of an era when total media freedom is guaranteed where nobody can claim of an incident of a single media personnel being murdered, being abducted by a white van, shaved forcibly, assaulted physically, fleeing from the country for protection, intimidated by phone or a media institution being set on fire.
He said the government established after January 8 has brought media freedom and media personnel who fled the country were returning.
The minister said journalists have the freedom even to criticise the government and government members without fear.
I would like to speak of the government media, Minister Karunatileka said.Even though some persons deliberately attempt to forget the government media, I would like to speak about them as they were highly politicised. They became trumpets of the government. They became institutions that criticised the opposition vehemently yet baselessly.
He added that these media institutions had not only economically failed but had also been rejected by the public.
Our concentration has been drawn to the welfare of media personnel, Minister Karunatileka said. As a person who has been the media spokesman for a main political party in the country for more than 10 years, I know the dreams of media personnel. I have a dream to fulfill those dreams of media personnel. I know they have housing problems. Some media personnel live in a temple, church, boarding or a rented house.
The minister said a proposal for plots of lands was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers. The surveys on those plots are underway. Measures have been taken to grant a motorcycle at a relief price, he said.
He added that 2,000 media personnel qualified for this facility and they will be given motorcycles before the end of the year.
The loan scheme given to media personnel engaged in higher education will be continued. One hundred fifty of this group, which is a section would be given this loan facility on December 18, Minister Karunatileka said. The Right to Information Bill was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The same will be presented to Parliament at the wake of next year.
The minister said the golden era of Lake House was during 2001-2004.
He added that the UNP handed over the same to the incumbent government with savings of Rs. 289 million.
Karunatileka added that the same was returned with loans and bank OD of Rs. 800 million.
The new Chairman is taking efforts to enhance the economic situation of Lake House. Since January this year, the loans and OD has been reduced to Rs. 450 million, the minister said.
Cricket telecast on Rupavahini was given to CSN for fatherly love. However I submitted a Cabinet paper to grant the same back to Rupavahini, Minister Karunatileka said.
Rupavahini is gaining momentum now due to its balance news coverage. It gives equal opportunities to all political parties now.
He said ITN considered to be the family channel had turned unfortunately to be a Channel of One Family.
He added that equal advertisement opportunities were given to all political parties during the election period.
The minister added that SLBC was also becoming the heart of the nation.
We could make all these achievements as we could get all these institutions rid of political intervention, Minister Karunatileka said. I have been in Parliament for 15 years. Nobody can claim that I have been involved in corruption. We are clean and ready to leave everything when we quit.
He said everything with regard to the Government Press was coming back to normal.
The minister added that the media reported that the COPE report of the previous regime revealed about corruption in the Government Press.
Parliament reforms come under me. You can see various reforms in the near future. The funds and facilities for Members are to be increased. The members staff will be provided training, Minister Karunatileka said.
The former Media Minister has not been able to join the debate. I feel sorry for that.
He said a house was set up for a journalist who crushed to death by an elephant. His house was provided with furniture by the Bauddya Channel, the minister said
He added that this government was free from corruption.

Electricity for all Sri Lankans soon - Siyambalapitiya
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in Parliament on Saturday that the government aims to provide electricity to all Sri Lankans in due course.
We hope to provide an uninterrupted 24 hour electricity supply augmented by renewable energy generation, Minister Siyambalapitiya said, joining the committee stage debate of the budget under financial heads of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry and the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
We are proud to say that Sri Lanka is the only country in South Asia with a 24-hour uninterrupted supply of electricity. Electricity supply to households is over 98 percent and there are 150,000 households yet to be connected to the national grid. These households will be provided with electricity by next January, he said.
The minister said on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, all government institutions have been requested to save 10 percent of their electricity consumption following a better electricity conservation plan and then conduct a proper valuation of power conversation.
The CEB expects to earn an income of Rs. 15,000 million at the end of this year following the power saving programmes. We are keen on generating power from renewable energy sources in a manner that had a minimal impact on the environment, he said.
Formulate systematic programme to meet rural communities energy needs - Pavithra
UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi said amendments were brought to the Electricity Act during her time to provide loan facilities to the poor to get electricity at nominal rates.
Under this project, people of low income groups were able to get electricity connections on an easy payment system. A systematic programme should be formulated to meet energy needs of rural communities living in off-grid areas of the country, she said.
Energy sector should be controlled only by govt - Anura Kumara
DNA MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in a country like ours the energy sector should be controlled by only the government.
The sole right to import tar was held by the CPC until now. But, this budget has removed that monopoly. We are against it. There is a move to entirely take away the energy sector from the government, he said.
No profits at CPC due to hedging deals - Yapa
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said the former government did not increase the prices of fuel even though the fuel prices in the world market were increased on several occasions.
This issue resulted in a loss to the CPC. The loss incurred by the CPC also largely increased due to providing the CEB fuel stocks at concessionary prices to generate electricity. The CPC would have earned profits, if it has not lost money through hedging deals, he said.
Sub-standard petrol imported during previous regime - Gayantha
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said when the corrupt Rajapaksa regime swindled money from the oil business even when oil prices fell record low in the world market depriving the people of the opportunity to get fuel at cheaper rates.
Even though the Supreme Court ordered to reduce petrol prices by Rs. 100, the former government refused to do so.
The CPC suffered a Rs. 600 million loss due to the corrupt hedging deal. The sub-standard petrol imported into the country by the previous government also resulted in engine failure and required replacement of costly pumps and injectors.
Hundreds of vehicle owners and petrol station managers suffered loses as a result of low quality petrol being released to the market, he said.
The government suffered a huge loss due to these reasons. We revived the institution which incurred heavy loses. But, we have been able to reduce the fuel prices and gave relief to the people several times after the new government came into power, the minister said.
Lanka looking to increase installed renewable energy capacity - Ajith
Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera said Sri Lanka is looking to increase the installed renewable energy capacity over the next two decades, as the countrys power regulator draws up a new long-term policy.
The CEB plans to increase the renewable energy capacity to 972 MW by 2020, which would contribute 20 percent to the total power generation in the country. Renewable energy share in power generation is expected to peak in 2025 at 21.4 percent with an installed capacity of 1,367 MW.
Corruption at CPC during previous regime - Anoma
Deputy Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Anoma Gamage said corruption and malpractices had risen to unimaginable heights in the CPC during the former regime.
We will create an environment where the CPC will be free of corruption political influence, she said.

Previous govt.s infamous rule reflected by media behaviour - Paranavithana
The dictatorial, indiscipline and infamous rule of the previous government were reflected by the behaviour of the media, said Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana in Parliament on Saturday.
He said the same situation was subjected to a drastic change within few weeks of the historic change they brought about in January this year.
He made these observations yesterday joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget Proposal for fiscal year 2016 under the financial head of Mass Media and and Parliamentary Affairs Ministry.
Paranavithana said Editor Lasantha Wickramathunga was murdered in a high security zone. Ekneligoda disappeared while Poddala Jayantha was assaulted. Many journalists fled from the country, he said.
Some ministers rushed to media institutions and created pandemonium by assaulting employees, the deputy minister said. There was media suppression in various ways. We have passed a period even when private media institutions were influenced by dictatorial rule.
He added that the responsibility of the Mass Media Ministry is to develop mass media in the country as an industry while protecting the media freedom. The Mass Media Ministry has plans to commence digitalisation of the Film Corporation as well as the Mass Media Ministry by next year, Deputy Minister Paranavithana said.
He added this project is expected to be completed in 2017.

Lubricant oil to be produced locally - Chandima
The government is taking measures produce lubricant oil locally to save enormous amount of money flowing out of the country, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody.
He said lubricant oil production will be commenced soon after Cabinet approval is granted for the project.
He made these observations in Parliament on Saturday in response to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana for an oral answer.
Minister Weerakkody said tar is also to be manufactured, when the refinery is renovated and its operation commenced.
Queried by MP Pathirana, the minister said that tar had not been imported by a private company since January this year.

Port City to create regional business hub

The recently released Supplementary Environmental Impact Report (SEIA) for the Colombo Port City (CPC) project says the main objective of the CPC is to create a regional business hub - a distinctly branded city, with high quality public spaces and infrastructure facilities, which would attract local and international developers and investors.
The ultimate goal is to establish the city as a centre for finance, tourism, shopping and entertainment, attracting new investments and new buyers of real estate and tourists who will spend more money and entrepreneurs who will invest in new businesses in Sri Lanka.
The SEIA says that the structural changes of the economy over the past ten years indicate the dominance of service sector economic activities, particularly in the areas of tourism, ICT, ports and shipping, retail, transport and financial services. The report states that the CPC has the capacity to contribute towards service sector oriented growth and development by attracting high profile FDIs and generating a wide range of direct and indirect benefits to the national economy.
The project, which is to be implemented over a 25-year period,does not involve replacing any economic activities in the area of its location or its immediate neighbourhood. Thus, the benefit generated by the entire reclaimed land becomes an additional asset to Sri Lanka as a result of a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
According to an integrated master plan which is to be developed, the development of the CPC will create a significant amount of additional oceanfront land thus providing opportunities for expansion of Colombos Central Business District (CBD).
Further, through planned development, the government of Sri Lankan will be able to envision part of its objectives outlined in the Regional Structure Planof2004 (theCESMA Plan), without the burden of spending state resources.
Additionally, the oceanfront land within CBDs emerging business cities would encourage finance, commerce and residential living within close proximity to each other. The CPC project therefore creates new land that will generate economic returns to the government, the investor, the city and the country as a whole.
The positive impacts of the project include employment creation, enhanced foreign investment, positive revenue generation to the government, transfer of technology and value added contribution to the national economy. Once the physical, socio economic and environmental impacts of the CPC are identified and quantified, the next step of analysis is to monetize these impacts with economic prices.
The report further states that the proposed CPC has the capacity to significantly contribute to the economic well being of the Colombo city and the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR). The long term employment figures include jobs generated at the CPC and multinational firms, jobs supporting local purchases made by local and foreign employees within CPC and firms that provide services to the CPC companies including office supplies and equipment, utilities, communications and professional services.
The CPC project has the potential to generate a wide range of indirect socio economic benefits such as high profile FDI which will thereby create direct employment mainly for professional and technical occupations in areas such as Information Communication Technology (ICT), banking, fund management, investment banking, real estate, and retail and tourism sub sectors.
The employees of these occupational groups are expected to be well paid and have the capacity to create indirect employment in the national economy due to high disposable income. Additionally, the project has the capacity to attract high profile FDI particularly for high value added service sector investments and headquarters of export manufacturing establishments. The immediate impact of such investments would be an increase in GDP and also an increase in foreign exchange earnings.
In addition to job creation, other long term outcomes include fostering modern management practices in various fields that will upgrade the living standards of Colombo. Through the utilization of world class residential spaces, the project will also extend socio economic benefits.
Additional economic benefits include an increase in higher paying jobs related to international trade and the movement of greater amounts of imports and exports through the Colombo Port.

## Title: Predictions on future supply chain in healthcare

Predictions on future supply chain in healthcare

At the start of every year, markets are inundated with predictions about what to expect in the year ahead.
Traditionally, these predictions encompass the coming 365 days. Interesting information for sure, but for an industry like healthcare in the midst of major change, we need to be thinking 10-to-20 years in the future - when healthcare will look very different than it does today. That is the reality we need to be making deliberate steps to move toward.
The healthcare industry has been subject to basic cost-cutting initiatives for some time now. But with the advent of reform and the need to make the industry more sustainable, we still have a long way to go. As healthcare tries to find new and innovative ways to cut costs, while also removing waste and improving patient care, the supply chain will play a pivotal role in this transformation.
In conversations with executives from providers and suppliers across the country, we've taken a long, hard look at supply chain's role in the future of healthcare. What we learned was fascinating. These discussions clearly illustrated how the value derived from the supply chain will be instrumental in getting healthcare to where it needs to be.
The following are eight predictions from those conversations with healthcare providers and suppliers.
1 . The Supply Chain of the Future Will Be a Goldmine of Data: The value of clean, accurate data is undisputed, but many healthcare organizations have a long way to go to realize data's full potential. The data coming from the supply chain will not only be transaction-focused, but also be used business-wide. The supply chain will sit on a goldmine of outcomes data that will be used to make better decisions for patient care. As more data is collected, every department within an organization will have an unprecedented understanding of where there is real value.
2 . The Supply Chain of the Future Will Be Part of the C-suite: Thanks to the value realized across the organization, the supply chain of the future will have a more prominent seat in the C-suite and be a linchpin in projects across different areas of the business.
3 . The Supply Chain of the Future Will Lead the Standardization of Care: One of the most significant ways healthcare will become sustainable is by focusing on the standardization of care, particularly consistency from a patient perspective. The supply chain of the future will support and guide this change, as it will sit on valuable data that can help determine not only the best price, but also the best outcomes, which will help change long-standing, inefficient processes.
4. The Supply Chain of the Future Will Be in Lockstep with Clinicians: The supply chain of the future will be clinically integrated. Physicians, recognizing the need to adjust their processes for the greater good of patients, will look to the supply chain for guidance, support and knowledge on product price points, outcomes, and alternatives. In turn, supply chain professionals will gain clinician trust by demonstrating the value the supply chain can deliver. Supply chain and clinicians will meet regularly to ensure continuous improvements and share ideas.
5. The Supply Chain of the Future will be predictive in nature: The supply chain will not only be used to make better decisions, but also for predictive analytics. To be fluid and fast in getting products to clinicians, supply chain professionals will use data to better anticipate what will be needed, and not falter or lose speed if a product is discontinued or back ordered.
6 . The Supply Chain of the Future Will Be Based on Strong Trading Partner Relationships: For years, healthcare trading partners have talked about creating more transparent and communicative relationships with each other, but few have actually done it. In the future, providers and suppliers will work toward the mutual goal of improved patient care and find ways to better align incentives to succeed.
7 . The Supply Chain of the Future Will Expand to Wherever the Patient Goes: The supply chain will no longer solely reside within the in-patient/out-patient facility, but rather expand to wherever the patient is physically located. This is due to greater consolidation and collaboration among health systems, as well as because reducing patient-readmission rates has become more critical with the advent of healthcare reform.
8 . The Supply Chain of the Future Will Adapt to Personalized Medicine/Informed Consumers: With disruptive technologies on the horizon like 3D printers and improved imaging and diagnostics, the supply chain will adapt with new manufacturing and buying processes around personalized medicine. This is also the case with more connected healthcare consumers, who are increasingly researching the best hospitals and products for them. The supply chain of the future will eventually allow consumers to shop for products and implants like they do online or at a brick-and-mortar store.
The healthcare supply chain must be the foundation for creating long-term industry viability and ensuring quality patient care. Some forward-thinking providers and suppliers are even working to get their supply chain to this point today - and a few are very close.
The only way to realize the opportunity is to take steps forward to make it a reality. Today's challenges are tomorrow's transformations.
The supply chain of the future begins today by prioritizing integration to enable inoperability of systems; clean normalized data; and the use of analytics and improved decision making based upon this data. Here's to the next decade of supply chain innovation it will be an exciting ride!
