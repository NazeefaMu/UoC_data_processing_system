CMC stops collecting non-segregated waste
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday, announced that it will stop collecting non-segregated waste within the municipal limits.
CMC acting Commissioner Lalith Wickramaratne issuing a press statement, said legal action will be taken against those who litter the streets reminding that it is illegal.
He pointed out the majority of people are now accustomed to segregate garbage, but a section of people who commute to the city still have the bad habit of throwing them at roadsides without segregating.
Awareness campaigns were held with the support of the Environment Police Unit and the Army to control this issue.The CMC cleared the non-segregated waste on roadsides over the past months to keep the city clean. However, as the Kerawalapitiya waste disposal site managed by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation has decided not to accept non-segregated waste, the CMC is faced with the issue of disposing non-segregated waste.Therefore we urge the public to hand over the waste to the CMC garbage trucks after properly segregating them. Do not throw non-segregated waste on roadsides too, the acting Commissioner said.
The segregation of waste was made compulsory when a garbage collection crisis emerged following the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump.

Country back to normal - Minister
The current situation in the country has been resolved 99 percent. No incidents have been reported during the past few days and investigations are underway, said Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara addressing the media yesterday. Once we receive the investigation report, we will be able to comment further.
With regard to the blocking of social media, he said a large percentage of the people using social media were using it for their business purposes or some others for studies. Only around one percent of social media users were engaged in spreading malicious content that arouses racial tensions.
He noted that during the recent past, considering the racially abusive content being shared on social media, the country came into disrepute internationally for treating the minority races badly. Therefore, we had no choice but to resort to such drastic measures as to block social media to prevent this situation. As a country we needed to take these measures to indicate that we treat all racial denominations equally and respect them equally. We had to impose curfew and a state of Emergency, he noted.
However, he said, having lifted the curfew, the government does not intend to continue the state of Emergency and hopes things will return to normal soon. Based on the recommendations of the security forces, the President will take a decision on lifting the state of Emergency and lifting the ban on social media, he said.
The new Law and Order Minister however said that as the minister, he has a set of responsibilities, while the IGP has his set of responsibilities. We need to decide on how the Police Commission needs to function and the minister needs to function.
If one feels the Police Commission can handle all matters, then there is no need for a minister and secretary. But there is a small issue with regard to the functions of the Police Commission and the minister and we need to resolve this, the minister said in response to a question raised by the media about the functions of the Police Commission.

Delegate Law and Order to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka
Law and order, I believe, is the single most important factor that ensures the proper operation of democracy. Corruption, indiscipline and disruption of day-to-day functions have now reached intolerable levels. We are all completely aware of the parliament's (except for a very few members) conspiracy against the people of this country. There are only a very few who can be described as educated and gentlemen.
How can the government justify the misery it has brought upon all peace-loving citizens May be their greed for luxury vehicles and extravagant sensuous living at the expense of the citizens, are their priorities. An honest, fearless and efficient person is needed to ensure that legal action against white collar criminals operates as it should, and to eliminate corruption and general social indiscipline.
There is hardly a better-qualified person than Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to whom this task can be entrusted. That is from the point of view of the majority of honest hard working citizens. The guilty, may, of course, have a different view.

The report running to 814 pages provides a general review of the electoral system in Sri Lanka, details of the delimitation process, demarcation of electorates, boundary Schedule of electorates and key issues highlighted by the stakeholders, including representation of minorities, multi-member electorates, naming of electorates and adequacy of the number of members.
The five-member committee headed by retired Surveyor General Kanagaratnam Thavalingam, retired Assistant Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Anila Dias Bandaranaike, Prof. S.H. Hisbullah, Prof. Sangara Wijeyasandiran and retired Assistant Election Commissioner Premathilaka Siriwardena presented its report to the Minister on February 19.

Fellowship  bond so close
A fierce and unyielding competitor on the field and a perfect gentleman off the field, Head Boy of S. Thomas Preparatory School Dimitri Jayawardena is ready to face any challenge. Perfect Prefects features Jayawardena a leader with a conscience.
You can play your heart out on the field and get angry with each other. But when you are off the field, you need to forget what happened on the field and act as brothers. Sometimes in Rugger, there are fights, but when the whistle is blown and the match is ended, you shake hands and hug and act like brothers. That bond is created, elucidated Jayawardena.
Jayawardenas skills are impressive. He has tried his hand at many sports, excelling in Rugger. In fact, he is an all-rounder when it comes to sports. And it is not only in sports that he excels. When it comes to other activities at school he has proved his capability and aptitude.
Under 14 Captain
When in Grade 2, he started Basketball and did that for about two years and stopped. Then he played cricket from Grade 4  9. During that time he started Rugby in Grade 6. When in Grade 8 he had the opportunity of captaining the under 14 team. Because of this Cricket and Rugger clashed, so he decided to let go of cricket and continue with Rugger. He also did Badminton and Swimming. He had to let go of the other sports as Rugger is time-consuming. So until now, the sport that stuck with him has been Rugger. He got to captain the under 14 team in Grade 8 and the Under 16 team last year and this year they will be playing the under 20 league. He played Under Rugger 12, 13, 14, 16 and currently under 18.
Currently, he is the Secretary of the Interact Club. Last year he was the secretary of the Student Christian Movement and he is also a debater. He is also the editor of the school newspaper. He has been doing scouting since grade 6 and is currently the acting troop leader. He has also done Speech and Drama. In doing speech and drama he learnt how to speak and carry himself in front of people.
Rugger and Cricket have taught me how to play with the team and be with the teammates. It taught me how to accept victory and defeat in the same way. I have also tried individual sports in addition to team sports. I know what glory is and what it feels like, but we have faced defeat as well and that too has been a learning experience. Since we played and did everything as a team that helped me to really bond with people, so when you go out into society you know how to associate with different types of people, said Jayawardena.
Jayawardena pointed out that the problem is that people do not understand each other well enough. They look only from one point of view. They dont have a broader view of society and do not consider the other ones point of view.
In unity
In society, we get people from all walks of life, different religious backgrounds and different cultures. My experience at STC Prep has taught me to respect people for who they are. You cannot change someone the way you like. They are the way they are and you need to respect and accept them. You need to live with them in unity and harmony.
At Prep we have all religions and walks of life. Getting the opportunity as Head Prefect to lead the school which has a diverse society has helped me understand people better, stated Jayawardena.
Jayawardena is a gentleman and understands the need for privacy. He knows that there is a line that must not be crossed. In other words, he is sensitive towards others feelings.
I have also learnt not to walk into others personal lives. You need to know where to draw the line and understand that each person has their own boundaries. You need to respect that and not overstep those boundaries. When you step over these boundaries that is when the problem starts. You have to keep your distance and at the same time associate with them closely. Basically, you need to know where to draw the line and live harmoniously, pointed out Jayawardena.
Doing sports has given Jayawardena a sense of equanimity and composure. A certain level-headedness and self Doing sports you need to be able to accept victory and defeat. I was not that great a swimmer and a badminton player. I used to lose a lot. But from what I learnt that winning is not the only thing and glory is not the only thing. There are times you get defeated and there are people better than you. It teaches you that you are not the greatest in society and there are always people better than you. You have to understand there is always someone better than you. There is always someone one step ahead of you. You need to compete with them in a friendly manner. Not in an aggressive and selfish way, said Jayawardena.
Privileged individual
Jayawardena says that you need to know how to associate with different types of people, it may be an underprivileged individual or it may be the president. You should not corner people in society just because of their status. Yes, there may be a hierarchy but you need to show the same politeness to anyone.
It is not a good feeling when you have pushed away to the side. You need to have that empathy and understand that we all have emotions and feelings. Everyone around you is human. You need to help them and not deprive them of their opportunities. I want people to be treated equally in society and that their rights are not undermined. I would not want to be shunned as a person who no one wants to associate with, stated Jayawardena.
It is not possible for one person to solve all these issues. But even a tiny change can make a huge impact on society.
This year I will be doing my O/Ls and next year I will be moving onto St. Thomas Mount Lavinia. So I will either follow the Commerce stream or the Arts stream. I am keeping my options open for a career. In my chosen career I want to make an impact on society and help change society for the betterment of the people. This is not for personal glory because I want to help people. One person cannot do this alone. But at least if you help one person it impacts that person in a positive way, said Jayawardena.
Today you find people trying to change society for their personal benefit. By doing that there is so much corruption. This is because they only want to achieve their personal goals. Each and every person in social matters. You are not the only one that matters. Each and every life matters.
Heightened patriotism
I might go abroad for higher studies but I definitely will come back to Sri Lanka because I love my country. And there is no other country like Sri Lanka. So I have that patriotism within me. So I am definitely sure that I will come back to Sri Lanka. There are people in society who are very capable, but maybe because they do not have the right connections their talents are all wasted. In Sri Lanka, there is youth who can make a huge impact. But they dont have the opportunity to shine and show their true colours. If they come up we can benefit tremendously, explained Jayawardena.
Leadership is not a change of Lifestyle, it is for the common good of everyone. You cant simply change your personality once you become a Head Prefect. The person you were when appointed must be that same person who finally gives the badge up one day.
When you are a leader, you are not there only for the name. There are a lot of responsibilities that come with it. When some people get the leadership they try and change who they are and become someone they are not. I dont want to change my personality, I just wish to develop my talents. So then I can help people in a bigger way. So what I want to tell young people is that once you get the leadership you should not change who you are. You should be who you are. In society, there are many opportunities to get leadership. You get it based on your talents. Each and every one of us has some talent. So you have to work hard and show your talents. They should have respect, empathy and know their virtues.
Those are what matter a lot. You should learn to respect a person. Even if a person is under you, you should know how to respect that person. You should listen to what he is saying. You should be a listener and someone who takes action as well. You need to again have respect and empathy, explained Jayawardena.
We are blessed to have our lives. But there are others who are less fortunate. They do not get to experience what we have. We have gone to fine schools and come from good families. But there are those who do not receive all the love and affection that we receive. At least we can share a bit of that with society, making others feel happy
Loving kindness
If I can make one person happy that makes my day. I am thankful to my parents for sending me to STC Prep. It has been the best part of my life. This school has taught me a lot. Almost everything I have learnt is from this school. So my values are from my school and parents. My teachers have been very loving and kind. They helped bring out my talents and helped me develop as a leader. At STC Prep you get leadership at a very young age. Because after O/Ls you leave Prep.
It is a very small school community. The experiences and lessons you learn in school are immense. One obstacle I face is balancing out all the sports, extracurricular activities and sports at the same time. One way I learn to manage all this is by looking at my sister, the way she manages all her activities, her too being a prefect, pointed out Jayawardena.
I want to thank my Head Master Revd. Dushantha Rodrigo and our past Head Master N.Y. Cassiechetty. Discipline is at a very high standard at STC Prep. STC prep is an excellent place to develop your hidden talents.
I also have a strong love for reading which was instilled in me from my young days by my mother.

Finger piercing instead  of wearing a wedding ring
How people choose to show their commitment to someone else is evolving. You can say it with diamonds. Or you can say it with a massive gnarly finger piercing.
Whilst your bony digits may seem like the last body part youd get pierced, having the lower part of your finger pierced is now a trend which is catching on.
A graphic clip, shared by Cultura Colectiva + , shows people getting their fingers pierced.
Given that its not for the faint-hearted, videos of people having this done have, unsurprisingly, split opinion.
Plenty of viewers were left feeling a little queasy by the process.
Ouch! Hell no! Ive been engaged for 1 month, one response read.
I have hit my hand off of things at least once a day...hat would hurt like a mother...
Another weighed in with: That is just DISGUSTING. Why would anyone want to pierce their hand or finger
Oh well thats just waiting for infection, being ripped off, getting stuck on something, hey their problem, theyre ones who will be crying, pointed out someone else.
But, the internet is a graphic, disgusting place at the best of times, with the bar getting constantly raised higher.
So while there were certainly people who didnt like the idea of a finger piercing, there were others who were OK with it.
I liked it, one woman added, everyone to their own I say and Im in my 50s, sometimes I think us old farts are more open minded lol.
It remains to be seen whether this catches on or not.
Wonder if Harry and Meghan could be tempted into sealing their marriage this way

Form national policy for social media networks-Dr Kankanamge
The government should form a national policy on social media networks by taking into consideration the views of the general public, said Chairman, Sri Lanka Trade Development Council and Founder President, Colombo Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Amila Kankanamge.
Our observations revealed a serious delay in the maneuvering of government and security forces in controlling and suppressing the recent chaotic situation in the Kandy administrative region. The violent uproars and unanticipated behavior of users on social media platforms escalated the existing crisis to a more intense one, he added.
We believe the decision taken by the government to temporarily suspend all social media activity is timely as it led to the mitigation of further violence triggered by aggressive extremist ideas shared on all social media platforms.
We express our appreciation for the measures taken by the government.
In proceeding, we propose to advance the positive outcome achieved by the Government in this scenario to a more dignified platform by taking action to eradicate the current ban on social media, under strict supervision.
Meanwhile Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment, Harin Fernando has indicated that the restriction on social media and messaging platforms will most probably be lifted by this Friday .

Galle Lovers Quarrel expects a close battle
Richmond-Mahinda annual cricket encounter fondly known among the cricket enthusiasts as 'Galle Lovers Quarrel' will be played for the 113th consecutive year on March 16 and 17 at Galle International Cricket Stadium.
It is one of the longest cricket match series in Sri Lanka which was begun in 1905, under the two principals Rev. James Horne Darrel of Richmond College and Frank Lee Woodward of Mahinda College.

After a 45-year-long unsuccessful trait, Richmondites also registered a win by an innings over Mahindians in the 2014 encounter and continued to a second consecutive win by an innings in 2015.

Dananjaya Lakshan who represents Sri Lankas U-19 national team captains the Richmond squadron. He has amassed a total of 407 runs that included one century together with three half tons. Another star player of Richmond side is Sri Lanka U-19 skipper Kamidu Mendis who has ensued a aggregate of 507 which includes four centuries. Avindu Theekshana who has gathered 41 wickets and 384 runs to his credit during the season is the vice captain of the Richmond team.
Mahindians have registered seven out right victories against Matara Saint Thomas, Colombo Sahira, Kurunegala Maliyadeva, Kandy Saint Silvester, Kandana Mazenod, Colombo Lumbini and Pannipitiya Dhammapala in 17 games played so far during the season with seven first innings wins including three drawn games.

GKN faces new 8.1bn Melrose  bid in takeover battle
Turnaround specialist Melrose has increased its offer for UK engineering giant GKN from 7.4bn to 8.1bn.
GKN makes parts for Boeing 737 jets and Black Hawk helicopters, as well as parts for Volkswagen and Ford cars.It has fought hard against the bid, offering to give back 2.5bn to shareholders and agreed to merge its car unit with US company Dana.
The takeover battle has also entered the political arena, with some MPs calling for the bid to be blocked.
GKN employs more than 59,000 people, 6,000 in the UK alone. It became a takeover target after it issued profit warnings late last year.
Melrose said all recent attempts to engage in constructive discussions with GKN had been blocked. It added that its latest offer was final and would not be increased under any circumstances.
It is now offering 467p a share, compared with Fridays closing share price of 435p. Melrose is also offering to give shareholders 1.4bn in cash as part of its offer.
It has also raised the amount GKN shareholders would own in Melrose following the deal from 57% to 60%.
However, investors appeared unimpressed by the latest move. Shares were up less than 2% in early trading at 444p.
Rebecca OKeeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: The muted market reaction... is the strongest indication yet that Melrose might not get its way.
The robust efforts GKN has taken to protect itself from the hostile bid, including the proposed disposal of its Driveline business to Dana, combined with the comments from Melrose that their offer will not be increased under any circumstances is leading investors to conclude that GKN has won this battle, at least for now.
GKN said it was evaluating the new bid and advised shareholders to take no action. It said it would provide a response in due course.

Avant - Garde corruption case:
Gotas revision petition fixed for support
A revision application filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seeking an order to stay the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court proceedings pertaining to the Avant-Garde corruption case, was yesterday fixed for support on March 22 by the Court of Appeal.
When the revision petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Pathman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the Counsel who appeared on behalf of the former Defence Secretary sought a further date to support the application.
Through this petition, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is also challenging the Colombo Chief Magistrates decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa regarding the Avant-Garde corruption case.
The Bribery Commission had filed a corruption case against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs. 11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when granting permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury.
In his revision petition, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has challenged the Chief Magistrates decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him and the Chief Magistrates decision to fix the matter for trial.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had also turned down a request made by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others that they be released from a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission over the Avant-Garde incident.
Rajapaksa is also seeking an order to set-aside the Colombo High Courts order dated February 2, 2018.

Hark Prince  Goodspeaker
The term Jataka is denoted as a story or collection of stories, about the Buddhas earlier incarnations. The orthodox Buddhist considers these tales to be autobiographical accounts of Gautama Buddha and hence a part of the Buddhist sacred writings and teachings passed down the centuries. They are also regarded as one of the oldest and most important collections of folktales extant. Though stated as five hundred and fifty, the entire collection consists 547 long and short tales.
The original Pali form of Jataka narratives (or Jataka Katha) is found written in various forms like dialogues, monologues, verses both prose and rhythmic. They also contain myth, legends, fairytales, maxims and sayings. All these go to introduce a resourceful collection of Jataka tales retold for the young and the old titled as Buddhist Tales for Young and Old (Volume One, Stories 1  50) Prince Goodspeaker.
Gift of truth
The publication is meant to be distributed free around the world especially for the English reading masses. The first 50 stories in the Jataka collection are retold in simple English by Todd Anderson and with an introduction by Venerable Kurunegoda Piyatissa Maha Thera of the Buddhist Literature Society, New York Buddhist Vihara, Kew Gardens, New York, USA. At the outset, it is stated that the material embedded in the publication could be freely copied and reprinted in order to encourage as a gift of truth.
This is indeed a commendable factor when one comes to think of the various types of copyright laws and regulations and the bonds interconnected as intellectual property rights. The reader of this well-illustrated compendium feels a sense of acquiring knowledge not only in the Buddhist teachings but also in the methods employed creatively in the dissemination process of knowledge.
Each Jataka tale as retold in the collection carries a moral at the end by way of an insight into the inner meaning of the narrative. For example, the first tale titled s Demons in the Desert (based on Apannaka Jataka in the main collection) revolves around a journey through the two merchants who knew each other find it difficult due to the obstacles. The first merchant journeys with 500 carts full of goods. They too carried water pots in order to quench their thirst before reaching an oasis. But the first merchant is encountered by a group of demons disguised as humans. They inform him that there is no necessity to carry water as it is in plenty. Not knowing that this is an advice of a demon he throws away the water pots. This happens to be an ignorant act. They become a prey to the disguised demons. Then the second merchant too journeys through the desert. He too goes with a group of friends in 500 carts full of goods.
Victims of disaster
They too encounter the disguised demons who declare them to discard the water pot brought in their carts. But as he, the chief merchant, was wise enough to think of the impending disaster, advised his group not to listen to the disguised demons. They enjoyed and crossed the desert using the water they brought. They were no longer the victims of the disaster. They too were vigilant.
Then they visualised the disaster that had cost the lives of his friend and his group of merchants who went in 500 carts prior to the journey. The tale comes to a close with the following words:
The next morning, the people ate breakfast and fed their bullocks as well. They added to their goods the most valuable things left from the first caravan. So they finished their journey very successfully and returned home safely so that they and their families could enjoy their profits.
The moral as laid down goes as follows: One must always be wise enough not be fooled by tricky talk and false appearances.
Enemies in friends clothing
The reader of the tale perceived the notion that the entire narrative is symbolic. The waterless desert is the social milieu where the man struggles to exist. The demon who comes in disguise and request the merchant to discard the water ports are the cunning people who appear and pretend to be friends. But in actual reality, they are enemies in the guise of friends. If this notion is well realised and act wisely a good human being can live happily.The tale in many ways resembles a modern short story in many ways. It could be interpreted in many more ways depending on the point of view one takes to look at the central experience as embedded. Thus an age-old tale can be both spiritual and modern.
The introduction by the Maha Thera points out: It is a pleasure to rewrite the Jataka stories in modern English understandable by the western reader. To achieve this goal, the stories are being retold in order to convey the spirit and meaning. They are not word for word translations as have been done prior to this attempt by many others inclusive of the work by Cowell and Fausboll. The Jataka stories as readers in Sri Lank know came to be translated from Pali to Sinhalese in the 14th Century. This translation gave way to many other creations like the folk ballad or Kavi Katha which in turn came to be recreated as folk plays and later on as folk ballets. Most events as uncovered in Jataka tales have given way to temple paintings and the erection of pandals (or thorana).
The bhikkhus who re-narrate Jataka tales were known by the term bhanakas. This work is an attempt to rewind the reader on several other social ideologies such as the value of perseverance, the disaster caused by greed and plunder, the need to be diligent and the need for gratitude the power of the truthfulness the joys of the spiritual life, the value of the wise leadership, the value of justice the power of friendship, the need for better advice, respect for elders etc.
The inherent power of the age-old creative wisdom is taught to the modern reader. All in all, this, though a free distributed collection of tales, is nevertheless an invaluable gift for all times to the entire world. Though Jataka tales have been translated and rewritten by many hands, this attempt could be regarded an everlasting classic for all times. This too transcends the narrow barriers of a mere gift of dana. The work is well illustrated in keeping with the contents.

The IAEA is an independent intergovernmental science and technologybased organisation established in 1957 in the United Nations family, that serves as the global focal point for nuclear cooperation and assists its member states in the context of social and economic goals.
Sri Lanka receives technical assistance through the IAEA Technical Cooperation programme in order to develop nuclear science and technology in the country.
The Technical Cooperation (TC) programme is the IAEAs major mechanism for transferring nuclear technology to member states. This programme builds capacities to support the peaceful application of nuclear science and technology, helping member states to address key development priorities in areas such as human health and nutrition, food and agriculture, water resource management and the environment, industrial applications, etc.
Sri Lanka utilises peaceful applications of nuclear technology only in non-power areas and the country was able to obtain considerable amount of technical assistance from the IAEA in the past past.
Establishment of several nationally important scientific institutes such as Sri Lanka Gamma Centre, National Centre for Non-Destructive Testing, Nuclear Medicine Unit at University of Peradeniya, etc. and provision of many training opportunities for Sri Lankan scientists, medical doctors, engineers, medical physicists, etc., who are involved in the nuclear field were done through the assistance received from the IAEA.
Unique equipment and instruments used in nuclear field which cannot be purchased in the local market were provided to various institutes in Sri Lanka through the IAEA technical cooperation porgramme.
Sri Lanka also expects to obtain such technical assistance from the IAEA in future too in order to launch planned programmes which are to be implemented utilising nuclear technology in the country.

A specialty juice shop, JuiceMo was opened in Independence Walk, Kurunduwatta (behind Rupavahini Training School) last month.
According to co-founders, of the venture Nilmini and Gihan Dheerasekera (mother and son), they are hoping to open two more JuiceMo outlets in Bambalapitiya and Nugegoda this year.
Founder, Nilmini Dheerasekera said that the idea to launch JuiceMo was created when they were in Australia and she followed several programs and received special training in this regard.
We wanted to offer authentic fruit juices without any preservatives, coloring and chemicals and meet this objective, we acquire a special technology from Australia.
She said that for the first time they are also offering a Veggie Kottu with a special pan cake which is now gaining in popularity along with their non-alcoholic Blue Margarita. In addition 99% of our juices are minus sugar and this is very popular among foreigners who use the jogging track in the morning and evenings.
Instead on Sugar they use Australian Honey and all the fruits are mostly selected from rural areas where fruits are grown using organic methods.
Dheerasekera said that most of their clients are foreigners and Sri Lankans are slow to enjoy benefits of health drinks and still preferred to use carbonated drinks.
She said that due to its nice spacious lay out people think they are expensive but its not true as they have drinks stating as low as Rs. 150.
The JuiceMo open entire week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. could accommodate around 100 guests and they have also now introduced special take away packs as well.
We are now talking to travel agents to promote JuiceMo among foreigners who visit independence square.

Police had identified and raided an office run by the main suspect arrested in connection with the recent racial violence in Kandy and for spreading racially explicit propaganda through social media, Widanapathiranage Amith Jeevan Weerasinghe in the Nattaranpotha area in Kundasale early last morning.

Lokuge's take on Kandy riots
Strange and bizarre theories have been floated these days by members of the Joint Opposition in the immediate aftermath of the Kandy racial riots. Some like MP Udaya Gammanpila has placed the blame for the anti-Muslim attacks squarely at the doorstep of the government. His reasoning. The UNP leader wants a diversionary ploy in order to suppress the No Confidence Motion to be moved against him, in parliament. He is also of the view that the mayhem was also intended to take the gloss away from the pohottuwa's victory at the recent local government elections. Mahinda Rajapaksa is of the view that the Kandy mayhem is going to be used by the government to pass the proposed new constitution with a view to divide the country, at the behest of the western powers and the Tamil diaspora.
Not to be outdone, Gamini Lokuge is of the firm belief that incarcerating Intelligence officers of the police and military paved the way for the lack of feedback in order to give the government a forewarning as to what was in store. Speaking in parliament during the Adjournment debate on the Kandy riots, the onetime UNP heavyweight and now an obedient disciple of the Rajapaksas, said the government's ill advised move to lockup all the top notch Intelligence operatives was the chief reason for the conflagration, since this resulted in the breakdown of the entire Intelligence network in the country.
To the best of our knowledge there are no more than a couple of such operatives who are now being held for interrogation in connection with the murders of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga, Wasim Thajudeen et al. To suggest that the entire Intelligence apparatus had collapsed by the absence of a couple of officers, who, anyway are being arrested in terms of the law, is ridiculous, to say the least. Besides, these officers, no doubt, may have been replaced by others. In any event, the operative or two, who had been arrested, had long ceased to be in service and would have been out of the reckoning in any case. Lokuge, who is weeping buckets for the jailed Intelligence officers have overlooked the fact that one of these operatives was in charge of a military safe house, operated in the city, employing hit men tasked with carrying out killings and abductions of journalists.
It is also moot as to how efficient these officers would have been in disseminating vital information to the government given their past loyalties.
In any event, the efficiency of the of Chief of the Director of military Intelligence, handpicked by Mahinda Rajapaksa, was called into question by no less a personage than the former President himself when he (Intelligence Chief) had no clue about the impending defection of Maithripala Sirisena from the Rajapaksa Government, to be the Common Candidate. So much for Lokuge's faith in the penetrating power of the Intelligence sleuths currently being grilled for their complicity in crime.
True, Intelligence was found wanting in this instance and even minister Laskhman Kiriella has attributed this to be the main cause. But it is not due to the reasons adduced by MP Lokuge. There was no Intelligence forthcoming ahead of the Aluthgama incidents as well. Hence, the government ought to pay special attention to this extremely vital aspect of policing. Unlike in the past, when there were no complications in intelligence gathering, with today's communication expansion and tools such as social media, information can travel at lightning speed from one corner of the country to the other, making the job of intelligence officers that much difficult. Hence, like the government, is currently engaged in providing specialized training to officers in the detection of white collar crime, with all it labyrinthine aspects, the Intelligence services too should be updated and modernized to meet with the present day demands and challenges.
The right move
The decision taken by Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera to put a halt to haphazard setting up places of religious worship throughout the country, is a move in the right direction. The Minister said new laws were being drafted outlining the legal procedure governing the setting up places of worship, particularly taking into account the number of families belonging to that particular faith in the specific area concerned.
Speaking at a media conference, the Minister said; Hereafter no politicians or religious dignitaries would be allowed to set up places of worship in any place within country as per their personal choice or intentions. Regulations would be tightened to ensure peace and harmony among communities.
Events in recent times show that disputes arose mainly between the Buddhists and Muslims over the construction of mosques in temple property, and vice versa, as claimed by both sides, particularly in Ampara and Dambulla. These disputes have flared up into fully blown communal clashes. What is worse is to see Mosques been set on fire during such clashes with the images carried all over the world, including Arab countries. The Kandy riots saw a number of Mosques similarly destroyed that brought a blot on the country. The Minister's move could be one way of tackling this situation.

Majority of financial disputes due to indebtedness to salesmen
Nearly 70 percent of complaints regarding financial disputes referred to Mediation Boards for settlement are due to people of low-income families falling prey to institutions and persons offering credit, and household and other goods at their doorsteps for repayment on installment basis, it has been revealed.
This indebtedness among low-income groups adversely affected the country's economy, Mediation Boards Commission sources said.
The sources said the Commission planned to set up special Mediation Boards for the settlement of such financial disputes in the future.
This would be done after a thorough analysis of the financial disputes relating to low-income groups which had been ever increasing, sources added.
According to an initial survey, many people in the low-income groups had fallen into dire straits by obtaining credit and goods on repayment basis from institutions and persons visiting their doorsteps.

March 15, a blot in history
An important day in the Roman calendar. March fifteenth, a blot in her history.
And a day woefully reminding Christians some of the similarities that Shakespeare wrote on IDES OF MARCH that had a semblance on Good Friday when Jesus Christ breathed his last on the cross.
Shakespeare being a Christian obviously seized such happenings from the New Testament when he wrote The Ides of March in Julius Ceasar. As Jesus yielded his spirit, darkness fell across; the curtain in the Temple ripped apart. Graves opened to yield its ghosts who were seen walking in the streets. In open, a lioness whelped her cubs in the street.
When Shakespeare wrote in terms of the impending assassination of Caesar, little did he realize its impact on Good Friday that makes us Christians believe the forty days of repentance finally lead us to the month of March.
(Brutus in his orchard)
.. But it is doubtful yet,
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no:
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quiet from the main opinion he held once
of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigics.
The unaccustomed the terror of the night.
And the persuation of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol today..
(Ceaser's House)
Thunder and lightning prevail indication the horrors that await the Ides of March. Calpurnia's instinct fore-warn Ceasar after her restless night when in her dream she sees Ceaser murdered. Thrice she cried out for help But Ceasar has ears for her pleading.
 Ceasar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet, now they fright me. There is one within.
Besides the things we have seen and heard,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets,
And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead:
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war.
The noise of battle hurled in the air
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan..
(A street before the Capitol with Ceasar's senators making their
way to the Capitol, followed by the soothsayer)
. The Ides of March are come.
Aye Ceasar, but not gone.
Hail Ceasar, Read this schedule.
(They stab Ceasar. Casca strikes the first, Brutus the last blow)
ET TU BRUTE (Ceasar falls and die)
Mark Antony who had no part in the planned assassination of Ceasar, appears immediately to appease the restless crowds that had thronged the Capitol on hearing Ceaser's death and orates one of Shakespeare's famous dialogue delivery:-
 Friends, Romans countrymen. lend me your ears.
I come to bury Ceasar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do live after them:
So, let it be with Ceasar.
Brutus hath told you Cesar was ambitious..
If it were so, it was a grievous fault
And grievously hath Ceasar answer'd it
SYNOPSIS  
On a stormy night Cassius and Casca visit Brutus who must be won to the rebel party. He receives them and the other conspirators in his garden and Ceasar's murder is planned. He discusses all details. It is planned for the next morning. Portia, Brutus's wife observers their unrest. Next day, Brutus and Cassius pick up a quarrel in their camp at Sardis. Later Brutus learns that his wife, Portia has committed suicide in Rome. Cassius believe the final battle to have been lost, orders his servant to stab him, Brutus falls on his own sword which leaves Antony to speak the epitaph over his foe:
'This was the noblest Roman of them all All the conspirators save only he Did what they did in envy of great Caesar.

Mine free by 2020
Sri Lanka has come a long way in clearing the mines from the war affected areas after three decades of war. In fact Sri Lanka can be proud of their achievement in mine clearing in comparison to many other countries in the region that faced similar situations. Having already cleared over 90 percent of the mines in these areas and facilitated the people in those areas to engage in their day to day activities without fear of landmines, Sri Lanka only has around 27 Sq. Km left to complete the task of completely ridding the country of mines by 2020.
Prince Mired Al- Hussein praises SLs efforts
Recently, The Special Envoy on the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al- Hussein arrived in Sri Lanka on a three day visit from March 4 - 7 and visited the remaining mine clearance sites in Muhamalai.
The Special Envoy appreciating Sri Lankas commitment to clearing mine infested areas said he was very impressed by what he saw during his tour to Sri Lanka in terms of the measures and effort taken to clear the country of mines.
I was very impressed with my meeting with the President and the Minister of Rehabilitation and other officials. They have such a great sense of ownership regarding the land mine issue and the political will is extremely evident and the Sri Lankan government is very serious in carrying out the mine clearance activities, the Prince said congratulating Sri Lanka on the work carried out so far to rid the country of landmines and other explosives remnants left behind by the 30 years of war.
I am sure if you carry on with this fantastic approach, Sri Lanka will be very successful on the land mine issue, so bravo, bravo to everybody for doing such a great job, Prince Mired Raad said.
Mine clearance progress
By the end of the humanitarian operation, Sri Lanka was tasked with the challenge of clearing all affected areas of the country of landmines. According to the initial survey it was identified that approximately 2,064 square km was contaminated with mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW). However, the government took the initiative to implement a programme to rid the country of mines and in accordance, the National Mine Action Programme was initiated in 2002. The programme functioned according to the National Mine Action Standards (SLNMAS) which was formulated based on the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS).
Initially it was identified that approximately 2,064 sq. km was contaminated with mines and explosives remnants of war. Around 640 villages were affected by mines. However, the government commenced its mine clearance activities in 2002.
So far, all agencies involved in humanitarian demining have cleared 1,233.368 sq. km by the end of last December. Currently only around 27 sq. km is left to be cleared, which the government hopes to accomplish by 2020.
The Sri Lanka Army Humanitarian De-Mining Unit (SLA-HDU), Devlon Association for Social Harmony (DASH), Skavita Humanitarian Assistance and Relief Project (SHARP), Mine Advisory Group (MAG) and the Hazardous Area Life Support Organization (HALO Trust) demining agencies are currently engaged in the mine action process in the country. All agencies involved in demining have so far have cleared 1,233.368 sq km as of December 31, 2017 while 735,444 Anti personnel mines, 2,073 Anti tank mines and 556,385 explosive remnants of war have thus far been recovered.
Mine detection dogs
Meanwhile, the Marshall Legacy Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping mine-affected countries, has been assisting the Sri Lanka Army Humanitarian Demining Unit in its humanitarian effort to clear landmines and explosive devices from affected regions of the country.
To date, MLI has donated 30 highly trained Mine Detection Dogs to the Sri Lanka Armys Humanitarian Demining Unit. Most of the dogs have been sponsored by generous Americans as well as global citizens, including private foundations, families and schoolchildren; several have been sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, which has also provided crucial funding support to enable MLI to train the dogs and their handlers.
According to MLI selection criteria, SLA-HDU Mine detection Dog teams won the best MDD award three times in 2012, 2016 and 2017. For their years of excellent service and the strong bond between them, MDD Yankee and her handler Lance Corporal T. K. D. Rajapaksha of the Sri Lanka Army Engineers Humanitarian Demining Unit were presented the 2017 Dog Team of the Year award by MLI.
MDD Yankee served with the Sri Lanka Army Engineers Humanitarian Demining Unit for six years sniffing out mines and saving lives in mine-contaminated areas of Sri Lanka until retiring earlier this year. Together with her handler, she has cleared 62,680 square metres of mine-contaminated land.
Party to disarmament conventions
After the change in regime on January 8, 2015 Sri Lanka eventually became party to the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT) also known as the Ottawa Convention last December and at the end of February this year, Cabinet also took the decision to become party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM).
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News, the Coordinator of the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) Vidya Abhayagunawardena said this was a huge achievement for Sri Lanka.
This is the first time that a special envoy to the mine ban treaty has visited the country. In fact, Sri Lanka is a success story in mine clearance. We have the lowest rate of mine related incidents in the region compared to other countries such as Cambodia, Laos etc. Sri Lanka reported only two mine related incidents last year, having cleared 500 sq. km of mine infested area by the end of the war. Currently, Sri Lanka has just 27 sq. km left to be cleared, he noted.
The government also intends to complete mine clearance activities by 2020. If we can achieve that target, Sri Lanka would be the first country in the region to rid the country of mines completely.
Then, Sri Lanka would become Universal Ambassadors to the convention. Meanwhile, Cabinet last Tuesday took the decision to become party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. This year happens to be the 10 anniversary of the UN Convention on Cluster Munitions, he said.
During the war, the Military had used landmines as a defensive weapon while the LTTE used it as an offensive weapon. The army had laid mines during the war according to international patterns while the LTTE had randomly laid mines, making it harder to clear as it has to be done inch by inch. Each deminer is allocated one sq. metre to be demined at a time.
According to the Landmines and Cluster Munitions Monitor, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, commonly referred to as the Mine Ban Treaty, was adopted on September 18, 1997 and entered into force on March 1, 1999.
As of November 19, 2014, there were 162 States Parties to the treaty and the treaty is still open for ratification by signatories and for accession by those who did not sign before March 1999.
Sri Lanka, last December became the 163rd nation to accede to the anti-personnel mine ban convention, fulfilling the pledge it made in 2016 to join the international community in supporting the ongoing landmine clearance programme.
Jaipur Centre for Disability Rehabilitation
The Jaffna Jaipur Centre for Disability Rehabilitation was formed in 1987 with the aim of reaching out to people with loss of limb through a total rehabilitation programme. Speaking to the Daily News, the Chairperson of the Centre, Dr Ganeshamoorthy said the past five years were most challenging, having experienced unprecedented instability in their sustainability with the local and international NGOs closing down their operations and moving away from Sri Lanka.
Therefore, they now have a new strategy since 2017 to form a strategic alliance with the Northern Provincial Council while still remaining as an independent organization.
She said around 37 percent of their staff are disabled and at the time of commencement, most of those who required artificial limbs were mine victims.
However, she said now the number of mine victims is far lesser while road accident victims and those who have lost their limbs due to diabetes have overtaken the mine victim numbers.
Initially the centre had provided artificial limbs to around 2,000 mine victims and those with war injuries.
At the end of the war those who required artificial limbs had to go to Colombo. Hence we formed this organization as we felt there was a need to have such a centre in Jaffna itself, Dr Ganeshamoorthy said.

Minister calls for new laws to curb hate speech on social media
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Leader, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday stressed the importance of controlling social media by implementing existing laws or enacting new laws.
This he said will prevent the spread of posts containing hate speech, fake news and terror propaganda via social media platforms.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JHU office in Battaramulla, Minister Ranawaka said the temporary blockade imposed on social media needs to be lifted since the situation is normal in Kandy.
The minister urged the Police to conduct investigations immediately and reveal the names of politicians, political parties or organisations behind the attacks to prevent the spread of rumours.
He also stressed the necessity of taking strict legal action against those who involved in this incident based on technical or any other evidences in order to prevent such incidents in the future.
We agree with the timely decision taken by the government to impose this blockade on social media platforms including Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp to curb hate speech and communal disturbances.We can take action against the print and electronic media if they propagate extremism. However, we cannot control the damage caused by social media if they spread extremism since now we are passing the post truth era, he said.
Most countries in the world take such measures to control communal riots and conflicts. Recently India had to block even the SMSs to control Hindu- Muslim conflicts that prevailed there.
The country cannot move forward without cloud computing. The whole world welcomed the fourth industrial revolution which builds on the digital revolution since 2010.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is marked by emerging technology breakthroughs in a number of fields, including robotics, nanotechnology, quantum computing and biotechnology.
The Minister further stressed the importance of agile governance to make better and faster response from the government claiming that quick response from government is very much essential to control any issue.

Moving Mechanics
Most of the traditional Indian dances forms originated at the temples and temple environments. Meanwhile, some were originated in royal courts. During the ancient period, no techniques were developed earlier microphones were not used in the classical dance programmes. In those days, the vocalists sang the songs loudly without the microphone.
With the passage of time, the mike system was introduced and it entered into the stage field, most probably in the mid - the 1940s.The vocalists started singing the songs in normal pitch. Earlier they struggled to maintain the sound level to reach the whole auditorium. After the microphone system was introduced it not only used by vocalists but it was also used by all the accompaniments. The sound system should be operated by well-trained technicians. Inside the sage and outside the stage, speakers are used to amplifying the sound system.
Sound system
The stage speakers are used for the benefit of the performing artists as well as for the benefit of the direct audience. Meanwhile, to maintain the sound system, equalizers are used by the sound system operators to control, adjust and regularize different instrumental accompanying sounds in such a way.
Earlier the light for the dance programmes was only given by oil lamps. Later the lanterns were carried by the people to provide light to the stage. With the passage of time, electricity was introduced, using sophisticated techniques. Now a variety of lighting systems is available. Spotlights, follow up lights, footlights, focus lights and rotating colour lights are some of the lighting systems used in the modern stages.
Presently footlights are not in use because it might cast a shadow on the dancing figure. Some of the lights are kept on the trolley, fixed up with wheels for rotation purposes. Sometimes the lights are attached to the discs which are covered with transparent colour papers to give the effect of colour lights to the stage. Some of the rotating colours are permanently fixed on the front of the top of the present stages.
Dance recital
Besides these, dimmers are also used for classical dance recitals. Dimmers are used before the dance starts and after the dance ends. It gives a perfect touch to the oriental classical dance recital. The light should not cast a shadow on the artiste.
The dance dramas are considered with separate identity in the oriental classical dance recitals. The choreographers of dance drama productions use many more scientific techniques in their productions. For instance, for different colourful smokes are often used. In the dance drama productions the choreographers, not only use the oriental classical musical instruments but also use the western musical instruments.
For instance, choreographers use the electric keyboard. Through the western keyboard different sounds can be produced. This facility was not available in the earlier dance dramas. To maintain the balance of pitch (Suruthi) level, earlier, manual Suruthi, airbox instrument was used, but today an electrical Suruthi box is used to maintain the Suruthi level. Similarly, to maintain the Suruthi level another string instrument Thampura is used. Even today electronic Thampura is available for concerts.
Moving curtains
Earlier people used to hold the curtains at both ends. But later manually operated curtains were used. These are one side moving curtains. Both sides moving curtains dropping curtains from up to down, or rolling from down to up are also in use. Today, electrically operated curtains are mostly available.
Nowadays pre-recorded C.Ds, cassettes, pen drives and record players are used for dance practices and stage performances. After the entry of distance education system into the dance field, even the practical lesson and illustration materials are given in C.Ds. Another development in dance teaching is learning through internet teaching, yet it is not a healthy development or desirable learning method in dance yet it is considered as a technological development in the dance field.
Dance stages are decorated by stage decors. The organisers of the dance show dcor the stage as they want and as they wish. But nowadays many of times the stages are decorated with appropriate video slides as background. Due to the use of modern technology for stage dcor the manual stage decoration system is slowly vanishing from the dance stages.
Another milestone development in the art field is the use of video system. The present generation teachers, students, parent and artistes are very much keen to take video recordings of the programmes. Even the TV channels also use the pre-recorded programmes and telecasting on the TV channels which is another development in the dance field.
Normally in any dance programme, the people cannot see the full facial expressions, such as Abhinayas while seated at the back rows of the auditorium. But to avoid this shortcoming nowadays, in most of the programmes large video screens are installed or used.
This facility provides an opportunity to enable all the people to view the programmes properly. Hence science and technology play an important role to cherish the dance field.

The good news for the Tuskers is the welcome return of diminutive utility three quarter and former Sri Lanka national under 20 sevens captain, Peterite Kevin Dixon to the side after a jaw injury.
The selectors have also drafted in some young players in the caliber of Adeesha Weeratunga (former Isipathana College/Navy SC), Sithum Peiris (ex-Wesley College/Havelock SC) and Buddima Piyaratne (former D.S.Senanayake College/Navy SC) for this tournament. Last years tournament was a miserable one for the Sri Lankan Tuskers mens team as they lost to team DBKL in the Plate finals by 15 points to 33.
They were only able to beat Malaysia by 26-5 in the Plate semi-finals in the entire tournament. But it was a different outcome when it came to the Sri Lanka womens team last year as they claimed their first ever Borneo Sevens Cup championship after beating Thailand in the final 12-5 under head coach former Sri Lanka national sevens captain Sudath Sampath. Chairman of selectors Michael Jayasekara said, We are exposing some young players in this tournament especially like Adeesha who has played for the Sri Lanka under 19 sevens team, as some of our experienced players are down with injuries after the local 15 a side tournament. We are targeting the Commonwealth Games as well as the Asian Games and trying our best to see whether we could possibly go for a medal.

British designer Anna Bullus found an ingenious way to collect chewed gum and transform it into coffee cups, Wellington boots and shoe soles.
Her project started 10 years ago when she was looking into which elements of roadside rubbish could be recycled.
One of the litters I found was a piece of chewing gum and, as a designer, I was amazed there was nothing being done to recycle it, she told the BBC.
Chewing gum is made from a synthetic rubber that does not biodegrade.
When tossed on to the pavement, it sits there until it is removed, which is a time-consuming, costly process.
Gum is the second most common type of street litter after cigarette materials. In the UK, councils spend around 50m each year cleaning up the mess.
Anna designed eye-catching bright pink, bubble-shaped bins made out of her recycled gum. She called them Gumdrops and ensured they could be installed anywhere.
The project was launched at the University of Winchester where recycled-gum coffee cups were given away to celebrate the first Gumdrops on campus.
Students would give the cup a sniff to check it didnt smell of mint or bubble gum, said Liz Harris, the universitys environmental officer.
A recycling plant in Worcester takes the Gumdrops full of used gum, filters out unwanted material, grinds it into pieces and then compounds this with other recycled plastic polymers.
They were trialled at Heathrow Airport for three months, saving it 6,000 in cleaning costs.
Great Western Railway has installed the bins in 25 of its railway stations and plan to roll on the project.
One of the biggest chewing gum companies, Wrigley has backed Gumdrop commending Anna for coming up with a long-term sustainable solution to tackling gum litter.
I do believe that through the right design, Anna said, we can change the way people behave. BBC News

OMP to be victim-centred-- Saliya Pieris
Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Chairman Presidents Counsel Saliya Pieris, in a fresh communiqu, stated that the OMP, unlike previous state mechanisms tasked to deal with disappearances, would be a permanent institution whose mandate would also include investigating and tracing.
Given the magnitude of the problem and the complexity with respect to the multiple tasks required to search for the missing and disappeared, the OMP will function as a permanent office, Pieris said. Unlike previous state mechanisms, which were temporary in duration and served largely to document, the OMP would be a permanent institution tasked with investigating and tracing.
He added that victim-centredness would be the guiding principle for the operationalisation of the OMP. Referring to the OMPs processes and structures, he said that the organisation would employ a consultative approach, speaking to victims and other stakeholders, whilst carefully considering key recommendations made to the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF). It is important to recognise that the OMP is just one of the four institutions and one of multiple measures envisaged by the government to ensure reconciliation and lasting peace within our nation, he said.
Reiterating the composition of the OMP, Pieris added that with seven members, the OMP represents a cross-section of society comprising individuals who are activists, public servants, professionals, a retired legal advisor to the Sri Lankan Army and a family member of a disappeared individual.
Pieris said that with these new members, the OMP will be deeply committed to the welfare of all the victims of Sri Lankas conflicts and is conscious of the duties entrusted to it by Parliament.
The OMP will address the many cases of missing and disappeared persons irrespective of ethnicity, religion and region. The OMP will examine both civilians and combatants, including several thousand members of the Armed Forces, police and civil defence force, who have been identified as missing in action.

India take on Bangladesh today :
Our batting execution was poor - Thisara
Sri Lanka captain Thisara Perera whilst praising the type of wickets prepared for the Hero Nidahas T20 tri-series blamed poor execution of his batsmen for their six-wicket defeat at the hands of India in the return match played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Monday.
The failure of the middle order to contribute runs was the biggest reason for the defeat, said Perera at the post-match press conference. We lost two or three wickets in quick succession. We should have stuck around during that period, and if we did that, we could have got around 180 easily. The bowlers need at least 175 to defend on this pitch. We didnt bat well enough.
We need to have 175 or 180 on the board, because from the first or second over, the ball is wet. Its hard to grip, so we need those runs. In the first six overs we couldnt bowl well. Thats not an excuse but we should be prepared for that, Perera said.
Our goal is to play good cricket. More than have the ball go this way and that way, its better to have pitches like this. We chased 173 and hit 214 on these pitches - things that we had never done before in T20Is. More than the ball turning a lot and staying low these kinds of pitches are better.
Perera defended the move to play an extra bowler in place of a batsman for the Indian game when Sri Lanka replaced suspended captain Dinesh Chandimal and gave vice-captain and fast bowler Suranga Lakmal his first match of the series. Lakmal however didnt fare too well with the ball bowling two overs for 19 runs.
With this rain we definitely needed another main bowler. Our game didnt go to plan - thats the main reason we lost. If we had got 175 or 180, we would have been more competitive. In the previous matches we did really well. Our batting was great. Its in this match only that we collapsed. We had chased 173 and then hit 214, so our batting is really good. We need to fix the little issues and think about the coming matches, said Perera.
In the previous two matches we didnt need the batsmen coming in at No. 7 or 8. So we thought the batsmen we had was enough. Actually if we look at our first match, we did pretty well. Dasun (Shanaka) and I finished the match. Other than in the last few matches our batting line-up is very good. But today (Monday) we couldnt bat well - including myself.
I have to bear the blame as well. I batted well at the start and could have continued. But what I tried to do was to hit a boundary. I think we could have batted better around Kusal Mendis. He batted really well. The main reason for the loss is we couldnt execute our batting plans. Sad to say this was not a good score to defend on this wicket. It was a really good wicket to bat. We were 30-25 runs behind, he said.
Sri Lanka are now left with a must win situation in their final league game against Bangladesh on Friday to qualify for a place in the final.
Man of the Match Shardul Thakur whose career best figures of 4 for 27 triggered a Sri Lanka middle order collapse said, I have told one thing before: I love challenges.
I am taking it as a challenge. If other senior bowlers are missing from the team, then I have to step up. I have done this previously for other teams that I have played for. I have come in place of Zaheer Khan, Dhawal Kulkarni and Ajit Agarkar while playing for Mumbai. I had to step up in that role. When senior bowlers are rested, I have to step up and fill that role to lead the pace attack.
Battered for 27 runs in one over in the first match, Thakur came back with a vengeance to bowl India to victory in the return game with the best figures in the ongoing tournament so far.
TODAY: India play their final league match against Bangladesh.

Panadura Police given dead rope over hidden aircraft spares
Panadura South Police conducting investigations with the Kalutara District Crime Investigation Unit officials, into the stock of allegedly hidden aircraft spare parts in the possession of a retired Sri Lanka Air Force engineer have not found any wrongdoing on the part of the engineer.
Acting on a tip-off, the police raided the engineers house in Alubomulla, Panadura, on Monday, and discovered the stock of spare parts of a condemned aircraft. However, the engineer, in his statement to the police, said he had purchased the condemned stocks of an aircraft belonging to a private firm by paying Rs.5 lakhs. Subsequently, he brought the stock to his house at Alubomulla from Bandaranaike International Airport. Thereafter, he had sold an aircraft part to a businessman in Ja-Ela to use at a playground. The engineer also possessed the necessary documents for the purchase.
Panadura Police could not find any evidence of misappropriation or theft in this case. Two senior officers of the Sri Lanka Air Force had also visited the scene and inspected the stock of aircraft spare parts.
Panadura Police who had summoned local media persons (not of the Lake House group) to the scene to publicise the story, found the tip-off ended in a dead rope.

While the entire Centre is run by electricity generated from waste, the remaining electrical energy is added to the national grid.
President Sirisena said that he would inquire about such projects in order to solve the garbage disposal problem in Sri Lanka and would seek the possibility of obtaining assistance from Japan for such projects.
The chief of the waste management centre explained details of the work conducted in the centre to the President and the accompanying delegation.

roadway to the best view
Lakshitha Karunaratne will deliver the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society Monthly Lecture at the Lotus Hall, BMICH, on March 15 at 6 pm. The lecture is open to all members and non-members, with free admission.
In Lakshitha Karunarathna, Sri Lanka should be proud of counting such an artiste as a son. The Grand Prize Winner for Natures Best Photography as awarded by the Smithsonian Institute, a Finalist for the Peoples Choice Award in the BBCs Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award, the Editorial Choice Award in the OASIS Nature & Wildlife Photographic Competition in Italy and 252 other International Awards inclusive of no less than 72 Gold Medals, defines the class of this outstanding photographer.
Inspired, at a very young age, by the works of Naturalist and Broadcaster, Sir David Attenborough, Karunarathna spent his formative years studying nature through still photography and wildlife documentaries before embarking on his own photographic journey. A resident of Colombo, and a Tea Taster by profession, he has travelled to Asia, Europe, Africa and the Arctic, getting closer to Nature in all of its climatic manifestations.
Karunarathna considers patience as his most important asset in dealing with the dynamic subjects he has chosen to embed in the memories of those who see his pictures. A long-standing fan of fine art and monochrome in wildlife pictures, he is also a true believer in conservation and awareness through the medium of photography. This is an evening for those who appreciate both, in the words of one who, spectacularly, does.
The idiom that a picture paints a thousand words is particularly relevant to wildlife conservation. With the advances in digital camera technology making the production of pretty pictures that much easier, there has been an explosion in the publication of coffee table books, and others, of wildlife and nature photographs. This, in turn, has brought the beauty of the wild to a much wider audience than it once did, as well as an awareness of the dangers that threaten its future existence.
To the connoisseur, however, what makes a perfect wildlife photographer, apart from an intimate knowledge of the properties of light, is the composition of the photographs he takes which demonstrates not only his technical expertise but also his acute knowledge of the status and behaviour of his subject.
It is this, that moment in time in the life of an animal or of nature, the conversion of an ordinary millisecond into an eternal memory that raises the work of the true artist above that of the very good.

BEAT INVISIBLE GLAUCOMA:
SAVE YOUR SIGHT
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world and the most common cause of irreversible blindness globally. (Most common cause of blindness is Cataract which is reversible). It is estimated that 4.5 million person globally are blind due to glaucoma, and that will rise to 11.2 million by 2020.
It silently robs your eye sight even before you feel it. It happens due to progressive damage of the Optic Nerve which is irreversible. However early detection and treatment of Glaucoma can halt or slowdown any further vision loss. Therefore early detection is the key to prevent progression of disease towards severe visual handicap or blindness. The earlier the diagnosis optic nerve damage is less and visual impairment can be minimized or prevented.
To fight against something devastating, we should know what it is.
Glaucoma is a group of eye disease that cause progressive damage of the optic nerve in the eye which carries visual information to the brain. Your eye has a circulation which maintain the eye pressure to keep the eye in shape and function properly. Main reason for the damage of optic nerve is raised eye pressure. Eye pressure is maintained by a watery fluid called Aqueous. Aqueous is produced by a structure called ciliary body in posterior chamber (posterior part) of the eye. The fluid passes through the pupil (hole in the centre of Iris) to the anterior part of the eye where it leaves the eye by draining through a sieve like structure in the angle of the eye between cornea and iris to the blood stream.
Normally theres a balance between the aqueous production and drainage. But, if it is produced too much or the draining pathway is blocked, eye pressure will rise. When the optic nerve is under too much pressure persistently, it damages gradually. A significantly acuterise of eye pressure can damage optic nerve immediately. Eye pressure is independent of blood pressure. On the other hand aqueous fluid which is responsible for eye pressure has nothing to do with tears. Those are the misconceptions among the public.
You can get your eyes checked by a specialized eye unit. Specialized eye unit available in all Tertiary care hospitals, all General hospitals and some Base hospitals. In private sector also private hospitals and some consultation centres have facilities to check eyes. Doctor will check your eye pressure and Ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus to check the optic nerve. Then your doctor might order some tests to confirm the diagnosis and the extent of the disease.
Visual Field Tests are the most common widely using basic test for Glaucoma, Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) test is the most common variety being used. A Visual Field maps out what your area of vision looks like to you. This detects the invisible areas to the patient which has gone unnoticed by the patient until the damage is severe.
This test is helpful in diagnosing and to detect the disease progression with time. With the advent of the new technology a non-invasive computer based 2D and 3D imaging tests are introduced, which are called Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). It uses light waves to take cross sectional pictures of your Retina enabling a detailed view. This is more advanced and sensitive method. Unfortunately this is not widely available in government hospitals, although it is available in some Tertiary Care Hospitals including National Eye Hospital, Colombo and Teaching Hospital, Kandy.
Once the diagnosis of Glaucoma has been made, mainstay of treatment is controlling the eye pressure. Reducing 1mmHg (unit) even has a greater impact on protecting the Optic Nerve and thereby protecting visual loss. Once Glaucoma is diagnosed the treatment should be lifelong. Your doctor will prescribe you one or two eye drops, rarely may be a pill added. According to the extent of the disease you will be asked to get your eye pressure checked in regular interval. You should go for the follow up in recommended interval by your doctor. If the desired level of reduction of eye pressure not achieved by drugs, laser treatment or a surgery might needed in later stage. If you are diagnosed to have Glaucoma you should tell your close family members also to get the eyes checked for Glaucoma.

## Title: Slow over rates is unpardonable
## Supertitle:

Slow over rates is unpardonable
When you are appointed the captain of your country along with it come responsibilities, and one of them is to ensure the team plays the game in the right spirit and discipline is maintained at all times.
If a captain gets copped for slow over rate and thereby gets suspended for one match or a number of matches he is being unfair by the team he leads and the country he represents. It is the duty as the captain to ensure his bowlers bowl the number of overs within the stipulated time limit given for an innings and it is also imperative that the senior cricketers in the team also help the captain to stick by it.
Failure to do so will result not only in the captain but also the team members being fined as well. Worse still is when a team loses its captain at a crucial phase of a tournament. Sri Lanka has experienced it on more than one occasion. The recent ban of Dinesh Chandimal for two matches in the ongoing Hero Nidahas trophy is one such instance where Sri Lanka was to meet India and then Bangladesh in the return matches to qualify for the final. Chandimal has been suspended from both these matches and he is not even the countrys white ball captain. Chandimal was appointed to the post because official white ball captain Angelo Mathews is recovering from a leg injury. Following the suspension on Chandimal the onus of leading the country in both these crucial matches fell on all-rounder Thisara Perera who had captained his country in this format before. If Sri Lanka fails to make it to the final then Chandimal would have played his last game in the tri-series. Such is the sad scenario that instances of this nature should not be allowed to happen as it upsets the team strategies and balance. Chandimal was also the wicket-keeper of his team and came to bat in the middle order. His absence has forced Sri Lanka to hand over the wicket-keeping duties to Kusal Perera who without this burden has been scoring freely and winning matches for his country purely on his aggressive batting. He was man of the match in Sri Lankas win over India in the tri-series opener.
The Sri Lanka team has been talking about playing smart cricket and taking smart options, but they have not been quite smart enough where the over rate is concerned and it is an area they need to strictly implement some discipline into.
Last year when Sri Lanka underwent one of their worst performances in international cricket Upul Tharanga who led his country in ODIs was suspended twice for serious over rate offences. He was first suspended for two matches in the ICC Champions trophy in June 2017 and then again suspended for a further two matches in the five-match ODI series against India in August two months later. This sort of indiscipline from a captain of a country is unpardonable. He may not be doing it intentionally but he must be aware of his responsibilities as captain. It is also the duty of the rest of the team members to be aware of what is happening on the field and to keep an eye on the clock and the over rate at all times.
Sometimes you need to be street-smart to outmaneuver the rules as Sri Lanka did during the 2012 edition of the ICC World Twenty20 which they hosted when they swapped captains to help Mahela Jayawardene avoid a possible suspension.
Having already been fined, and facing the prospect of suspension again, Kumar Sangakkara took over the duties of the toss. On the field, though, Jayawardene did all the commandeering.
It was obvious what Sri Lanka were up to, but it was also magnificently cunning and Jayawardene admitted to the trickery.
"I had a warning for an over rates issue, and if it happens again I miss the match, so what we did was have Kumar as the official captain. I don't think that the intentions were wrong. It's a tough system and it's tough to bowl 20 overs in one hour and 20 minutes in a tournament like this. We try our best, but the penalties are harsh. We don't want to miss the big games, so we did it with the right intentions, Jayawardene said afterwards.
The rules of captaincy were changed following the incident. The captain that is now named before an ICC event is considered to be the captain, if he is playing. That meant that there is no chance for any sort of ruses in future.
Sri Lanka is notorious for forcing the international governing body the ICC towards changing the rules of the game. In 2004 the ICC revolutionized chucking laws by allowing Muthiah Muralitharan to bowl his doosra delivery that was earlier reported to be illegal. The committee that had carefully looked into the issue found that it was not only Muralitharan but that many much-admired bowlers like Glenn McGrath, Shaun Pollock, Steve Harmison and Allan Donald bowled deliveries that are illegal under the existing rules. As a result the ICC brought in a new rule allowing bowlers to straighten their bowling arms by up to 15 degrees replacing the existing ones that restricted spinners to five degrees and fast bowlers to ten degrees.
Going back to the question of slow over rates there is no principal ruler watching over cricket and calculating who should be fined. Incidents are reported by the umpires and team managers and the match referees investigate, allowing for things like time wasting by opposition, reviews, injury and so on. While the accepted standard over rate is 15 overs per hour, to find the actual required over rate, all of these factors need to be considered. However, the application will always remain inconsistent.
Some teams experience difficulty on over rates on the type of bowlers they use. For instance teams like South Africa, Australia and England for example who depend largely on pace will find it more difficult to whizz through overs than subcontinent teams which are packed with spinners.
In the end, this factor could even influence team selections. The hard part is that some teams are punished for being packed with pacemen, while others can get away with time-delaying tactics because of the amount of spinners in the team. In Sri Lankas case there is no excuse for such tardiness.

Social media ban to be lifted on Friday
The ban on social media sites are expected to be lifted on Friday (16), almost a week since the government imposed the ban under Emergency regulations, Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday.
I spoke to the President today (13) and he agreed that the ban could be lifted, he added.
Tensions between Muslims and Sinhalese groups in Kandy last week resulted in the government taking action to ban social media on March 7, to quell and control the spread of racially inciting rumours and hate speech.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Ministry, Fernando said a team from Facebook would be visiting Sri Lanka on Thursday (15) to finalise discussions over how they would work together in future to identify hate speech on Facebook.
In the past we would ask SLCERT to remove racially motivated pages on Facebook but we found that the response from Facebook was too slow - at times it took up to a week and by that time it was too late, Minister Fernando said.
Correspondence between the Ministry and the heads of Facebook in the region, operating from India, in the last three days, had revealed that the delays were caused due to a lack of resource personnel able to monitor offensive material in Sinhala.
Facebook had also asked that the government nominate an agency with whom they could work together to resolve the problem,
We have thus asked that they work with both SLCERT and the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (TRCSL) which has direct links to Defence to monitor hate speech, said Fernando.
Facebook has also assured them that they would now pay more attention to users in Sri Lanka to ensure that their platform is not used to spread racial bigotry. They have also promised to block any user found guilty of spreading hate speech.
The Minister also assured that monitoring of content will only be done to control hate speech and elements which are detrimental to national security, This is by no means an attempt to clamp down on views against the government, he stressed.
According to the Ministry, in 2015 there were 3.5 million Facebook users in Sri Lanka and by 2018, those numbers have doubled to 6.2 million. These numbers have alerted the government to the seriousness of the issue with Fernando promising to bring in legislation along with a dedicated regulatory body to monitor these platforms in future.
Unlike mainstream media, there are no checks and balances on social media. And first time users tend to believe whatever that is posted on line, he said.
Admitting that they have allowed for lapses in national security by not monitoring these platforms more, the Minister observed that as technology advances at a rapid pace, the government too needs to keep up to ensure that it is not misused.
As citizens however, we all have the responsibility to use this valuable tool wisely, said the minister as he pointed out that it was only Sri Lanka which had such lax regulations on social media and that countries like Iran, Egypt, China, Syria and even the UK monitored their citizens on social media platforms on a daily basis.
Meanwhile, the Government Information Department yesterday announced that the ban on Viber would be lifted from midnight yesterday (13).
All other social media applications would have the ban removed on Friday.
Director General of the Department, Sudharshana Gunawardena in a statement explained that while the ban had been imposed to control the social unrest which was fast spreading last week, the security situation in the country by now was returning to normal and strict legal action was being taken against the perpetrators.
As the situation returns to normal, Sri Lankans living abroad, especially those employed abroad have requested that the government take into account their difficulties in communicating with their love ones back home.
Further the governments attention has also been drawn to the business community, small and medium scale entrepreneurs and tourists who visit the country who are disadvantaged by the ban, explained Gunawardena further.
Thus as a first step towards removing the ban, the government will re-open Viber, said the Department.

Story on the canvass
Mahen Pereras paintings-as sculpture-as-paintings contain subtle yet sustained moments of un-theatrical anarchy. His works are dramatic, but they do not function on the same wave-length as a tragic life event that suddenly destabilizes ones guiding constants and frameworks. Although there is destabilization, Mahens works are quieter: like a passing comment or question dropped by a friend that stays with you; plagues you, while quietly contributing to a changing view of the world. In other words, a moment to look back and question, re-evaluate while looking forward to discovering and learning.
Mahen Perera trained in Multi-Disciplinary Design at the National Design Centre in Colombo before going on to pursue his BA in Fine Arts from the Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore in affiliation with the Open University U.K., Many of the objects and materials featured in the artists works are discarded things he comes across on long walks around Colombo. For Mahen, walking sometimes aimlessly is a way of confronting and considering the world and [himself] inside of it. When something grabs his attention, he picks it up and takes it back to his studio. There it sits, spit out by a labyrinth of human systems: its history now salvaged. When pushed, Mahen cannot articulate the process he uses to decide what objects and materials he picks, he dismisses the question. Theres no process, he says, I just find these objects really interesting, others might not. It so begs the question of: what deems these objects worthy of salvage and consideration
Mahens works feature knotted fabric, protruding from the canvas drenched in layers of paint. As a finished product, they cease to be their previous selves; their mono-history intersecting with two other histories. Although the objects cannot speak, it is in the convergence of these histories that Mahen Pereras works traverse their way into a connection with the individual. After Mahen knots, stretches, soaks, covers and changes these materials, a third history comes into play; the history of the viewer. The viewer is confronted with important questions that include, what is the history of this object How did it come to be heard in this moment Perhaps these questions may reveal less about the object in front of them and more about the world itself
The triangle of histories reflected in the final pieces inspires a chaotic back and forth with polysemantic1 possibilities; they conjure up familiar associations. The protrusions feel corporeal, reminding one of their own bodies in a sinewy violent act of stretching and tearing, opening spaces for transmutation. Suddenly with equal force and form they are unrecognizable and unfamiliar. They are artificial, alien, and plastic movements: both belonging to the body and outside of it. They feel at once psychological and lively but also resolute and peaceful. It is an exercise in training the eye to see without certainty, after certainty. To accept contradiction and complexity as a visual reality, but perhaps more importantly, a lived reality.
Mahens works have thrown a wedge into the ordinarily lived world, creating moments of reflection through anarchy, precisely because of the contradictory nature of being both recognizable and unfamiliar at once. Anarchy, because of its newness and disorder, due to absence or non-recognition of authority or category. The works usurp the authorities that industrialize our lives; that fuel our systems and contribute to our mechanization. Reflection, because in his works, the newness gives us a place to rest, and experience something unknown and unanswerable as a means of re-evaluating the known.
It is in the cultivating of these moments of reflective anarchy that Mahens painting are not particularly political, but they can be. They are not decorative, but they can be. Perera has created new matter that lives in a permanently contradictory state and thus inserts itself as a kind of surprise interrupting daily human activity.
Formally, these works are an unfamiliar combination of admiration and fear for the world of objects; this is because they tell us infinite stories of ourselves and what we discard. They become objects of passive surveillance. We do not have access to the data but we recognize them as monuments of their existence and thereby evidence of our own.
Mahen Pereras works have been exhibited in Sri Lanka, Singapore and Vietnam. His latest exhibition will be held at the Saskia Fernando Gallery on March 15 from 6 pm to 8 pm.

Two complaints against SAITM before Bribery Commission
The Parents' Union of State Medical Students made two separate complaints to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption yesterday in connection with Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital and SAITM, the Parents Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professional Association (OPA) in Colombo yesterday, he said that the first complaint is on misusing state money by the Health Minister, Health Ministry Secretary and all other relevant persons to pay for a private hospital violating rules, regulations and law of the country.
Alwis said there was a ceremony at this private hospital with the presence of the President and the Health Minister held in connection with the 'take over' by the Government and there was a huge issue about this so called `unsigned agreement'. "The Government paid over Rs.300 million monthly to run this private hospital.Now its owner has published a newspaper advertisement to sell it. How can an individual sell a state property or how can the Government pay millions of state money to run a private hospital" the parents queried.
"The Health Minister had fooled the President, the Cabinet, the Parliament and the entire country. The law of the country was violated.We hope that the Bribery and Corruption Commission will investigate the issue and take legal action against the culprits," he said.
The other complaint is on how 40 students had joined with only Ordinary Level Examination qualifications with the expectation of becoming doctors.This is a clear financial fraud because no one can become a doctor in Sri Lanka without passing the Advanced Level Examination in the Science stream.
He had cheated those 40 students. Now there is a conspiracy going on to offer a private MBBS through the KDU for those students with Ordinary Level qualifications, he added.

Vetgrow introduces Sri Lankas own milk booster Kiriton
Two visionary local University Academics have created history by pioneering a 100% truly Sri Lankan-made milk booster supplement to increase the daily milk yield received from lactating cows by over 20%.
Credit for this discovery is due to the hard work of two visionaries; Dr. Anura Jayasooriya, Senior Lecturer, Department of Basic Veterinary Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya and Dr. Gamika Prathapasinghe, Senior Lecturer, Department of Livestock and Avian Sciences, Faculty of Livestock, Fisheries and Nutrition, Wayamba Univeristy.
Commenting on their studies and research achievements Dr. Anura Jayasooriya said, According to our knowledge, a mineral supplement used by farmers, that includes calcium and phosphorus are key factors in determining the milk yield of lactating cows. However, the mineral supplement currently given to these animals contributes to increase the milk production by only 9%. Dr. Jayasooriya added.
Explaining further Dr. Prathapasinghe, To study the impact of using Kiriton on lactating cows we selected two dairy farming groups in Ambanpola and Polonnaruwa. We provided them Kiriton and also instructions on using it.
The daily milk yield of lactating cows that were given Kiriton increased between 20-50%, while in some instances records show that cows increased their daily milk yield by more than 50% due to the milk booster. In addition to this breakthrough, both inventors, Dr. Jayasooriya and Dr. Prathapasinghe are also owners of several other product patents.
With an aim to offer pet animal food supplements and farm animal production enhancers they founded an organisation known as Vetgrow. Kiriton is manufactured by Vetgrow according to the highest international standards.
Kiriton is available for retail purchase in 500g, 5kg and 10kg packets. Additionally, Kiritonas a milk booster is also obtainable through Dairy Farming Societies and through MILCO.

The Professional Web Journalists Association (PWJA) yesterday urged the government to lift social media restrictions and to bring in a code of ethics for these platforms as soon as possible. The PWJA also said restrictions on social media have now taken the shape of media censorship.

These observations were made at a press brief held at the Center for Corporate Social Responsibility at Colombo 1 yesterday.
The PWJA pointed out that there are about 400,000 persons making a living out of social media in Sri Lanka including marketers, designers, photographers and models.They also said a large number of persons who are abroad have found the continued restriction to be an obstacle when contacting their loved ones at home.

Proposed VAT on condominium sale, detrimental -Chamber
The proposed 15% VAT on the sale of condominium housing units with effect from April 2018 will have a severe negative impact on the industry, said Secretary General and CEO, Chamber of Constriction Industry, Nissanka Wijeratne.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said the current construction cost in Sri Lanka is the highest in the region. If you take the cost per square foot, its more than that of Dubai or even Singapore, he said.
Wijeratne said that with the increase of VAT being added to the cost, Sri Lanka would lose the competitive edge they are having for housing units especially from foreigners.
It will also be a negative factor for foreign direct investments. As the input VAT has already been absorbed as a cost, this change could potentially result in the increase in the prices of apartments.He said that apart from that the additional cost of 15% would also make housing a super luxury item in the eyes of the middle class. Wijeratne said that the biggest problem would be for the people who have paid advances for housing units that are currently being built.
They have to find additional funding to raise more capital and this is very unfair for them.
The best way to implement this would have been to implement this 15% VAT for new projects that would commence from May 2018.
He also said that they are not sure if the VAT would be charged on the condominiums that are being built in the Colombo Prot City. We think they would be exempted from this as the development comes under a Strategic Development Act.
Minister of Fiance Mangala Samaraweera during the budget speech said that condominium developments in which all condominium units are priced at less than Rs 10 million will not be subject to VAT even after April 1, 2018.
Meanwhile one of the leading developers said that they were not in a position to absorb the 15% VAT due to the escalating cost of construction. We will have to pass this on to the customer which will result in the drop of sales, he added.

Why be an employee without being a generator of employment 
Discussed with:Upul GalappaththyTrade Facilitation &Trade Information DivisionSri Lanka ExportDevelopment BoardSamantha Mirando, who did not take up the state position due to him after being graduated and became successful in the entrepreneurship field.
It seems that our education methodology, complying with the Sinhalese proverb Ugatha Mana Shilpayamai Mathu Rakena, has not evolved to employment-centered educational principles as Mathu Rakena Shilpayamai Ugatha Mana.
In such a social structure, protests by unemployed Graduates and young men and women mailing hundreds of job applications from the day they passed out as Graduates is a very common sight in our society. The expectation of all these people is finding any sort of employment in a State organization.
In such a society, isnt someone who selects the world of entrepreneurship leaving aside the State appointment entitled for his degree a very rare example 
Samantha Kumara Fernando, the founder of Liven Essential Oils, is such a rare entrepreneur.
As soon as I graduated with Honors from the University of Ruhuna, I got a job in the Department of Wildlife Conservation. But, I thought, why I should become an employee instead of becoming a generator of employment.
The dream of entering the business world has been growing in Samanthas mind from the time he was an undergraduate in the university. But, he had very little knowledge about the sphere of business.
I did not have any experience or extensive knowledge of the sphere of business. I only had the desire to become an entrepreneur. So, I obtained a Diploma in Project Management and a Postgraduate Degree in Business Management. I did those studies with the notion that if I am to do something; I have to do that something right.
A belief deeply rooted in him was that something can be done to the country utilizing the agricultural sphere, the indigenous resources and the market. Furthermore, even though the country has an abundance of flora of medicinal value, he fully realized the vacuum existing in the essential oil manufacturing field in Sri Lanka through his experiences in the agricultural sphere.
He realized, through his studies that, even though the tourists coming to Sri Lanka are interested in using medicinal products based on herbal extracts and Ayurvedic massage, most of the products used are imported from India. He specially realized that essential oils and related value-added products could be manufactured in this country.
I went to the Shri Kaya Kalp Ayurvedic Center in New Delhi, India, and trained in aromatherapy and manufacturing beauty culture products and products for a healthy life through the mixing of essential oils.Furthermore, I studied manufacturing natural cosmetics and ointments from a top class institution in India.
Starting his manufacturing activities in 2015, he had the good fortune to establish himself as a major supplier in this country within a very short time.
By today, essential oils related to pepper, cinnamon, clove, lemon, lavender and lemon grass, oils of jojoba, argon, almond and avocado, products from dehydrated Moringa, Karapincha, Gotukola and Cinnamon powder and a range of medicinal products such as medicinal soaps and creams are being manufactured at Liven Essential Oils.
However much influence he was able to spread in the local market, Samantha had an expectation of entering the export trade. In this background, he was pointed to a workshop conducted by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board to direct Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs to the export sphere. That was the beginning of his long journey to the international market.
The Sri Lanka Export Development Board guided me on the path to enter the export market. They facilitated me for a tour of India to pave the way for me to study the qualities of a product entering the export market. Furthermore, they directed me to China for a training of processing spices. The Sri Lanka Export Development Board is continuously assisting me in upgrading the quality of my products and finding markets.
By today, Samantha Mirandu has succeeded in marking a special point in his industry. In the competition to select the Best Export Feasibility Project in Sri Lanka organized last year by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board and the World Bank , the project report submitted by him secured the first place, over 15 project reports covering various subjects submitted by various organizations.
The first place of this competition was secured by the feasibility report of the proposed avocado oil extraction and the market of beauty culture products related to it to be activated by Samanthas company in collaboration with an Australian investor.
This project is a special turning point in the beauty culture products industry. Furthermore, it is a product that can bring a huge amount of foreign exchange to our country. I am exporting my products to Russia and Europe at present. We are preparing to enter a huge market in Australia and New Zealand for avocado-related products.
Studying the business footsteps of Samantha is a good handbook for the present youth generation striving to build up their lives.
When I started thinking of a business enterprise of my own, I did not have anything needed for an investment. I did not at lease have even the entrepreneurship knowledge or the basic applications for it. But, I did not give up thinking that there are no facilities in the country and no money in my hand. At the start, I accrued knowledge.
He says that the secret for his success was identifying the market vacuum and being directed to value-added products to fill that vacuum. Furthermore, another secret for his success is his unquenchable thirst for knowledge that has led him to become a successful entrepreneur.
Many friends of mine who were in the university with me are serving in government offices for a monthly salary. I feel sorry about them utilizing their knowledge that way.
I entreat the leaned academics to search for new dimensions to develop this country. There are many valuables spheres in our country that could be directed to export trade. If we can identify them and take them to the international market, our tomorrows will be brighter.
That is an earnest appeal from a Sri Lankan son of indomitable courage.

Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort celebrates the harvest of its first rice crops from its own organic paddy fields, located within the premises of the resort. The rice paddy fields are one of the latest farming initiatives that further enhance the resorts continued sustainability commitments.
The resort gardeners adhered to traditional planting methods and started cultivating two varieties of rice in November last year, in order to keep the indigenous farming heritage alive.
The cultivation of organic rice is part of a larger mission to educate and curate a wholesome farm-to-plate culinary experience for resort guests with zero plastic and minimal carbon footprints.
Following the local rituals and religious ceremonies, the local community, guests and resort employees were invited to collectively participate in the paddy harvest by taking part in a traditional blessing ceremony before joining the resorts gardeners in harvesting the rice.
The harvest was followed by an ambula, a traditional wholesome and nutritious meal eaten by farmers working in the fields. During this community meal, employees shared their passion and the complexities of traditional rice farming methods with the resort guests. The estimated yield of 450 kilogrammes will be donated to local schools, temples, and the community.
Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort offers 120 guest rooms and 32 private pool villas.Highlights form the harvesting

ANC offers Guaranteed Paid Student Internship Programme
ANC Education, has achieved yet another first with its Guaranteed Paid Student Internship Programme [PSI] which is the only of its kind in Sri Lanka.
Today most parents dont have the connections to send their children to Blue Chip Corporates due to the lack of corporate contacts. This is why ANC created GPSI where our students will get an opportunity to start their paid internships with Blue Chip Corporates, including multinational companies, said CEO/ Executive Director ANC, Dr Punarjeeva Karunanayake.
We believe that GPSI is the key differentiating factor in a highly competitive education industry. We have over 5000 graduates in the market right now who are holding key managerial positions. Their professionalism, analytical skills and communication skills have greatly contributed to the enviable reputation ANC enjoys today
GPSI is the most vital step in higher education, because it ensures a great career with Blue chip Corporates in Sri Lanka. Not only does ANC offer multiple options to its students, but it ensures that students pursue their academic and professional dreams whilst learning to lead in their chosen fields.
GPSI is a partnership between ANC and 30 of the most reputed blue-chip Corporates in the island, where ANC provides special industry related degree programmes alongside a '6-12 month' Guaranteed Paid Internship in their final year from the partnered Blue Chip Corporates.
They will also be engaged in industrial visits and numerous workshops throughout their studentship, which will truly place them One Step Ahead of students attached to other institutes.
Students who avail themselves of ANCs GPSI programme are not only academically validated but are industry validated as well having graduated with a years Corporate experience, thus placing them in a position where they can command a higher starting salary with Blue Chip Corporates, averaging Rs 75,000/-
The step taken by ANC in this direction is certainly a very positive one which provides students the opportunity to learn the best practices in all aspects of business in blue-chip companies and ANC undoubtedly have the best to offer budding leaders to put their progress on a faster track, Said Mr.Kishu Gomes, Managing Director/CEO Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC
We have observed that students gain transferable skills essential for employment through internships. We all want suitable manpower with hands-on experience and employable skills, such as communication, adaptability, positive attitude, leadership, willingness to learn, integrity, teamwork, etc to facilitate the growth of our organizations. said Shantha Kurumbalapitiya, COO  Serendib Leisure Management Limited.

Argentinas White Giant collapses
ARGENTINA: An ice bridge in Argentina collapsed in front of thousands of stunned tourists.
A large chunk of the Perito Moreno glacier, located in Los Glaciares National Park in the southwest Santa Cruz Province, came crashing down into the water.
The Patagonian glacier, known as the White Giant, sent impressive waves surging into the Lago Argentino lake as it fell.
Around 4,000 people gathered at a nearby vantage point hoping to see the natural phenomenon, which last happened four years ago.
Spectators broke into applause as they witnessed the breathtaking moment that the arch, which measured 250 metres wide and 70 metres high, collapsed.
A video shows how small pieces of ice dropped into the water before the entire bridge collapsed inwards and crashed into the lake.
The Perito Moreno glacier measures 19 miles long and has a total area of nearly 100 square miles.
Ruptures occur around every four to five years after the glacier forms a dam over the southern arm of the lake.
Water in the dammed section rises up to create pressure that eventually breaks through.
The imposing glacier, near the southern town of El Calafate, is one of 48 glaciers fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field shared with Chile which is the third largest ice concentration in the world after the North and South Poles.
The largest glacier is the 31 mile-long and nearly five mile-wide Upsala Glacier, but the Perito Moreno glacier, named after a 19th century explorer, is the most famous.
Matilde Oviedo, spokeswoman for Los Glaciares National Park, said: It made a tremendous noise when it came down.
There were a lot of people but we were expecting it to happen a little later.
Around 700,000 tourists visit the park, which is a UNESCO world heritage site, every year.
Speaking before todays rupture, the countrys Tourism Minister Gustavo Santos said: Were about to witness a marvellous spectacle of nature in an Argentinian setting that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site and attracts tourists from around the world. - AFP

In awe of Sidewalk Broadway
Continued from yesterday
Extracts from the Dr. Gamini Haththotuwegama Memorial Lecture delivered by Nihal Rajapakse at OPA Auditorium on the invitation of Richmond 60-70 Group.
Another activity he was deeply involved in whilst at Richmond, both as a student and later as a teacher was the Wednesday Evening Club, introduced to the school by that beloved Principal, Shelton Wirasinha. Like G.K. this Principal was also a literary genius. The Club was a literary, cultural and even a political forum confined to H.S.C. students and the academic staff. Due to the gap in our seniority, I was not fortunate enough to have been associated with G.K. at that time, in the activities of the Club. However, I vividly remember Shelton Wirasinghe once lamenting the loss of G.K. who he said was not only very articulate but also spoke impeccable English and who made the Club very vibrant during the period he was associated with it.
I vividly still remember a memorable encounter I had with G.K. more than half a century ago whilst both of us were students at Richmond. In my early days, I was in the College hostel. In the hostel, there was an organisation called RCBLA which stands for Richmond College Boarders Literary Association. Friday evenings were set aside for debates. On one such occasion, I was nominated as a debater which comprised of 4 students on each side.
The subject of the debate was English should be the medium of instructions in schools. I was on the proposing side. The debate was in Sinhala. I was probably in the Std. VII Class at that time. To get a helping hand I approached G.K. who I knew was always helpful to his juniors and brilliant in his command of English. I told him my problem in that I want him to give me some salient points to be used in the debate. He erroneously believed that I was on the opposing side and gave me enough material to argue as to why English should NOT be the medium of instruction and subjected the English Language to much ridicule by stating that it was a bahubootha language to have words like BUT and PUT pronounced in two different ways!.
At that time I knew that he had missed the bus! When I corrected him stating that I am on the proposing side, he then asked me to go to the hostel master and ask him to change my side which obviously would never have been allowed. It is a well-known fact that G.K. had coached and helped thousands of his students across the length and breadth of the country with utmost dedication and commitment. But when I sought his help it was unfortunate that it ended up in a big disappointment.
Hostel life at Richmond
A word about the hostel life at Richmond. G.K. had never been a hosteller because his house is a few doorsteps away from the College premises, located opposite the residence of Dr. W Dahanayake. However he always makes it a point to meet his hostel colleagues practising sports on College Grounds in the afternoons and evenings. His preoccupation with the hostellers after school hours led him to neglect his homework which was reported to his parents. This weakness even continued at the University level when he often failed to submit his tutorials. However, when he did submit them they were always outstanding and brilliant.
As for me, my hostel life came to an abrupt end in 1953 when I scooted off home under the pretext of going to watch a cricket match at the Galle Esplanade. Following this escapade, I was not only expelled from the hostel but also from the school! However, after my fathers intensive pleading (he was a pupil of E.R. de Silva), I was taken back to school but the hostel remained out of bounds for me for life. Academically, G.K. was simply brilliant. He passed the S.S.C. probably in 1952 securing distinctions in English and Civics for which he won the Queens Jubilee Scholarship. He is the only person I know who had secured a distinction in Civics from any school at any time. However, it is no longer a subject in the school curricula. He would have invariably studied English, Government, Ceylon and European History for his H.S.C. and University Entrance Examinations. He passed this Examination with flying colours in 1954 and was selected to proceed to study for the degree in English Honours. For the General Arts Qualifying Examination (G.A.Q.) along with English, he studied History and Economics. It was probably due to his brilliant performance at this Examination that he was allowed to proceed to study for an English Honours Degree course which was rare even those days but unheard of nowadays.
Whilst studying in the University he produced and appeared as the leading actor in the Sinhala version of Anton Chekhovs play The Proposal. During this period in the University, he also played the title role in the play Agamemnon. His university career as an undergraduate was greatly influenced by two giants associated with theatre and drama at that relevant time, viz; Prof. Sarathchandra and Prof. E.F.C. Ludowyke, both happened to be products of Richmond, the latter, of course, was full blooded. In 2005, G.K. was invited to deliver the prestigious E.F.C. Ludowyke Memorial Oration. As expected, he was a member of the University Debating Team as well. He is probably the only English graduate to have moved away from English to produce plays for the Sinhala audience. I have yet to come across an English Honours Graduate produced by Richmond after G.K. although there had been a few before him.
The little-known fact is G.K. among other things, is also a prankster. At Richmond, there was a teacher by the name of Christopher Wickramasinghe. He was the Head Master of the Primary School. He had been a very popular teacher, who was loved by all, by both students and teachers alike. He taught me in school and probably G.K. as well.
He lived in a bungalow on the College premises. It was this bungalow that has recently been converted to the College Museum. Occasionally, he will throw a dinner to those teachers who used to reside in the hostel. On one such occasion in the 1960s the Master in Charge of the hostel at that time, a well-known personality was invited along with other teachers residing in the hostel for a sumptuous dinner at Christophers bungalow. The invitees included G.K. as well who at that time was attached to the tutorial staff of the school. Before the dinner was served, the Master in Charge of the hostel referred to above, had got himself excused to answer a call of nature. He entered the toilet leaving his footwear outside. When he came out of the toilet he found that one of his shoes was missing. An intensive search was conducted by all concerned but to no avail. On the following day when Christopher opened his refrigerator, to his horror, he found the missing shoe inside it. On further investigation, it was discovered the culprit is none other than G.K. himself.
Theatre and drama
In 1959, G.K. graduated with honours in English. Armed with an English Honours Degree, he would have literally walked into any major school in the City but like his elder sister Iranganie, he opted to come back to his alma mater to impart his knowledge to fellow students of Richmond. It was in 1960 that he joined the academic staff there. Unfortunately, by this time I had left Richmond. Like a fish taken to water, he immediately immersed himself in theatre and drama whilst tutoring English to the students in the Upper School.
He directed several plays during his short tenure at Richmond including Shakespeare in Sarong, Hamlyn the Pied Piper, Awa Madai Maruwa and several other plays. After he assumed office, theatre and drama underwent a rapid transformation at Richmond. During his brief tenure, he also made another significant contribution to the extra curricula segment of the School. It was he who introduced badminton to Richmond. He laid the groundwork for Richmond to later become the All Island Badminton Champions.
His brief spell came to an end in 1964 when he was invited by the University of Kelaniya to join their academic staff as a Lecturer in English. Although his tenure as a member of the academic staff at Richmond was limited to only 4 years, he left behind an indelible mark and his legacy at Richmond still lives on. G.K. was a prolific writer as well. He was the Editor of the University Magazine for a number of years. He has also contributed many articles to prestigious and learned journals. In addition, he was also a film critic and an actor who had even played a minor role in Dharmasiri Bandaranayakes film Thunweni Yaamaya and the lead role in Vijitha Gunaratnes film called Walapatala.
In 1967 he was unanimously elected as the first President of the Film Critics and Journalists Association. Apart from lecturing at universities which were his main forte, he has conducted workshops for thousands of students across the length and breadth of the country as well as abroad and is well known as one of the most accomplished and skilled trainers of actors as well as one of the best voice trainers in the country. In 2005 he was given the Kala Keerthi Award by the State. In 2007, at the National Arts Festival, he was conferred a Doctorate for his immense contribution towards the upliftment of theatre and drama of the country by the University of Kelaniya.
The bud that was at Richmond really blossomed into full bloom with all its glory at the University of Kelaniya. He was attached to this University from 1965 up until 1977 when he was recalled to the University of Peradeniya. Unlike at Richmond, the University of Kelaniya had the necessary infrastructure and fertile ground for him to develop his theatrical skills. Besides his busy schedule in lecturing, he always found the time to produce a large number of plays during this period. These included Ranga Kebili, Sangeetha Sochchamak, Jesu Jerusalamata Pemineema, Akeekaru Puthraya etc. It was during this period that a momentous development took place in his career and that too by sheer accident.
In 1974, a theatre colleague of his who is a well-known artist had conducted a workshop at Anuradhapura. He joined this workshop as a director. In this workshop, he exhibited three plays. They were Raja Dekma, Bosath Dekma and Minihekuta Ellila Merenna Berida After the workshop was completed, his troupe were waiting for the Colombo bound train at the Anuradhapura railway station. Due to some reason, the train was about three hours late. Whilst waiting for the train, he got the urge to perform a play on the railway platform! He played the leading role brandishing a bogus sword. A large crowd congregated to watch the play in the railway station premises. That was the birth of his pet project which is the Street Theatre Movement that has had a huge impact on the cultural and social fabric of the country. Apart from this brief introduction, I shall refrain myself from speaking about this project as a more competent person, viz, Miss Deepani Silva, who was one of his erstwhile pupils, associated with this project almost from its inception, is lined up to speak authoritatively at length, on this very interesting and inspirational subject.
In 1975, another important and an interesting event took place. There was a conference organized by the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. G.K. had produced a play called World Food Conference for this event. After having declined first, the organisers later allowed it provided that the play was limited to no more than 30 minutes.
The play created a sensation as it was highly critical of the policies adopted by the World Food Programme. The play was tri-lingual, in Sinhala, Tamil and English. At the end of the play, the Australian High Commissioner commented, brilliant theatre, bad politics. Dr. Sarath Amunugama described it as a guerilla play. The play also created an international uproar. The Hongkong and Singapore newspapers blew it up. The FAO news bulletin published a detailed report of the play. The net result was G.K. was taken to the infamous 4th Floor of the C.I.D. and questioned at length by the intelligence people as the Authorities suspected that the play was of subversive nature.
Street performances
In 1977, G.K. joined the University of Peradeniya. During the period he was attached to this University, he did a large number of plays details of which are given in Dr. Kanchuka Dharmasiris book titled Street Ahead with Haththotuwegama. During this time he got involved in student activism as well which got him into trouble with the University Authorities. One of the academics once said, whenever that Haththotuwegama opens his mouth, I say theres sure to be a strike. Despite his busy schedule as a lecturer and a playwright, he continued his pet project which is street theatre. G.K. passed away from us on October 29, 2009, aged 70 years. His funeral which was state-sponsored was one of the most colourful funerals I have ever witnessed. During his lifetime as a playwright, he had produced by far the largest number of plays than anyone.
He had trained thousands of people. Some of these beneficiaries later became household names in the world of theatre and cinema. To name a few Jayalath Manoratne, Deepani Silva, Cyril Dharmawardene, H. A. Perera, Dhamma Jagoda etc. were all his pupils. Money was never his primary consideration. After all, no one buys tickets for street theatre performances. Neither was he interested in adding titles to his name like Dr. or Prof. He worked through donations he received from well-wishers. Throughout his working life, he had always commanded a huge following! His contribution to the world of theatre and drama is unparalleled and monumental. He is the last of the Mohicans but his legacy shall live on.

He made these remarks during a meeting with the Sri Lankan community in Japan at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, yesterday.
Mobile phones, computers, the Internet and social media were created for the benefit of the human kind and by utilizing these technologies we can access the knowledge of a world, but unfortunately some individuals in Sri Lanka use these resources to destroy the country, he pointed out.
President Sirisena said it is expected to introduce new programmes on the proper usage of such resources and emphasized the imperative need for the citizens as well as the government to fulfill their responsibilities.
He said that there is a need for such media that communicates and exchange good, authentic and correct information and there is a need to remove false information which triggers to disturb national peace, damage national security, and ridicule and insult individuals in a severe manner.
President Sirisena was warmly welcomed by the professionals, businessmen, and student union members and individuals working in many fields in Japan.
The President also appreciated the accomplishments of Sri Lankans living in Japan, thus enhancing the reputation of the country as well.

Birth of hate politics
UNP manifesto at 1953 Parliamentary elections, referring to the highly subsidized rice ration of two measures [aprx 2 kilos] per week, per person at 25 cents a measure stated, as long as Sun and Moon exists it will remain intact They won comfortably. 1952/53 financial year saw depleted foreign reserves; a severe economic crisis followed; catalysing the crisis was the end of Korean War boom; government was forced to impose unkind cutback in subsidies.
The alien term HARTAL meaning strike action, was first engaged during the Indian freedom movement in which Leaders of LSSP participated in early 1940s. Four young Marxist, who spoke against Imperialists world war II were imprisoned by colonial rulers. Dr. NM Perera, Dr. Colvin R de Silva, Philip Gunawardene and Edmond Samarakkody who broke jail and escaped to India, borrowed the concept from the Indians and on return they introduced it to Sri Lanka. A mass protest campaign which stipulates closing of shops and factories, work stoppage, transport strikes, or virtual abstinence from all engagements. The movement involved demonstrations against an illegal, irregular, or unacceptable decisions by a government that affects a large section of oppressed masses. On August 12, 1953 leftist parties declared a Hartal.
History of rice-subsidy
Economic and social programme should not be hampered because the nation pass through a depression. If properly thought-out budgetary proposals on a long-term basis are contemplated, this situation will not arise J R Jayewardene, the brilliant fiscal and economic planner, presenting the first budget in 1947
- Hansard; Dec. 1, 1947: Col 421.
The Cabinets decision to deceive the masses eventually boomeranged on JR, the Minister of Finance, damaging his reputation as an expert fiscal manager. In 1953 it became a huge drain on nations economy; the shortfall rose to unmanageable magnitude. Concluding his budget speech on July 23, 1953, the minister said, solution lay in elimination of overall deficit, but it was not possible to take this step without removing as well the subsidy on food.
- Hansard-23/07/53: Col. 807
All citizens, irrespective of their economic standings were given two measures at prices far below that of prices paid to Thai, Burmese, and Korean suppliers. Government withdrew it with simultaneous trimming down of several welfare measures. The rapid falling of prices of traditional exports in international markets made bridging the budget deficit a formidable task. Within a month, the anticipated deficit rose many fold; the rice ration accounted for 70% of the budget deficit, pruning the subsidy became inevitable.
The socially insensitive government blundered by attempting to do it in one strokemaking a substantial rise from 25 to 70 cents a measure. The masses responded positively to leftists call for Hartal.
Cabinet on board Warship declares Martial Law
On August 12, in Waskaduwa, close to Kalutara, rails and fish plates were detached in railway line; sleepers were ragged up; telephone posts were toppled in many areas. Wooden sleepers set on fire bringing trains in the Southern line to a halt for a few days. Train compartments were uncoupled from the engines preventing operations on Main lines. Passenger transport services were disrupted by stoning in several places making the owners withdraw their services. [there were no CTB buses then]. Main roads had been blocked by placing logs from cut down trees across them. Rioters even used explosives to damage small bridges. As the protest turned out to be an aggressive mass uprising that spread to places where there were LSSP-CP strongholds, a panic-stricken Cabinet sought refuge in British Warship HMS Newfoundland docked in Colombo Port.
On the same day, and within hours top defense officials were summoned on board the British warship for an emergency session, where it was decided to bring all affected districts under Martial law. Under emergency regulations a twenty four- hour curfew was imposed. The government authorized the armed forces to use fire-power to suppress the rioting, though a painful decision for the 41 year-old Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, who reluctantly placed his signature on the document.
UNP leaderships, [JRJs] insensitivity to social anxiety was quite obvious as the proposals, in addition to withdrawal of rice ration included, increased sugar tax, train fares and postal rates hike; removal of free midday-meal to school children. JRs antagonists in the UNP launched an anti-JR movement days before the passing of the proposals, a slogan was created, A move by JRJ to make Dudley unpopular. 
TRINE, the political tabloid carried a Headline on April 19, 1953 Conspiracy to oust Prime Minister.
The Hartal was called by the Marxist/Trotskyites of the traditional left, LSSP, CP [Communist] and Philip Gunawardanes group the VLSSP. It was led by Dr. N M Perera, Dr. S A Wickramasinghe, Dr. Colvin R de Silva, Pieter Keunamen, Philip and Robert Gunawardane brothers, and Edmond Samrakkody, most of them were former students of Prof Harold Lasky, the father of Marxist ideology in London University.
They had under their belt over 90 percent of the Trade Unions, and a well-organised sub-urban network in Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern Provinces and a significant presence in the plantations and in the North. They organised both the white and blue-collar working classes; Indian plantation workers in some tea estates participated in violent protests. The new-born SLFP supported the campaign in principal, with no active participation.
Hartal 53 was an exercise worked out on lines of Marxist ideology. Edmond Samarakkody MP and staunch Trotskyite writing to official organ of LSSP stated, What the working class and the masses that were in the struggle looked forward to were not a mere one-day protest action and a return to workthey were in readiness for a struggle to overthrow the hated UNP government. In fact, this direct action of masses continued on the next day also.there was clear possibilities of this Hartal action being continued for several daysbut the leadership, despite the unmistakable moods of the workers and other sections of the masses, decided against. Samasamajist; [1953]
The peoples capability for mass struggle against unfairness and injustices made the political leadership apprehensive and to look for options. Since August 1953, anti-Marxist politicians initiated plans and strategies of facing similar tragedies by distracting the interest of masses from material benefits to wishes on racial, religious and language issues, a clever approach in political survival. A tragedy that caused the nation continues to suffer the harmful effects of it. Hartal 53 was a spontaneous reaction of an enraged people who displayed their strength in challenging a governments authoritarian stance. Peoples sense of collective power experienced on this day brought them success, when the price of rice was reduced from 70 to 55cents.

Ceylinco Life adjudged Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the year
Ceylinco Life was declared the Peoples Life Insurance Service Provider of the Year at the 2018 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards, making the life insurance market leader the only company in its sector to win this accolade every year since the inception of the awards 12 years ago.
This was the second year that the Peoples Insurance Service Provider of the Year was awarded separately to Life and General Insurance companies, following the segregation of these segments of insurance by law in 2015.
In the 10 years that preceded the segregation, Ceylinco Insurance PLC won the award every year.
Held at Waters Edge on Friday, 9th March, the SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards is the hallmark awards event of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM).
The countrys top brands across multiple sectors are honoured each year, following a nationwide assessment of public opinion covering 3,000 men and women aged 15 to 60.
Our credo  A Relationship for Life  influences everything we do, and it is fitting that this commitment to people is reciprocated every year with the Peoples Award, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO, R. Renganathan observed. We have extended the protection of life insurance to nearly one million lives, about 5 per cent of our countrys population, but our community initiatives extend far beyond this group and reach virtually every corner of the country, making Ceylinco Life a true brand of the masses of Sri Lanka.
The SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards recognise brands and personalities that have made a profound impression in the minds of the people of Sri Lanka and are one of the most awaited marketing events in the corporate calendar as the nominees and awardees are chosen by the voice of the people, through a comprehensive nationwide research conducted by Nielsen Sri Lanka.
The selection of the winners in the different sectors and categories is based on a nationwide quantitative face-to-face survey using a structured questionnaire.
Respondents are asked to mention their favourite brands and personalities across various categories, and those that receive the highest nominations are declared the winners.
Ceylinco Life ended 2017 with assets of Rs 106 billion, total income of Rs 25.6 billion, premium income of Rs 15.7 billion, a Life Fund of Rs 85.1 billion, an investment portfolio with a value in excess of Rs 89.5 billion and net profit of Rs 6 billion, making it the market leader in the countrys life insurance industry for the 14th successive year.
Adjudged Sri Lankas Best Life Insurer in 2017 for the fourth consecutive year by World Finance, Ceylinco Life is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
