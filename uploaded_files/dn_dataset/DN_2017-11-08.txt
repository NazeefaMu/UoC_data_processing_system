Petrol shortage: Lanka IOC rejects allegations,caters to only 16% of Sri Lankan market
Lanka IOC while rejecting the allegations that the company is responsible for causing the shortage of petrol in the country yesterday said LIOC caters to only 16 per cent of the Sri Lankan market and the remaining 84 per cent relies on Ceylon Petroleum Corporation supplies.
The company in a statement said that the shortage across the country can only be caused by a disruption in supplies of the CPC. The company said that the CPC petrol parcel, which was scheduled to reach Sri Lanka on November 2 2017, has been delayed and it is not aware of the reasons for this dela.
We understand that a CPC petrol parcel, which was scheduled to reach Sri Lanka on 2 November 2017, has been delayed. While we are not aware of the reasons for this delay, such a disruption has led to shortages of petrol across the country, particularly given that CPC caters to 84% of the Sri Lankan market.
The full statement:
LIOC has noted that consumers across the country have been facing some shortages of petrol over the last few days. As a reliable distributor of petroleum products in Sri Lanka over many years, LIOC is making all efforts to assist in the early resolution of this problem. However, attempts by some to blame LIOC for causing the shortage are mischievous and factually incorrect, and we categorically reject such allegations.
It may be noted that LIOC caters to only 16% of the Sri Lankan market, while the remaining 84% relies on CPC supplies. Thus, large shortages across the country can only be caused by disruption in supplies of CPC. Average daily sales of LIOC is 600 MT of petrol. Against this, as on date, LIOC has a buffer stock of 3500 MT of petrol at the Common User Facility (CUF), which is managed by CPSTL. It may be noted that LIOC has adequate stocks of diesel at both trincomalee terminal & at CUF and normal daily diesel sales of 775 MT is continuously happening from all our sheds across the country. It is total misrepresentation of facts that diesel is not being sold by LIOC sheds.
LIOC is a professionally managed subsidiary of Fortune 500 Global company, and plans its product requirement well in advance and maintains necessary stocks.
LIOCs recent shipment
LIOC had procured a shipment (parcel) of 35,000 MT of petrol from the French oil company M/s TOTAL on DAP basis, which arrived in Sri Lanka on 16 October 2017. As per routine procedure, the petrol was tested by CPC/CPSTL laboratory before being accepted by LIOC. It was found that while the parcel met the chemical properties specification, it contained some visible particles.
CPC/CPSTL laboratory as well as LIOC refused to accept the parcel. LIOC maintains its own high quality standards, which it does not compromise at any cost.
LIOC immediately informed M/s TOTAL to replace the parcel. It may be noted that ownership of the product remains with M/s TOTAL till it satisfies the requirements of LIOC and CPC/CPSTL laboratory. Once a parcel is rejected, LIOC has no further role thereafter and it is the sellers own sole discretion/responsibility to decide when to take out the vessel from Sri Lankan waters.
As replacement cargo would have taken at least 25-30 days, M/s TOTAL offered to remove the particles through filtration process, which is a common industry practice, in order to enable expedited delivery by 3-4 November 2017 to manage the present crisis. For reasons unknown to us, this proposal was not acceptable to CPC officials.
Hence, LIOC asked M/s TOTAL to replace the parcel completely. Allegations that LIOC pressurized CPC to accept the original parcel without correction are totally false.
It is reiterated that LIOC always adheres to the quality parameters in totality and procures goods from reputed oil companies only. LIOCs quality track record bears this out. Further, the allegation that LIOC tried to sell sub-standard Diesel is totally malicious and frivolous. Infact the diesel proposed to be imported was of much better quality as per international standards. However, since the country is still having old specifications for diesel, CPC informed that they demand Sri Lankan specifications irrespective the quality of diesel and accordingly, LIOC decided not to procure.
Though LIOC had sufficient buffer stocks, in order to assist CPC (whose shipment has been delayed), we immediately contacted our global suppliers for an emergency delivery (in addition to the replacement delivery by M/s TOTAL). This is expected to reach Sri Lanka by 10 November 2017. It may be recalled that on various occasions in the past, LIOC has offered all its assistance to CPC to procure emergency shipments of petroleum products, and will continue to do so, whenever required. As a responsible petroleum company, at the times of strike, LIOC has always worked round the clock to make the product available to the citizens of the country.
Delay in CPC shipment
We understand that a CPC petrol parcel, which was scheduled to reach Sri Lanka on 2 November 2017, has been delayed. While we are not aware of the reasons for this delay, such a disruption has led to shortages of petrol across the country, particularly given that CPC caters to 84% of the Sri Lankan market.

PM orders report on fuel issue
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for an immediate report on the current fuel crisis affecting the country from all stakeholders, Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference held at Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday, Bandara said the government will take several important decisions once this report was received.
This will help uncover whether anyone was responsible for creating this fuel crisis or it was the result of a conspiracy hatched to inconvenience the government.
Bandara said a request will also be made to appoint a commission to investigate this matter.
He said the shortage will end by November 9 or 10 since a fresh fuel shipment was due in the island on November 8, night.
Bandara blamed the previous Rajapaksa regime for spending enormous funds on unnecessary development projects and neglecting the more important refinery projects. He said nearly 2.5 million dollars were required to improve refinery facilities which the government ought to undertake forthwith.
When there were adequate facilities to store 90,000 metric tonnes of fuel sufficient to last for 45 to 50 days it was intriguing to see as to why officials waited till the last moment till stocks were totally depleted.
He said resolving the fuel crisis was a government responsibility which could have been easily averted.

## Title: Policy interest rates to remain unchanged
## Supertitle:

Policy interest rates to remain unchanged
Considering developments in the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, the Monetary Board, at its meeting held on 06 November 2017, was of the view that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Accordingly, the policy interest rates of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka will remain unchanged at their current levels.
The decision of the Monetary Board is consistent with the objective of maintaining inflation at mid-single digit levels over the medium term and thereby facilitating a sustainable growth trajectory. The rationale underpinning the monetary policy stance is set out below.
Global economic activity is expected to strengthen further, according to the latest update of the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October 2017, driven by improvements in global trade and manufacturing. Alongside improved external conditions, the Sri Lankan economy is expected to perform better during the second half of the year as a result of the continued positive momentum of the Industry and Services sectors and the modest recovery in the Agriculture sector.
Although the economy remains vulnerable to supply-side disruptions stemming from weather related disturbances and rising global commodity prices, the implementation of the envisaged structural reforms and the realisation of inflows of foreign investments over the medium term are expected to improve the resilience of the economy.
Continued weather related disruptions weighed negatively on domestic food prices, which was reflected by the rise in headline inflation, measured using the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) as well as the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100).
However, core inflation, which is closely influenced by demand management policies, remained subdued reiterating that the recent escalation of headline inflation is supply driven and is of short term nature. Accordingly, inflation is
expected to moderate from December 2017 and reach the desired levels in 2018, underpinned by appropriate monetary conditions as well as the dissipation of the one-off effects of tax revisions on inflation.
In the monetary sector, the growth of credit to the private sector from commercial banks continued to moderate in September 2017 as envisaged. Net credit to the government (NCG) also recorded a decline largely on account of the retirement of Treasury bill holdings of the Central Bank. With repayments made by key public corporations, the declining trend in credit to public corporations observed since June 2017 continued in September as well. With improvements in net foreign assets (NFA) of both the Central Bank and commercial banks, overall NFA of the banking system turned positive in September 2017. The build-up of NFA also contributed to the expansion of broad money supply (M2b). Meanwhile, in response to improved rupee liquidity in the domestic money market, some bank interest rates moved downwards in recent months.
In the external sector, the improvement in export performance during the first eight months of the year was outweighed by the notable increase in import expenditure, particularly on fuel, rice, and gold. Accordingly, the cumulative trade deficit widened during the first eight months of the year. Although tourist arrivals and associated foreign exchange inflows grew on a cumulative basis, workers remittances continued its declining trend mainly due to geo-political uncertainties in the Middle East.
The rupee denominated government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) continued to attract foreign inflows. Amidst these developments, the Central Bank's cumulative purchases of foreign exchange from the domestic market exceeded US dollars 1.2 billion on a net basis, and gross official reserves improved to US dollars 7.5 billion by end October 2017 from US dollars 6.0 billion at end 2016.
With increased flexibility in the determination of the exchange rate, the pressure in the domestic foreign exchange market has eased considerably. This has limited the cumulative depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar to 2.5 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, in comparison to the depreciation of 3.8 per cent observed during the year 2016.
Against this backdrop, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent, respectively.

Presidential Committee to probe fuel shortage
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday appointed a Cabinet Sub-Committee to probe the cause of the crippling fuel shortage prevailing in the country.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga too had made a request from the President to appoint a committee to probe the issue.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee will investigate whether there was a delay in ordering the fuel consignment and the reasons for the sudden malfunctions in the oil refinery. The Committee will also probe how a consignment of substandard fuel arrived in Sri Lanka and whether that fuel stock was of a proper standard.
The sub-committee comprises Mega polis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama and Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
According to the findings of the investigations, action will be taken against those responsible for the crisis, the minister added.
Addressing the weekly SLFP press briefing in Colombo yesterday, the Minister said the primary reason for the fuel crisis was the delay in the shipment which was expected on November 2.
We are expecting another shipment today which will end the fuel shortage, he said. He said the biggest contributor to the shortage was impulse and panic buying on the part of consumers who feared an all out shortage.
We are glad that we stopped substantial fuel from entering the market. It is essential to improve the storage facility even though the previous government did not do so. But, the present government has formulated plans to increase the storage facility to avoid similar shortages in the future, he said.
Meanwhile, the vessel Neverska Lady which left Jabel Ali port on November 1 with a gross load of 27,505 tonnes was expected to arrive in Colombo shortly.
Demand has doubled
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga who tendered a public apology cited that the government had a buffer stock to cater to 80 percent of the demand until tomorrow (Wednesday). However, according to the CPC, the usual consumption of petrol which used to be at 2000 MT per day has doubled during the last three days, creating a scarcity in the market.
Emergency purchase expected to arrive today
In order to remedy the situation, CPC went into making emergency purchases in the spot market until the situation normalises. It is learnt that a shipment of 40,000 MT is expected today and that CPC has made arrangements for an emergency purchase of 85,000 barrels of petrol.
Rationing distribution and supply
In order to ration this distribution, Upali Marasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Petroleum Resource Development issued a circular yesterday requesting the owners of Petrol sheds islandwide not to sell petrol in bottles and cans and for it only to be pumped to vehicles. He added that due to unwarranted rumours of an all out shortage, people were queuing up with bottles and plastic cans. The move however has drawn flack from the Ceylon Motorcyclists Association who in a letter to the Minister pointed out that this mode of distribution was impractical since there are vehicles that would have stopped on the road after running out of fuel. It would also affect supply for generators and industrial machines that are used on a daily basis they said.
There were also reports of petrol being sold on the black market for higher prices. Marasinghe called on public to use petrol sparingly until the sheds were restocked with sufficient supplies.
LIOC denies all charges levelled against them
Amidst the furore over the shortage of fuel, is a blame game that has taken over centre stage. During a media briefing, the Minister said that they would usually import oil when the available stocks are down. In this case,what happened was stocks of the LIOC were below standards and we rejected it. There was pressure on me to accept the stocks, but I refused. Thereafter they promissed to get another shipment before the end of the month, but that did not arrive.
Meanwhile LIOC in a lengthy statement refuted the accusations caste on them adding that they only cater to 16% of the market share, while the rest is dominated by CPC. The large shortages across the country can only be caused by disruption in supplies of CPC, they said. Average daily sales of LIOC is 600 MT of petrol. Against this, as on date, LIOC has a buffer stock of 3500 MT of petrol at the Common User Facility (CUF), which is managed by CPSTL.
It may be noted that LIOC has adequate stocks of diesel at both trincomalee terminal and at CUF and normal daily diesel sales of 775 MT is continuously happening from all our sheds across the country. It is total misrepresentation of facts that diesel is not being sold by LIOC sheds.
They have also categorically denied rumors that they compelled CPC to buy the initial purchase of fuel which was found to contain particles of iron dust in them. Allegations that LIOC pressurised CPC to accept the original parcel without correction is totally false their communiqu clarified.
Furthermore they added that on various occasions in the past, LIOC has offered assistance to CPC to procure emergency shipments of petroleum products and will continue to do so whenever required. As a responsible petroleum company, at the times of strike, LIOC has always worked round the clock to make the product available to the citizens of the country.
Speculation over petrol price hike
Speculation is rife that there maybe an increase in fuel prices since the CPC had been forced to make spot purchases to avert the current fuel crisis. However, Minister Ranatunga told in that fuel prices will not be increased. The LIOC, however, has been agitating for a price hike due to mounting losses in the backdrop of a surge in international fuel prices.
High officials foreign travel barred during budget debate
The President has issued an order temporarily suspending foreign tours of all Ministry Secretaries, District Secretaries, Heads of Departments and Chairmen of state corporations and statuary boards.
This is during entire period of the budget debate starting from November 9, 2017.
Secretary to the President Austin Fernando has communicated the directive to all secretaries of ministries on November 2. He has also directed all Ministry Secretaries to inform all officials about this order.

Resurrecting Valachchenai, Embilipitiya Paper Mills
After several years in the doldrums, the Valachchenai and Embilipitiya National Paper Mills are expected to roar back to life as a public private partnership with a grant of US $ 20 million from South Korea.
The Valachchenai and Embilipitiya Paper Mills which had been a boon to thousands of families in the Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, became a bane with the closure of these factories as a result of various corrupt activities and a lack of political will to clean it up, thus forcing thousands of employees to become destitute and unemployed. Their lives became miserable as they lost their livelihood.
The families who were dependent on these factories are now struggling for their survival and the former employees who were earning a substantial salary from the mills are now involved in petty jobs to make ends meet.
The initiatives taken by the national unity government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to revive these national assets, have offered a chance to those who were dependent on these industries bringing new hope to the workers and their families.
German technical support for paper mills
Director of Yesvee Industries M Vijayakumar , Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Managing Director of YasveeIndustries S. Palaniappan and former competent authority of Valachchenai National Paper Mill Mangala Senarath. 
The Valachchenai Paper Mill is expected to resume full production in the third quarter of next year after a complete modification drive led by tremendous efforts taken by the former Competent Authority of Valachchenai National Paper Mill, Mangala Senarath.
According to Senarath, the Voith company in Germany and its South Asian agent Yesvee company based in Coimbatore, will provide technical assistance to revamp the paper mills under a new initiative.
This long overdue project has received the blessings of subject Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, State Minister Champika Premadasa and the political authority in the Eastern Province.
The political authority led by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Deputy Minister M.L.A.M. Hisbullah, State Minister Amir Ali and MP A. Yogeswaran, has hailed the initiative which will help uplift the economy of the people in the area.
This project has also received the Cabinet nod after a series of discussions held at official and ministerial levels at the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management.
A technical team from Yesvee Industries made a preliminary visit to these mills at the invitation of the former Competent Authority of Valachchenai Mill, Senarath last year, to ascertain the areas that require development and refurbishment.
They found that the existing machines at Valachchenai Paper Mill needed to be revamped and upgraded as their wear and tear would result in an increase in the cost of production.
This technical team also found that many parts of the paper mill had also been removed and the remain,ing equipment had corroded as part of the machine had been submerged.
The capacity of the board machine at Valachchenai is to be increased to 50 tons a day for 150 GSM Kraft and Board and 100 tons per day for the GSM Chip Board after revamping the existing machines.
The capacity of the paper machine is also to be augmented to produce 30 tons per day for 52 GSM printing and writing grades and 50 tons per day for 100+ GSM low BF Kraft.
Head of the Indian team and Managing Director of Yesvee Industries S. Palaniappan at a recent media conference divulged the present scenario of these paper mills.
He said that many of the parts in these machines were missing and that many parts of the control room had been taken away.
Revamping of machines
He was of the view that production cost could be reduced drastically once the machines were revamped. Palaniappan further stressed the importance of revamping these machines to reduce electricity and steam consumption.
A ton of paper costs 3200 electricity units and this situation should be arrested by revamping the machines, he said.
We specialize in revamping, dismantling and repairing Voith paper and board machines around the world," he added.
He said his technical team participated in the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management headed by former Finance Ministry Secretary R. Paskaralingam and pointed out how production could be streamlined through the revamping of the machines.
Palaniappan added that these two mills would guarantee more than 2,500 direct and indirect employment to the people in these areas once operations commence.
The revamping of these machines are expected to take up to 10 - 12 months, thereafter these machines would not require major repairs for the next 20 years.
Sri Lanka has a surplus of raw materials to manufacture boards and paper. Sri Lanka could meet its entire paper and board demand locally, if these mills resume operation after the revamping drive, he said.
Releasing their inspection report to the media, Palaniappan added that his company expected to start revamping two machines at Valachchenai Paper Mill and one machine at Embilipitiya Mill by January next year while the process would be completed by the end of 2018.
History of the Valachchenai Paper Mill
The Valachchenai Paper Mill built in 1955 started commercial operations in 1956 and the Mill became a state owned venture in 1976.
Reports say more than 3,000 workers were employed at the mill in the 1970s and it had funded the expansion into a second paper mill at Embilipiya in 1976.
Both these public ventures fulfilled 70 per cent of country's paper demand until terrorism engulfed the Eastern Province in the 1990s.
Former Competent Authority of the company, Senarath, while thanking South Korea for granting necessary funds for the resumption of operations at these mills said he was confident that he would be able to turn these state ventures into profitable ventures.
He also thanked the government and South Korean representative, Kim Duck for placing faith in his potential for the development of these mills.

Sajans hurricane 266 steers Panadura Leeds
A hurricane 266 in 135 balls including 26 hits to the rope and 18 above it by Sajan Priyamadu propelled Leeds International School, Panadura to a mammoth 254-run first innings victory against Kamburawala Vidyalaya in their under-13 Division III cricket match at Baduraliya recently.
Batting first Kamburawala Vidyalaya lads were restricted to a paltry 88 runs by the strong Leeds bowling attack led by Lakshan Sameera who did the main damage by capturing 4/31. The one and only Kamburawala batsman who showed some resistance was Rashmika Denuwan who battled a solitary fight with 41 runs. Kasun Gajendra, Sajan Priyamadu and Lakmal Sampath shared two wickets each for the Panadura team.
In reply Panadura boys continued their run chase at a usual pace until the number four batsman Sajan stepped into the ground who brought the run-storm with his superb batting performance. He seemed simply unstoppable and hammered boundaries and sixes across the ground with great confidence and power. None of the Kamburawala bowlers were able to tame him until he reaches 266 runs in an innings full of action. Dineth Sheveen and Lakshan Sameera scored 39 and 23 runs respectively as Panadura Leeds posted 342/7 at stumps when the play was stopped due to bad light. Sunera Prabhatiya (2/80) and Sithum Dananjaya (2/107) bowled best for Kamburawala Vidyalaya.

Sarvodaya Development Finance shows impressive results in 1H
Sarvodaya Development Finance, the pioneer in microfinance in Sri Lanka, has shown significant growth based on the 6 months financial results ending September 30, 2017.
The company has recorded a significant growth in terms of net profit after tax in 2017, compared to the corresponding period of the previous financial year. 2017 has marked a year of accomplishment and impactful growth for Sarvodaya Finance, the financial services arm of the Sarvodaya Movement, thrusting the company towards the forefront of Sri Lankas microfinance sector.
Commenting on the significant growth achieved by Sarvodaya Finance, Chairman of Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited Channa de Silva underscored that the company has successfully transitioned from a basic micro finance firm to a fully-fledged financial institution, involved in funding leasing, SMEs, personal loans and pawning.
Going beyond the ordinary banking norms, we have constantly strived to empower people from the grassroots. Our profits are circulated through Sarvodaya Movement to empower rural communities and fund numerous social service programs.
We offer loans for beneficiaries in rural and urban communities for conveniently affordable rates. During calamities such as floods and drought, we have always been in the forefront to support the affected businesses in times of need.

Expressing his views on the current economic trends, De Silva further added that the time has come for the country to re-examine its approach to the challenges of development with a new mindset.
Economic policies should be redrafted to strengthen the rupee to at least the 1990s level, while fiscal and monetary policies should be reviewed to create an environment of low interest rates and low taxes, leading to a backdrop that encourages entrepreneurial activity and employment creation, De Silva further said.

## Title: Some conditions in new Inland Revenue Act not export friendly - NCCSL

Some conditions in new Inland Revenue Act not export friendly - NCCSL
As the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka(NCCSL) in a communique acknowledges that there was compelling requirement for the Government to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act.
Some of the reasons being, in the recent past the Government tax revenue as a percentage of GDP has come down to approximately 12%; total interest payment of the loans taken by the Government is also remaining in the range of 36% of the Government revenue and the fact being debt to GDP ratio is in the range of 79%;the FDI to GDP ratio is also remaining below 1% which is an unhealthy situation for the progress of the economy. With this background, it has become extremely important for the Government to streamline the revenue side with the newly introduced Inland Revenue Act. It is noteworthy that the Government has taken a very positive approach during the draft stage of the Inland Revenue Act where they accommodated large number of amendments based on the private sector and expert consultations. Initial steps of revenue side policy changes took place around November 2016 by increasing the VAT percentage which resulted increase of inflation in the country.
After consulting some of the corporate tax paying companies, it was noted that some of the conditions included in the Act is not export friendly, specially for startup companies engaged in exports. To be more specific, any Company producing services or goods will have to export more than 80% of their produce to qualify for tax benefits, given for exports. In an environment where total exports of the country remains around 15% of the GDP, more lucrative policy changes are required to addressthe prevailing situation.
Further the Small and Medium Sector (SME) threshold previously was at Rs 750 million and now it has been brought down to Rs.500 million, which might not be encouraging environment for SMEs.
SMEs play a vital role in the economic development of a country, both by ways of contributing towards the overall productivity of the country as well as providing of jobs both for the skilled as well as semi-skilled workers. Hence the Government should have a Tax Structure for SMEs and should be one that would motivate and encourage more investments in SMEs in the future.
In Sri Lanka, the market capitalization as a percentage of GDP around 25%, which has a negative effect on the collection of taxes, therefore it is essential that every measure should be taken to increase the market capitalization as a percentage of GDP, whereby collection of taxes make possible with formal listed companies in the economy.
From the point of the business community the main advantages are, the provisions of the new Act are easier to read and understand and taxpayers may be able to manage their tax affairs on their own, than under the old Act.
The New Inland Revenue Act proposes to do away with the deduction of Withholding Tax on Government Securities and Bonds and the granting of notional credit for Withholding Tax which can be set off against future tax payments. This comes into effect from April 1, 2018. The effect of this for investors after April 2018 is that the interest income earned will be taxed on whatever tax rate that is applicable for them.
However for Investors who have invested in Government Securities and Bonds maturing beyond April 1,2018 will be subjected to being taxed twice, i.e once by way of Withholding Tax for which no notional credit is available and secondly when their Interest Income is taxed upon maturity at whatever tax rate that is applicable to them.
The National Chamber believes that the competitive tax structure should be retained to encourage most sought after FDI inflows to the economy. Since it is the expectation of the Government to connect the economy to global value chain, the National Chamber is of the view introduction of tax structure would be competitive enough to attract FDIs and to maintain competitive cost advantage.
Furthermore, payment of NBT on accrual basis would be a difficult matter for the construction Industry due to cash flow issue resulting from delayed collection of revenue.
The National Chamber believes, further improvements in the Act, should be discussed with the relevant stakeholders in the private sector,with the view of creating a conducive business environment.
The Chamber fully endorses the efforts to modernize the tax system and we look forward to an early opportunity to engage with the authorities to discuss our suggestions and concerns.

Space for techno savvy kids
In a world where knowledge has become an increasingly ubiquitous commodity thanks to the internet, learnability is slowly but surely replacing it in the classroom as the single most important trait that younger students need to be inculcated in. So says Founder of IgniterSpace Hasith Yaggahavita, who believes that training children in critical thinking ought to take precedence over spoonfeeding them information.
An engineer by profession, Yaggahavita founded IgniterSpace in March 2016 with the objective of filling a much needed gap in technology-driven creativity education for children. The father-of-two is a strong advocate of an education methodology that gives priority to developing creative abilities over drilling in knowledge. This is a core belief thats reflected in the refreshingly practical approach to technology education employed at his first-of-its-kind makerspace. In just over a year, IgniterSpace has grown into a fully-fledged institute supported by state-run tech giants such as COSTI, SLASSCOM and ICTA, and employs over 15 full-time and 30 part-time instructors.
Yaggahavita is highly critical of the prevailing culture of force-feeding knowledge and evaluating students on their ability to regurgitate that knowledge.
The current education philosophy was designed hundreds of years ago for the purpose of retaining knowledge. At schools, we feed children information. We expect them to remember that information, and test for accuracy at exams. In many ways, we expect children to become walking encyclopaedias. It might have worked in the past but there is an issue with this model today, he says.
Yaggahavita believes that knowledge is a perishable commodity, in that what one learns today may be invalidated by a new discovery made tomorrow.
This is specifically true in the rapidly advancing tech-era. Simply having knowledge does not guarantee the usefulness of it, he opines.
The internet and its increasingly wide accessibility, what with the high penetration rates of broadband and smartphones in the country, has also resulted in knowledge no longer offering the competitive advantage that it once did. Its no longer a differentiator, says Yaggahavita.
A 15-year-old with an internet connection may even outperform a professional with regard to mere knowledge. Today, in many ways, there is no practical use of recording the complete encyclopedia in your head, he says.
Needless to say, Yaggahavita hastens to add, knowledge is still very important. But its crucial that educators realise that there are other, arguably more important factors that also come into play, such as creativity, skillfulness and learnability, which is the ability to acquire knowledge efficiently and effectively, and use it in a meaningful way.
In this rapidly changing the world, what defines our success is not what we know, but rather, our ability to learn what we dont know. Being knowledgeable does not imply learnability, but the reverse definitely holds true. One could make a child knowledgeable in a chosen field by feeding her a ton of relevant information; but she may not know how to acquire new knowledge independently, says Yaggahavita, using the proverb give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime to illustrate his point.
Yaggahavita has identified seven methods in which effective and efficient learning can be implemented:
= Asking the right question and asking it correctly
= Reading, observing, measuring and listening critically
= Learning through creative thinking and experimentation
= Writing, teaching and other ways of organising knowledge
= Reasoning, analysing, classifying and systems thinking
= Inferring and interpretation of what is already known
= Collaborative communications and discussions
While knowledge and the ability to retain that knowledge is by no means completely redundant - not yet, anyway - simply possessing knowledge can take you only so far, he says, adding that the difference between a great career and a mediocre one is often determined by the learnability and the skills possessed by the person - not by his knowledge.
Yaggahavita also opines that essential traits such as social skills, teaching skills, management skills or engineering skills can only be mastered through practice.
IgniterSpace approaches education with the view that skills must be specifically stimulated alongside the knowledge, and Yaggahavita calls for a change in attitude that prioritises learnability, creativity and skills development.
He says: We must create opportunities for children to pragmatically apply knowledge through scenarios and activities. IgniterSpaces way of education is a result of this thinking. At such makerspaces, children learn technology through hands-on creations - not by attending a lecture.

Starc creates history with second hat-trick in same match
Mitchell Starc became the first bowler in nearly 40 years - and the first in Australia - to claim two hat-tricks in the same first-class match when he blasted out Western Australias last three batsmen to claim outright points for New South Wales against Western Australia at Hurstville Oval.
Having gone wicketless in the second innings up to that point, Starc had Jason Behrendorff caught behind and then bowled David Moody with the last two balls of his 15th over, then returned to have Jon Wells caught at slip by the captain Steven Smith with the first ball of his 16th. This hat-trick followed another on day three of the Sheffield Shield match, when he had dismissed Behrendorff, Moody and Simon Mackin.
Starcs feat was the first instance since Amin Lakhani managed to do the same for a Combined XI against the Indian tourists in a match at Multan in 1978. Overall only seven other bowlers have taken two hat-tricks in the same match, and only one Australian T.J. Matthews doing so against South Africa at Manchester in 1912. Matthews feat is also the only time two hat-tricks have been taken by a bowler in the same Test match.
Smith said that Starcs old-ball angle from around the wicket and reversing the ball away was fiendishly difficult to deal with for any batsman. He also complimented Hazlewood for his excellent rhythm throughout his first match back from injury.
Theyve found it pretty hard for a long period of time, the shape that he gets, the angle that he creates when going so wide, Smith said. Its difficult for batters, let alone tail-enders. To take two hat-tricks in a game ... most people are lucky to take one in their career. Theyre not easy to come by.
I thought [Hazlewood] bowled like an absolute genius, hes a superstar. Starcy, I think, has probably taken a little more time to get going and get some rhythm. But the back end of today showed why hes world-class. Patty Cummins has had a couple of good games as well. Theyre up and going and bowling really well.
Starc and Cummins will rest from the final round of Shield matches before the first Ashes Test while Hazlewood will play against Queensland in Brisbane.

He also said that Sri Lanka should be digitised at all levels including economic, education and administrative sectors to become a successful competitor in the global market.
Premier Wickremesinghe,while pointing out Sri Lanka is to fund a colossal amount of debt in the coming two years, stated that, adding value to human resources and labour through digitization is a timely measure to support such economic challenges.
We must accelerate our economic growth and increase our export industry. For that we need to approach the global market. The global economy has become extremely competitive due to digital technology. Sri Lanka must reap the benefits of digitisation from using it to enhance our human resources. Digitised human resources will increase our competitiveness in the global market, PM Wickremesinghe observed.
Keeping in line with this LGN project, we will give tablets to all Advanced Level students in the country as well. That means, within these two years we have provided five hundred thousand tablets. Why do we do this We do this to equip our country with latest technology and modernize it, PM Wickremesinghe also pointed out.
PM Wickremesinghe also commended several Sri Lankan private companies for excelling in digitized economy and becoming global competitors in provided services such as designing and rubber industry.
The upgraded Lanka Government Network 2.0 is a part of the national policy of Digitisation of Economy, powered by Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA).

Trump lands in China for talks with Xi amid N Korea tensions

US President Donald Trump has arrived in China for a visit likely to focus heavily on trade and tensions with North Korea.
He has landed in Beijing where Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping has a lavish reception planned for him.
Earlier,in a speech to the South Korean parliament, Trump urged China to sever ties with North Korea.
Trump is in China as part of a five-nation tour of Asia. He has also visited Japan so far.
Before his arrival, Trump piled praise on Xi, saying he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president after "his great political victory".
Mr Xi recently consolidated his power, at a Chinese Communist Party congress, a move analysts say will make him less likely to reach compromise with Trump.
Despite his congratulations, there are tensions between the two men, with Trump having attacked China over its allegedly unfair trade practices.
The US president and his wife Melania are scheduled to visit the Forbidden City, for centuries the home of China's emperors, followed by afternoon tea.
What did Trump say about North Korea
His arrival came just hours after his speech in the South Korean capital Seoul, in which he described North Korea as "a hell that no person deserves".
North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has sparked international alarm, with Pyongyang carrying out its biggest nuclear test yet in September. In typically stark language, Trump warned the North: "Do not underestimate us. Do not try us."
But there were hints though he might be open to a deal, telling the North "we will offer you a path for a better future".
Singling out Russia and China, he urged "all responsible nations" to isolate the North, and fully implement UN sanctions, downgrade diplomatic ties and sever trade and technology ties.
"You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept," he said.
China is North Korea's only major ally, but says it is committed to the UN sanctions and argues its leverage is overestimated.

UK diesel car sales fall by nearly a third in October
Sales of diesel cars in the UK fell by nearly a third in October compared with last year, prompting the motor industry to call for help in the Budget.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) wants to see government-backed incentives to encourage people to buy low emission diesel vehicles.
Overall vehicle sales fell by more than 12%, marking the seventh consecutive month of declines.
The SMMT blamed a drop in business and consumer confidence for the fall.
So far this year, new vehicle registrations are down by 4.6%.
Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel, said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive.

US announces grant to promote religious freedom in Sri Lanka
The US has announced a grant of nearly USD 5,00,000 for organisations which can come up with ideas and projects to promote religious freedom in India and Sri Lanka.
The Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, in its notice, said it seeks to "reduce religiously-motivated violence and discrimination in India" through its USD 493,827 programme.
And for Sri Lanka, it seeks to ensure that authorities at all levels of government in Sri Lanka effectively implement national laws and policies protecting religious freedom.
Recipient of both the India Programme and Sri Lanka  with similar objectives of religious freedom and protection  would be announced after screening of applications in this regard, it said.
For India, the state department wants the applying organisation to come up with proposals to develop and implement early warning systems to mitigate large-scale violence; and implement conflict mitigation programs between minority and majority groups.
The applicant also needs to ideate successful programme activities to counter hateful or discriminatory public messages with positive messages using all kinds of media.
The state department also wants the applicants to come up with ideas to educate civil society and journalists about legal protections for religious freedom, particularly for members of religious minorities; document and report religious freedom violations to authorities; and educate law enforcement on human rights standards.
The State Department did not respond immediately to a set of questions on the necessity of such a grant.
According to the information available on the state department's website, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor supports over 28 democracy, human rights, and labour programmes in South and Central Asia (SCA).
Current funding for these programmes exceeds USD 17 million.
Programme topics include media innovation and development, gender advocacy and equality, and improving protections for political, labour, and human rights.
India is not among the countries listed by the state department as recipient of these funding programmes.
The countries currently receiving grants from the US in the region are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kazakhastan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
In its latest International Religious Freedom report, the state department said Christian and Muslim activists stated the government was not doing enough to protect them against religiously motivated attacks.
There were reports of religiously motivated killings, assaults, riots, discrimination, vandalism, and actions restricting the right of individuals to practice their religious beliefs and proselytize, it said.
There was an increase in violent incidents by cow protection groups against mostly Muslim victims, including killings, mob violence, assaults, and intimidation.
Hindus threatened and assaulted Muslims and Christians and destroyed their property, it added.
According to the Evangelical Fellowship of India (EFI), there were more than 300 incidents of abuse targeting Christians during the year, compared with 177 in 2015.
Incidents included assaults on missionaries, forced conversions of non-Hindus, and attacks on churches, schools, and private property.
As for Sri Lanka, the state department notice of funding opportunity said it seeks to ensure that authorities at all levels of government in Sri Lanka effectively implement national laws and policies protecting religious freedom.

US, Sri Lanka affirm stance against North Korea
The US and Sri Lanka will stand together against the threats of North Koreas nuclear weapons programme, and terrorist groups like ISIS, senior delegates from both countries said in a joint statement on Monday.
We are strong partners and today our relations are at an all-time high, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon said.
The US and Sri Lanka concluded their second round of partnership talks Monday evening, following a one-day visit by Ambassador Shannon.
Shannon and Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said that since the first round of talks in February 2016, the countries have advanced an agenda of economic, social, and military collaboration.
On a global scale, Shannon and Kariyawasam said, they discussed the grave threats posed by terrorist groups like the Islamic State, or ISIS, and North Koreas unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
More locally, the United States and Sri Lanka agreed that the security, stability, and prosperity of the Indian Ocean region should be safeguarded, they said. To that end, the officials shared the intention to further promote cooperation and exchanges in maritime security and safety, including anti-piracy measures.
Shannon said the U.S. Coast Guard would be offering Sri Lanka a second Secretary Class High Endurance Cutter, pending congressional notification.
He said the U.S. would work to return Peace Corps volunteers to Sri Lanka, and he announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would award $21 million to strengthen the countrys dairy sector.
Shannon added that though he wished Sri Lankas process of post-war reconciliation would go faster, the United States would support Sri Lanka through the process.
He said the US welcomed progress on constitutional reform, the return of private land held by security forces, and the establishment of an independent and permanent Office of Missing Persons.
Obviously we all want a fast pace, and nobody wants it more than the Sri Lankan people, he said.

US supports Sri Lanka bid to become regional trade hub

The United States expressed its support to develop Sri Lanka as a regional hub for trade and investment in Asia, which would connect trade flows among ASEAN, India, the Middle East, and Africa through free and open seas that would be the key to growth of the region, says the joint statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka and the U.S. Department of State on the Sri Lanka-United States Partnership Dialogue held at Colombo on Nov. 6.
Led by Sri Lanka Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam and US Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon, the Partnership Dialogue demonstrates the consolidation of cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka, and serves to further strengthen and enhance bilateral relations in the widest sense, through regular and structured engagement.
It further states that as fellow democracies, the two governments resolved to work together toward a free and open Indo-Pacific region and for greater peace and stability around the world. The United States and Sri Lanka agreed that the security, stability, and prosperity of the Indian Ocean region should be safeguarded through the promotion of a rules-based order which would ensure that all countries that enjoy the global commons respect international laws and norms.
Both countries agreed to advance this vision for peace and stability regionally and in international fora and stressed the particular importance of the freedom of navigation and overflight and of maintaining a maritime order based on the rule of law including unimpeded commerce, and they shared the intention to further promote cooperation and exchanges in maritime security and safety, including anti- piracy measures. Sri Lanka emphasized its need, as an island nation, to build maritime capacity so that it can effectively patrol its own borders and safeguard its marine resources.
The United States expressed its support for Sri Lanka through trade, investment, foreign assistance and direct partnership with stakeholders throughout the country and remains committed to a strong economic partnership and robust trade relationship with Sri Lanka.

A campaign launched by members of the UPFA administered Wayamba Provincial Council joined with the Joint Opposition to protest against the current fuel shortage by travelling in bullock carts to attend the Council meeting yesterday, frittered out as only five members opted to come in the bullock cart to the Council meeting.
All other minsters and council members ignored their clarion call and travelled in their official cars to attend the council meeting yesterday.
The five members who came to the meeting in a bullock cart were Piyumal Herath, Sumith Rajapaksa, D.B. Herath, Samanpriya Herath and Ashoka Premadasa.
They too tried a mere publicity stunt by boarding the bullock cart about 200 metres away from the Provincial Council Complex after parking their official vehicles near the Kurunegala Wath-himi Bandara Devalaya premises.

When hands express
The word hand gestures generally mean the figure works of the hand fingers. In the day to day human life, besides the oral language, the hand gesture language also plays a vital role. The oral languages of the people differ from place to place and country to country. Even the style of speaking of the same oral language also differs from one area to other. But the hand gesture language is same to all over the world.
The hand gesture language plays important role in the Indian classical dances, to interpret the meaning of the songs. Among the classical dances of the world, the Indian classical dances occupy an important place in the world which are intermingled and close to day to day life of the masses. The facial expressions and the hand gesture language used by the humans, all over the world are the same.
Single hand gestures
In the Indian classical dances, the hand gestures are generally divided into two major categories. One is single hand gestures and the other is double hand gestures. The number of gestures generally differs from text to text. In Bharatha Natyam the total number of single hand gestures is around 30 to 32. Meanwhile the total number of double hand gestures used in Bharatha Natyam is around 28 to 30. Anyhow two or three different types of hand gestures are illustrated under one name.
Both these single hand gestures and double hand gestures are further divided into two more categories. One is Ellil hands, (beauty hands, or grace hands). And the other is Thollil Hands (working hands) to illustrate the meaning of the songs. Ellil hands are used only in adavus (steps).
This category of Ellil gestures are only used in the Nirtha division of dance. Thats why these hands are often called Nirtha hands or Nirtha hasthas. These hands do not reveal any meaning but add beauty to the hands. More or less altogether 13 gestures are included in this category including some single hand gestures and some double hand gestures.
Double hand gestures
The gestures used for Abinaya (interpretation of the meaning of the song), are called Nirthya hasthas or Nirthya gestures. In this category, all the single and double hand gestures are used.
In Sanskrit, the gestures are called Hasthas. The single hand gestures are called Asamutha Hasthas and double hand gestures are called Samutha Hasthas. Yet the total number of gestures differs from text to text.
Each gesture has numerous usages. The use of each gesture is clearly described in various ancient texts. Yet in Bharatha Natyam and in other South Indian classical dances we still use these gestures with the same sense and effect with the same prescribed illustrations in texts.
Among all the Indian classical dance forms, Bharatha Natyam, Kathakali, Kuchupidi, Oddissi, and Mohini Attam use the hand gestures widely. But some dance forms only use a certain restricted number of hand gestures. Among all the India classical dance forms, Bharatha Natyam and Kuchupidi use the maximum number of hand gestures.
Normally the role of gestures is not clearly and firmly demarcated within a chosen limit. Practically the use or handling the hand gestures totally depended on the imaginative creativity of each individual artiste, and the personal ability of the artiste in the Nirthya aspect of dance.
Indian classical forms
In Kathakali the gestures are used on the basis of the ancient text Hastha Lakshana Deepika. Altogether more or less 24 fundamental gestures are used in Kathakali. Like most of the other Indian classical forms, in Kathakali the meaning of the songs, (moods and emotions) are illustrated, expressed and interpreted through facial expressions and hand gestures (hasthas).
In Odissi, like Bharatha Natyam, hasthas or hand gestures are used in pure Nirtha and Nirthya. Abinaya Darpana is an ancient Sanskirit text believed to have been written by Nanthikeswarar.
This is the main source for the dancers to learn about the hand gestures. Beside this, various treatises are available to provide valuable information regarding the hand gestures. Like Bharatha Natyam and Kathakali, Oddissi also derives its hand gesture source from Abhinaya Darpanam and Abinaya Chandrika.
The Andhra Pradesh classical dance form Kuchupidi which, has its close links with Tamil Nadu classical dance form Bharath Natyam. Hence both these classical dance forms use the hand gestures extensively in Nirtha and Nirthya. Kuchupidi is a drama based classical dance form, which uses more realistic and dramatic expressions in the dance. Hence it extensively uses more facial expressions and hand gestures.
Mohini Attam which is another attractive classical dance form. It is a fusion dance form of Bharatha Natyam and Kathakali. It also uses the same hand gestures to a great extent. Meanwhile many times various varieties of folk dances are used in numerous traditional hand gestures to interpret the meaning of the songs.
Sculptural gestures
Another division of hand gestures is called sculptural gestures. These sculptural hasthas or sculptural gestures look almost similar to dance gestures. But essentially and basically the use of the sculptural gestures differs from the dance gestures to certain extent. These hand gestures are often referred to as Kai Ammaithi in Tamil.
The Hindu temple towers are always decorated with sculptures and sculptural gestures. These hand gestures are used to interpret the meaning of the religious epics. Meanwhile, in dance, the poses and abhinaya are used to interpret the meaning of the songs through gestures. The sculptural gestures are carved in stones or made out of the combined mixture of cement, but sometimes the shapes are quite different from the natural dance hand gestures.

## Title: Why does Taylor Swift write so many one-note melodies

Why does Taylor Swift write so many one-note melodies

It's easy to get distracted by her celebrity, but Taylor Swift is a once-in-a-generation songwriter.
From the very beginning, she's displayed a knack for melody and storytelling that most artists never master.
Take, for example, her first US number one,Our Song.
Written for a high school talent show, it's a fairly typical tale of teenage romance until the final lines: "I grabbed a pen / And an old napkin / And I wrote down our song."
That's smart, self-assured song writing for someone who wasn't old enough to vote. Notably, the lyrics insert the musician directly into the narrative - something she developed into a tried and tested trope.
But Our Song also establishes another of Taylor's trademarks: The one-note melody.
These static vocal lines, where she sings at one pitch for a sustained period, crop up on all of her albums - and increase in frequency when she switches lanes from country to pop.
You can hear it on all four songs she's released ahead of her new record, Reputation, which comes out this Friday. It's most apparent on the lead single,Look What You Made Me Do, where the entire chorus is delivered in a sinister monotone.
But it's less of a cop-out than you might think, and here's why.
Taylor Swift's career is built on being accessible. She might have 10 Grammy awards, but she recently invited loyal fans to an album playback at her oceanfront mansion in Rhode Island. In 2008, when she was 18 years old, she accompanied another fan, Whit Wright, to his prom in Alabama. She regularly delivers handwritten notes and gift packages to her Instagram followers.
Repetitive melodies that centre around a single note are part of that appeal. They emphasise her relatability by mimicking the cadence of speech.
It helps that her lyrics are effortlessly conversational and vernacular. "We are never, ever getting back together" is a clumsy song title but it makes perfect sense in Taylor's brand of teen-speak. The impression is that you're hanging out with a friend, chatting about boys (and it's almost always about boys).
Taylor uses the device most often in verses, shifting the chords beneath her voice to give the melody a sense of movement, in the same way that moving a light around the room casts different shadows.
When the chorus soars up the musical scale, it's like a rush of energy. The emotional highs become even higher. And, as I am not the first to point out, she has a flair for melodrama.
Taylor didn't invent these one-note melodies, of course. Gregorian chant, one of the earliest recorded forms of Western music, was predominantly monotone.
"A lot of that had to do with understanding the text - because this is religious text and they want people to understand the words that they're singing," said musicologist Scott Interrante in apodcast on the phenomenon of one-note melodies.
"That's important to think about in our modern pop songs," he added. "It might have a lot to do with the words".
Let's scrub out the word "might". Taylor really, really wants us to pay attention to her lyrics.
"I wouldn't be a singer if I weren't a songwriter,"she told Billboard in 2014. "I have no interest in singing someone else's words."
If you believe the tabloids, she spends most of her time warbling about famous ex-boyfriends and feuds with fellow pop stars - but if you pay attention, Swift's catalogue is full of deft lyrical minutiae.
In fact, she has the rare ability to tell a whole story in the space of a sentence:
"She wears short skirts / I wear t-shirts / She's cheer captain / And I'm on the bleachers" (You Belong With Me)
"We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light" (All Too Well)
"I never saw you coming/ And I'll never be the same" (State of Grace)
"Darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream" (Blank Space)
"Remember when you hit the brakes too soon / Twenty stitches in a hospital room" (Out Of The Woods)
That last one is particularly interesting. The car accident was real, and Taylor sings the (one-note) melody with uncommon urgency over a turbulent backing track.
"I put it in the song knowing it was an evocative lyric,"she told NPR in 2014. "And it was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship, and they don't know everything that happens in my life, and I can have something really major and traumatic happen to me and they don't know about it."
On this year'sLook What You Made Me Do, she uses the one-note melody in another way - to convey anger and defiance.
The target here is Kanye West, who stage-crashed her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and has dogged her career ever since.
"I don't like your wicked games," she spits, "The role you made me play / Of the fool / No, I don't like you."
Her delivery is clipped and defensive. The conversational tone is replaced by a threat. (Incidentally, that's probably why the song took such a battering in the media: Bitter Taylor isn't as appealing as unlucky-in-love-but-shaking-it-off Taylor.)
Another of Taylor's key traits is to shout key lines for emphasis: "We never go OUT OF STYLE"; "Are we in the clear yet, IN THE CLEAR YET GOOD!"; "All you had to do was STAY (STAY) STAY (STAY)".
Again, she's using rhetorical tricks to drive home her point - and by doing so, she's taking her place in the pop pantheon.
Songwriters like John Lennon and Morrissey, who place equal emphasis on their lyrics, also tend to utilise one-note melodies. And then there's rap, whose rhythmic ebb and flow exerts an increasingly strong gravitational pull on pop writers.
In fact, static melodies are cropping up all over the place, on Dua Lipa'sNew Rules, Post Malone'sRockstar, and Khalid'sYoung Dumb & Broke.
None of this is to suggest that Taylor is incapable of writing a melody. Of her new tracks, the love songGorgeousis both the most heartfelt and the most traditionally "songy".
But her masterpiece is a song calledRonan- a little-known charity single, released in 2012. It was written about Ronan Thompson, a four-year-old boy who died of a rare form of cancer.
After reading a blog written by the boy's mother, Maya Thompson, Taylor turned her words into a song: "I remember your bare feet, down the hallway / I remember your little laugh / Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs / I love you to the moon and back."
In other hands, it could have been saccharine and exploitative. It isn't. Taylor's delicate delivery, and the sorrowful contours of her melody are simply devastating.
If you ever had any doubts, Ronan settles it: Taylor Swift is anything but a one-note pop star.

World Travel Centre launches  dedicated sports tourism arm
For the first time a Sri Lanka Travel Company, World Travel Centre has opened a dedicated arm to promote both inbound and outbound sports tourism.
The sports tourism though has tremendous potential is rather neglected in Sri Lanka and we thought to promote it in a professional manner, said Sudharman De Silva, Chainman, WTC.
He said that they have also created a special dedicated team headed by former Cricketer Basil Jayewardene for this purpose. A former Sri Lankan cricketer himself Jayewardene said that they have been organsing many sports tours in the past 15 years and now decided to create a dedicated arm for it. We will also be hosting Sri Lankas first over 40 international T20 cricket carnivals next January in Colombo involving teams from 5 test playing countries. We are also looking at hosting a similar event for Golfers early next year. We are also launching a campaign to create what would be Sri Lankas first Barmy Army cheering squad with few cricket enthusiast spectators who wish to travel when ever Sri Lanka is going overseas and also playing in Sri Lanka. We will offer them a complete package.
WTC has been in the tourism industry for more than 25 years, not only catering to tourists arriving from different parts of the Globe to Sri Lanka (inbound) but also tourists from Sri Lanka to different parts of the world (outbound).
Basil Jayewardene head of the Sports Tourism Unit, at World Travel Centre, said that they have contracted with several local sports bodies in cricket, tennis golf, basketball, athletics, football and rugby to promote inbound and outbound sports tourism.
We have also Susanthika Jayasinghe Sports Academy, former test Captain Bandula Warnapura along with several past sportsmen signed up with us and are mainly looking at promoting altitude training for overseas athletes in hill country through this. Jayewardene also said that they will also organize foreign training programs for young cricketers, tennis and athletes mainly in London and Australia. Here again we have a contract with EICA Elite International Cricket Academy in Hampshire UK and Cachet Leisure in UK to offer these training packages in their sports complex. These two sports complexes has their own stadium, track, gym. pool and hostels. This service would also be available for coachers and umpires to get a foreign qualification for them.The WTC will also looking at offering a complete package for any sports team going overseas as well.
WTC is approved by Sri Lanka Tourism as a Destination Management Company and is a member of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and also is an IATA Accredited Travel Agency.

Young hearts glittering with victory
Establishing national reconciliation is not a duty of the government alone, said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga at the Award Ceremony of the All Island Essay and Art Competition recently. The civil society should take up the leadership in accomplishing it.
Kumaratunga, who is also the Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, fostered the event which was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The competition was held under the theme Unity in Diversity is the Strength of Our Nation and was organized by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and the Bakeer Markar Center for National Unity. Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Secretary to the President Austin Fernando were also present at the event.
Leaders who belonged to different races and religions held hands and fought for freedom [in the past], Kumaratunga said further. After we achieved freedom, racism and religious intolerance began for various reasons. And no government was brave enough to address the rights of minorities, she remarked.
But now, the background and the weapons needed to achieve unity have been given by the government and it is the societys turn to take the task into their hands and proceed to resolve the matter, Kumaratunga stated.
Corrupt politicians have been spreading racism in the country. They are those who are unable to come to power in any other way, Kumaratunga said. Some Buddhist monks in robes spread extremism and religious intolerance, trying to set the nation on fire. But there are many other real Buddhist monks who are against it, who work hard, silently, for the peace and reconciliation of the nation. But only the extremists are being portrayed in the media.
The young hearts were excited. Nervous. They would look at you with wide, unsmiling eyes but when they heard the words What do you feel about your victory their somber faces would break into a wide smile, eyes softening as if sunshine breaking through clouds.
Im on top of the world! exclaimed young Haala Marikar who had won the All Island first place in Senior English Essay competition. The student of Badiuddin Mahmud Girls College, Kandy had not expected the victory. This competition has been a good venture, she said with a beaming face. Training young minds to think like this is something much needed in a society with a lot of racism.
Asela Pieris of Gnanodaya Maha Vidyalaya, Kaluthara who secured All Island second place in Senior Art competition shared the same joy of Marikar. Through his piece of art, he tried to convey the message that as a nation, we all should be united. We should shed our differences and walk into the future as children of one mother.
The winners received a cash prize from ONUR through the Bank of Ceylon who offered additional gift items.
The All Island winners received Rs.50000/= and an Oxford dictionary whereas 1st runners up received Rs.30000/= and an Oxford dictionary. The 2nd all island runners up received Rs.20000/= and a school bag.
The provincial level winners received Rs.15000/= with a mathematical instruments box, the 1st runners up received Rs.10000/= and school books and 2nd runners up received Rs.5000/= and school books. It is reported that ONUR contributed Rs. 2,730,000/= for the prizes.
We, as Sri Lankans, have been receding due to our division as a nation, said Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. But now weve found a new path to follow.
The minister appreciated how young children, through their art and words, have been able to prove their understanding better than adults. As politicians, government officials and citizen, we all have a duty to fulfill.
We are taking measures to step beyond exam-centered education and move towards a more practical system where our children learn to live practically and respect others. We are working to create a new generation with good hearts who respect basic human rights, he said further.
The genuine innocence of the young minds could be seen through the art they had created. The wish these young people have for the future of our nation. Their colors, shapes and every pencil stroke called for peace and unity.
We held a competition under the same theme in 2005, said Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, President of the Bakeer Markar Center for National Unity. But were still struggling. We [as a nation], still havent been able to give up thoughts and notions of division.
Diversity is a resource, a blessing and not a burden, Markar confirmed. Those who spread thoughts of division are like flies to the wound. We will not be able to rise as a nation if we remain this way.
Aadhila Nasir from Hejaaz International School, 1st runner-up in English Senior essay competition, in her innocent but firm voice, said No matter what race, religion or creed you belong to, what matters is how you are inside. Not your appearance, your faith or anything else  your character is what matters in the end. The world would be empty and dull without diversity. It is something we should embrace.
When she said these words in her low voice, it was her heart that echoed through her lips. By teaching our young generation what is right, what is just, we can at least hope that our future will be brighter as a nation. Because thats where the change begins. In the young heart. Within oneself. Thought by single thought. SSP

## Title: Reconciliation mechanisms are for all Sri Lankans
## Supertitle:

Reconciliation mechanisms are for all Sri Lankans
The following is a special message to the Sri Lankan people regarding the ongoing efforts for reconciliation from Motoo Noguchi, Prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors Office of Japan.
I am visiting this country on an official mission of the Government of Japan, but my message below is my personal one as an expert reflecting my tentative observations as of today and does not necessarily reflect the views and positions of the Government of Japan.
It is critical to recognize that the ongoing efforts for the reconciliation mechanisms are for the entire people of Sri Lanka and are intended to benefit all of them in an equal manner. There may be some misunderstanding that the mechanisms will benefit only a part of the people of Sri Lanka, such as Tamil people, but this should not be the case. In addition to the unprecedented nature of the efforts, maybe some foreign words unfamiliar to the Asian people, such as transitional justice and accountability, are a cause of the misunderstanding. In fact, these words do not exist in the Japanese language, neither, and we have yet to find directly equivalent and natural translation of these words in Japanese. Therefore, I will try to explain my understanding of the reconciliation without using these words.
Later in the 20th century, Sri Lanka entered a tragic phase of violence and war which finally ended in 2009. Since then, the Government and people of Sri Lanka have been focusing on rebuilding a united, peaceful, and prosperous country. During the decades of prolonged violence and war, many people suffered immensely, irrespective of ethnicity or religion. Indeed, the serious sufferings extended to the entire country. But the tragic phase ended and now you are rebuilding your country.
As an initial step, there are several things to be prioritized, together with constant efforts to achieve further economic development. First, the fate and whereabouts of those who are still missing must be found and known to their families without further delay. Second, those who seriously suffered must be adequately redressed so that they can regain their dignity and hope and start a new life. Third, those who were responsible for these serious sufferings must be punished according to law and subject to the availability of credible evidence. Fourth, all the communities across the country must reunite to rebuild a peaceful and prosperous country and to prevent the recurrence of past tragedies.
To achieve the objectives above, the reconciliation mechanisms are composed of four pillars, truth, justice, reparations, and non-recurrence. All of them are equally important to rebuild the country and to lay the foundation for sustainable economic development for a united and peaceful country. It is important not only for the present Sri Lankan people, but more so for the generation of your children. You must not make your children face again all the tragedies that you had to undergo.
This is my understanding of what the reconciliation means. This is such a simple thing, which I trust is the common belief of all the Sri Lankan people. You dont need to see it as overly complicated or something foreign to the culture of Sri Lanka.
Among the four pillars, the accountability mechanism or criminal prosecution is seen as the most politically sensitive issue. I see this largely coming from the misunderstanding that the judicial mechanism that is under discussion will benefit only a part of the entire population, more concretely only Tamil people. This is because many people, in particular those from the majority community, tend to see this mechanism as a forum for prosecuting the alleged war crimes committed by the military forces during the war, while leaving the crimes committed by the LTTE side unaddressed. As a result, they tend to see the accountability mechanism as a structurally one-sided and inherently unfair forum aimed at punishing their war heroes.
I dont think that is the case, because what this mechanism intends to do is to prosecute those who were responsible for serious sufferings of people, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion, and thereby to provide justice to victims, their families, and their communities. The main criteria in the case selection should be the gravity of crime and not who committed the crime. This is exactly what is meant by the rule of law and there is no space for politics here. In other words, the judicial mechanism should be designed, structured and operated in a way that it will benefit all the communities of Sri Lanka in a fair and equal manner. The scope of crimes to be addressed by the judicial mechanism needs to be carefully considered taking this point into account, both in terms of material and temporal jurisdiction. Because this is a critical point to ensure the unreserved support and active participation for the judicial mechanism, which are crucial for its success in delivering justice that is acceptable to all.
It is also important to know that the judicial mechanism is not a forum to pursue collective responsibility to some entities including the military forces. On the contrary, it is procedures to identify individual criminal responsibility, thereby contributing to convictions against some individuals while releasing others from unfounded allegations against them. And those who are prosecuted of course have a right to rebut to charges against them under due process of law and shall be acquitted in case of a successful defense or the absence of evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
The question of international judges seems to have been focused in the discussion surrounding the accountability mechanism. In my view, what is most important is not the nationality of judges, but whether an individual serving as judge can be supported from all the communities equally and whether the people is willing to leave the fate of cases of his/her wisdom and professionalism. What is more important is to secure the fair, skillful and efficient investigations which are a prerequisite to make any subsequent trials meaningful. Without high quality investigations there are not much that even the most able judges can do.
Some may argue that it would be better to forget about past events and just look to the future, without undergoing painful and complicated procedures of criminal prosecution and trials. However, I think such an approach will effectively endorse the culture of impunity, will fail to provide justice to victims, and will increase the risk of recurrence of similar crimes and tragedies. As an established democratic country, Sri Lanka must stick to the rule of law, not only on legal texts but also through concrete action of the judiciary.
In the end, the ability of State to protect its people by adherence to the rule of law is one of the most essential infrastructure of a Nation State. Same as other critical elements of social infrastructure such as water, sanitation, education, transportation and financial systems, the principled and efficient judiciary is a key element for a democratic nation. For Sri Lanka to make great steps forward towards sustainable economic development and prosperity, the stable and determined application of the rule of law is a must. Japan is a long friend of Sri Lanka. Nearly seventy years ago, when Japan was struggling to rebuild the country from the scourge of war, Sri Lanka was one of the first countries which strongly supported Japan in its endeavors to return to the international community.
Now that Sri Lanka is determined to overcome the past tragedies and move forward, I, as a Japanese citizen, am most honoured and pleased to be of any help to you in these unprecedented endeavors. I thank you, my friends.

Singer Soopa Shastra home science education programme 3rd phase concludes
Singer Sri Lanka PLC completed the 3rd Phase of the Singer Soopa Shasthra programme jointly with the Ministry of Education to boost the standard of Home Science education in schools across the country while also paving the way for school leavers to step into a career in the fast-growing hospitality industry.
Partnering with the Ministry of Education, Singer Sri Lanka initiated the Singer Soopa Shasthra programme in 2015 with a focus on supporting the Home Science subject in schools by emphasizing the importance of nutritious home cooking as a vital part of a healthy lifestyle and a happy family in todays busy world.
Under the 3rd Phase of this unique initiative, 150 underprivileged schools representing all provinces were handpicked to receive Singer appliances to boost their Home Science classes, bringing the total number of schools equipped so far to 450 over the course of the 3-year period.
The 3rd Phase of the Singer Soopa Shasthra programme also included the renovation and re-equipment of the Home Science Unit of the National Institute of Education in Maharagama at a cost of approximately Rs. 2.5 million. This unit, which was launched in the early 90s and was in need of upgrading, plays a crucial role in the training of Home Science teachers from around the country. A selection of modern kitchen equipment was handed over thereby making the unit fully-equipped for Home Science teachers to undergo their training efficiently.
In addition, Home Science Teacher Training Workshops were organized across the island for over 2,000 teachers, where they were trained on how to use the latest Singer kitchen appliances for preparing meals that are nutritious, time-saving and are in line with the national curriculum. Students also received hands-on training on modern kitchen appliances at Singer showrooms island-wide.
Expressing the significance of this years programme, Mahesh Wijewardene  Director Sales and Commercial of Singer Sri Lanka stated, Today is a significant day for Singer Sri Lanka as we have completed the next phase of this long-term project that is focused on uplifting the educational standards of the country while also enriching the lives of children.

ADIC, SLMA urge govt. to not reduce alcohol prices
Medical officers representing the Alcohol and The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) and Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) urged the government not to take any decision on reducing the price of alcohol products for the betterment of the 80 percent majority who do not drink alcohol, yesterday.
They were commenting on requests made by certain people even in the Parliament, to reduce the price of beer by giving tax relief from the Budget 2018, claiming that it would be helpful to reduce the consumption of illicit alcohol (kasippu).
They charged that only 10 percent of countrys population consume illicit alcohol and the government should pay its attention to protect the 80 percent of countrys population who are non-consumers, from addiction to alcohol. Decrease of prices will only benefit beer companies and not the country or its people.
They further charged that only 20 percent of total population use any kind of alcohol and alcohol industries try to expand their customer base, targeting the 80 percent majority of the non-user population to drag them in by keeping arrack and beer at low prices compared to inflation rate and thereby increase the affordability and availability of alcohol. Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, ADIC Executive Director Pubudu Sumanasekara said that any decision taken on alcohol must be evidence-based and that it is not only a finance matter. The Finance Ministry must consult experts and professionals in the alcohol control field, especially the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA).
The timely need of the country is to introduce recommendations to control alcohol use and reduce its availability by regulating alcohol taxes by the government in way to ensure not to repeat the wrong decisions taken by previous governments.
If any of wrong decision was taken into action, the whole country will have to suffer from it and it will take much longer time and effort to reverse the negative outcomes it may cause. Tax relief on beer will only benefit alcohol industries and not the 80 percent of majority who do not drink alcohol.
Alcohol and Tobacco Control Expert Committee member in SLMA Sujeewa Ranaweera said that in year 2016, the economic harm done by alcohol is around Rs. 141 billion. At present, strong beer production has increased and the per capita alcohol consumption has come into the highest degree in the history.
This condition will negatively impact on the social and economical status of the country.
He proposed that the Alcohol Policy which was approved by Parliament in 2015, should be taken into action for better alcohol control in the country.
Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and other Drugs (CAN) Director Hakan Leifman said that when calculating the alcohol production quantities for past 25 years, the alcohol percentage included in alcohol beverages has increased gradually.
The alcohol percentage in beer sold in Sri Lanka is much higher compared to the alcohol percentage of beer in other countries. He said that the taxes on beer should not be reduced in any country, claiming that Finland did it a few years ago and they couldnt reverse the mistake they did.

Batting will be the key
Against India you have to take Test to five days  Gurusinha
Cricket manager and national selector Asanka Gurusinha said that batting will be the key to Sri Lanka performing well against India in the three-match Test series that commences at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on November 16.
Against India you have to put runs on the board the key is our batting. You cant expect to get 250 or 200 and win against India. Their batting is strong and they are playing on their home soil as well, said Gurusinha ahead of the teams departure to India in the early hours of today at 6 am.
The guys are focused and they know they need to get runs because when you have 400 runs your bowlers also have a total to bowl at which we didnt have in the homes series against India. India batted first got 600 and we were bowled out twice.
The batsmen really need to put their hands up and say I am going to do something.
They are responsible for making runs not just the bowlers taking 20 wickets. Those are the things we are seriously looking at and the players and Sri Lanka Cricket they all know this is most probably the toughest overseas tour we are going to make, he said.
Everyone will have to deliver not just the players, but the coaching staff led by Nic Pothas is working so hard to deliver a result because with India you have to take the Test match to five days, then you have a very good chance.They are a side who plays aggressive cricket and they like to finish a game in 3-3 days. But if you take them to the fifth day it could be interesting. Thats one of the plans the coach has put in.
Pothas is seriously looking in that we need to go to five days and to do that you need to score 400 plus runs. The batsmen and the team know about it and they are ready. The confidence from the Pakistan series is definitely there for them, Gurusinha added.
Gurusinha said that selectors were seriously looking at a 6-5 combination of six batsmen and five bowlers, the five bowlers will include an all-rounder.
Sri Lanka has a spinning all-rounder in Dilruwan Perera and a fast-bowling all-rounder in Dasun Shanaka in their Test squad of 15.
To win against India youve got to take 20 wickets. We were successful in Pakistan to win the two tests because we went with a 6-5 combination. The important thing is not to depend too much on Rangana (Herath), said Gurusinha.
Herath has proved to be Pakistans nemesis, but the Indian batsmen have tackled him successfully.
The second Test against Pakistan we won, it was not Rangana who took the wickets, he took a few but the others chipped in as well, said Gurusinha. Thats what we need for the other bowlers also to contribute. Dilruwan did a great job there. We have to look at Dilruwan and the pacies. We have a good balanced side but at the end of the day if you are not going to get 400 runs then we are in trouble.
Gurusinha said it was difficult to talk about the competition they will expect from India at this stage. We are not sure what type of wickets they will prepare. We can get two different wickets one is turners because their spinners did well against us in Sri Lanka but at same time they can give us some bouncy, seaming and grassy tracks because they are going to South Africa straight after our series.
We have certainly learnt a lot from the last series and the coaching staff has put their plans in and we will work on that. I cannot go into details the guys have been working very hard under Pothas and we certainly have plans how to tackle everyone.
But at the end of the day we can have all those plans and everything but youve got to go to the middle and execute it. The players will have a lot of responsibility of executing those plans.
During the home series against India that Sri Lanka lost 3-0, it was the Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja who ran through the Lankan batting taking 30 wickets between them.
India always took early wickets with their pace and then the spinners came in. Its not just two bowlers Ashwin and Jadeja who took a lot of wickets but their pace attack is good as well, said Gurusinha.
India is a complete side and we need to handle that. Thats what our coaching staff has been working on recently and I am hoping it will come good. Yes, we won two Tests against Pakistan but this is a completely different series. It will be very challenging for everyone.

ARE SRI LANKAN COMPANIES CHALLENGING THE FUTURE
Island nation is targeting to attract US$3 to 4 billion foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2017. It was not so long ago Sri Lanka talked about an ambitious exports target of US$ 50 billion by 2020. FDI and exports may strengthen countrys financial position. Internationalising the local companies may be a path to achieve this goal. Successful international companies attract investments and generate considerable exports revenue to the home country. Sri Lankan government should help the private sector internationaisation process to encourage its local companies to attract foreign investments and increase exports.
But do Sri Lankan companies have strategies that are bold enough to challenge the future That will make them successful in international markets Executing a well defined strategy may make these ambitious targets less targets and more results.
The World Bank indicates Sri Lankas total (goods and services) exports in 2015 were US$16.9 billion, or 21% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Same year FDI was USD.0.7 billion, or 1% of its GDP. According to 2015 figures, reaching US$3 billion FDI and US$ 50 billion exports mean approaching FDI target of nearly 4% of GDP and export target of over 60% of GDP respectively.
Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg once said: The biggest risk is not taking riskIn a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
Strategy is a word misused heavily in the business world but if used appropriately will provide the focus and drive for the companies to achieve what they want. Strategy will build the personality of the company to take risks to achieve its objectives.
In simple terms, business strategy is a combination of business activities that set limits but help companies to challenge their future to achieve what they want.
When building a strategy, Sri Lankan companies should start by asking themselves why they exist.
Specific objectives
Knowing why will help them to understand the purpose of their businesses. Purpose may help them to set broader goals that can focus the business towards that purpose. Goals provide guidelines to set specific objectives. Working towards the objectives will generate key results that make the company successful.
The European Union's envoy to Sri Lanka Ambassador Tung-LacMargue stated in early this year that only around 5% of Sri Lankan companies engage in exports. That indicates most Sri Lankan businesses are domestic market focused may be due to the lack of resources for proactive internationalisation. That means the markets Sri Lankan companies have strengths to serve are limited. Targeting markets they can serve well may help companies to focus their effort and time to gain positive results.
However, identifying the market will not make companies successful. They should identify what they can do better than others or how they can differentiate themselves in that market.
Brand is a promise and what they communicate as a promise will ultimately be their brand. Then the firms should identify the products and services that can prove what they have promised.
Defining goals, objectives
Working towards the purpose by defining goals, objectives and expected results may require companies to take new actions and stop some existing actions. Implementing a bold strategy that challenges the future can be difficult as that may require certain changes in roles, structures, incentives and culture within the company.
In this fast changing world even the best strategy may not work unless the company reviews it continuously to measure the progress and to make improvements. At the end, running a company with a well defined strategy makes its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) great. As the leading strategist Professor Michael Porter once stated: the best CEOs I know are teachers, and at the core of what they teach is strategy.
Building a bold business strategy to be successful in international markets can be easier said than done. It may need resources, experience, relationships and the attitude. The internationalization decision may depend on whether the company wants to be successful in international markets. However, a company decided to remain local may lose the opportunities in foreign markets and may also risk losing its local market due to competition. Thus, it is worthwhile for the Sri Lankan government to build more dedicated platforms and channels to help local companies to be international.

ASG misleading Bond Commission, alleges Ravi
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake complained in Parliament yesterday that Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda had been misleading the Bond Commission with concocted stories to bring disrepute to his image.
Raising a privilege issue, Karunanayake reiterated that he is not related to Shanil Neththikumara, the individual who had allegedly threatened Anika Wijesuriya. He said he will resign if proved otherwise.
He said ASG Kodagoda should apologise to the Bond Commission for misleading it with wrong facts. This individual is not my relation. How can the AGs Department officials think they know my relatives better than me, he asked.
He added Anika Wijesuriya, who previously testified before the Commission, has so far not lodged a complaint at any Police station over death threats she had received. He said Anika Wijesuriya has not returned to the country after October 6.
ASK Kodagoda submitted before the Commission a letter received to the Bond Commission Secretary by Wijith Wijesuriya, the elder brother of Anika Wijesuriya, without checking the accuracy of its information.
The Attorney General Department enacted a drama. I sent a clarification letter on the same to the Commission, but my letter was not submitted before the Commission, he said while complaining that there is a conspiracy behind the incident.
He said a dispute had occurred between Neththikumara and Anika Wijesuriya following a quarrel at a night club. When two people clash at a night club, the AGs Department has accused me, he added.

Breaking into Indias fortress - Mission Impossible
India is one of two countries that Sri Lanka has yet to win a Test match (the other is Australia), and the task of them performing it this month seems like mission impossible considering the strengths and weaknesses of the two sides.
India are currently on a role beating all and sundry being ranked number one in Tests and two in ODIs. They have not been beaten in a Test series at home since 2012 and the chances of Sri Lanka even pulling of a victory in the three Tests seems a far-fetched task at this stage.
It was only as far back as August that India came to Sri Lanka and whitewashed us 3-0 in our own conditions and pitches. Since then Sri Lanka has gained some of their composure by beating Pakistan 2-0 in the UAE, inflicting on the hosts their first-ever series defeat at that venue since 2010.
What Sri Lanka will carry to India is the confidence gained from that victory which should give them a morale boost ahead of the Test series and at least wipe out some of the scars of their 3-0 whitewash at home.
Surely Sri Lanka must have learnt their lessons from their three Test losses where they erred and what needs to be done to rectify their mistakes so that they can look India in the eye and meet fire with fire when the new series starts at Kolkata on November 16.
Alastair Cooks England is the last team to beat India in a Test series in India in 2012 when they won the four-match series 2-1 (1 drawn). Since then India have been unbeatable at home winning series against Australia (2), West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and England.
Two areas that stood out in Englands victory was their fielding which was miles ahead of India and the batting of their captain Alastair Cook who showed his team mates that run-scoring was possible in India with some hard graft.
Although Nick Comptons first tour was not prolific, he and Cook ensured the middle order was not regularly exposed early. England accepted that a run-rate of three-an-over would often be the summit of their ambitions, but knew the value of keeping India in the field for hours on end. If Dimuth Karunaratne  the leading run getter for Sri Lanka against Pakistan can play the role like Cook, Sri Lanka can be halfway towards achieving that elusive Test win.
Coaches often talk about the fielders taking a wicket and in this area England were excellent. It was reward for the hours of training done between Tests and before play as they affected three crucial run outs during the series that of Virender Sehwag, Cheteshwar Pujara and MS Dhoni that proved to be game changers.
Sri Lankas fielding which was dreadful at one time has shown a remarkable improvement under coach Nic Pothas and the rest of the support staff. What the fielders still lack is the ability to make direct hits a habit. If that can be done Sri Lanka can take a heavy load off the shoulders of their champion bowler Rangana Herath who is approaching the sunset years of his career and who recently admitted that it would one of his dreams to win a Test match in India.
But unlike against Pakistan where Herath holds a stranglehold on their batsmen with 106 wickets (avg. 28.07) from 21 Tests and a strike rate of 62.1 balls per wicket, he has not found similar success against Indian batsmen who have been able to productively tackle his left-arm spin. Heraths strike rate against India is 82.8 balls per wicket. He has 32 wickets from 9 Tests at 45.96 which is the most expensive against any country that he has played.
How hard Sri Lankas task will be is that since that 2012 home series defeat to England, India has lost only one Test match at home in 22 matches winning 19 and drawing 2.
That rare defeat came as recently as February this year when Steve Smiths Australians pulled off a surprise win by 333 runs in the first Test of a four-match series at Pune, but suffered the full wrath of the hosts in the remaining three Tests to lose the series 2-1.
Few gave England hope after defeat in the first Test of that series in Ahmedabad, but a few weeks later they left the shores of India with a famous series victory. Nothing is impossible in this game of uncertainties.

Who laughed at Dr AP de Zoysa: Royalist JRJ or Thomian Daha
Buddhist politics decades ago
Agampodi Paulus de Zoysa (1890 1968) the leader of Buddhist Republican Party (BRP) was a social reformer, Buddhist scholar and politician. Hailing from Randombe, Ambalangoda, A. P. de Zoysa lost his parents when he was eleven: his grandmother sent him to Maha Samudraramaya temple, and to the Wesleyan school in the village. Later he joined Mahinda College, Galle where he came under the influence of Pali scholar Frank Lee Woodward, its principal, and the famous Theosophist.
AP, the cricketer, artist and actor later he moved to Wesley College, Colombo. De Zoysa was not only a good student but also a keen sportsman. He taught for a few years at Ananda College Colombo and Royal College. In 1921 he went to England for his higher education, and obtained his first degree as an external student and was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in 1929. Later he obtained his doctorate in anthropology at London University for a thesis on Observances and Customs in Sinhalese Villages'. He was appointed examiner in Sinhalese to the University of London.
Eleanor Hutton, the mother of famous author and the feminist scholar Kumari Jayawardena was APs wife, whom he had met in Londons Buddhist mission. The couple who married in 1929 returned to Sri Lanka in 1934. After returning to Sri Lanka he commenced the struggle to earn a living at the Bar and became famous as a poor mans lawyer. His short practice as a lawyer ended when he was elected to State Council in 1936 representing Colombo South and he continued serving the State Council as an independent member until 1947. AP de Zoysa was a city father at Colombo Municipal Council too.
Sinhalese educational books
De Zoysa published several scholarly texts using his own printing press, which he bought in 1939. His greatest project, or the magnum opus he endured with help from Pali scholars was the translation of the Tripitaka (Buddhist scripture) into simple Sinhala; running into forty-eight volumes it took him twenty years to complete. Dr de Zoysa bought a printing press in 1939, and began to print a series of Sinhalese educational books; the weekly paper, Dharmasamaya was edited by him. He compiled and published Sinhala-English and EnglishSinhala dictionaries as well. Zoysa, though a linguist and Buddhist intellectual, he possessed little knowledge in economics, commerce and national development. Once he was participating in a debate on the proposal to build the Norton Bridge Hydro-power Station, and spoke vehemently opposing the idea in State Council.
(Extract from Hansard 1947.) Dr A P de Zoysa- Member, Colombo South
Now where is the Capital You get all power to run industries but where is the capital Are you going to use the electricity to grow tea and rubber Are you going to use electricity to improve your agriculture, or are you going to start factories and lose on them The earlier we stop this and say, before we get down the necessary plant, we must have the necessary market for our goods the better it would be for the country.
Supposing you start manufacturing motor cars, what markets will you have for your products Are you going to make motor-cars and any other goods for the Ceylon market only Is the world market open to you Can you even compete in this country with like goods sent from abroad... I see the Honourable member for Kelaniya (JR) laughing.
J R Jayewardene 
I am sorry sir; I wanted to point out that the Honourable member for Bibile (W Dahanayake) was laughing.
Dr A P de Zoysa
That honourable member is entitled to his views. The honourable Minister thinks of industries without considering whether we have necessary money, whether we have markets.
- HANSARD July 23, 1947 Fol. 237/238 (70 years ago!)
The sarcasm of JRJ and Daha compelled the scholar to cut short and wind up his speech. Reminds one of the famous saying, It is a scholar's weakness, to run narrow and deep.
Here we have come to a very interesting guesswork. A Paulus de Zoysa was teaching at Royal before leaving for London in 1921. The 15 year-old JR in his 1921 diary, as his Biographer indicates had made an entry, Mr Paulus called me the rankest slacker in the form. Was it Paulus de Zoysa or some other Paulus
He was elected to Colombo South in State Council 1936, and he continued as an independent member until 1947. He supported the anti-dowry legislation improvements to state education and opposed death penalty, he spoke eloquently on such topics including minority rights which he was quite familiar with. He was also a municipal councillor in Colombo for many years, took a keen interest in local issues and campaigned to improve the Colombos amenities.
Two great historical research work, Heroes and Saints of Ancient India, and Indian Culture in the Days of the Buddha were among famous books authored by him.
Buddhist Republican Party
He never joined any main stream political party, but spoke in support of progressive causes and of Buddhism as a universal philosophy. Dr. G.P. Malalasekera writing on him stated, simplicity in life and dedication to work and described Dr De Zoysa: A man with rare integrity, great courage, perseverance and powers of endurance. A nationalist political party was founded by A. P. de Zoysa in 1952, who named it The Buddhist Republican Party (BRP). Its election symbol was a flower. He fielded three candidates in the 1952 parliamentary election, but mustered only 3,987 votes, less than 0.2 % of the national vote.
Dr A. P. De Zoysa, Lawyer, Historian, Social reformer and Buddhist scholar died on May 26, 1968. He was seventy eight-years-old.
Prof Carlo Fonseka reviewing the biography of Dr AP de Zoysa written by daughter Kumari Jayawardene says, He was a highly principled politician and legislator of social democratic persuasion; a Buddhist reformer who rubbed shoulders with Anagarika Dharmapala in the British Mahabodhi Society and sought to establish a Buddhism devoid of superstitious credulity; a prodigious lexicographer; a versatile translator proficient in English, Sinhala, Pali and Latin; a dedicated schoolteacher who was also a visiting university lecturer in oriental languages; a nationalist and internationalist rolled into one; a humanistic radical thinker and creative writer.
People who use their erudition to write for a learned minority... don't seem to me favoured by fortune but rather to be pitied for their continuous self-torture.  Desiderius Erasmus

Budget to promote exports, support  Vision 2025 - Dr Harsha
There would be several trade positive proposals to promote exports at the 2017 budget proposals, said Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Development, Dr. Harsha De Silva.
Speaking at the breakfast meeting organised by Sri Lanka Australia New Zealand Business council (SLANZBC) the Minister said that this is being done as the government understands the need to promote exports. The Deputy Minister also said that the budget would also support the Vision 2025 and would have several links to promote it.
Asked about on the proposals to promote tourism and relax restrictions on alcohol he said that this area too would be addressed. Though alcohol prices are very high in Maldives tourists keep going there, he pointed out.
The government has included some proposals in the 2017 budget that would address some of the issues faced specially in the tourism sector with regard to alcohol. After the budget people would get the chance to have a wine on Christmas and also on special days.
Meanwhile Australian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Bryce Hutchesson said that the governments Vision 2025 initiative is very encouraging and if properly implemented it can take Sri Lankan economy to the next level.
Vision that would take the country towards knowledge based economy and the authorities must try to exploit Sri Lankas unique strategic location for this.
He said that for the vision 2025 to succeed there should be team work and the private sector too has to support it. The business community has to play a bigger role towards the success of Vision 2025.
He said that the Australian government too is helping Sri Lanka to achieve this goal and have invested over nine million Australian dollars for several initiatives in this regard through the World Bank.Consul General New Zealand, Senaka Silva said that when New Zealand wanted to sign an FTA with China there was a lot of opposition to it and people said that that New Zealand would swell up with Chinese imports.
However this did not happen and there was a surge of New Zealand exports which increased from one billion dollars to eight billion in a short span.The Consul General said that Sri Lankans too should take a leaf from New Zealand scenario with regard to the proposed Sri Lanka China FTA.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (08-11-2017)]
SHOULD CONSTITUTION INCLUDE PROTECTING BUDDHISM
One of the issues widely discussed and argued today is the provision in the Constitution to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, where Buddhist monks, politicians and Buddhist organisations clamour. Some Buddhist fronts have threatened to march and demonstrate, which may lead to violence.
In this context a very valuable article appeared on Daily News of November 2 under the caption Beware the ENEMY within by Ven. Bhante Dhammika Thera, Australia. To give veracity to his argument he cites a case where, while in Sri Lanka, he had stayed in a temple in Kandy, the incumbent of the temple had permanently closed the Sunday Dhamma classes and rented the building to conduct classes in English and other subjects, thus depriving Buddhist children of learning Buddhism.
I support this statement, with my personal experience, where I went to a famous temple in my area to complain to the Chief Incumbent of a monk in his temple refusing and requesting me to come later to get a piece of Pirith Noola. Incidentally this Chief Incumbent is also in the forefront on the issue under discussion. To my dismay and disgust, he told me tying of Pirith Noola has become a nuisance and disrupts other work, giving me the impression that this ritual is valueless and only a show. The other work may be conducting Bodhi Poojas, distributing Sil Redi. It is strange the prelates who are agitating are those who supported the previous regime by allowing temple premises to be used as Political Party Offices, conducting Bodhi Poojas, reciting Seth Kavi, distributing Sil Redi for the same party to come to power.
The most despicable act was sending monks [men in yellow robes] to collect funds to pay a fine imposed. It is therefore quite clear, irreparable damage to Buddhism is done mostly by Buddhist monks. The lay Buddhists by criticizing the Sangha because of their behaviour, also bring disgrace to Buddhism.
Ven. Bhante Dhammika also questions: Is Buddhism threatened If so by what or whom and continues:
In my four decades as a monk, I have travelled to every Buddhist country, living in some of them and in most regions where Buddhism prevails and in some of these places I have seen evidence that my religion is under very real threat. The ones that I have noticed most were these: an indolent and ignorant Sangha, the promotion of various superstitions rather than the Dhamma, a devoted but ignorant laity and squandering of resources on showy, but ultimately useless projects.
He winds up by saying: according to the Buddha external objects or events cannot make the Dhamma disappear but the foolish people (Mogha Purisa) actually within Buddhism can. If the Buddha is correct this would mean that we should be paying attention to individual within Buddhism rather than outside, it as the possible threat to religion. How could they do this By giving it a bad reputation through their words and actions, by failing to put it into practice, by using it for their own aggrandisement rather than for helping others. Possible by all these and more.
As said in my previous letters, handing over this responsibility of monks in protecting, fostering Buddhism to the government  politicians  makes Buddhism a part of politics, which the politicians make use to palaver Buddhist monks by offering employment in the State recognition at state functions, various rewards - perks - at government expense etc. That is exactly what these few Buddhist prelates desire as they had tasted such favours earlier.
It is left for genuine Buddhist monks and laymen  Upasaka, Upasikas, and Dayakayas to get together and force these errant monks back to the temple to teach and practice the Dhamma.
Handing over the protection and fostering of Buddhism to the state is the final nail driven to the coffin called BUDDHISM.

Concur redefines financial  transformation for Sri Lanka businesses
Concur, a SAP company and the worlds leading provider of travel, expense and invoice management solutions, this week announced an intention to accelerate financial transformation and automation in Spend Management for Sri Lanka.
The announcement was made at an event held for CFOs and CIOs of Sri Lankas leading corporates in Negombo.
In a digital mobile economy, where employee spend has become diverse, unaccountable and unmanageable, it is crucial for modern finance leaders to manage business finances more effectively to reduce costs and increase control and transparency in business transactions. The event provided CFOs and CIOs with deep insights on deriving accurate, consolidated and current data to drive savings and reduce risk across the entire business. Concur, with its cutting-edge technology suite, enables organizations to automate the process of business expense, invoicing and spend management.
While todays businesses are well on their path to go digital, the bottom line remains critical across the offices of the CFO, said Richard McLean, Regional Chief Financial Officer, SAP Asia Pacific Japan. CFOs must keep up with the accelerated pace of change in the business, analyzing financial and performance data quickly to derive instant insights to enable right decisions at the right time. Concur addresses enterprises by helping automate the spend management process that can increase productivity and revenue. Our aim is to help companies in their journey towards financial transformation.
Sri Lanka currently has around USD 1 billion spending on business travel1, which is likely to increase manifold by 7-9% in the coming years. With the changing market dynamics and the need to automate business processes, we see a significant growth potential in this market. We seek to leverage our strategic foothold as the countrys main software solution provider for business travel, invoice and expense management, said Neeraj Dotel, Managing Director, Concur.

Delhi doctors declare pollution emergency as smog chokes city

A public health emergency has been declared by doctors in Delhi as air quality in the worlds most polluted capital city plunged to levels likened to smoking at least 50 cigarettes in a single day.
Slow winds and colder temperatures have been blamed for a surge in airborne pollutants beyond what instruments in the city could measure with some recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) maximum of 999.
The Indian Medical Association said the countrys capital was suffering a health emergency and called for an upcoming half-marathon to be cancelled to avoid disastrous health consequences.
Residents were warned to avoid leaving their homes as smog enveloped streets and landmarks on Tuesday, sparking road, rail and airport delays and renewed calls for Indian state and federal governments to act.
The Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said the city was a gas chamber as his government met on Tuesday afternoon to consider a response to the crisis. Primary schools, already asked to keep students indoors, will be shut on Wednesday and possibly longer if the poor conditions persist.
Most dangerous to health are concentrations of fine pollutants smaller than 2.5 micro-metres  tiny enough to evade the bodys natural filters and permeate the blood-brain barrier.
Tests by Greenpeace have shown these fine pollutants  called PM2.5  can include carcinogenic chemicals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury. Levels of PM2.5 in Delhi on Tuesday reached 710 micrograms per cubic metre, more than 11 times the World Health Organisations safe limit.
It has terrible effects on every part of your body, said Dr Arvind Kumar, the chest surgery chairman at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, who compared the 999 AQI level recorded in the RK Puram area to smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. ICUs are full of pneumonia patients. Lots of my patients are coming with coughs today. They are breathless.
It can precipitate an acute asthma attack and in the long run it will increase their risk of lung cancer, he said.
Those who work outside  such as the citys fleet of rickshaw pullers  are hardest hit. Vikas Yadav, an immigrant from Bihar state, said he used to welcome the colder months when the threat from disease-carrying mosquitoes subsides.
Now, my eyes get a burning sensation, he said. I fell sick last year. I dont know whether it was from the air but I felt breathless and my eyes were itching. Doctors told me not to work early morning during winters.
The smog was unsparing of Delhis wealthier set and its community of expatriate workers, many of whom gathered on Tuesday morning on the lawns of the Australian high commission for an annual champagne breakfast to celebrate the Melbourne Cup horse race.
It was like being in Europe in the middle of winter on a misty morning, said one reveller, Elizabeth Pennell, a lawyer for an international fund. It would have been romantic had the mist not been PM2.5.
The crowd paired their race-day dresses and suits with pollution masks but Pennell said the foul air failed to dampen the mood. You tuck up your children inside where the air is purified and for these few hours you risk your health to let your hair down, she said.
And then you can go back and lock yourself inside your apartment and breathe clean air  unlike most Indians.
Delhis air quality is extremely poor for most of the year due to road dust, open fires, vehicle exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and the burning of crop residues in neighbouring states.
But conditions worsen in winter months when slow winds and cool temperatures trap pollutants closer to the ground.
As awareness of the problem in Delhi has grown, various methods have been tried to clear the atmosphere including shutting down a local coal-fired power station, traffic rationing and banning firecrackers during Diwali, the annual Hindu festival.
But any lasting solution would need to simultaneously tackle the myriad sources of pollution and involve dozens of state and municipal governments in a country where law enforcement is notoriously patchy.
Though Delhi gets most attention, toxic air afflicts the entire north Indian plain, including parts of Pakistan. A study last year found the holy city of Varanasi had among the worst air in the country.
Airtel, the leading sponsor of the upcoming Delhi half-marathon, urged the city government to ensure the safety of runners, indicating that it may pull out of the event next year.
Air pollution poses serious health risks and it is important that these concerns are addressed urgently and appropriately by the authorities for Airtel to continue associating with the event next year and beyond, it said in a statement.
Research published in the Lancet last month foundabout 2.5 million Indians die each year from pollution, the highest number in the world.
Unprecedented levels of pollution this time last year forced schools to shutas authorities scrambled to contain the crisis.
The World Health Organisation in 2014 classed Delhi as the worlds most polluted capital, with air quality levels worse than Beijing. A2015 study showedabout half the Indian capitals 4.4 million schoolchildren had compromised lung capacity and would never totally recover.

Diabetes prevalence in Colombo over 27 percent
The diabetes prevalence in Colombo is 27.1 percent at the moment and the prevalence is 20 percent in the Colombo suburbs. The current diabetes prevalence is 10.3 percent in the country as a whole, Endocrinologist and Diabotologist Dr. Noel Somasundaram said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo yesterday, he said that the prevalence of Cardio Vascular Disiases (CDV) in Colombo is 40 percent and the CDN prevalence in the country as a whole is 25 percent at the moment. Sri Lanka Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative (SLDC) has invested Rs. 3 million in a three-year programme to curb the diseases.
Dr. Verginie Mallawarachchi from the Non Communicable Disease (NCD) Unit of the Health Ministry said that 75 percent of hospital deaths occur in Sri Lanka due to NCDs and seven percent of those deaths are due to Diabetes and related health complications. Prevalence of diabetes in Sri Lanka is on the rise. Around 35 percent of Sri Lankan women are overweight.
Consultant Endocrinologist and Diabetologist at the National Hospital Medical Unit Dr. Prasad Katulanda, MD, FRCP (Lond), FCCP, FACE, DPhil (Oxon) said that 10 percent of pregnant women in Sri Lanka have diabetes and 15 percent of them have pre-diabetes condition. One in every two pregnant mothers who had diabetes develops Type Two Diabetes at a later stage in their life. Sri Lankan females, especially Muslim women, are psychically inactive and this leads to develop diabetes and other NCDs.
Sri Lankan women need to maintain their Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 23 in order to become a healthy mother and have a healthy baby in future. They also need to maintain their waist line bellow 80 cm in order to prevent developing NCDs in them and to avoid developing NCDs in their children (to be born), he added.

LONDON: Surrey seamer Tom Curran was added to Englands Ashes squad on Tuesday after Steven Finn was ruled out of the tour to Australia with a knee injury.
Finn, himself a late replacement for the absent Ben Stokes, has been diagnosed with torn cartilage in his left knee and will head back to England for a possible operation.
Curran, 22, is next in line and the England and Wales Cricket Board has announced he will fly to Australia on Wednesday.
He has played a single one-day international and three Twenty20 internationals but is yet to make his Test debut.
Finn only made the current tour when he was added to the squad in place of the suspended Ben Stokes.
It ended another miserable tour to Australia for Finn, who left the previous 2013/14 trip under a cloud when coach Ashley Giles declared him unselectable.
Coach Trevor Bayliss told reporters in Adelaide on Tuesday: He had an injection a couple of days ago which they thought would help.

Focus on the final  outcome, neither time spent nor task done
James Zenger, a well-known researcher surveyed over 60,000 employees to see which leadership characteristics made leaders great in the eyes of their employees. The most important two characteristics that Zenger found were Focus on results and Focus on people. Today, let us talk on focus on results or outcome.
Many business organizations place too much emphasis on time spent at work. Employees who burn the midnight oil might be viewed as dedicated to their work, while others who quietly get their work done during business hours might be passed over for a promotion.
Punching a time clock makes no sense for professional executives. Their contribution is not the time they spend on their work but the value they create through their knowledge. Bosses with orthodox mind-sets create rules and norms not in the pursuit of efficiency, but rather out of distrust. A local research analyst told me recently that a study done by him has revealed that full-time executives work a total of three days a week, wasting the other two.
Physical presence
Modern management gurus tell us that placing importance on hours and physical presence over action and results leads to a culture of inefficiency and anxiety. The pressure of being required to sit at your desk until a certain time creates a factory-like culture that ignores a few basic laws of idea generation and human nature: (1) When the brain is tired, it doesn't work well, (2) Idea generation happens on its own terms, (3) When you feel forced to execute beyond your capacity, you begin to hate what you are doing.
Of course, there is no short-cut for the perspiration required to make ideas happen. But the time required to complete a project successfully must reveal itself rather than be dictated. If you care about your work, you will do what it takes to get it done right. As such, your performance should be measured by your ability to get work done on time and done well. Your decisions about when and how you completed the work should not matter.
The inefficient hours in the office could be utilized out of the office as creative stimulation. Time spent in the outer world is productive if it is increasing the rate of idea generation and providing the mental focus required to capture and complete action steps when back in the office.There is a value to mixing up the workday, working out, grabbing a cup of tea.
Alternative
But what if you're not in a position to change your organization's policies Within your own sphere, you can focus on results rather than hours worked -- both by using your time more efficiently in the office, and by protecting your time away from the office. Let us see how:
Know your priorities
Many things that you do at work are probably not the best use of your time. For instance, many professionals often spend much more time than necessary perfecting relatively low-priority tasks. Even if employees perfectionist tendencies are pushing more important priorities to the wayside, people still feel and appear productive -- Since I'm sitting at my desk doing things, I must be making progress at my tasks, they might subconsciously think.
The way to fix this habit is easy to say but hard to do: Understand what really matters to you, your boss, and your organization, and then be willing to be less than perfect on your lower-priority tasks.
Handle meetings professionally
Meetings! Meetings! Meetings! Executives all inundated with meetings, many which turn out to be a report out of recent tasks. How do you reach beyond this to use meeting time more strategically
There are several steps we can take to help keep us on track of approaching the strategic level vs. the tactical.
Are you holding your meetings in the same room week after week, month after month If youre trying to generate high-level, creative thinking, consider moving your meeting to a different location. Often the barrier starts with the very walls that typically hold you in.
Breaking barriers
Provide a clear meeting purpose. One of the biggest mistakes is to allow meetings to get off track. Be sure to set clear meeting expectations in advance of the meeting so participants will know that a) their time is important to you, b) that you respect their thoughts and participation, and c) that you will not allow other participants to derail the purpose.
What outcome is expected Often, we set agendas without discussing the needed outcomes. If you have a specific need to solve a problem, design something, create a timeline, etc., spell that out clearly so that the team can work toward the goal in the time allotted.
Provide background and discussion. Why are we in business and how does our team support the business When holding high-level, strategic meetings, its important to remind participants why the business exists. You may think this sounds like something that can and should be skipped, but without this step, the team often reverts to talking about the day-to-day tasks and small goals instead of focusing on the larger purpose.
How do we envision the future next year, three years, or five years from today Envisioning something is very different from writing down tasks you hope to complete in the next year. Talk about how changes proposed will impact the business in the next year and what barriers need to be addressed.
Brass tacks
Prioritize. Now that you have the visioning complete, talk through team projects and begin to prioritize them in order of the ones that will achieve that goal. This may mean taking fun projects off the list or ranking them lower in priority. Be clear with the team that the goal is to aid in not overloading them, but to provide tighter focus on more attainable goals.
Discuss results on priority items. This is the one portion of the meeting where reporting out becomes appropriate. Only after youve talked through the strategy pieces should you spend time on the steps that get you there. Again, reinforce that the results should be presented in a way that ties them back to the business impact, not just reporting for the sake of sharing.
By engaging your team in a strategic, thoughtful way, you should see a difference in their ability to see the big picture vs. focus on day-to-day outcomes.
Don't forget to recharge
An organization that places too much emphasis on time spent at the office probably neglects the importance of time spent away from the office. In order to be productive at work, professionals need to be able to recharge, physically and mentally.
Keep physically fit. On the physical dimension, sleep and exercise are often the first two personal activities to face the chopping block when professionals have to increase their hours spent in the office. But this reallocation of time doesn't actually help people get more done. In my experience, you would get more done during the day if they worked a little less -- and used that time to get extra sleep and some physical exercise.
Avoid burnout. Long hours at work wear people down mentally. All too often, I see professionals work to 8, 9, or 10 every night and go into the office every day of every weekend, even if there is no real crisis. While these professionals might be increasing their output over the short-term, this type of overwork inevitably leads to burnout. And if you're burned out, you're not productive.
So, you should assertively protect your personal time. That means being firm with your boss about times when you are not available -- family dinners or your child's soccer games, perhaps.
Don't be afraid to speak up.
Obviously, asking for more flexibility at work is easier said than done. You might fear that the mere act of requesting time off would make you come off as lazy or not a team player. But while it cannot be guaranteed that every request will be successful, there is little harm in asking politely. Believe it or not, most good bosses understand your desire to spend some time with your children or enjoy a romantic dinner with your spouse. Your boss can't address your needs unless he or she knows what they are.
Improved focus is not just about getting more done. Improved focus ensures that you know where to place your attention so that you may achieve the best possible result. Increasing your efficiency can be very helpful but only if it comes after you have focused on your most important activities and eliminated the unimportant tasks. Improved focus will enable you to prevent the unimportant tasks from making it onto your task list so that you may focus solely on those activities which help you achieve your desired results. Implement the above tips, listed above, and you will soon experience the power of improved focus in your life.

Forgotten warrior
The warriors drew energy and warmth from the sun; they sharpened their skill like water. Subtle and delicately precise, they could bring death to their enemy by the touch of their fingertip. And this art is still alive, unnoticed if not completely nourished  right among us.
In an attempt to resuscitate the failing breath of the blood red art that has its roots in our culture, as deep and far as 30,000 years, Angampora - a Nations Legacy in Pictures, a photographic narrative of Sri Lankas ancient martial art was launched on Saturday (21), at the DIMO 0800 showroom Colombo 14.
The event was held under the patronage of film director Jayantha Chandrasiri who portrayed the art of Angampora through his teledrama Dadubasnamanaya. The coffee-table book unearths the history, origins and techniques of Angampora which, up until now, had been a dying whisper in the raw of modernism.
Peoples art
I believe that it is rebels who change the world, said Dr. Ajantha Mahanthaarachchi, the author of the book and a proud descendent of Korathotaarachchi angampora lineage. My own rebellion has helped revive the art of our people.
Mahanthaarachchi, author of several other books, contributed to the project whose completion took two and a half years. His rebellion, in deciding to train students outside his lineage, was intended to preserve the deadly martial art which is a mastery he inherited from his ancestors.
His forbearers, the master Angampora fighters who supplied soldiers for the Kings army during the time of Kingdom of Seethawaka, were massacred by the Portuguese in 1562. And in 1818, Angampora was banned in Sri Lanka by the British. Since then, Angampora faced a tragic and silent decline.
It was however, practiced by a few lineages who managed to keep the art alive through generations, and now, with the introduction of this collection of photographs, Angampora is being presented to the world for the first time ever in visual form.
Picturesque legacy
Among the photographs of Angampora  a Nations Legacy in Pictures, is a copy of the ban announcement, declared by the British. The document was extracted from the London Public Library by the creators of the book. In addition, images of a War History Book (Satan Viththi Potha) from the library of the Temple of the Tooth Relic have also been included.
Pictures of the oldest Angampora fighter, Suriyaarachchi Gurunnanse, were also captured by Reza Akram, whose photography speaks of Angampora to the world through the collection. The fighter was in ill health, said Mahanthaarachchi. But when he touched his weapon, he got up from his bed and performed his sacred fighting drill.
The book contains pictures of dancer, 80 year old Jayasena Gurunnanse, whose Leopard Dance was the only remaining proof that after being banned by the British, Angam martial art was transmitted into dance. But unfortunately, the precious dance, by now, has gone extinct.
Mahanthaarachchi recalled Archimedes who once said Give me but a firm spot on which to stand, and I shall move the earth.
If you ask me what I wish for, I would say the same, Mahanthaarachchi said. Give me but a firm sport on which to stand, and I shall move the earth through the art of my people  Angampora.
A review of the book was given by Mahinda Kumara Dalupotha, prominent folklore researcher and lecturer at the University of Visual and Performing Arts. Our culture has been deftly portrayed in the visuals of Angampora  A Nations Legacy in Pictures, he said.
He further noted that the photographs of the collection bring out subtle details of the unique martial art that can be studied by researchers. Various resources that can be useful for research are found in most of the stills. Our heritage, from ancient times, documented on ola leaf, has been captured in the photographic narrative.
Military weaponry
The importance of presenting this invaluable treasure of an art in picture form is evident when you consider all the roles and devices that have ceased to make it to the present. The lost roles of society, the forgotten military weaponry could create muddled images if described using mere words. Therefore, the portrayal of photographs fulfills an immense duty in passing such precise knowledge to our future generations, remarked Dalupotha.
The book is an immense attempt to compile a system of visual anthropology which brings out the life, energy and spirit of Angampora fighters.
While working on the project, we learned about the enormous social and cultural ramifications we have faced over the last two centuries, said Yasas Ratnayake, project manager and editor of Angampora  A Nations Legacy in Pictures, thanks to an integral part of our culture which was systematically erased by those who wished to turn [our people] into their subordinates.
Ratnayake remarked that with the launch of the book, the opportunity to reintegrate Angampora back into our culture has, finally, arrived. Nations such as Japan, India, China and Thailand have adapted to the times without losing their unique sense of cultural identity and we, too, should think strongly about developing our sense of culture, he further stated.
The background of hundreds of people who came together to support in compiling the book shows how much people really care about preserving our heritage because they came from the underprivileged and the highest strata of society and everything in between and they [all] cared deeply about preserving our heritage, Ratnayake said.
Eager student
The book was published by Oceans and Continents, Sri Lanka and was sponsored by Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC - Mercedes Benz, Sri Lanka Army, Brandix (Pvt) Limited, Sampath Bank PLC, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Navy, Siam City Cement (Lanka) Pvt. Limited, Q&E Advertising.
Among the team who made this worthwhile attempt a success are also, chief advisor of the project General (retd.) Daya Ratnayake, Coordinator Sashanka Atapattu, Videographer Nuwan Attanayake and Media coordinator Dewmith Ekanayake.
The strength, the energy and the majesty of a human when they turn into their fighter self is prominently seen when they perform their art, when they fight their battle. The fighter is a sacred creature who can bring life or death with a concealed movement. It is time to preserve this mighty form of art. Where the student is eager, they are free awaken the soul of the warrior. The words of Archimedes echo the plea of this dying art: Give [it] but a firm spot on which to stand, and [it will] move the earth.

Gifts for a centenarian
Heroes may range from the superhuman to the subhumans along a scale of power having infinite gradations. Perhaps for some of us, the living patterns and the actions of our own parents may tend to depict them as our heroes. If such a hero or heroine lived for a century our tendency is to honour them in the utmost possible manner. On November 1, we had the chance of observing the honour bestowed by kith and kin of such a hero, a great personality of a teacher named William Mihindukulusooriya.
It is nothing but the great and sensitive sense of love, the honour and affection of the sons and daughters of the great senior citizen that had given rise to two remarkable books first titled as Piyahasara (the path of the father) and the second titled as Siyavasaka Piyahasara (Hundred years of the path of the father). Both books are authored by one of his sons a retired bank employee named Wijesiri Mihindukulasooriya.
Great teacher
For him who had traced the lifestyle of his father, the protagonist in both books happens to be a great person who had not only been a great teacher but also as a social reformer of a class akin to himself. He, the author son, traces how his father had to struggle hard to be a learned individual during his childhood. The work looks closer to a biography.
It also transcends the mere barriers as a result of the sensitivity of the humane flavour embedded in it. They are the reminiscences jotted down in the form of creative episodes of communication that enlighten the mind of the reader. The protagonist in both books emerge once in the form of a father, then as a teacher, followed by the steps of a social reformer cum humanitarian and a spiritualist par excellence.
He is shown via true to life series of episodes as to how he detests the evil manners of the fellow beings not only by way of verbal utterances but also by down to earth events. In the sense, the influence of a persons living pattern is hinted as the verdict for longevity. For example, though the sense of happiness is adored by him the event like hunting and killing are factors that are detested by him.
As such, he had been living all throughout his life as a happy person who had a free mind. Another factor that emerges from the lifestyle of the protagonist Mihindukulasooriya is his great sense of a fiction to the sick and the needy. The sense of attention and affection towards the care and cure are highlighted in his career as a teacher.
Socio-political issues
These two compilations tend to reach the level of a supramundane narrative cum human interest story, for all times. From another point of view, the experiences embedded in the two works tend to provide answers to some of the issues pertaining to culture, education, learning patterns and socio-political issues with special reference to the postwar period.
The social factors such as poverty, scarcities and the meagre needs that overpervade the normal living patterns both in the remote rural areas as well as more suburban areas are rewarded giving vent to how individual attempts to face them as existential challenges. The protagonist overcomes them not as mere barriers but as challenges that could be faced bravely.
On the day of the launch, these two books at the Colombo Public Library, the great teacher was seen attired in his usual national costume. He was seen in a happier mood attempting to sing a song of the yesteryear. He was received with admiring applause of the well-wishers of a century. What a great event it was!
Those who gathered at the auditorium had the opportunity of listening to episodes drawn from the life of the great teacher as written by the son. On talking to the gathering it was clear that it was a moment of bliss in their lives. The launch of these two books coincided with the great elders 100th birthday too was remarkable. On close scrutiny, it was revealed that this great elder has lived to see three generations.
Second generation
It in itself is a bliss. On one occasion, the elderly teacher had been ushered into a wedding reception hall of the second generation where one of his granddaughters were given in marriage. It is jotted down by the writer son Wijesiri that at one moment his father had disappeared from the hall.
Where has he gone It was the question raised by most. But to the surprise of all of them, he had been seen seated outside the reception hall leisurely and enjoying the bliss of loneliness tasting a chew of betel. This had been his special identity. He preferred a noise-free atmosphere. He preferred the nature to the artificiality of the modern living.
Though the name of the protagonist is cited in his birth certificate as Mihindukulasooriya Warnapelige William Singho, he willingly changes his longish name to sound more briefly as William Mihindukulasuriya. He had gone to the extent of publicly informing the name to clarify matters. This shows his integrity and the free will which is a hallmark of his living condition.
The two books written by Wijesiri Mihindukulasuriya come as an everlasting gift to all parents of the nation. The first one, Piyahasara, initially appeared in 2014 in the form of a biography. The second one, Siyawasaka Piyahasara, which appeared in the form of a narrative is an extension of the former work. Both works centre around a single person, living amid us gracefully and looked after by a new generation.

Havies field a young and talented side this season
Havelock Sports Club founded in 1915 is a Division A rugby union team based in Sri Lanka that plays in the Dialog Rugby League.
The Club has a long history and Rugby is the clubs main sporting activity. The Havies, as they are commonly known amongst its members, is situated in Colombo and the clubs ground is known as Havelock Park. The club has produced some excellent players over the last few decades including players of the calibre of fierce tackler cum third row forward Angelo Wickramaratne, Michael Jayasekera, Hisham Abdeen, Marco De Silva, Bharatha Mendis, Graham Raux, Sanjeewa Jayasinghe, Rajeev Ganapathy and Kavinda Jayasena to name a few. The club has struggled over the last decade to retain its players with their star performers crossing over to more star-powered clubs.
They were ones down and out even to find 15 players to represent the club rugby side but Stormed in to recognition in 2012/13 season with the help of several ex CR and FC players together with the guidance of knowledgeable Samoan coach TevitaTulagaise affectionately called Laga by all his close friends by winning the coveted league Crown under prop forward Terrence Henry after a lapse of almost close to four decades.
They beat the defending champions at that time the formidable Kandy Sports Club, who were the champions for the preceding 10 years. The brain child behind this famous victory is none-other than ex CR and FC stalwart Asanga Seneviratne who suddenly took over Havies that year and within the period of three to four months transformed a ordinary bunch of players to a fighting unit, capable of giving a fight to other top clubs such as CR and FC, Navy and Kandy by being a dominant force in the local rugby arena.
Seneviratne, who is the current head of the Sri Lanka Rugby, has changed the face of Havies Rugby over the last several years by helping them find sponsors through companies he controls, which has helped lift the standards of the club on-field and off-field. A new stadium has been built with games being played under lights.
Sri Lankan national prop/second row forward Jason Melder will captain the Havelock SC in the 2017/18 season in the Dialog league rugby tournament and the Clifford cup knock out championship.
Also the club has drafted in Sanath Martis as the head coach of the team this years rugby season.
Prop forward Ashan Darling has left the club and joined Kandy SC this season.
Theres a good news for Havies as former club captain cum national winger Sadun Herath has returned to play for them this season along with some newcomers in experience Sri Lanka full back Reeza Mubarak, Peterite Prop/ Second Row forward Rahal Delpachitra, Pathana fly half Randy Silva, Joes third row forward Gihan Perera and Wing three quarter Sachith Silva along with St.Anthonys college Kandy this years captain cum cracking centre Dinuk Amerasinghe and Royal college hooker Azmir Fajudeen has joined the club and will most probably play for the pink and chocolate Jerseyed lad this season.

Hayleys turnover up by 20% YOY to Rs. 62.4 bn
Hayleys PLC posted a 20% Year-on-Year (YoY) increase in turnover up to Rs. 62.4billion.
The Group has continuously infused higher levels of investment into key business segments with a view to enhancing growth potential over the medium-long term. These investments were also reflected in the Groups net finance cost, which rose to Rs. 1.9 billion while group profit before tax for the period stood at Rs. 1.4 billion in 1HFY17/18.
In that context, Hayleys Group achieved significant benchmarks during the period in review, particularly in relation to its recent acquisition of a 61.73% of the issued share capital of Singer ( Sri Lanka) PLC for a consideration of LKR 10.9 billion, making it the single largest acquisition for a listed company in Sri Lanka in recent times. Commenting on the Groups performance over the first half, Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive, Mohan Pandithage said: The group was able to achieve several significant milestones duringthe first half of the financial year, driven by aggressive investments that have positioned Hayleys Group for strong top and bottom line growth moving forward.
We are confident that the acquisition of Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC together with the recent major investments that the Hayleys Group has made into leisure and transport and logistics sectors are anticipated to yield significantly improved results for the group in the future.
Turnover in the groups Transportation and Logistics segment rose from Rs. 11.1 billion up to Rs. 16.4 billion while operating profits rose from Rs. 631 million up to Rs. 1.1 billion during 1H17/18.
Strong export market prices supported notable improvements in the groups Plantation sector which recorded turnover of Rs. 6.5 billion, as compared with a previous Rs. 4.4 billion.
Poor weather conditions hampered agricultural production, leading to a reduced turnover and operating profits, which ended the half at Rs. 5.5 billion, and Rs. 233 million respectively.
Increased raw material prices also negatively affected the groups Hand Protection and Purification Products segments. Revenue in the Hand Protection segment stood at Rs. 8 billion while operating profits stood at Rs. 98 million.
Leisure sector operating profits reduced to Rs. 36 million despite relatively stable turnover of Rs. 2.6 billion, largely as a result of investments made towards the refurbishment of key hospitality properties within the group.

## Title: His Eminence is right

His Eminence is right
Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, speaking at a function at St. Joseph's College, the other day, said he had written to President Maithripala Sirisena, asking him to ban tuition classes on Sundays and Poya days. He said, present day children have been robbed of their childhood by being deprived of their leisure and outdoor activity, unlike during his days. The first thing he did, after returning from school, he said, was to make a dash for the playground. But today very young children are seen making a beeline for tuition classes at the end of the school session, which was not a healthy trend.
The Cardinal is right. Today's school going generation is forced into an unrelenting drudgery of continuous learning, unlike in the past, when they enjoyed all the joys and thrills of childhood. End of term holidays were reserved for family outings which was time for adventure and discovery. Today, though, even these end of term holidays are filled up with strenuous learning sessions at private tuition classes, leaving no breathing space for the child. The competitiveness in the field of education, as in the case of all other fields of activity, has a lot to do with this state of affairs. Children, too, are today caught up in the rat race of a different kind. Hardly do they arrive home, after a rigorous school session, than they are all kitted up to leave for their tuition class. Some children even go directly, after school, for tuition, after a hasty lunch.
The Year Five scholarship examination, instead of being a simple test of learning skills of students, in their formative years, have today become a prestige battle, fueled, to a large extent, by the media. The wide publicity given to the successful candidates have led parents to drive their children harder. This, no doubt, takes a heavy toll on the child. All parents want their children to obtain the highest marks in the island and dream of the prospects of their progeny being interviewed on television, not to mention admission to prestigious schools.
The lack of physical activity, due to children spending their playing time, at tuition classes, can also have drastic repercussions on the child's health. His Eminence said, he ran to the playground, soon after returning home, from school. Today, there are hardly even any playgrounds around. Nowadays we hear of ailments and afflictions affecting the very young that were non-existent in the past. Non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and heart ailments have registered a drastic increase among children. Obesity among children, leading to various diseases, too is on the rise, all of which, according to medical opinion, are due to lack of physical activity.
True, all parents desire a bright future for their offspring, which can come only through a sound education and academic success. But a balance needs to be maintained. Children should not be deprived of their leisure and pleasure. The normal life pattern of a child should not be disturbed. The desire for success, at any cost, by parents has given rise to a thriving tuition industry too. Today, no space is spared, advertising the academic merits and prowess of this sir or that sir who will be the ultimate deliverer of success to their charges. Parents, no doubt, are highly taken in by these yarns and would spare nothing to get the best for their children. How genuine these professed credentials are will only be put to the test when the child sits the exam and after the fees are collected.
It is hoped that His Eminence's letter to the President would yield the desired results and tuition classes prohibited on Poya days and Sundays, which, in any event, should be devoted to religious practices. True, tuition, in some instances, are necessary, given that teachers, unlike in the past, are less dedicated and barely apply themselves to their tasks. Also, in a majority of instances, the teachers themselves conduct private tuition classes, to the neglect of their classroom duties, and frown on their charges who don't attend them. Hence, more often than not, students are compelled to attend these tuition classes to avoid being victimized. It is fierce competition that has given rise to the booming private tuition industry, so much so, even Sundays and Poya days are not spared.
Fishing in troubled waters
The pro-Rajapaksa TV channels are having a field day, taking advantage of the current petrol shortage, to take pot shots at the government. True, there is natural anger and resentment among motorists, particularly the three wheel drivers, whose livelihoods are affected by the crisis. Hence, it is only natural that these three wheeler drivers vent their spleen on the government, which is responsible for ensuring an uninterrupted supply of fuel. But, this natural anger is sought to be given an anti-government twist by certain TV channels, which are airing the views of angry three wheeler drivers. How would these men have reacted if the government issued the substandard petrol to the market, which would have caused irreparable damage to their vehicles

Hope against failure : DS Senanayake College
To believe in yourself, to have the strength and wit to realise your ambitions, to rise above your fear and terror when it is at its strongest and to win the hearts of men and women regardless of the language they speak are the qualities of a great leader.
In the end, it is ones attitude that wins the day. Understanding that others have won their battles, and that if one is confident others around him/her become confident, one understands how to lead. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of DS Senanayake College Inura Samarawickrama who is always looking to expand his horizons.
A genuine guy and having an affable personality, Samarawickrama prefers not to be judgmental and feels that he is always learning as a leader. He certainly believes that one should lead by example.
Good leader
From what I have learned in my life it is clear to me that people are different from one another. It always helps to assess a situation before reacting to it. Also one must refrain from giving judgments or opinions before actually putting oneself into someone elses shoes. Being a genuine person makes others trust and follow you. This is the best way of leading. It hurts no one being humble, and getting to know the unknown even from a youngster, helps all of us to expand our horizons. Im always curious to know more and develop myself in many ways, so I can be a good leader and a person others can rely on, said Samarawickrama.
Fear can help you in life, yet fear is something most people battle against. It is the one enemy that is most difficult to defeat. The one enemy that is always there. Sometimes before you and sometimes behind you. Always with you. The greatest enemy.
The fear I have is to be a failure in the eyes of the people who believe in me. It has become my habit now to work hard and do my utmost. I also believe that I will be able to do the right thing at the right time. I also appreciate the guidance and the support I have always received from the people all around me. It has molded me and been my pillars of strength at rough times, explained Samarawickrama.
Again Samarawickrama points out that it is confidence that brings new hope. He points out that if we believe in our own strengths and are aware of our weaknesses it will give us the incentive to stand up on our own two feet. We should believe in ourselves before anyone can believe in us.
Samarawickrama faced his Advanced Level examination in the physical science stream. He pointed out that mathematics always gives one the needed analytical powers to see a situation through. But he also pointed out that it is not the subject matter which helps you to make the most appropriate decisions quickly. It is the environment and the people around you that enrich your life.
Born fighter
D S Senanayake College is the second mother of my life and it has always nourished and molded me. I thank all the teachers who have given their utmost in shaping us for the betterment of this country, said Samarawickrama.
We all have our heroes in life. For Samarawickrama it is that great competitor, New Zealand Rugby player Richie McCaw, a giant in the field of rugby. McCaw was known for his brilliant captaincy and his courage on the field. He was tough and a born fighter.
I would be thrilled to meet Richie McCaw. Its not just because he is an honorable human, but also he is a personality we all can learn from. He was a great leader on the pitch and the stats speak for him. He is a person who struggled through his life and became the best, through hard work and compassion. He is a figure of humility and honor and is a perfect role model, said Samarawickrama.
Lets face it. Most of us have had dreams of becoming a billionaire. But what would we do with all that money What would we spend it on Or would we spend it on others
Sri Lanka, being a developing country, needs all the hands it can get in lifting the country up. I would like to build an educational institute that focuses on the skills and the capabilities of our children including streams that they have a desire to follow. It will help this country to have a variety of professionals to help this country to grow, stated Samarawickrama.
When we were kids we all had dreams of changing the world. But at that age did not realize that only a few will have the greatness to bend history. But the rest of us in our own small way can change a part of this society we live in.
Equal rights
I think its time people change their perceptions about others and also judging others according to stereotypes. It will help people to see all humans in a different way and break down these barriers we have created that separate us. I believe women have the strength and the intelligence to work head on with men. There should be no glass ceiling. They have equal rights and must be appointed to positions in which they can make a difference in this country. I think in a Democratic country, people should have their freedom. But with that great freedom comes great responsibility. Freedom does not give you the right to harm anyone with your actions, stated Samarawickrama.
Samarawickramas ambitions are not only for himself. He believes in being a good citizen. The rights of children make him very passionate. This is because children are vulnerable and need protection. With them, they carry the hopes and dreams of our generation.
It is especially the children who face unthinkable difficulties, also losing their lives. Children are the next generation. The victim becomes the oppressor at times. The victim grows up to become the oppressor. It greatly saddens me to know that children in Sri Lanka suffer because of the actions of adults, added Samarawickrama.
The field is where a different learning takes place. Men taking on men. Rugby one of the greatest contact sports of all times. Where injuries take place and where brains and brawn are important. Indeed some have gone as far as to say that these boys are gladiators. They tackle and score. They collide with each other and they grow in toughness. It is a fast game that requires wits and physical strength.
I was a part of the Schools 1st XV Rugby team for the last 5 years and last year I was the vice-captain. Im currently a member of the Sri Lanka Navy Rugby pool. Rugby has taught me that the team is everything. One mistake can destroy the dreams of the rest of the team. It has taught me to stand up for others and to safeguard my own brothers. It has taught me time management, given me courage and provided me with the strength to be the best, even at the rock bottom, explained Samarawickrama.
Specific challenge
Life is the greatest adventure. Face it. Never give up. You need to see it through. You have been given your problems because you can handle it. You have been given your specific challenge because you are strong enough to bear it and face it. Otherwise, it would not have been given to you.
This is what I would like to say. Believe in yourself. Always think twice before taking a decision and dont hesitate to seek advice from experienced personalities. It will help you to make the most appropriate decisions. Be humble enough to learn from anyone and to thank them. This will help you to have a long and a successful journey, added Samarawickrama.
I would like to appreciate my Ammi, Thaththi, Akki, my family and the special people in my life for always standing by me and helping me out and being pillars of strength during tough times. I would like to thank the Principal and all the teachers & coaches who have inspired me and guided me in my darkest times. I also would like to appreciate the help and the guidance of the past prefects, Old Boys Association of D. S. Senanayake College and my fellow brothers of the current guild. My gratitude goes out to my Rugby teammates for their compassion and faith in me through difficult times.

HSBC to help combat climate change with a $100 bn boost for sustainable financing
HSBC pledged to provide $100 billion in sustainable financing and investment by 2025. The goal is one of five new commitments that HSBC is making to tackle climate change and support sustainable growth in the communities it serves.
The bank will intensify its support for clean energy and lower-carbon technologies, as well as projects that support the implementation of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.
HSBC also pledges to: Source 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, with an interim target of 90 per cent by 2025. By signing long-term agreements with suppliers, HSBC aims to support the development of new renewable power facilities .
The bank also plans in reducing its exposure to thermal coal and actively manage the transition path for other high-carbon sectors. This includes discontinuing financing of new coal-fired power plants in developed markets and of thermal coal mines worldwide.
Similarly the banks intend to adopt the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to improve transparency.
In its next two Group annual reports, HSBC will give more details on its approach to climate-related risks and opportunities. It also would lead and shape the debate about sustainable finance and investment. This includes promoting the development of industry-wide definitions and standards .
Group Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said, For more than a decade, HSBC has helped clients break new ground in the green bond markets in Europe and Asia, and to finance some of the biggest climate-friendly infrastructure projects in the world. The $100bn commitment that we are announcing today acknowledges the scale of the challenge in making a transition to a low-carbon future. We are committed to being a leading global partner to the public and private sectors as they make that transition.
The pledges build on HSBCs long-standing involvement in green and sustainable finance. Over recent years, it has: played a leading role in developing voluntary standards for issuers of green bonds and social bonds; issued its own 500 million green bond; and won recognition for the quality of its research into climate change.
HSBC announced the new commitments in an update on the action it is taking to meet its social, environmental and governance (ESG) responsibilities. The bank has continued to improve its own environmental performance in key areas. Over the past year, HSBC has reduced water usage by 9 per cent, carbon emissions by 9 per cent and energy consumption by 13 per cent. It has also signed agreements with clean energy producers to source 24 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources.

Indian CEO Forum President clarifies Lanka IOC position on fuel issue
The Indian CEO forum of Sri Lanka, the preeminent body for Indian business representation, weighed in on the fuel shortage situation with a statement clarifying the role of Lanka IOC in the ongoing sitivation.
CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland PLC and Deputy Chairman of SMB Leasing PLC Umesh Gautam, says that the island wide petrol shortage continues to inconvenience motorists, the need for answers and accountability is important. However the rush to judgment and the need to apportion blame has resulted in several allegations and misrepresentations which require some clarification, particularly involving Lanka IOC as a founding member of the Indian CEO forum and one of Sri Lankas pioneer strategic foreign direct investments. Lanka IOC is a subsidiary of the Indian Oil Corporation, a Fortune Global 500 company with a turnover of over USD 55bn, and shares many of their corporate governance, processes and standards with regard to procurement, quality assurance, transparency and accountability.
Therefore one particular allegation pertaining to the import of sub-standard diesel is unequivocally false, as the company adheres to a higher international standard for diesel than what Sri Lankan specifications demand.
There is a fundamental misrepresentation in a lot of the reporting which highlights Lanka IOCs shipment of petrol on the 16th of October as the genesis of the crisis. Lanka IOC has a market share of around 16%, and its business activities relating to the import of petrol is to facilitate and cater to its demand, not the entire Sri Lankan market.
In the event the petrol shipment is rejected, Lanka IOC maintains a buffer stock to ensure there is no supply disruption to its filling stations as is normal operating procedures.
With regard to the shipment on the 16th October, Lanka IOC would like to make clear that Lanka IOC does not gain ownership of the petrol shipment until it passes CPC/CPSTL laboratory testing. After the lab rejected the petrol parcel, the supplier offered to remove the impurities through a filtration process, pushing the delivery to the 3rd or 4th of November, which the CPC officials rejected. Lanka IOC requested a replacement shipment (expected 25-30 days) and thereafter had no role with the rejected petrol parcel thereafter.
Any allegations associating Lanka IOC with the petrol parcel once rejected is unfounded.
As a key stakeholder and partner in the Sri Lankan petroleum market, Lanka IOC has come forward on several occasions to offer assistance to CPC whenever the need has arisen and is fully committed to do so again.
The company has immediately procured an emergency delivery, expected to arrive on the 10th of November, in addition to the replacement delivery by M/s TOTAL.

Insurance Regulator renamed as the Insurance  Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka
The name of the Insurance Sector Regulator, the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, has been changed to the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka with effect from October 19, 2017, consequent to an Amendment to the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 by Act No 23 of 2017.
The amendment included two other changes to the insurance regulatory framework. One is to permit insurance companies, which meet certain criteria, to seek exemption from the mandatory listing requirements of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act. The rationale for providing the said exemption was on the basis that such companies are already part of a listed entity, either in Sri Lanka or abroad.
The National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. (SLIC), or any entities formed upon segregation of SLIC, have been also exempted from the mandatory listing requirements as long as such entities are owned by the Government of Sri Lanka. Insurance companies that would be exempted from the listing requirement would have to comply with terms and conditions as may be determined by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka from time to time.
The second change is to permit persons who are currently appointed as insurance agents of an insurance company for one class of insurance business (i.e. either long term insurance business or general insurance business) to be appointed as agents of an insurance company for the other class of insurance business as well.
Prior to the amendment, the law permitted an insurance agent to work only for one insurance company.

IOC suspends Frankie Fredericks after France charges
LAUSANNE: Former world sprint champion Frankie Fredericks was on Tuesday suspended by the International Olympic Committee in the wake of corruption charges brought against him by French authorities.
The IOC Ethics Commission, while stressing the importance of respecting the principle of the presumption of innocence, recommended suspending the Namibian four-time Olympic silver medallist because of the impact on the reputation of the IOC.
The IOCs executive board duly added: Considering the gravity and urgency of the situation and its impact on the reputation of the IOC, the IOC EB decides to suspend Mr Frank Fredericks from all the rights, prerogatives and functions deriving from his quality as an IOC Member. Fredericks, who denies any involvement in untoward conduct, is being investigated by French authorities over a $299,300 (262,000 euros) payment he received from Papa Massata Diack, son of ex-International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) president Lamine Diack, on October 2, 2009 -- the day Rio won the bid.
Fredericks appeared before a Paris judge last Thursday. French investigators are looking into the possibility that bribes were paid over the awarding of both the 2016 Olympics to Rio and the 2020 Tokyo Games.
The investigation centres to a large extent around the activities of Papa Massata Diack, who along with Lamine Diack also faces charges in France over millions of dollars paid to cover up doping failures by Russian athletes. Fredericks insists that the payments, first revealed by Frances Le Monde newspaper in March, were received for promotional services provided between 2007 and 2011 under a contract signed on March 11, 2007, and had nothing to do with the Olympics.
Following the corruption allegations, 50-year-old Fredericks stepped down as head of the IOC committee evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics. The IAAF provisionally suspended Fredericks from its ruling council on July 17 as it launched a probe into the corruption allegations against him.

Joins hands with Guru Prathibha Prabha
A heart touching video titled Guru Panduru was shared extensively on social media recently. Inspired by a true story, the video was conceptualized by Rainco as a tribute to Teachers to coincide with Guru Prathibha Prabha, the National Felicitation Ceremony for Teachers.
Raincos symbolic association with Teachers is rooted within the image of the teacher, which is not complete without her carrying an umbrella, the core product of Rainco. Stemming from this concept the corporate has associated itself as being at the forefront of appreciating Teachers.
Organized by the Ministry of Education, the National Felicitation Ceremony Guru Prathibha Prabha aims to pay tribute to those special teachers we encounter, who have made a lasting impression on our lives. It is a ceremony of ovation for teachers who have contributed to enrich lives of students in remarkable ways.
The event was held recently at the BMICH with the attendance of the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as the Chief Guest along with the Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and State Minister of Education V. Radhakrishnan. Over four hundred teachers, principals and pirivena lecturers representing educational institutes were felicitated at the ceremony.
It has been an honour for Rainco to be associated with Guru Prathibha Prabha, which felicitates teachers,an idea close to us as a brand and core-product. Teachers play an important role in nurturing our future generation, but there are no large scale events where they are recognized for their silent services. A childs mind is molded, not only through the lessons they learn in the classroom, but also the lessons of humanity, compassion, respect and creativity. It is the teachers who are mainly responsible in inculcating these into a young mind. In the words of Michael Marpurgu It is the teacher that makes the difference, not the classroom, commented Aroos Ahmed, CEO of Rainco Private Limited.
Released to coincide with Teachers Day and the event, the Guru Panduru video tells a story of a little girl, who having lost her parents due to tragic circumstances, is a trouble maker in school. Her teacher, upon learning about her loss, begins to lovingly mentor her. The most whelming point is when the student gifts her mothers broken watch to the teacher on her birthday.

Lanka can expect investment to attain desired levels  C B Governor
As macroeconomic conditions stabilize and if the Budget is aligned to the governments Vision 2025, then investor confidence will change for the better and Sri Lanka can expect investment to attain desired levels, while the composition of credit growth too would change, Central Bank Governor Dr IndrajitCoomaraswamysaid yesterday.
He said Sri Lanka can expect a economic growth of 4 - 4.5% for 2017.
The Governor was speaking at the news conference to announce the seventh monetary policy review of the Central Bank, where the Bank chose to keep interest rates steady, as analysts predicted. Dr Coomaraswamy was answering a question as to why credit growth had not seen corresponding investment levels.
Investor sentiment is bound to change and will have a positive effect on investment, once there is consolidation of the fiscal discipline that has been introduced, the Governor said, adding that credit to the government had been relatively high in 2017, while in the private sector, credit was been sought by the construction industry.
He said that credit growth peaked to 28% in the middle of last year and the challenge was to bring it down to 15-16% by end 2017.
Dr Coomaraswamy said the real estate sector was segmented. At the lower end was the affordable housing sector which is experiencing heavy demand, at middle level was the property and residential market and at the high end was the luxury apartments market, where Sri Lanka has been witnessing a large inventory. e said there is a boom in this high end luxury apartment market and it may become necessary to undertake macroprudential measures, not for fear of a bubble or overheating in this segment, but to ensure sustained growth, as other countries have also undertaken. Central Bank Senior Deputy Governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe added that commercial banks will have their own macroprudential measures. He also added that the luxury apartment market peaked about six months ago.
Y-o-Y growth of credit to the private sector decelerated to 17.5% in September 2017, compared to a growth of 18% in August 2017.
In absolute terms, the increase in credit to the private sector in 2017 was Rs 50.1 billion, while the cumulative expansion in credit during the first nine months of 2017 was Rs 454.7 billion compared to Rs 515.8 billion for the corresponding period in 2016.
At the current pace of expansion, the Y-o-Y growth of credit by commercial banks is expected to decelerate to around 15% by end 2017.
Net credit to the government (NCG) from the banking system has declined by Rs 14 billion in 2017. However, so far for 2017, NCG from the banking system has increased by Rs 251.4 billion. The figure for 2016 was Rs 212.6 billion.
Credit to public corporations contracted by Rs 5.4 billion in September 2017. On a cumulative basis credit to public corporations increased by Rs 2.4 billion during the first nine months of 2017 compared to the contraction of Rs 27.9 billion during 2016. See page ii

Liability Management Act sets a ceiling on borrowing:CB Governor
Clarifying the provisions of the proposed Liability Management Act, Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that the Act provides for borrowing over and above the ceiling prescribed in the Appropriations Act and was to be used specially for debt servicing. The Governor said at present, the Appropriation Act sets a ceiling on borrowing  limited to budget deficit as reflected in this Act.
In effect, this meant the Central Bank could not borrow for liability management.
Dr.Coomaraswamy said the Liability Management Act would enable the Central Bank to raise money to address the bunching of external debt that will soon ensue. The Act also makes provision for borrowing to repay domestic debt.
The new Act will create space specifically to raise money for liability management, the Governor said.
Given public debt dynamics, we need to create space over and above borrowing requirement specifically for debt servicing.
In answer to a question from the media as to whether the new Act would further burden Sri Lanka with more borrowing, the Governor said that the Act specifies the reasons which would allow borrowing and set limits as well.
The Liability Management Act would institionalize fiscal policy and give it more teeth, just as monetary monetary policy has been institutionalized, Dr.Coomaraswamy said.

More is better
An Australian joke poses the question Why wasnt Jesus born in Australia, and answers it because God could not find a virgin and three wise men there!
When we encountered the idea of representative democracy; initially, very limited representation under the Colebrook reforms, gradually widened through Donoughmore and eventually to the post-independence autochthonous constitutions, a new creature had to be invented; an honourable man; public spirited, well-informed, with the skill and foresight to be an effective legislator.
For centuries preceding, there was no question of elected representation or legislative processes. By karmic ordain these were not matters that concerned the vast majority. To the weighty matters of the State, the King and his court had exclusive rights by birth.Sometimes; they referred to consultants, mainly soothsayers and men of religion. But the final decision was with the king. The primary concern of all royal courts was self- preservation and perpetuation.
This was more or less the order of things in nearly every ancient society and then appeared timeless, a permanent arrangement in governance.
But in a few places things evolved differently; the democratic instincts stirred, republican ideas emerged and mans intellectual horizons widened. Greece is a golden example of an early experience with democracy and republican concepts. These ideas took a grip in Western thought and began a slow evolution, now asserting itself, now retreating, nevertheless moving in the direction of a surer and clearer expression of the public will.
We cannot claim a parallel evolution in democratic tradition. From our first king to the last, from Vijaya to Sri Wickrema, the system was monarchial and despotic. There were no other thoughts of governance than one by a king and his coterie of high officials, a system by modern standards both arbitrary and essentially corrupt. For nearly two thousand years, no one offered anything different. Except for the ebb and flow of the fortunes of the various kings nothing else; ideas, technology or systems seem to have emerged. In technology, methods used a thousand years before are praised more than the inventions that emerged later! Not surprisingly, there were no intellectual movements towards a republic, representative form of government or even the rule of law.
Even today, there are many whose intellectual and emotional yearnings are for the diktats of a king, however tyrannical, corrupt or even buffoon like.
Enforcement of law and order
Ready or not, from early 20 Century, representation (mandate) became the guiding principle of legitimacy of government in our country. Onwards from 1948, we have been electing our own parliaments to make laws for us and our own governments to run our affairs. How they have fared in managing the country; its racial balance, its social and economic stability, legitimacy of the governing organs, institutional health and the general welfare of the people is recent history.
In the interim, we have faced two bloody insurrections, several widespread and destructive riots and a devastating separatist war that almost brought the house down. By any account, the responsibility for these dark events lies with our clumsy blundering leaders. Even in less gory times, enforcement of law and order seems at once oppressive, politicized and unintelligent; overall, lacking in transparency and moral authority. So bent are these agencies that in their eyes, those in power do no wrong.
Nearly all institutions of government have lost their luster, if not credibility. To questions like whether our Police is an independent law enforcement agency, whether State funds and property are treated as inviolable public assets, whether the Employees Provident Fund invests in the best interest of the contributing workers, whether the Central Bank determines our money supply and monetary policy with the countrys economy at heart, whether our institutions of higher learning are on par with other countries, there are no easy answers now; or perhaps the answer is easy, but not complimentary. In the seventy years since independence, whatever honour or integrity our institutions commanded have been sullied and in some cases lost forever. In their capabilities and strength, our national institutions have only retreated.
As a country, we are not only dangerously debt-ridden but have on several important economic indicators, descended in the order.
The quality of the laws that our parliaments have been passing, especially in their lack of clarity and consistency, have only contributed to the muddle. Some of the important financial laws have so many subsequent amendments that interpreting them is well-nigh impossible. They are so confusing and contradictory that the accepted purposive approach to interpretation has become unhelpful in unraveling the convoluted legislative thinking. Like everything else in a retrogressive society, we need to now resort to the unchallenging literal interpretation method to comprehend the laws passed by our legislators.
When it comes to constitution making our legislators have proved to be singularly inept. In the decade 1970-80 they were occupied in the testing task of constitution making, arguing that the way to the promised land is through a constitution. The two constitutions made by them (1972 and 1978)were met with concern and misgivings in several segments of the community and led eventually to wide-spread disaffection and instability. In fact, the 1970s were the beginning of one of the most harrowing periods of our recent history. It is widely believed that our constitution making is inspired by subjective considerations, and therefore are designed to the advantage of the makers; the very anti-thesis of good law making. Naturally, there is skepticism and even suspicion about the integrity of the process.The constitution makers disregard objections, and since they are fortified with the necessary numbers in parliament, go ahead and launch their constitution with a lot of fanfare. But before long it dawns on all concerned that they are now saddled with a constitution both troubling and faulty. We then spend the succeeding years working out how best to amend or drop the flawed constitution.
However, there is neither muddle nor ambiguity when legislators vote to bestow benefits and privileges on themselves. All political parties in the parliament are in agreement that our parliamentarians deserve the best; from generous allowances to duty free vehicles, subsidized meals to the state of the art health facilities (inevitably overseas, as local standards are suspect) and regular globe-trotting, and all this without any accountability.
Hierarchy of glamour
In the advanced democracies, one takes to a public life to enrich it with your ideas, capabilities and experience. It is obvious that this is not the case here. The enrichment works the other way. By taking to a public life the person is enriched in wealth, status and creature comforts. Almost every person who has taken to politics appears to be richer, at least wealth- wise, for it.
We do not know how many of them are tax payers, but in their life style our parliamentarians lack for nothing. There is an encouraging cultural support from the larger social ethos which elevates a politician (any office holder for that matter) to a high status, a person worthy of exaggerated respect and deference. Lacking in true heroes, the public turns to the fake. Any event; a wedding, a funeral, a school prize giving to a launch of a water project is enhanced if there is a politician present as the chief player. The attendance of a minister or two will send the event up in the hierarchy of glamour. To many a member of the public, a corrupt politician is an example of a successful career. Invariably, those who take to politics are gentrified by the experience, a common social ambition. Our poverty is not only a matter of wealth. It is a poverty of philosophy; a way of looking, assessing and judging that is very different. Those eyes now behold a successful gentle-man.
The surest indicator of the rapid social transformation of the parliamentarian is the newly acquired life style and the aspirations of his children.
They attend so called prestigious schools, mainly for the social-climbing value. When it comes to sport or even school boy fun, it is the most Western recreational activity, including a bit of sun bathing while sipping cocktails at a plush hotel pool. The lad will generally park himself in a plush apartment with a snob address. Invariably, the State provided security disturbs his equilibrium and under the cover of that protection the brat turns violent towards helpless customers at hotels and the night clubs he frequents. Then the boy is packed off to a Western country to take in the culture, and if possible acquire a qualification. On his return, the young man is overcome by the pathetic state of his compatriots and nobly sacrifices himself to a public life, truly his fathers son.
Having no history of representative democracy, the novel office of a parliamentarian has been understood only as an opportunity for a dazzling career, with life style advancement in every sphere, as the reward; an alien idea, interpreted by a cynical mindset.
A nonsense country gets no respect from reality. Talk we may, but we cannot pretend to be a big economy or even a fast growing one. The surest way for a Sri Lankan to earn an honest living is by getting employment overseas. Take out the humble tea bag and the low-technology garment industry and we have no industrial base. A stray dog attacks a young European tourist (he dies of rabies); the resulting cancellations send the already suffering industry in to painful spasms.
Per person productivity, whether it be agriculture or industry is below the international average. Even a small kiosk having about Rs. 100,000 per month turn-over, will need a minimum of two employees. When a Sri Lankan goes to a foreign embassy for a Visa, however genuine, he is treated like bad news- must you really come to our country Even embassies of secondary countries treat Sri Lankans with disdain. An oil ship, apparently wanting to unload low quality fuel on the country, is turned away. The whole country runs out of fuel and virtually comes to a stop.
Presently, we have some two hundred odd parliamentarians and a few hundred provincial councilors, falling into the category of politicians/legislators.
In their wisdom, our political leaders have come up with a brilliant answer to the burning problems of the country.
There is a need to increase; double, treble or even quadruple the number of legislators we have.
We are moved to silence by the sheer scope of this affront to a nations intelligence.
When a small number were so bad, how much worse the activities of a larger number!
One fine day, it may be asked why Sri Lanka cannot produce a good Parliament Where will we find good and honest men may be the obvious answer
Thus far, in this much troubled land, such men have proved to be a most rare and elusive species.

Nation building budget for 2018 - Eran
State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne said that the budget for the fiscal year 2018 will focus more on building the future.
It will also focus on building the countrys skills base and educating every child, strengthening small and medium industries and bringing them into the global export chain, Wickremaratne told the Daily News.
He said that although there will be benefits that are more immediate and beneficial to the public, but that alone will not be the focus of the budget.
A budget traditionally has been about giving the fish but this budget will be more about giving the rod. This budget which is about to be presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Thursday, is basically not a set of promises but will be a set of proposals which he will implement. His budget speech will set out a policy frame work, the Minister said.
According to a recent research conducted by Verite Research, only 3 percent of the budget proposals of the previous budget were on track, whereas information was not obtained for over 51 percent of the promises.
Speaking on the issue of implementing and tracking of the budget proposals, Wickremaratne said sticking to the promise that they gave when assuming office, the Parliamentary Office of the Budget will be fully functional by the end of 2018.
This will be an independent body from the finance ministry which then also becomes a way of monitoring. Then the legislature will not only approve the budget but it will also monitor the budget. Thats a step forward. Then on the executive side we have to obviously tighten our information system and also implementation of the project management side, he said.
He further reiterated that this it is very much more forward looking and to build the future as oppose to just short term relief. According to the Minister this budget in contrast to the budgets of the past will be about building this countrys future and laying the foundation for building a strong economy. The factors that fuelled past budgets had been more short term which is not good for the country or the economy.

Nearly 10,000 dengue patients detected in Kurunegala so far
During the past 10 months of this year, about 9,875 positive dengue patients have been detected from the Kurunegala district alone and they have taken medical treatments from government hospitals of the Kurunegala District.
However, about 22 of them have died from dengue during this period according to the records of the hospitals, said Kurunegala District Health Services Director Dr. Gamini Wimalaratne. Among the dead patients, there were several students as well, he said. Consequently, 80 percent of students dont attend government schools within the Kurunegala MC area at present.
Meanwhile, a joint search operation was conducted by both Department of Health Services of the North Western Province (NWP) and the NWP Department of Education, in several government school premises in the Kurunegala urban area on November 4 and seven leading schools of them were found to be have mosquito-breeding grounds infested with mosquito larvae.
The school premises where mosquito-breeding grounds were found were from Kurunegala Sir John Kotalawele MV, Lakdas De Mel MV, Wayamba Royal College, Maliyadewa Boys College, and St. Annes College in Kurunegala. This special Dengue control operation was conducted by Special Government Dengue Control Unit under the guidance of NWP-PC Health Services Provincial Director Dr. N. Fareed.
All errant school heads who had mosquitoes within their school premises would be warned over their negligence and all schools within the NWP would be instructed to launch shramadana campaigns to destroy mosquitoes with the help of parents, teachers, pupils, past pupils and volunteers, said Kurunegala Senior Director of Education W. M. Balasooriya, yesterday.
About 125 health officials had participated in this operation.

Trump tells South Korean President
North Korean threat requires global action
SOUTH KOREA: North Korea poses a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action, President Donald Trump said in Seoul Tuesday, but insisted we are making a lot of progress in reining in the rogue state.
The US leader, standing alongside his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-In, reiterated he was prepared to use the full range of American military might in order to halt Pyongyangs march towards becoming a full-fledged nuclear power.
But he added: It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table to make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and the people of the world. North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires a worldwide action.
I think we are making a lot of progress, he said, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping -- whom he has often claimed holds the key to disarming the North -- has been very, very helpful.
After a relaxed few days in Tokyo, Seoul is a more complicated stop for the mercurial US president.
Trumps relationship with the liberal-leaning Moon has been cool, and the former real estate magnate has railed at South Korean moves to engage its neighbour -- something he has previously labelled appeasement.
But he began his diplomatic day vowing to figure it all out with fine gentleman Moon, despite their differences on the nuclear-armed North.
As tensions over Pyongyangs weapons programme have soared, the US president has traded personal insults and threats of war with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.
Trump arrived from Japan, where he secured Tokyos full support for Washingtons stance that all options are on the table regarding Pyongyang, and declaring its nuclear ambitions a threat to the civilised world and international peace and stability.
He enjoyed three days of near-bromance with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, calling him wonderful after a round of golf and describing US-Japan ties as really extraordinary.
But at Camp Humphreys on Tuesday, where US forces stationed in the country have moved their headquarters from downtown Seoul, he and Moon sought a rapprochement.
Ultimately, it will all work out on North Korea, said Trump. It always works out. It has to work out. And Moon -- whose parents were evacuated from the North on a US ship during the Korean War -- was abundant in his praise for the United States.
They say one knows a true friend when one is in need, he told Trump. The United States is a true friend who has been with us and has bled with us in our time of need. South Korea is rolling out the red carpet for Trump as it seeks messages of assurance about the alliance and US resolve.
But while Trump has threatened Pyongyang with fire and fury, Moon is mindful that much of Seoul is within range of the Norths artillery and in an address to parliament last week demanded. - AFP

Had 2003 UNP Govt. continued, Trincomalees 99 oil tanks would be functional: PM
Had the 2003 UNP Government continued all 99 oil tanks in Trincomalee would have been fully operational today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said, in reply to the accusations over leasing out oil tanks to the Indian Oil Company.
Speaking in Parliament yesterday, the Premier said that when the 2003 agreement with India was inked, the oil tanks in Trincomalee were idling as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was not in a position to make use of them.
Then there was a change of Governments and the agreement was postponed. In 2015, we had discussions with India to resume the project as the CPC had no financial capacity to embark on it alone as it was burdened with a huge debt. If we were to develop the Trinco oil tank farm, it would be sufficient to store enough buffer stocks for Sri Lanka and part of India, he noted.
The Premier said the LIOC had imported another fuel shipment from India to cater to the increased demand and it would arrive in the country by Thursday or Friday.
Both President Sirisena and I spoke to the Indian High Commissioner in this regard. This fuel shipment was in addition to the shipment ordered by the CPC, he said, explaining on the urgent measures taken to settle the problem.
While expressing his regrets over the inconvenience caused to the public due to the petrol shortage, the Premier assured that the situation would normalize by the end of this week.
The Premier, replying to the Joint Opposition's complaints in the House on the 2003 agreement with India, questioned back as to why the former regime led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not cancel it and send the IOC away when it held ruling power.
If you do not want India's involvement, you could have terminated it and developed these tanks during the 10 years you held ruling power, he added.
Wickremesinghe also pointed out that China had expressed interest in constructing an oil refinery in Hambantota.
Our plans to renovate the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery with Iranian support was delayed due to sanctions imposed on Iran. Later, when we came up with plans for a second refinery at Hambantota, you were campaigning even against that project together with some Trade Unions.
You try to chase away the investors by petitioning the Supreme Court, he told the Joint Opposition.
Unparliamentary remarks-Speaker takes Vasu to task
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday took Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara to task as the latter had accused him of being responsible for the fuel crisis in the country.
MP Nanayakkara, when he was given the opportunity to ask for a clarification from Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, went on to charge that the current situation was caused by the flaws in the 2003 agreement signed with India and that the Speaker should take the blame for it as the then Petroleum Minister.
The seemingly miffed Speaker, demanded the MP to withdraw the comment, stating that it was a collective decision of the then Cabinet of Ministers. You cannot point the finger at an individual minister for a Cabinet decision. You are a senior Parliamentarian. You stooped to such a attitude today to accuse the Speaker blatantly disregarding Parliamentary traditions, the Speaker told the MP.
Four Bills passed in Parliament with amendments
The Judicature (Amendment) Bill, Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses (Amendment) Bill, Prevention of Crimes (Amendment) Bill and Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill were passed yesterday in Parliament with amendments.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said in Parliament, that the number of High Court Judges would be increased by 45 percent in order to hasten the hearing of criminal cases with the implementation of these Amendment bills, while making the witnesses in a criminal case enable to provide evidence while remaining overseas. He made this observation moving the second reading debate on the four motions.
He said there was a need to set up a Special Court to take up Corruption and Fraud Cases. He also said that to implement the policy, the number of judges had to be increased. "In order to meet the needed number of judges, this measure was taken," the Deputy Minister said. "The criminal cases should be heard continuously. However, there are reasons for the delay of those hearings." "The number of High Court Judges would be increased by 45 percent," Deputy Minister Perera said. "Hence the number of High Court Judges would be increased from 75 to 110."
Commencing the debate, the Deputy Minister said that motions were very necessary for the reformation of the Judiciary. He said the country had already passed an Act to protect victims of crimes and witnesses of the same case. He added that the country had made it available to enable witnesses of a case before Commercial High Court to give evidence, while remaining overseas. "But this is impossible in relation to a criminal case," Deputy Minister Perera said. "These measures would make it possible and it is a responsibility of a responsible society."
Speaker says he too was affected by fuel crisis
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday, that he too had been affected by the fuel crisis and his vehicles too had run out of petrol.
He made this observation when Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake raised the fuel crisis in Parliament making special statements under Standing Orders 23(2).
MP Gunawardena queried as to how could the severity of the issue be faced by the common people, as the Speaker too had been affected by the issue with no petrol for his vehicles. He added that Parliament should understand the severity of the problem.
The entire country is suffering from this crisis. Normal life and the economy are affected because of this problem prevailing for the past several days. It is the duty of the government and the minister responsible to inform the nation when they would solve the problem," said MP Gunawardena. "Who is responsible for the maintenance of stocks of petrol Now we do not have the ownership of the oil tanks in Trincomalee. There is a crisis in the refinery. Who is taking the responsibility for this crisis
He also said that Sri Lanka had lost the opportunity of constructing and maintaining the Hambantota refinery.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that there was a procedure of importing petrol. "But five ship loads of petrol had been unloaded recently against the procedure," MP Dissanayake said. "There is a massive loss caused by that action. The estimated loss is around 40 million US dollars. The Trincomalee oil tanks have been given over to the Indian Oil Company. Now you could see what the results are. The minister had stated that there was pressure from politicians to permit unloading of substandard petrol, but he acted against it. Will the minister inform the House who exerted pressure on him"
MP Dissanayake also said the problem would be a long term one if the LIOC was allowed to involve themselves in fuel supplying in Sri Lanka.
To recognise high performances of state institutes-COPA organises National Awards ceremony
The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has organized a National Awards Ceremony to recognize 81 State Institutions that had achieved a high level of performance.
The ceremony will be held on November 13 at 12 noon at the Parliamentary Complex with President Maithripala Sirisena as the Chief Guest and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Guest of Honour.
The institutions with high performance levels have been selected by evaluating the data related to all 842 public institutions coming under the Committees scope, using a specially designed computer programme. All Ministries, Government Departments, Special Spending Units of the Government, Provincial Councils, District Secretariats and Local Government Authorities come under COPAs scrutiny.
No MP privileges for Geetha
Sandasen Marasinghe and Disna Mudalige
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya instructed Parliamentary authorities to debar Geetha Kumarasinghe from entering parliament premises, using MP privileges, Parliamentary sources revealed yesterday.
The Speaker issued new directives in line with the Supreme Court decision that stated Kumarasinghe will not be entitled to continue to take her seat in Parliament due to her dual citizenship.
The sources also revealed that following the Supreme Court decision being conveyed to Parliament on Monday (6), the Speaker informed the Elections Commission that Kumarasinghe will no longer be considered a Parliamentarian.
The Supreme Court declared that a person holding dual citizenship, at the time of nomination, and taking oaths, could not function as a Member of Parliament, confirming the Court of Appeal decision issued earlier which was later on challenged by Kumarasinghe before the Supreme Court.

Petrol shipment arriving tonight
The petrol shortage will come to an end by noon tomorrow (9) with a fuel shipment reaching Sri Lanka by 9 pm today (8), Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranthunga yesterday.
He said that it was predicted that the fuel ship will reach Sri Lanka by 11 pm today but it has been calculated by observing the position of the ship via satellite that the ship will reach the country around 9 pm today.
With the shipment reaching the harbour today, distribution will enable consumers to obtain fuel by noon tomorrow, Minister Ranathunga said.
The Minister was responding to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the issue. Ranathunga stated he was sure of the quality of the fuel shipment as he had assigned two persons to get it inspected before distribution.
