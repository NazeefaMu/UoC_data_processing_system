Accordingly, no posters, election symbol can be fixed anywhere except at the respective candidates' election office established in the particular election area, and on the vehicle, which is used by a candidate.
He said the UPFA will act with the rules and regulations imposed by the Chairman of the Election Commission that is because it is a fruitful measure for a peaceful election.

Rain in Apura insufficient for Maha Seasonal cultivation
Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayake emphasized that the monsoon rain so far received in the Anuradhapura district is not at all sufficient for launching a successful Maha Seasonal cultivation. He said so referring to the present situation of the 2017/2018 maha cultivation plants to the Daily News.
"In the Anuradhapura district, farmers have experienced heavy cultivation loses during consecutive cultivation seasons due to the drought. Our target for the 2017/2018 Maha Season is to cultivate paddy in 130,000 hectares. So far, 100 percent cultivation could be done only under Tisawewa tank. No paddy cultivation is currently possible under the 3,000 minor irrigation tanks. In this background, it is envisaged that around 35 percent out of the targetted landscape of 130,000 hectares could be cultivated during the Maha Season," he said.
Wanninayake said that under the current circumstances, the distribution of free dry food ration bags would continue for another round. So far, Rs. 1.388 million has been invested for this relief measure, involving 149,000 drought-affected farmer families in the district. In the meantime, for remedying the fertilizer shortage, mainly urea, the distribution of fertilizer is being done through the 43 agrarian services centers in the district. Wanninayake said that within a few days, the fertilizer shortage would be over.
He added that the Agriculture Department, jointly with agrarian services development authorities, are transporting fertilizer stocks directly to the agrarian services centers at the rate of Rs. 2,480 per bag. Farmers could buy the fertilizer at Rs. 2,500 per bag from the agrarian services development centers. Anuradhapura Agrarian Services Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said that so far, around 750 metric tonnes of urea have been sold to farmers from 25 agrarian services development centers, and stocks are currently arriving at the other centers.

Ad hoc tax on glove manufacture  may divert US$ 100 mn from SL
One of the leading industrial glove manufacturers in the world, based in Katunayake and Koggala has second thoughts about investing a further US$ 100 million and generating an additional 4,000 jobs in the country.
This is due to the recent imposition of ad hoc taxes such as excise levy on non-portable spirits (methanol) which is one the prime raw materials in industrial glove manufacturing.
This move will certainly impede our expansion developments especially in the recently opened factory in the South as this is a clear violation of the BOI initial agreement, an official from the company said.
We entered Sri Lanka in 1992 as an exporter and registered under Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No 4 of 1978. Since our commencement in Katunayake, we have expanded to other industrial export processing zones in Sri Lanka, providing direct employment to over 6,000 and over 50,000 indirect dependents.
To date, the company has invested more than US$ 200 million and we have planned to invest in many more plants in the South and they were done on the assumption that the government will offer all support to help the investor.
This was clearly mentioned in the very first agreement we made in 1992 which says that all imports of plant, equipment, machinery and construction material, raw material and other material to be used for and by the enterprise for the sole purpose of the said business within the said zone shall not be liable for ANY import duty and shall not be subjected to ANY Customs or ANY other like restrictions.
This excise levy of Rs. 25 for methanol was originally introduced in the 2016 budget proposal. After continuous requests made by us, the levy was withheld by the Finance Ministry. But with effect from August 1, 2017, this levy was imposed again and subsequently was removed on August 22. However, once again this is imposed with an amended amount with effect from November 10, 2017. Recently the amount was once again amended on December 19, 2017.
By the imposition of this ad hoc tax we have been treated differently as a manufacturer as all other BOI companies are allowed to import all raw materials tax free for export purposes. We, like all manufacturers, have to compete in the world market and such levies of this nature will force us not to invest in Sri Lanka and look at another regional country.
We must also thank and highly appreciate Minster Malik Samarawickrama and Board of Investment Directors for the cooperation extended so far trying to remove this levy. We sincerely hope that in the coming days that they will be able to convince the Minister of Finance to remove such levies on BOI manufacturing companies.

Afghanistan suicide attack: Dozens killed in Kabul

At least 40 people have been killed and 30 wounded in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul.
A Shia cultural and religious organisation and media offices of the Afghan Voice agency were hit.
The interior ministry told the BBC a suicide blast was followed by another two explosions in the area. No-one has yet said they were behind the attack.
In recent months, so-called Islamic State has been carrying out attacks on Shia targets across the country.
Both the Tabayan cultural centre and offices of Afghan Voice were at the location of the attack.
Students were among those who had gathered at the centre for a discussion forum.
The interior ministry said the event was to mark the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The initial explosion was followed by two others that appeared to target those trying to help victims. Images on social media showed a number of bodies in a courtyard following the blast.
Student Mohammad Hasan Rezayee told Tolo News: "After the blast there was fire and smoke inside the building and everyone was pleading for help."
Local hospitals are treating the dozens of people wounded, and there are fears the death toll could rise.
Who could have carried it out
There are unconfirmed reports that the IS group has said it was behind the attack but BBC correspondents say this has not yet come from an official IS source.
The Taliban issued a statement saying they were not involved.
Both groups have carried out frequent attacks across the country, although the Taliban are not known to specifically target Shia groups.
Shia fears
In recent months IS has attacked many Shia targets in the west of Kabul, where the majority of the city's Shia population live.
The Tabayan centre also has offices in the Iranian cities of Tehran and Mashhad and is believed to have close ties with religious and cultural centres in Iran.
There are growing fears that IS is trying to spark a Sunni-Shia sectarian war in Afghanistan and the Shia community is increasingly dissatisfied with President Ashraf Ghani's government for failing to protect them.
US-led foreign forces meanwhile continue to engage IS in eastern Afghanistan and President Trump, in his new Afghan strategy, has pledged to root out IS in the country, as it has been in Iraq and Syria.
How is IS involved in Afghanistan
IS announced the establishment of its "Khorasan" branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015.
It initially gained ground in the east and north, although it has lost territory there and was largely eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Taliban and operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces.
IS has since resorted mainly to guerrilla tactics and is estimated to have a force of between 1,000 and 5,000 fighters.
IS considers Shia apostates and aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shias.
In October, at least 39 people were killed in an attack on a mosque belonging to the Shia minority.
In April, the US said it haddropped the "Mother of All Bombs" on IS in eastern Afghanistan, but the group continues its attacks.
What has the reaction been
President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman issued a statement describing the latest attack as an "unpardonable" crime against humanity.
Amnesty International's South Asia director, Biraj Patnaik, said: "This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians. In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups."
Are the media under specific attack
It has been a difficult year. Afghanistan remains one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists and media workers.
In November, IS said it was behinda gun attack on the Shamshad TV station that killed one staff member.
In May, two media workers, including a BBC driver, were killed in a massive bomb attack in Kabul.
The first six months of 2017 saw a surge in violence against journalists, with local monitorthe Afghan Journalists Safety Committeerecording 73 cases, an increase of 35% in comparison to the same period in 2016.
Last year seven members of staff from the private Tolo television station were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul.

FAISALABAD: While the whole world is praising Rohit Sharma for his 35-ball T20I century, Babar Azam got there in nine fewer deliveries  while playing for SAF Green in a T10 charity match in Faisalabad, organised by the Shahid Afridi Foundation.
Batting first, SAF Reds scored 210 runs in 10 overs, and SAF Greens strong response was powered by a magnificent hundred by Babar Azam in 26 balls.
Ironically during the SAF Red innings, Babars national teammate Shoaib Malik hammered him for six sixes in an over. Until then, it was proving to be a bad game for the 23-year-old Pakistani cricketer but he redeemed himself in style touching triple figures in 26 balls.
Babar hammered a barrage of 11 sixes and seven boundaries at an amazing strike rate of 384.62.
The Lahore natives knock ensured SAF Greens victory in what was expected to be a tricky chase, with skipper Shahid Afridi hitting the final boundary through the offside to win the game.

BOCs Kekirawa branch wins GREENS Gold Rating Award
The Bank of Ceylon was recently awarded the prestigious GREENS Gold Rating at the GBSL Awards Ceremony 2017 organized by the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka with special reference to the Banks Kekirawa branch building which was built according to eco-friendly standards.
The awards ceremony is scheduled to take place with the participation of the Chairman of the World Green Building Council as the chief guest, at the Earls Regency Hotel, Kandy.
The Banks Kekirawa branch was refurbished and re-built in early 2017 using minimal environmentally hazardous methods and materials whilst minimizing the cost by recycling and up-cycling materials that were taken from the previous building.
BOC Kekirawa branch was one of the three initial branches to be converted as a green branch and the other two were Kilinochchi and Tissamaharama branches. Currently BOC maintains 20 branches under the 'Green Banking Concept'.
When re-furbishing the branch, minimal material usage and use of eco-friendly materials were taken to account and improved to give a better environmental quality. The interior of the Kekirawa branch is designed to let in as much daylight as possible to minimize the usage of electricity during day time whilst using batten type LED bulbs with a specially manufactured diffuser system. Solar panels were fixed to produce 83% of the electricity used by the branch.
All necessary fixtures and fittings are environmentally certified. These include air conditioners that have inverter technology, automated fresh air ducting and are CFC free. They measure indoor air quality with CO2 metres. The branch also includes a vertical green garden that helps to maintain a comfortable interior temperature and which refreshes air and improves air quality and uplifts the overall atmosphere.
These green gardens are maintained through a supply of rain water whenever possible through the rain water harvesting system that is installed within the branch. Well planned landscaping allows the branch to save 25% of the energy compared to a similar type of base building.
Moving forward the bank has formulated its comprehensive sustainability policy to address strategic placement of procedures and processes to strengthen the triple bottom line: social, economic and environmental pillars. Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility is embedded into the Sustainable Policy of the Bank.
The strategic implementation of digital transformation that commenced in early 2014 has gradually replaced many of traditional procedures, policies and technologies and has laid down a solid foundation for the Bank to embark on green banking, said General Manager D.M. Gunasekara.
The Bank of Ceylon has been engaged in green initiatives such as e-learning, altering internal systems and processes to be tech-savvy, thereby achieving a minimized carbon footprint, paper recycling and e-waste management apart from maintaining green branches.Engaging the society to walk along with this noble initiative the Bank planted 100,000 trees in line with its 75th anniversary in 2014 gathering school children and public from all over the country.
The Bank continues to maintain these trees. BOC was also recognized as the highest financial assistance provider for solar power technology, at the ceremony held to mark the generation of 100 mega watts through renewable energy organized by the Ministry of Power and Energy. For BOC, improving social and economic well-being is an integral part of its core operations. In this regard, the Bank ensures that it follows ethical guidelines to sustain customer relationships.
Whilst providing a dedicated banking service to its community, BOC looks into the sustainability of their customers business as well. The Bank at all times encourages environmentally friendly projects and sees that loans and advances are granted to deserving environmentally friendly projects that reap greater benefits for the community.

Centurion Cook, Broad defy critics as England hit back
Melbourne: Alastair Cook hit a long-awaited century and Stuart Broad snapped up four wickets as Englands much-maligned old guard finally enjoyed a day to remember in the Ashes series on Wednesday.
At 3-0 down after three Tests, the Ashes urn is already lost to Australia but Cook and Broad showed their careers are not over yet after critics had questioned their place in the England team.
In scorching heat in Melbourne, England bowled out the Australians for 327, with 113-Test paceman Broad capturing four wickets for 51 runs in his best bowling performance in more than a year.
Cook then ended a 10-innings stretch without a half-century, the longest drought of his 151-Test career, to claim his 32nd Test ton.
At the close, England were 192 for two and trailing by 135 runs with Cook, playing in an English-record 34th consecutive Ashes Test, unbeaten on 104 and skipper Joe Root providing support on 49 in a 112-run partnership.
Cook had a huge and symbolic let-off on 66 when rival skipper Steve Smith put down a two-handed chance after a couple of grabs at the ball in the slips off Mitchell Marsh.
But apart from the drop, it was more like the former captains signature batting after just 83 runs in his previous six innings of the series. The Australians claimed two wickets with Josh Hazlewood trapping James Vince leg before wicket for 17 and Mark Stoneman out to a blinding one-handed return catch by spinner Nathan Lyon for 15.
Australia, already without the injured Mitchell Starc, had enforcer Pat Cummins on and off the field with a stomach complaint and down on pace and trademark bounce.
England earlier ended Steve Smiths incredible three-year unbeaten run in Melbourne as they bowled out the hosts for 327 just after lunch, claiming the last seven wickets for 67 runs.
Debutant Tom Curran celebrated his first Test wicket as Smith chopped a short, wide delivery on to his stumps on 76, early on the second day.
Smith had not been dismissed in a Melbourne Test match since Boxing Day 2014, and was on track for his third century of the series on a bat-friendly MCG pitch.
In the last three Boxing Day Tests, Smith scored 192 against India, 134 not out against the West Indies and an unbeaten 165 last year against Pakistan.
With his dismissal, Smith has now scored 502 runs in the Ashes series at a stunning average of 125.50.
It was an overdue slice of luck for Curran, who had David Warner caught on 99 only to have the dismissal overturned for an overstepping no-ball on Tuesdays opening day. Warner went on to score 103.
England got more return for bowling wide of the stumps when Mitchell Marsh also dragged on a Chris Woakes delivery for nine after his 181 in the third Test in Perth.
His elder brother, Shaun, lost a leg before wicket review on 61 off 148 balls to Stuart Broad.
Tim Paine became the third batsman to chop on to his stumps in the session for 24 off James Anderson, while Jackson Bird fell lbw to Broad for four.
Cummins was snapped up at slip off Broad for four, before Lyon was lbw to Anderson for a duck to end the Australian innings. AFP

China to broker new Afghanistan-Pakistan talks
PAKISTAN: Chinese diplomacy apparently has succeeded in persuading Afghanistan to begin a wide-ranging dialogue proposed by Pakistan for mending strained bilateral relations.
The decision came at Tuesdays first trilateral talks Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted in Beijing between his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts.
Last month, Islamabad shared with Kabul what it called an Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Solidarity (APAPS) for a constructive and meaningful engagement between the two countries. The proposed plan, officials say, would create working groups in politics, economics, the military, intelligence sharing, and issues related to Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
There is a response now from our brothers in Afghanistan. I think things will start moving on the formation of the five groups on different topics entailed in this proposal and there will be progress on this proposal, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told a joint news conference at the trilateral talks.
Asif did not elaborate and credited China for the headway made on the proposed dialogue with Kabul.
China is fully supportive of this effort and today during the discussions, it was part of our deliberations and this proposal is practically, if I may so, part of the dialogue, which took place today, noted the Pakistani foreign minister.
Without directly commenting on remarks made by his Pakistani counterpart, Afghan Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani praised Beijing for arranging Tuesdays dialogue and said that China has very good relations with both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
We are confident that China will play its role as an honest broker and someone that both countries [Afghanistan and Pakistan] believe and are happy to work with, said Rabbani.

CIFL depositors on quest  to recover their money
Depositors of CIFL who have been denied of their money with due interests at a press conference held at OPA observed that an integrated approach is being made to recover their money.
CIFL depositors Association President Vijaya Gunawardena said, We already have had several discussions with the Central Bank on measures taken to retrieve depositors money from CIFL with the due interests.
Originally we deposited large sums of money with the CIFL since it had the Central Banks license. From that initial deposit base of Rs 3.5 billion, they have invested Rs 1.2 million in Aspic Homes a subsidiary of CIFL. Aspic Homes has not paid our money back with the due interests to its mother company. Now the depositors who are denied of their finances are in the process of helping CIFL to recover that money from Aspic Homes, he added.
We received interests for our deposits up to 2013 and since then not a single cent has been paid to depositors, Gunawardena stressed.
Dakshitha Bogollagama who is a Director of Citi Finance Company and an investor said an integrated approach is made towards recovering the due amounts of money from Aspic Homes.
It was said at the press-con that Bogollagama was in touch with investors from Singapore who are willing to invest money in the company once it startsed smooth sailing.
Citi Finance Corporation Limited Company has been commissioned in 1962 with the name; Industrial Finance Limited by Thudawe brothers.
In 2008 Industrial Finance Limited Companys balance sheet showed a risk of Rs 400 million thus Aspic Group bought the company. At the time CIFL was a subsidiary of Aspic Group.

Tsunami, endless agony
I am writing this as December 26 brought in great grief to me about the loss of life of several thousands of innocent people and how I escaped from that vast devastation.
On December 26, 2004, I, being an ex employee of an institution, joined its employees to go to Galle to attend the funeral of the father of a colleague. As the bus that had been organised did not turn up, an A/C bus was hired from Pettah and we left Fort around 9.30 a.m. As we had to pick up two of our friends from Panadura, we stopped there and while one of the friends was getting in, an outsider with bags in hand tried to enter the bus.
Our conductor said that ours was a special bus'. But he begged saying that his house had been destroyed by the seawaters and that the fate of his family was not known. Nobody cared for his words and the bus started its journey. A few yards away we had to again stop the bus to pick another friend who was late and the same person rushed to our bus and stated the same story and this time very innocently pleaded to allowed in. His request was turned down again and the bus moved.
Having travelled a long distant, we saw some people gathered on a bridge and I said jokingly that someone had jumped into a river and committed suicide. Then we came across another bridge and there too people were watching something. I then said that since the boy had committed suicide the girl too had attempted to end her life in that river for which all laughed.
After we did some more distance, we saw some people running here and there and we thought that some people were still enjoying and celebrating Christmas.
When we were closer to Waskaduwa the bus radio was on and then we heard saying that Galle road was under sea water and therefore traffic was being diverted. And in a few minutes time it announced that about 30 navy personnel were downed in Galle. Only then we took the matter seriously and from the point of Waskaduwa we were not allowed to proceed.
Though a few amongst us wanted to proceed through Mathugama others discouraged us. In the meantime, or families had to tried in vain to contact us on our mobile phones and we too could not contact them.
The following day we understood the complete devastation that had taken place with a name called tsunami'. The cancellation of the bus had saved us from the tsunami and even now when we think of that person who frantically tried to board our bus we feel very, very sorry for we did not know at all what had been happening in the coastal area of the south. Still, the pathetic scenes of him flash before my eyes when the subject of tsunami is spoken.
Oh, you tsunami, the greatest enemy of the world!

The Clifford Cup came into being in 1911 when Lady Elizabeth Clifford (wife of the acting Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hugh Clifford) was interested in the annual rugby football fixture between Low Country and Up Country and expressed a wish that a match take place in Colombo on her birthday 26 August, between teams representing the United Services and All Ceylon. Arrangements were made to play the match on August 26, but it was not to be as the venue the Race Course was not available on that particular day. The following year 1912 on September 2 the match finally took place and Kandy United Services defeated All Ceylon by 25-0. The All Ceylon team comprised entirely of European expatriates. Rugby was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I. It was once again revived by Sir Hugh Clifford who returned to Ceylon as the Governor and Lady Clifford.
The Clifford Cup was awarded to the winner of a quadrangular tournament comprising Low Country, Up Country, Ceylonese and the United Services. The first tournament in 1926 featured Ceylonese a team composed of entirely locally born players. Ceylonese lost the match against the Kandy United Services. The competition continued until 1938, when it was disrupted by the advent of the Second World War. In 1950 the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union decided to grant official status and a new system was planned and the cup was introduced to the club tournament, where clubs like Kandy Sports Club, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya MCC, Uva Gymkhana Club, (KV) Kelani Valley Club, Havelock Sports Club, CR & FC, and CH & FC took part. Havelock SC became the first champions. Then in 1961 five affiliated rugby clubs, Police, Army, University, Air Force and Navy from Division B were invited to join the tournament and play against the constituent clubs, forming a 13 team competition. The format of the competition was also changed, whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the league season the best eight teams competed in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup. In 1975, the format was further adjusted to give prominence to the teams who are able to score the highest number of goals. In 1985, the rugby league competition was renamed the John Player Gold Leaf Rugby Championships and the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union decided to award the Clifford Cup to the winners of a separate knock-out tournament, conducted among the A Division clubs held at the end of the regular season.
Kandy Sports Club has won the Clifford Cup a record 21 times since 1992. The CR&FC have won it 14 times, including a tie with Dimbulla ACC, Havelocks SC have won it 13 times including a tie with Police SC, Police SC 8 times with ties against Havelock SC and Army SC, CH & FC 7 times, Dimbulla A & CC twice including a tie with CR&FC, Army SC twice with one tie with Police SC, whilst Air Force SC and Navy SC have only won the cup once.

Day-night Test 'unlikely' in 2019 Ashes - ECB
Melbourne: England will be unlikely to stage a day-night Ashes Test match when Australia tour in 2019, England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison said on Wednesday.
Harrison said England did not need a pink-ball Test in their home Ashes schedule, although Australia has already staged four day-night Tests in recent years.
The two countries played the first day-night Test against each other in the second match of the current series at Adelaide Oval earlier this month.
A further two day-night Tests -- against India and Sri Lanka -- are likely to be staged in the 2018-2019 season.
"It's to be decided, but it's unlikely, to be honest," Harrison told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation during the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne.
"I think we've got a format that works brilliantly well for us in Ashes cricket in the UK.
"Right time, right place, right conditions are the rules for day-night Test cricket. I think we'll wait and see, but it's unlikely I would say."
Cricket Australia counterpart James Sutherland said he was comfortable with the ECB's decision, if it materialised.
"We're obviously great advocates of it, we've seen the success of it here but Tom knows his conditions better," Sutherland said. AFP

The Joint Opposition (JO) would regret the decision of not contesting with the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, some Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) talk about the victory of the flower bud party, but they have not obtained the membership of that party. It is because they still need the SLFP and are scared of facing the disciplinary action of the SLFP. Minister Seneviratne was addressing the gathering during a meeting held in Ratnapura recently.
The minister pointed out that the fear of the SLFP MPs who support the flower bud party is a good indicator for the unity of the two sections. It is hard to get together, and it is easy to divide.
The strength of the SLFP is growing day by day. The supporters of other political parties such as the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) join hands with President Sirisena.
The political leaders of the SLFP and the JO have understood the value of unity.
The people of the country have also understood that President Sirisena is a leader who does not give a chance to racism, ethnic differences, etc., and that he is the leader who can bring reconciliation. The SLFP would win this upcoming local government polls without any challenge, he added.

If coach Sean for Kandy, Nilufer Ibrahim with Army, Fijian Ferry CR, Lagga for CH, Martis with Havies, Jayatilaka guiding Navy etc...have thoughts collectively ..its certainly is about how they might run their best and fittest, stamp some class and shape their survival in the middle. Coaches will dread the thought of injuries to their key players ..physios working triple hard to get a full squad for mid week training.
Now its the warrior and big match ups..the confrontation of the islands more skilled and gifted, in a one on one battle...to determine the champions.
Dialog cant be much happier with the league status and determination of the top 4 sides pushing for honours in 2018. Kandy sitting fairly pretty, Navy and Havelocks very keen to give their rank a solid drive up, with greater ambitions ahead.
All said and despite the popular hype..its still the best thing for miles around.
The fans getting more determined and mighty keen to see their team challenging the best at every inch of loose play...and consistent squads, defence to grind results out. This is the heart of Dialog rugby and defiantly, the statement of impact sport in Sri Lanka.
My greatest fear is the distinct lack of big performances, and poor commitment at national level..for tours.
The fix should be a high performance future for our elite, all year round, and professional administrators to maintain the balance annually.
Sri Lanka travel to the Hong Kong 7s on merit with a chance of qualifying for the rugby World 7s series from the Asian nomination. What a stupendous achievement that would be for all of us fans, if Sri Tuskers 7 beat the likes of Kenya, Canada, Jamaica, Nigeria, and USA...make new history and a joyous way to welcome the new year.
Its all down to conditioning and how much our determination shines bright. Its the stark reality of our position in Asian rugby ...and what our future holds..
We must contemplate the stature of international rugby and accept to develop step by step ..questions about player insurance and safety, professional contracts, proper medical support across all formats etc ...our biggest hurdles to-date.
Change is the way forward...soak in stats and sheer magic from Japan, especially their union policy and determination to push for a spot in the top 12 world ranking...become a force and fly 1st class with the RWC 2019.
National policy matches and support rugby policy from top to the ball for kick off every weekend.
Their wisdom in hiring Eddie Jones as coach, reflects the enhanced stature in thinking and their singular ambition to be a force in the rugby world.
Our islanders rugby will revolve around personalities and their vision to ape Japans remarkable journey over the last 3 seasons...the transformation too dramatic to imagine ...and deliciously possible realities for the rest of Asia.
If we start to get it right ...then our days of flying 1st class, not too far away and seemingly unattainable.
Round 2 is all about injury management and how good the quality of finishing for our marauding warriors.
Teams to watch will definitely be an inspired CH, with the likes of Keegle, Weerakoon, Samuel, Herath..hopefully fully fit and itching to run ..plus Saranga, Satya, Yoshita, Sasanka, stepping it up from their opener in Welisera vs Navy.
There will be no love lost and Gertha Perera, desperately seeking revenge for that earlier loss...its going to be a cracker.
CR, Havelocks and Army will be licking their lips at the chance of taking a bite from Kandy and their blind ambition to fight for that league title..impossible though it may seem on paper
Enjoy the rugby, marvel at the warrior class and their conditioning..see their skills in glorious sunshine..all matches are 4pm kickoffs, except the Havies stadium 6.30 pm floodlight matches, that glam our local rugby to the max.
Wishes to all rugby hearts and our resident experts for season 2018.
Bigger, better, faster and more intense is our new years resolution. May that reality stun and thrill us to the gills.
Cheers islanders..see you in January.
Bula bula Sri island Rugby!

Koreas Ministry of Science and ICT and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a part of ODA business, donated Media Assets Management and Digital Audio Archiving System to Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) for better conditions for the broadcasting environment.
The Korea Radio Promotion Association and the Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka on behalf of the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT, and around 50 related parties from SLRC and SLBC attended the ceremony.
Korea and Sri Lanka have continuously developed relations on politics, economy, social and cultural spheres since the diplomatic ties established in 1977. The latest donation marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Korea and Sri Lanka.
The Korea Radio Promotion Association officials stated that with the donation, improvement in the quality of broadcasting and work efficiency is expected as SLRC and SLBCs analog contents (tape, LPs etc) can be converted, edited, stored and managed into more than 50,000 hours of digital files through the supported system.

Lankan players take cricket lessons from MS Dhoni
MUMBAI: Former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has not just grown as a player but as a person over the years. The respected cricketer is not just admired by his teammates but also his opponents for his distinctive ground play and game awareness.
After losing the T20 series to the hosts on December 24, the Sri Lankan team was clouded with sadness and disappointment but instead of soaking in his teams victory, Dhoni was seen imparting some of his well-connected knowledge about cricket with the rival squad.
The top-notch wicketkeeper and collected batting style have become the inspiration for many young cricketers including the Lankan players Upul Tharanga, Akila Dhananjaya and Sadeera Samarawickrama who could be seen taking in Dhonis kind words post-Sundays match.
While the visitors skipper Thisara Perera was being interviewed by Sanjay Manjrekar post losing the 3rd T20I at the Wankhede Stadium, his teammates were seeking guidance from the former Indian skipper.
The recent viral video is a sight to behold with Dhoni mentoring the young professionals so naturally.

## Title: National action plan to combat bribery and corruption

National action plan to combat bribery and corruption
A National Action Plan on anti-corruption will get off the ground early next year which envisages a collective effort among stakeholder agencies to tackle bribery and corruption, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Sarath Jayamanne, PC said.
In the absence of a strong framework to combat bribery and corruption, the National Action Plan will become a road map in the coming years outlining guidelines in the fight against bribery and corruption, he said.
A National Action Plan on anti-corruption will indicate that the government is in full support of the anti corruption initiative in the country, he added.
This move will also project Sri Lanka as a progressive country in the international arena, PC Jayamanne added.
He pointed out that most countries under different international organisations have pledged to fight corruption and have adopted their own National Action Plans on anti-corruption.
Responding to the Daily News, Jayamanne said the CIABOC together with the Presidential Secretariat and the Foreign Ministry and other key stakeholders such as the Ministry of Public Administration, Law and order, Judiciary and Education will present a general framework for the National Action Plan on anti-corruption as the initial step within the setting up of the National Action Plan.
A special meeting with the participation of all key stakeholders will take place in the next two weeks to set the general framework, which will include vision, objectives and deadlines relevant to the task at hand,Jayamanne also said.
This meeting will most probably be headed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
While having an extensive discussion on the plan, we can also set the basics, objectives, other priorities and deadlines at this discussion. In three months time, we will be able to compile the main body of the action plan, he added.
The proposal made by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala to compile an action plan for empowering anti-corruption agencies in controlling corruption and creating awareness on the negative impact of corruption, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers recently.
The action plan mainly focuses on preventive measures whereas adversarial approach to the matter will be strengthened by the amendments to the Bribery and Corruption Act that will also be introduced by early next year, Jayamanne said.
The action plan also includes coherence and coordination, implementation of the convention against corruption, enhancement of the independence of the Bribery or Corruption Investigation Commission, education, awareness creation, capacity building, and technical assistance.
Some believe that an adversarial approach to bribery and corruption will solve the major part of the problem. Yes, it will definitely have its advantages. However, it is important that we give equal focus on corruption prevention as well. For example, according to recent success of Malaysia in corruption prevention, 40% of their success is due to preventive measures. This is where the education sector comes in. We are looking forward to include corruption prevention topics into the school curricula so that children will be expose to this idea from a young age, he explained.
The National Action Plan will be compiled not only with the contributions from the public and private sectors, other vital stakeholders but with the contributions made by the general public as well, Jayamanne said.
The contribution of the public to this action plan is of immense importance. We will reach people in rural areas to receive their contribution to the compilation of the national action plan. It is equally vital that we raise awareness on this national action plan among the public as well, he explained.
The Director General also pointed out that the National Action Plan will strengthen the CIABOC which is a multi tasking organisation that investigates, prosecute, prevent and corroborate internationally to matters regarding bribery and corruption in the country.
A full recognition from the government along with a national consciousness on the matter of bribery and corruption will strengthen our Commission immensely. Even though our Commission has our own action plan, we cannot extend it as part of the national interest. We had a very weak system against bribery and corruption. So it is the responsibility of the government to establish a national action plan on anti corruption for which the CIABOC can be the cheif coordinator and a key contributor,the CIABOC Director General pointed out.

## Title: Need to provide support services to  make real estate sector sustainable
## Supertitle:

Need to provide support services to  make real estate sector sustainable
Srilankan real estate is going through a positive phase of transition in the process of its development. It is gradually moving to become a more organized one. This has largely been possible due to the entry of international real estate players and foreign investors into the real estate sector.
From 2015 and early 2016 the real estate sector in Sri Lanka has witnessed phenomenal growth due to rapid urbanization, increasing levels of income and opening up of the sector to foreign direct investment (FDI). The real estate community will have taken a greater role in the financial ecosystem.
Now in Sri Lanka people are looking for vibrant, diverse places to live and work. According to that Sri Lanka is investing in many infrastructure projects like the Colombo International Financial City, megapolis and express highways.
Not only infrastructure projects there are many global hotel chains that are investing in Sri Lanka. Presently, the real estate sector is booming with opportunities. Previously Colombo was the luxury hub for investors, but now investors are looking towards investing in the newly developing cities and suburbs. There is an increased demand for the residential properties from the wealthy and middle-class populations while there is also a high demand for commercial properties in Colombo and the suburbs.
As mentioned earlier, Sri Lankan real estate sector has witnessed an upward trend and there are many projects going on under the megapolis ministry and this will attract more and more people, so the cost of prime urban real estate per square metre will continue to rise and developers will become more innovative about how they design and build commercial and residential real estate, seeking to use space more efficiently.
Services like tourism, hospitality and IT industries have triggered high demand for the real estate sector in Colombo. Technology is finally coming to real estate now. We can take the example of the launch of 3000mm diameter drilling rig by D. P. Jayasinghe Piling. These things will take the construction industry to the next level and will change the way of real estate developers and the investment community. In future the real estate market will become far bigger and more global.
Socio-economic benefits
The real estate industry plays an important role in the economy of a country and welfare of its people. It also affects many other areas of economic well-being that arent measured. It is an enabler of economic activity and it attracts FDI. Also, real estate is a source of employment in all sorts of areas; not only for architects, builders and engineers, but also for legal and financial advisors, surveyors, facilities managers and all those that provide for the construction industry. Real estate plays a vital role in the provision of infrastructure.
In general, the level of infrastructure development in a country says a lot about its economic status. Furthermore, high-quality, modern and innovative buildings contribute to maintaining the country's reputation as an international trade hub and attracts skilled labour and capital investments from the rest of the world, creating further opportunities.
Support services linked to the sector
As I mentioned above, real estate sector is growing rapidly in Sri Lanka. But to maintain this demand and growth we need support services and providers such as facility management (FM) companies, property lawyers, standardizing brokerage, loan facilities, etc.
When it comes to supporting services FM companies are the key component in the real estate industry because FM is a tool used in managing and maintaining the facilities in an organization. The facilities include office complex, physical resources at the company or site and any other mechanical and electrical utilities that can cause health or safety hazard to employees.
Sri Lanka requires over 1.5 million housing units in the next 15 years and most of them will be condominium housing units. Building these units will be a challenge whilst maintaining those buildings for a long run will be more difficult without the help of supporting services like FM players. A real estate sector is linked with many supporting services therefore the success of real estate sector also depends on the quality of the supporting services linked with that.
Facility management
FM has gained importance over the last few years as businesses have identified that well-managed buildings and utilities help companies function effectively and efficiently. In some Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, they take FM as an important area in business and the techniques of FM are increasingly used by them. In Sri Lanka, the field is still in its infancy.
People, process and place are the three main factors of an organizations, and there is a need to manage the physical environment in concert with people and job processes.
A FM finds management solutions by positioning at the intersection of these factors and FM makes sure all these factors are functioning properly. The functions of FM are wide and include the management of real estate, finance, and human resources, in addition to services maintenance, domestic services, utilities supplies, security, safety and health - all of the non-core activities of the organization.
Also, FM will ensure all the facilities in an organization are compliant with industry health and safety regulation, the complex has disability access, fire prevention methods and emergency exit plan in place, effective waste disposal and control of hazardous substances and maintenance of the company parking space. In order to help the business achieve a competitive advantage and increase the overall worker productivity, companies must involve the facility manager in strategic decision making.
As I mentioned in Sri Lanka, the FM discipline is still in its infancy and its related duties are fragmented with limited knowledge on the subject. The awareness of the importance of FM is often not discussed, whether in the public sector or private sectors. However, initiatives are being taken by some institutions to reduce the risk.
Health and safety in the workplace is a critical issue. For example in Great Britain in 2009/2010 152 fatal accidents and 233,000 reportable injuries and 5.1 million working days were lost due to workplace injury. It might happen in Sri Lanka too; so if we have to reduce such risks its really important to include a FM company in the business because the use of equipment in the workplace can increase the risk of accidents and must be carefully managed.
Risk reduction measures like machinery guides, warning devices, and personal protective clothing and maintenance routines keep the issue of safe use and maintenance to the front of everyones minds. It is important to remember that employees also have a duty to handle tools and equipment safely and to stop using any item immediately if it requires maintenance or repair.
All of these activities can now be sourced from a FM company, reducing the burden on the management team. Each organization should be responsible for health and safety compliance; so it is important to have full confidence in the expertise of anyone providing such services.
FM has developed into a major business sector and as a discipline continues to grow across the world. Well-managed sites and buildings enable organizations to function at their most efficient and effective level, achieving collaborations and offering real added value to the organizations core business. So its really important to include FM companies in the business.
Time for global FM firms to set up here
Prof. Deborah Susan Levy, Head of Department of Property, University of Auckland, at CREMV-2017 stated, "The property management or how we use our buildings is very important. We can have all the wonderful layouts and top buildings, but if we do not manage them properly, people aren't going to enjoy working in them and be productive. From her statement its clear that maintaining the property is really important, to achieve that we need FM companies.
At wealth insights series of investor events held on November 7, a keynote speaker stated that according to the current market scenario it is a necessity to include other amenities like gymnasiums and swimming pools which should be the main feature of high rise residential buildings.
To maintain these facilities we need FM companies. I think this is the perfect time for many global FM companies to enter Sri Lanka following the footsteps of JLL and Fonda Global who have already set up their services here.
Benefits of embracing FM firms
In today's tough economy, most companies often cut FM, thinking it is too expensive. But in reality FM actually provides greater savings in the long run for any company. Some of the benefits of having a FM company are as follows:
Cost savings: Buildings and land are usually the second largest expenditure of any business. By effectively implementing sound FM practices, a business can save millions annually. These measures include keeping all building systems and equipment up to date and running efficiently and maintaining security.
Customer satisfaction: While many people would not admit it, they are far more likely to visit (and revisit) a company that takes pride in its appearance. By keeping the site well maintained, a company shows that it pays attention to detail and will go the extra mile.
Compliance: As we all know, today's society is more litigious than ever and government standards are always changing. An effective FM system, by documenting operations, can serve as evidence that your company is striving to provide a safe environment.
Personnel retention - Having a productive workforce is invaluable, and by maintaining a safe, comfortable and happy environment, a business can see the true potential of its employees.
Safety - Safety in the workplace is a must nowadays - standards are ever increasing and employees expect them to be met. Outsourcing to a FM company ensures that safety is not compromised.
Conclusion
The real estate sector will continue to be strong and there will be greater range of risks and opportunities for real estate investors. Its an exciting time for the real estate sector and other sectors which is linked with real estate sector.
FM really does have its benefits as many companies are now experiencing. Developers and property owners are usually interested in seeking to increase the occupancy rate of their buildings, and maximize the lifecycle of their assets, while corporate organizations usually target to reduce overhead costs, improve people productivity, and operate their businesses efficiently. These goals could be achieved with the involvement of an effective FM company.
With the latest budget proposals encouraging foreign buying by removing restrictions of foreign participation in the real estate sector, the industry is set to grow and therefore the environment is an encouraging one for setting up real estate support services.
This not only gives an opportunity for entrepreneurs to own new stream of businesses, but also will assist the booming real estate industry to have a growth which is sustainable too.

No change to monetary policy needed now - FC Research
GDP growth for 3Q 2017 was lower than expected (grew by 3.3% YoY) with overall agricultural activities reporting a negative growth mainly due to the unfavorable weather conditions (severe drought as well as heavy rainfall) that prevailed during the last two years in many districts of the country, FC Research said in its December pre-policy analysis. 
During the third quarter of 2017, the Services Activities continued to expand further by 4.3%, while Industrial Activities recorded a marginal growth rate of 1.9%. 
FC Research in August 2017 upgraded private sector credit growth for 2017E to 16% from 14% forecasting a possible pickup towards year end.  Private sector credit figure decelerated to Rs 50 billion in September 2017 despite slowdown in the credit in August. FC Research believes overall credit is likely to continue to remain under check. 
CCPI-based headline inflation, decelerated on a YOY basis to 7.6% in November 2017 (exceeding FC Researchs estimate of 7.0%) from 7.8% in October 2017. NCPI-based inflation accelerated on a YOY basis to 7.5% in November 2017 from 7.1% in October 2017. 
However, core inflation remained under check decelerating to 5.2% in November 2017 from 5.8% in October 2017.  FC Research forecast for December 2017 is for CCPI headline inflation to beat 7.2%.  FC Research believes inflation will be under control over the next 2-3 months while there could be some upward pressure towards 2Q 2018. 
Sri Lankas forex reserves assets dropped by US$ 171 million to US$ 7.32 billion in November which was equivalent to about 4.5 months of imports from US$ 6.0 billion reserve at end 2016.
The Central Bank had net purchased US$ 1.46 billion on a net basis from currency markets so far this year. 
FC Research believes foreign reserves are now at comfortable levels and are likely to end the year around the US$ 7.5 billion mark. 
During the last three months, the Central Bank brought down its holding in government securities from Rs 60 billion to below Rs 1 billion as at December 22. 
Economists said the Fed will still pencil in three hikes for 2018 (March 2018, June 2018 and December 2018), but moved forward one of those projected moves to March 2018 from June 2018. 
FC Research believes that despite inflation remaining high, GDP growth and credit growth are below its expectation. Considering the above macroeconomic environment, current monetary policy is appropriate and no change is required. FC Research expects the Central Bank to keep the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) unchanged at 7.50%.

Novel method to counter distribution of election freebies
The National Elections Commission (NEC) is to put up banners at the sites of all newly constructed public property, bearing the message that these had been built out of tax payers money.
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya told the media that the banners would be put up till the Local Government Elections are over.
For example if the construction of a school building or public ground has been completed, there is no point in delaying its opening till the end of February.
Therefore, we decided to allow those ceremonial openings, but we will put up a banner stating that they were constructed from public money and not the money of any politician or political party. This is to avoid any politician or political party getting undue credit for those constructions and using them for their polls campaign, Dehapriya explained.
He also said the Commission would paste a sticker on all the items given out to the people during the period of the election stating that the items in question were purchased from tax payers money. We do not intend to stop what people duly receive at the end of year, but we will remind the public that this was at the cost of the tax payer. Those items will be distributed through the officials, he said. Deshapriya, reiterating that all election cut-outs, posters and processions are illegal since the date of nominations, said the Commission intends to paste a tape carrying the message that this is an illegal poster on all such posters.

Over 110 maternal deaths in Sri Lanka during 2016
A total of 112 maternal deaths had taken place in Sri Lanka during the last year (2016), the Maternal Death Review Report said.
According to the report, the percentage of maternal deaths in Sri Lanka in 2016 is 33.8 percent for each 100,000 live births. This is the best ratio in South Asia. But unfortunately, 55 percent of those deaths had been preventable.
The report says that the maternal death ratio did not show a change (any decrease or increase) during the past seven years, but direct maternal deaths had shown an increase last year, which is 55 percent. A total of 44 percent of maternal deaths were due to some sort of shortcoming of health staff.
The report points out that 68 percent of all maternal deaths had some sort of delay in a stage of the procedure. A total of 43 percent of dead mothers had neither been provided with the required medical advice nor were they taken to the hospital, on time. A total of 20 percent of maternal deaths were due to not obtaining required family planning services.

## Title: Pro Lean with Protein

Pro Lean with Protein
A sedentary man, with not much physical activity going on for him, needs on average 56g of protein to be consumed in a day. A woman of similar stature needs 46g per day. Studies* done on Sri Lankan food patterns however, show that an average adult man only consumes 52.8g while a woman has 40g per day.
The biggest crisis in protein however, occurs as the Sri Lankan population mired in religious and cultural conservatism, grows older and further lessens their protein intake.
Most of our elderly become vegetarians for religious or cultural purposes. They would get a little bit of protein from rice or dhal, but this is not sufficient for them, said Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association President, Dr. Renuka Jayatissa addressing a seminar on Protein for All at the Taj Samudra, Colombo recently. The event was jointly organized by the Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association and the World Poultry Science Association (Sri Lanka Branch).
As adults hit 60-70 years of age, the likelihood of them being at risk of Sarcopenia- the loss of muscle mass and bone, is greater.
Dr. Jayatissa recommended that those above 70, consume 1.5g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day and 1-1.2g per kilogram if they are suffering from any disease.
This protein however has to be of good quality with a proper mix of both animal and plant sources.
Why do we need protein
As the old scientific adage goes, Proteins are the building blocks of life. Every cell in our body contains proteins and having protein in our diet helps the body repair and make new cells. In addition, you need proteins to make enzymes, hormones and other body chemicals. More importantly it is an important building block for bones, muscles, cartilage, skin and blood.
Having protein in your diet also satiates you faster, lessening the need to eat more and thus helps in controlling obesity.
According to Dr. Jayatissa, your age and level of physical activity determines the amount of protein you require per day. A child of 1-2 years needs 20g of protein per day, with young adults between the ages of 16-18 years needing 85g of protein per day.
15-20 percent of an adults diet has to be protein. That is one third of your food plate needs to be protein. A 100kg person will need 90g of protein in a day, she explained.
These numbers are worked out under the assumption that people are healthy, the protein comes from a good mix, are of good quality and used efficiently in the body.
Given the reluctance and myths around protein food, she stressed that the elderly could easily consume eggs, the easiest form of protein that is of good quality without any worry. Eggs also have the micronutrients needed to help have a better nervous system and memory.
They can easily eat one egg per day without any issue, said the doctor.
At least some protein in all three meals in a day was highly recommended in order for the person to reach their optimal height, without gaining weight.
Eating the right type of protein
Once we have decided to embark on the path to protein, choosing the right type of protein to eat is also important. Whilst protein deficiencies are also harmful to the body, the same in excess can also lead to problems in your kidneys.
Protein quality is very important. Then we have to look at the factors which affect quality. One is digestibility, explained Dr. Jayatissa.
Protein digestibility thus depends on its source. Animal protein which contain most of the essential proteins have an absorption rate of 99 percent into the body whilst plant protein has a far lesser absorption rate, this would mean that vegetarians need to consume more and a varied protein diet to make up for what they are missing from animal protein sources.
Food Myths
Bad diet, tobacco smoking, excess alcohol and lack of exercise are the main reasons behind the most common causes of death.
80 percent of people in the world die of four Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). They are heart disease/stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes, said Senior Lecturer in Medicine and Honourary Endocrinologist, Dr. Prasad Katulanda.
South Asia is one of the worst affected regions in the world for NCDs, with coronary heart disease impacting Sri Lanka severely. Coronary heart disease together with diabetes make up for almost 50 percent of deaths in Sri Lanka, according to Dr. Katulanda.
We have to live according to our genes, he further remarked as he went on to explain that we needed to eat according to our energy needs with a balanced diet and active lifestyle.
Our biggest problem today however, is over nutrition - a diet high in carbohydrate and fat, especially during dinner time. Sri Lankans also mostly try to make up for their protein intake through dhal and rice which is insufficient.
Barriers to nutrition
One of the biggest barriers to an efficient protein diet are certain food myths.
People are in the false belief that eating meat and eggs is bad for your health. Some people have gone to the extreme and some old women in particular have a voracious dislike for eggs and meat, explained Dr. Katulanda.
They say they start vomiting if they eat eggs, because it has been so ingrained into them that it is bad. Perhaps it is the fault of our medical fraternity and also religious reasons.
These myths also lead us to over indulge in food believed to be good.
They believe that bread and flour based food is bad and that brown rice is good. So instead of eating two slices of bread, they eat two cups of rice, he said as he stressed the need for moderation in all foods.
The doctor also highlighted a research study called the Pure Study which showed that eating one egg a day reduced the risk of strokes in both men and women.
Safe to eat
As the seminar had representatives of the poultry industry, Dr. Jayatissa took the opportunity to voice some of the concerns regarding the industry. She noted that many doctors and nutritionists were hesitant to recommend chicken to their patients, given the concerns over antibiotic and hormone use in the meat.
These concerns however, were dispelled by Singapore based Poultry and Veterinary Consultant, Dr. Chin How Cheonga, a frequent visitor to poultry farms in the island.
Fifty six percent of the chicken in the world live in Asia and we still need more, said Dr. Cheong.
Chicken is the cheapest and most accepted source of meat. In the next 20 years, as populations double, chicken will be the only source of meat able to meet and supply growing demand, he added.
Surveys however, show that the public was most concerned about three factors when it came to chicken; antibiotics (chemical residue), pathogens infecting the food system and hormones in the meat.
According to Dr. Cheong, much of these concerns and fear are generated by people who do not really understand chicken.
Less than 20 percent understand chicken production, more is hearsay or what they read online, he said.
Understanding chicken
Antibiotics, Dr. Cheong explained, was used in bacterial treatment. In the past they were added to feed but this is now highly regulated.
Department of Animal Production and Health, Director General, Dr. R.M. Ariyadasa speaking to Daily News, explained that the government had taken steps to ban a list of selected antibiotics which are similar to those used in humans.
The decision was taken so as to prevent humans from developing immunity towards these drugs, he said.
This comes in the wake of a worldwide movement to reduce the antibiotic use in chicken and if used, to ensure that they are not the same as that used by humans.
Dr. Cheong explained that as China, one of the main producers of these antibiotics has also banned its use in the country- there would be a scarcity in the market, leading poultry farmers to refrain from its use, simply based on high costs alone.
In addition many farms are also switching to alternatives to antibiotics, as in the use of e enzymes, pre and pro biotics and biological means of control. This has happened in a majority of farms in Sri Lanka.
These alternatives regulate the micro fora in the intestine, enhance gut integrity and strengthen the immune system. They can use one or a combination of alternatives instead of antibiotics, he said.
At the end of the day, antibiotics and disease is a costly affair to a poultry farmer and thus Dr. Cheong explained that most have opted to ensuring biosecurity in their farms, to reduce their expenses in combatting disease.
Most chicken feed is cooked in high temperatures to make it more digestible and to reduce pathogens in the feed.
When it comes to hormones, the Singaporean consultant categorically denied any hormones being used in chicken worldwide - further it is a banned practice. The beef industry, he said used specific hormones administered as implants to speed up growth, but chicken already had fast growth and thus did not need hormones.
Chicken grow fast because of having selectively bred fast growing varieties over the years. You also have too many chicken, so administering hormones is not cost effective, he explained.
Chicken today take on average 30-35 days to reach full size at approximately 2.5kg, thanks to careful selection of pedigree and years of selective breeding- We need at least 5-10 years to come up with a good breed, said Dr. Cheong.
The poultry consultant explained that most Sri Lankan farms have to depend on three factors for success -Nutrition, Housing (reducing stress) and Cleanliness.
When it comes to pathogens infecting the food system, the greatest fear all poultry farmers have is that of Avian or Bird flu.
Sri Lanka fortunately has not experienced this pandemic thus far and Dr. Cheong believed that the relative isolation of the island has played to its advantage.
Government monitoring systems, environmental regulations and standard certifications such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) have also ensured that all proper procedures for safety and health are followed during production, said Dr. Cheong.
In Sri Lanka, most people buy processed chicken with few opting for chicken from small, unregulated farm shops.
Hence health and safety of chicken in the market, up to a great extent has been standardized, he added.
In Asia chicken is cooked very well. Any organism which remains is destroyed in the process. What is more, consumer pressure in this country is high, so companies have had to ensure that food standards are met. No food company wants a food safety issue, said Dr. Cheong.

Pseudo elements of patriotism
We have in our historical records the names of some people who are called Patriots and National Heroes. We call so because those mighty, hearty and gifted people who had nationalism in their blood fought the foreigners sacrificing their lives to decolonize the country. After they abolished the Europeanized rule and converted it to a nation state and upturned it the national way working not only using their knowledge and state resources at their disposal but also generously sacrificing properties and wealth they inherited and earned. They were not self-seeking people. They were magnanimous leaders with clean hands with stainless characters. As such, they became people worthy of praise.
The magnitude and the magnificence of the services they rendered and the human kindness bestowed on them aroused an affectionate desire in the beneficiaries to reverently and gratefully ennoble their nobility. Like canonization of humble servants of God as Saints by the western church, these humanists too by virtue of the meritorious work done honestly in the interest of the mankind found their way to deification by the mankind.
They erected statues resembling them after them to continue to be with them as before, and annually, they from ordinary to extraordinary people go before their statues and lay wreaths before their feet with love, honour and gratitude and salute in prostration, give alms to confer merits on them, make eulogistic public orations, broadcast, telecast and write in the press recalling the services they rendered for the well-being of the people, about their gentility and of their impeccable and effulgent characters deferentially. Though their bodies are dead and decayed their names have come up after them to shine than the stars above, and for evermore.
There was also a day declared by the state as a National Heroes Day to honour the deceased on the first day of January every year but, it was abolished before long as it did not befit an inglorious class of deceitful people who were hell-bent to demean and wipe out the history of the patriots, the names of patriots from history and the sovereign good they did for their fatherland, intentionally, to survive pretentiously. Thereafter, political parties began to celebrate this day individually to commemorate individuals of their choice on dates chosen by them, in disunion.
An individual can belong to any political party but, if that individual works for the common good of the people sacrificing health, wealth, knowledge, time, taking risk of life and sacrificing life, he or she becomes an honourable humanist.
Honour is commanded by virtue of the humanitarian work done. Why discredit them when we must do credit to them. Why should we commemorate them severally when we should do it collectively as patriots belong to all So, where is patriotism today Evidently, Opportunism is what is practiced though a doctrine similar to egalitarianism is preached. We have come past seven decades since independence but sadly, we still remain in a lumpenproletariat.
Disunity and opportunism
Undeniably, we are on a sound footing today on a buttressed foundation laid by them for the forward march of the nation and with due respects to all those patriots belonging to all the communities in this country we continue following their doctrine and paradigms left with us for our guidance struggling amidst obstruction and subversion. Our representatives still do not have a patriotic feeling to admire and appreciate when good is done instead they rise up to disrupt, discredit and discourage adversely.
Our country at the time of acquiring independence maintained a very high standard of discipline and the disciplined people had a great respect for the law of the land.
The credit of bringing the people of this country to that civilized standard goes with an everlasting gratitude to the humanitarian Christian Missionaries who were here in that era. They never severally regarded the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers but, as a family. Having trampled on the sovereign example they set, and, gone stray we prolong in disarray without a principled path to proceed. We dont see meaningful discussions and dialogues in harmony instead violent behaviour and speeches in anger while still remaining divided as opponents prognosticating a disastrous end. Disunity and opportunism began as we began self-governing.
Upali S. Jayasekera writing to the Editor of the Sunday Observer on December 3, 2017 under the caption Rolling stones gather no moss said in his penultimate paragraph that However, in the context of our country, especially in the political arena, it looks as if it is those criss-crossing from one political party to another and back  the Rolling Stones who are mostly successful. He wanted someone to correct him if he was wrong.
The first change that took place in this House of Representatives in the form of a crossover was when G G Ponnambalam QC leader of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress joined the United National Party in support of Don Stephen Senanayake to stabilize the first government of our own. He was offered the Ministry of Industries, Industrial Research and Fisheries. However, S J V Chelvanayagam in protest broke away from him and formed the Federal Party. This was the beginning of crossing over and opportunistic politics.
The second of its kind took place in September 1951 approximately five months before Premier Don Stephen Senanayakes demise when the United National Party Minister of Health and Local Government Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike (who was assassinated in September 1959) crossed over to the opposition owing to party line differences and formed the Sri Lanka Freedom Party with the severance of connections creating a precedent too, for future guidance.
When Premier Don Stephen Senanayake passed away on March 23, 1952, some of his followers in grief refrained from continuing, others who grew old retired, some of them departed and none of them are with us today. As people who believe in reincarnation we hope to meet them again but, what is regrettable is that until then, we will not have such people because the present day politicians are self-centred except for a handful of prestigious people who believe that they are in that house with a mandate from the people to perform a bounden duty. The avaricious who deceived the people have boarded a gravy-train.
Origin of self-governance
Having won the general election in 1956 at the head of a revolution, Bandaranaike formed the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna regime popularly known as Apey Aanduwa, or our government. The people who created that government began to rule the country according to their whims and fancies adopting a monolingual policy of Sinhala only in a trilingual state. It created disunity and dispersed the united people.
The followers of Apey Aanduwa did not listen to their leader. The leader had to listen to them. When the leader refused to entertain their opportunistic demands they killed their leader, the revolutionary. The discipline of the country reduced to zero, the rule of law was disrespected and violated. Administrative procedures were breached, circular instructions were overlooked. Since then opportunism became a sort of culture that made living easy by grasping opportunities by hook or by crook for those birds of a feather. It was inherited by generations after them and its a tradition taken root.
Tradition is a procedure handed down from generations to generations. Crossing over in parliament from one party to another has been a tradition followed from the origin of self-governance. Its therefore not considered a wrongdoing. This custom has been followed for the past 70 years. For all the people who were born during these seventy years, it was only a tradition to be followed. They followed it. This tradition is now part and parcel of politics here continued even in 2017 amidst preparations being made to hold the local government elections.
The opportunists among the hoi polloi rallied round the politicians and lived around them. The opportunistic politicians rallied round party leaders and lived around them. The party leaders induced members of different parties to join them giving promises of attractive favours and embraced them when they double-crossed their leaders and crossed over to them.
When elections were declared they fought tooth and nail to grab the suffrage of the constituents. When they were elected to office they at first gave a wide berth to the electors and joined victorious parties deserting their parties to grab opportunities offered as Santhosam, the something. To get rid of the scapegoats and stooges who became pests afterwards, they were given appointments from the lowest to the highest and contracts from minor to major regardless of their qualifications. Thereafter, those square pegs in round holes in connivance with all others who were compelled to join them robbed and ruined the public service while the so-called representatives played ducks and drakes with the wealth of the people. This method became an employment and the people who saw them prosper and having learnt the secrets of the short term method of becoming prosperous without toiling and sweating selected politics as an employment.
Today, even idling, loafing and loitering about in the premises of a government department, corporation or in other statutory bodies has become an employment, therefore, they should not be mistaken as idlers, loafers and loiterers. This is how day by day opportunism, favouritism, nepotism, bribery and corruption came into being and all these practices gave life to subversion.
Search of green pastures
The envious competitions and fierce fights to enter parliament as peoples representatives and provincial ministers increased when a remuneration was offered converting a portfolio to a pensionable post. But, it is not understood whether they are governed by the Establishment Code and contributing to the pension scheme except for the maturity for eligibility is said to be in five years. As this is heaven sent to the easy goers they began to behave in chameleon style, changing colours to become eligible to a pension in a short while marking time living pretentiously and luxuriously until the end jumping sides to sides. My comment does not reflect on the handful of patriots still remaining with us.
Crossing over took place during the previous regime when hordes of partisans from the United National Party crossed over in greed for portfolios. The talk of the town was that President Mahinda Rajapaksa bought them over to establish his government. He reared them in his century up Cabinet well until the end but, at the end, they deserted him in 2015 to climb on the bandwagon. They included the people both won and lost.
If uprooted by some means, these politicians will suffer the loss of an energizer becoming weaklings and lackadaisical in the absence of the vital power.
The tradition of crossing over, crisscrossing and double crossing in search of green pastures has not ended. This cultured way will continue as all the others did in the past. Its to gain affluence and influence.
Upali Jayasekera is right and he owes a bouquet of flowers for being bold enough to be very frank. We will succeed and prosper only when scholars and gentlemen politicians take seat in the legislature certainly after a revolution similar to that of France.

Risk of foreign flows for Indian stock market in 2018
Indian equity investors have had a good year. The broad indices are up by a quarter in local currency terms. And they have gone up by a third in dollar terms. Most important markets have done well thanks to a synchronized recovery in the global economy.
The recent data on international corporate investment recovery is especially noteworthy. India has participated in the global financial assets rally despite the slowdown in economic activity as well as the sluggishness in corporate earnings. Domestic corporate investment continues to disappoint thanks to excess capacity as well as the inability of banks to lend. However, the next year will begin in the shadow of doubt. Will global liquidity dry up And what will that mean for the Indian equity market
The US has already begun to tighten its monetary policy. The usual assumption is that tighter US monetary policy will hurt portfolio inflows into emerging markets such as India. This tightening is expected to happen in two ways over the next year.
The US Federal Reserve is expected to push up interest rates as inflation catches up with the improvement in the labour market. The US central bank will also start reducing the size of its bloated balance sheet in some variant of quantitative easing in reverse. Should Indian investors worry
They should worry-but not panic. A recent blog post by International Monetary Fund economist Robin Koepke says an internal forecasting model predicts that monetary policy normalization will likely reduce portfolio flows to emerging markets by about $70 billion over the next two years.
The reduction of the Fed balance sheet will cut portfolio flows by $55 billion while higher interest rates will have a $15 billion impact. This is in comparison with average annual inflows of $240 billion since 2010. In other words, the expected reduction in portfolio flows will be 14.6%.
India attracted $7.7 billion of global capital into its financial markets in the calendar year till 22 December.
It is a modest number when compared to the $29.3 billion that came in 2010 or the annual average of $20.1 billion in the three years to 2014. So the risks of a sudden stop are lower than before. Two other factors are likely to help. First, India has a manageable current account deficit that is being funded by foreign direct investment. Second, domestic liquidity support is strong thanks to the dedicated money flowing into mutual funds each month through systematic investment plans.
The risk comes from sudden surprises like the one delivered in May 2013 by Ben Bernanke with the decision to gradually withdraw from quantitative easing. It is quite possible that portfolio flows will strengthen next year in case the US Fed tightens monetary policy at a slower pace than currently expected; and portfolio flows could dry up suddenly in case monetary policy tightening is more aggressive than expected.
A lot depends on the ability of the US Federal Reserve to manage market expectations. The surprise in May 2013 should be compared to the more nuanced communication over the past two years.
There will likely be some impact of tighter US monetary policy on portfolio flows to emerging markets. China is expected to embrace one of the lowest money supply growth targets next year. However, Europe and Japan continue to maintain their monetary policy in expansionary mode.
These crosswinds do not take away from the fact that US monetary policy direction will continue to be key, especially if there are any policy surprises. India will be relatively protected in case of a sudden stop by its low current account deficit as well as strong domestic liquidity.
This sanguine view on liquidity should not distract investors from a more fundamental worry-corporate earnings.

Russia ready to act as mediator for US and North Korea

Russia is ready to serve as a mediator between North Korea and the United States if both sides agree, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN on Tuesday.
"You can't become a mediator between two countries just on your own will. It is impossible, you need both sides to be willing," Peskov said.
Peskov's comments come just days after the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a new set of US-drafted sanctions on North Korea in response to Pyongyang's November 29 ballistic missile test.
The latest sanctions, aimed to further restrict energy supplies, tighten restrictions on smuggling and the use of North Korean workers overseas, are the toughest yet, according to US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.
The vote was unanimous, but Russia's ambassador to the UN criticized the resolution, saying that the US had rushed it through with several last-minute amendments that targeted North Korean workers abroad. Some 40,000 North Koreans work in Russia, and theysend significant amounts of their income back home.
The resolution's requirement of a 24-month period for North Korean workers to return home "is the minimum acceptable period necessary to deal with the logistical aspects of the issue," Ambassador Vasilly Nebenzia said, before adding one last criticism of the resolution.
"Unfortunately, our call to preclude a further escalation of tensions, to revise the policy of mutual intimidation, was not heeded," Nebenzia said.
Peskov's remarks on Tuesday are not unusual for Moscow, as the Kremlin has long held the position that the US and North Korea should move toward diplomatic talks.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday urged the United States and North Korea to start a dialogue and said the US should make the first move.
The minister on Tuesday urged a fast path toward negotiations in a call with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry.
Lavrov "stressed the unacceptability of hyping up the tensions around the Korean peninsula with Washington's aggressive rhetoric toward Pyongyang and building up military preparations in the region," the statement said.
Lavrov has said US military exercises in the region have made dialogue tougher.
In the past, US President Donald Trump has vowed to counter North Korean provocations with military force, saying he would unleash "fire and fury," on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should their nuclear threats persist. But top US advisers have long retained that the US remains committed to prioritizing a peaceful resolution to tensions with Pyongyang.

Russian technical experts to visit Sri Lanka
A team of technical experts from Russia is to visit Sri Lanka in late January or early February 2018 for familiarization with the current plant quarantine procedure in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Moscow said in a press release.
The decision was reached during a meeting between a nine-member Sri Lankan technical delegation led by the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board, including the Director General of the Department of Agriculture and the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Russian Federation, with the Head of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor), Deputy Head of Rosselkhoznadzor in charge of phytosanitary matters, and other officials of Rosselkhoznadzor on December 25.
This meeting was also represented by the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, representatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Economic Development and RusTeaCoffee Association of Russia. (Russian Tea and Coffee Association).
During the discussion, the Russian side indicated that they were satisfied with the measures proposed by the Sri Lankan side to ensure the shipping of pest-free plant products consignments to Russia.
The Sri Lankan side indicated that there are no records found since 1978 of this identified pest and this is a probable contamination due to the use of disinfested container. However, the Sri Lankan side assured that it would take stringent measures to further strengthen the current phytosanitary procedures to avoid any repetition.
Understanding the concerns of the Sri Lankan side and the way forward, the Russian side indicated that it has made the decision to lift the temporary restrictions earlier imposed on the imports of plant origin products from Sri Lanka before December 30, 2017.
The letter addressed to the President of the Russian Federation by the President of Sri Lanka in this regard made a great impact on the positive resolution of the situation.
The timely interaction of the Ministry of Plantation Industries, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka Tea Board, Sri Lanka Tea Research Board, and the National Plant Quarantine Service was highly effective in the earliest lifting of the temporary restriction, the embassy further said.
On a general note, the average time in reconsidering such restrictions on imports imposed by the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance is up to 3-4 months or more.
However, in this case, it took only one week for the Russian side to lift its restriction thanks to fast and fruitful coordination and interaction of the relevant parties.
The Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Russian Federation and the Embassy of Sri Lanka are pleased to witness the positive conclusion of the issue in the shortest possible time period, the release further noted.

Those who enter the Bundala National Sanctuary without a valid pass would be fined Rs. 1,000, the park warden said.
He said that anyone who enters the park must observe the rules and regulations laid down under the Fauna and Flora Act. Behaving contrary to the rules and regulations would have adverse effects on the wildlife in the park. The park warden further said playing casette recorders at high volumes has been prohibited. Meanwhile, the five species of turtles in Sri Lanka come to Kalametiya beach for nesting every year, of which the Green Turtle is the dominant species, environmentalists said. He said that May and July in every year are peak seasons for turtle nesting. He said that this endangered species is under pressure due to the collection of eggs and hunting of turtles.
The Kalametiya lagoon is also a bird sanctuary and bird-shooting goes unabated, residents said. Although the catching, transportation, and possession of lobsters are prohibited, it is still being carried out, threatening the existence of the species.

South Africa tickled pink as Markram, Morkel make Zimbabwe toil
Port Elizabeth: Aiden Markram hit his second century in three Test matches and Morne Morkel produced a devastating spell of new ball bowling as South Africa took command on the first day of a four-day, day-night Test against Zimbabwe at St Georges Park on Tuesday.
Markrams innings of 125 was the mainstay of South Africas 309 for nine declared before Morkel, bowling at high pace under lights in South Africas first home floodlit Test, took the first three wickets to leave Zimbabwe reeling at 30 for four at the close.
Morkel trapped Hamilton Masakadza leg before wicket with the first ball of Zimbabwes innings, dismissed Chamu Chibhabha for six with the help of a blinding catch by Temba Bavuma at fourth slip and had Brendan Taylor caught behind for the second duck of the innings.
Vernon Philander followed up by trapping Craig Ervine leg before for four.
New cap Ryan Burl showed resolve in batting through to the close on 15 not out while Morkel had figures of three for 20.
With South Africa losing five wickets for 58 runs after the dinner break, a total of nine wickets fell for 88 runs in a two-and-a-half hour floodlit session.
Opening batsman Markram, 23, who was caught behind off what proved to be the last ball before dinner, continued a dream start to his Test career.
Although he was run out for 97 in his first Test innings against Bangladesh in September, followed by 15 in the second innings, he made 143 in the first innings of his second Test against the same opponents.
Markram made a watchful start on Tuesday against some testing bowling from Zimbabwe new ball pair Kyle Jarvis and new cap Blessing Muzarabani.
He took 104 balls to reach fifty but accelerated to post his century off 175 balls with 13 fours and a six. He added another four and a six before falling to the 204th ball of his innings.
There will be tougher challenges for Markram than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe but Tuesdays innings took his total to 380 runs in his first four Test innings at an average of 95.00.
Markram shared stands of 72 with fellow opener Dean Elgar (31), 96 with stand-in captain AB de Villiers (53) and 78 with Temba Bavuma (35 not out).
South Africa were without regular captain Faf du Plessis, who had failed to recover fully from lower back and shoulder injuries, and fast bowler Dale Steyn, whose return from a broken shoulder is now likely to be in the first Test against India, starting in Cape Town on January 5.
De Villiers, making a comeback to Test cricket, made an aggressive 53 off 65 balls.
He was the captain in his most recent two Tests, against England in January 2016, but then suffered a long-term elbow injury before deciding to take a break from long-form cricket.
Wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock strained his right hamstring while running between wickets and De Villiers had to take the gloves at the start of the Zimbabwe innings. AFP

The status quo will prevail
The SLFP faction of the Unity Government are on overdrive these days attempting to distance themselves from the UNP. Various statements are being made by SLFP ministers of the government to portray the Greens in poor light. Very often we hear of SLFP personages referring to the bond issue, throwing a clear hint as to who the guilty party is while others speak of leaving the Unity Government, come December 31, when the joint agreement is due for renewal, or, allowed to expire, as the case may be. Pro-Rajapaksa media have also seized on a recent statement made by the President, to suggest that he (President) was due to exit from the UNP led government and go his own way.
True, the SLFP is in direct competition with the UNP at the upcoming poll and minister Nimal Siripala de Silva is already talking about defeating the common enemy'. The President too, it should be noted, was addressing SLFP candidates, and, therefore, is bound to make comments that would bolster their morale and create the impression of the UNP being their common enemy, although allied with his government, as per the agreement, and that they should go all out to win. It is only then will they (candidates) enter the contest in earnest.
Besides, there is a lot riding on the President to come on top at this poll, which is the first to be held since his election to office, and, as the leader of the SLFP. Hence, as already mentioned, the comments made by the SLFP stalwarts in the Unity Government, no doubt, is a clear attempt at galvanizing the grassroots support of the SLFP, by distancing the party from the UNP in the context of an election. It may also be a bid at drawing in the support from among the undecided pohottuwites.
However, the sober reality is quite different and these SLFPers will, no doubt, be more circumspect before they make these utterances, particularly the one about quitting the government, once the election is done with.
To begin with, the SLFP on its own cannot form a government. The arithmetic simply does not provide for this. The UNP, though failing to reach the magical figure of 113 MPs for an absolute majority nevertheless has a commanding lead, securing 107 seats as against the UPFAs (including the Mahinda faction) 93 members. It is unrealistic for the UPFA to think of engineering as many as 15 defections from the Greens. The four JVP members will certainly not side with the UPFA as the rathu sahodarayas did when CBK lost her majority in 2001, to form the pariwaasa aanduwa. TNA will be more inclined to team up with the UNP in forming a government, on the other hand.
Hence, this talk of exiting the government, as threatened by some SLFP ministers, is merely for public consumption, mostly targeting the party's rank and file. It is certain that once the election is over unity will prevail between the two camps. The UNP too should take things in that spirit. There cannot be a parting of ways at this juncture when the government is not even halfway through its full term. A lot still needs to be done. There is the unfinished business of brining to book the corrupt elements of the Rajapaksa regime as also with the other promises that are yet to be fulfilled.
Above all, the President cannot sack this UNP led government, until the present parliament completes four and half years (it is only just over two-years-old). President Sirisena too, for all his posturings, would not be looking forward to such a prospect. He has on more than one occasion expressed his gratitude to the UNP for backing his candidature and installing him in the office of President with the vast bulk of UNP votes. It would seem the height of ingratitude to kick the ladder that help him climb to the highest office of the land, and, what is more, embrace, among others, his enemies, at whose hands, he had already claimed, he would have been six feet under terra firma, had the results been different on January 8.
True, as they say, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies in politics. But it is difficult to envision President Sirisena, essentially a grassroots politician, who was brought up in the village tradition and imbibed of the values of the village, turning his back on the UNP, for political expediency. The SLFP too, for all the talk of defeating the common enemy, cannot see for itself a journey sans the UNP in the present context. For the first time in the post independence history the arch political rivals have come together to work for the common good of the country. The President, no less, has often alluded to this refreshing development and spoken in positive terms on continuing with the unity government arrangement.
Hence, whatever the outcome of the LG election there is little doubt that the status quo will prevail where it really matters.

Top 5 unsung heroes of 2017
In sports, we often tend to remember the players who pull you towards them. For example, a lot of people would remember what a Steven Smith or a Virat Kohli has done in a particular game or series. These kinds of players always remain in the spotlight (irrespective of what they do).
However, there are a few players who perform a thankless job. They, more often than not, tend to stay away from the spotlight and go about their work quietly, but their consistency and output is often up to the mark. Hence, we look at 5 such players who were the 'unsung' heroes for this year (2017).
HASHIM AMLA
Hashim Amla is one of the calmest cricketers going around. You hardly notice him. But he has this excellent appetite for getting big runs. He may seem to be a classical Test batsman, but his record in the limited-overs formats speaks for himself.
In 2017, he's hardly been noticed and still, he's scored at an average of 50 in all three formats. In 11 Tests, he's amassed 942 with 3 hundreds and 4 half-centuries. He played a big part in South Africa's win against England at Trent Bridge. He scored twin fifties (78 and 87) in the game to help the Proteas set decent first and second innings scores. In ODIs, he has scored 862 runs in 18 games and 269 runs in 6 T20I games. With the likes of AB de Villiers and de Kock hogging the limelight with their power hitting, Amla in his classical way consistently keeps scoring runs.
Even though Amla has scored more than 2,000 runs this year in international cricket, there's hardly been any spotlight on him. Hence, he is the #1 unsung hero of this calendar year. - SK
Note  Stats as on 21st December 2017
TOM LATHAM
Tom Latham might only be 5 feet 6 inches tall, but he packs a punch. And the year 2017 has been a revelation for the 25-year old Canterbury lad.
In Tests, he started off with a bang, scoring 302 runs in 4 innings against Bangladesh. More often than not, he has helped New Zealand get off to a solid start ensuring the middle order isn't exposed early.
In ODIs, after a string of low scores at the start of the year, Latham turned the year around brilliantly as he has 50-plus scores in his last 6 One-Day innings. And of late, the New Zealand team management has moved him to No. 5 due to his ability to play spin well and the move has worked superbly.
In India, he helped New Zealand chase down 280 after being 80/3 in Mumbai (first ODI). He continued his rich vein of form in the series as he finished as the second highest run-scorer in the series. He's also kept wickets in recent times and has done a wonderful job.
Hence, his performances haven't quite been noticed as the spotlight has been on a few of the other players in the team.
NATHAN LYON
Nathan Lyon is perhaps one of the most underrated bowlers in the world at the moment. He goes about doing his job rather quietly. However, to everyone's surprise, Lyon is currently the leading wicket-taker (60 wickets) in Tests in 2017.
Yes, he has played 6 out of 10 Tests this year in the subcontinent, but he's bowled beautifully irrespective of the pitch and conditions. He started the year with a bang as he picked up a career-best of 8-50 in March (his third Test of the year) against India. He took 19 wickets in 4 Tests in India before churning out 22 wickets in just 2 Tests in Bangladesh.
And that's not all! He has bowled beautifully in the ongoing Ashes series as well. He has taken 14 wickets in 3 games and the England batsmen have had little success in countering him.
With the spotlight often on the big quicks (Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins), Steve Smith and David Warner, the 30-year New South Wales spinner has quietly done a thankless job for the Aussies.
LIAM PLUNKETT
Liam Plunkett is one of the reasons why England have done very well in ODI cricket this year. The tall 32-year old pacer runs in all day and hits the deck hard. He has a very good ability to bowl over 90 mph and generate discomforting bounce.
This year, he has taken 36 wickets in 18 games at an average of 22.47 and a strike-rate of 23.97. He is fourth on the list of leading wicket-takers in 2017. Only Hasan Ali (the leading wicket-taker this year) and Rashid Khan have a better average and strike-rate than Plunkett.
After a sluggish start to the year in India, where he was taken for runs, Plunkett came back strongly and was amongst the wickets pretty quickly. He took 10 wickets in 3 games against the West Indies in the Caribbean and was England's most successful bowler in the ICC Champions Trophy, where he picked up 8 wickets.
Despite his exploits with the ball, Plunkett hasn't quite hogged the limelight in the English team. However, he has enjoyed a stellar 2017.
CHETESHWAR PUJARA
Many cricket pundits have stated that 'Cheteshwar Pujara meditates in the middle' and that is because of his wonderful ability to bat for long hours with immense concentration. And in 2017, Pujara has done what he does the best
India's Test No. 3 has churned out runs at will this year. He started the year with a couple of half-centuries against Bangladesh before coming into his own zone against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (where he scored 405 runs in 4 Tests).
In that series, he broke Rahul Dravid's record of most balls faced by an Indian in a Test inning. He played 525 balls en route to a majestic 202. Every time, India were in trouble, Pujara bailed them out. His 52 on a tough pitch at Eden Gardens is a testament to this fact.
He has scored 1,140 runs at an average of 67.06 this year. Even though he has scored a plethora of runs (with 4 hundreds and 5 fifties), Pujara has stayed away from the spotlight.
With major attention being on the likes of Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, Pujara has quietly gone about his work and is currently the highest run-getter of 2017.

Two-year plan for drug-free nation by 2020
The National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) plans to implement a two-year programme with the intention of creating a drug-free Sri Lanka by 2020.
Speaking at a media conference held yesterday at the NDDCB office, NDDCB Chairman Prof. Ravindra Fernando said the two-year programme will be implemented in collaboration with the Presidential Secretariat, Sri Lanka Police, Sri Lanka Federation of Non-Governmental Organizations Against Drug Abuse (SL FONGOADA) and other related institutions.
The programme will commence at the national level and will expand up to the international level drug prevention campaign, said the Chairman. According to the statistics of the NDDCB, the total number of drug-related arrests was 79,378 in 2016 and compared with 2015, drug-related arrests had decreased by four percent in 2016.
Out of the total drug-related arrests, 35 percent was related to heroin and 60 percent was related to cannabis. Around 60 percent of drug-related arrests were reported from the Western Province and nine percent had been reported from the Southern Province. The prevalence of drug-related arrests was 390 per 100,000 of the population in 2016.
Based on drug-related arrests in 2016, the highest number of cases - 47,787 - was reported for cannabis. A total of 4,174 kilograms of cannabis was seized in the country.
In 2016, 206kg of heroin was seized and 2,762 persons were arrested. When compared to 2015, heroin-related arrests have increased by three percent in 2016. According to the annual report of the Colombo Crime Division, 1,762 crime incidents were reported after illicit drug use and those were related to grave and minor crimes.
The President of Sri Lanka Federation of Non-Governmental Organizations Against Drug Abuse (SL FONGOADA) Dr. Sarath Samarage said having laws and regulations is not enough to address the drug issue and it is necessary to have a proper plan and procedure to prevent this menace.
The Director of the Presidential Task Force for Drug Prevention Dr. Samantha Kumara Kithalawaarachchi and Law and Order Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanne also participated.

US cager star rebounds from arrest with Iraq national team
Baghdad: DeMario Mayfield feared his basketball career was over when he was arrested on suspicion of planning a robbery, but the former US college star is now bouncing back -- in war-torn Iraq.
Originally from Georgia in Americas deep south, the 6 foot 5 inch (1.95 metre) player is the latest banner addition to Iraqs national team after taking citizenship following a 2015 club move to Baghdad.
I will forever be grateful for the opportunity that I have had presented to me, Mayfield, 26, told AFP.
It has been nothing but love since the day I arrived.
Mayfields prospects looked grim back in 2013 when the one-time University of North Carolina and University of Georgia star was arrested in his home state for conspiracy to commit armed robbery.
Right then and there I thought it was the end, he said.
But then I realised I just had to trust myself and dig myself out of the hole.
In the end he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of possessing a firearm and served 10 months on a work-release programme -- before eventually being given another chance by Angelo State in Texas.
But after finishing there he got no interest from clubs in the US or Europe until an offer from an unlikely source -- Baghdads Oil Club -- came along.
I had friends in this league before I came. They persuaded me to come here. We did a lot of talking before coming, Mayfield said.
Iraq was not the easiest sell.
The Middle East country has been wracked by violence and bloodshed since the US-led invasion of 2003.
While the capital Baghdad can often be quiet it is still frequently the target of suicide bomb attacks -- often claimed by the Islamic State group that swept through the country in 2014. AFP

It was carried out by providing Rs. 148 million to the Sri Lanka Army through the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry, in order to relocate the Army headquarters.
Accordingly, the Minister has informed the Divisional Secretariat to take necessary steps to provide this land back to their original owners on December 28. People would be enabled to obtain their own lands back, after concluding their 290-day protest after.
The minister further said that steps would be taken to resettle 85 families on those lands, in the year 2018.

Waiting for the voters choice
Sri Lanka's political landscape will see some decisive transformations in the coming weeks as campaigning for the local government elections pits major political parties against each other.
An early indication of this came last week when President Maithripala Sirisena addressed Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) activists last week. In a measured but hard-hitting speech, he readily acknowledged that he had undertaken every possible effort to unite the two factions of the party.
It is also no secret that towards the latter stages of the discussions it was the dissident faction of the party, with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as its de facto leader, which was reluctant to unite with the mainstream SLFP rather than vice versa. This is because this group, which is contesting the forthcoming local government elections as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), imposed several unrealistic conditions on the mainstream SLFP during negotiations such as leaving the National Unity government.
SLFP ministers who engaged in the talks now believe that while there were some hardliners who resisted a 'deal' between the two factions, it was a belief that the SLPP could outperform the SLFP that fuelled the SLPP's resistance.
In his speech to the SLFP, President Sirisena made no attempt to hide his annoyance about this attitude. "The identity of those who scuttled negotiations is well known " the President said and pointed out that he made every effort to arrive at a consensus, just as he had done prior to the August 2015 general election.
President's remarks
President Sirisena then went on to provide the strongest indication yet that there would be consequences for the SLPP's intransigence. "Just as much as I undertook my first challenge in November 2014," the President said in an obvious reference to his decision to leave the Rajapaksa government three years ago, "I will not hesitate to continue the second phase of that process".
Since then, there have been many interpretations to the President's remarks. Some have attempted to characterise them as a warning to the SLFP's partner in the National Unity government, the United National Party (UNP). Others have even gone to the extent of predicting a parting of ways with the UNP after the local government polls.
Adding to the speculation was the President's announcement that a presidential commission of inquiry will be appointed to probe management issues related to the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines. This has also been interpreted as the President training his guns on the UNP. This is due to the current management of the airline being appointees of this government with strong links to its UNP faction.
However it must be noted that not only the President but Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the entire government is also concerned about the underperformance of the airline and earnestly want it restructured as it is a major strain on the economy- with resulting political consequences for the government.
Rajapaksa government
Besides, any investigation into the national carrier will most certainly encompass its management under the previous regime when it was initially a profitable venture in partnership with the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, Emirates Airlines. The decision to terminate the agreement with Emirates would surely come under scrutiny as there are suggestions that it was triggered after the airline refused a personal request by then President Rajapaksa.
The airline's subsequent decline in performance under the Rajapaksa government will also be under investigation. Thus, the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into Sri Lankan Airlines cannot by any means be construed as a witch-hunt against the UNP.
SLFP stalwarts also note that in the same speech, the President was quite critical of the party's previous leadership. The President recalled how there was an attempt to belittle the Bandaranaikes although paying lip service to their policies by hanging their photographs in party offices. These remarks hardly suggest reconciliation with the SLPP leadership and indicate that President Sirisena could get tough with the SLPP in the aftermath of the local polls.
In this context it is pertinent to note that despite the aggressive campaigning by the SLPP and its forerunner, the Joint Opposition (JO) grouping in Parliament, its parliamentarians haven't had to campaign against the SLFP at an election until now. By doing so in the current campaign, they are explicitly violating party discipline and exposing themselves to measures being taken against them by the party hierarchy. This is a prospect JO stalwarts campaigning for the SLPP need to be mindful of. Of course, it is readily recognised by all concerned that any action by President Sirisena following the local government elections will necessarily be influenced by the performance of the three major parties in the fray- the UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP. If the SLFP performs strongly, there is no doubt that President Sirisena will be emboldened to wield the whip against the SLPP dissidents and full scale disciplinary action is likely. On the other hand, if the SLPP outperforms the SLFP, a more conciliatory approach is likely.
Against this backdrop, the campaign themes of the respective parties are noteworthy. Obviously, the SLPP is focussing on the alleged shortcomings of the government and also raising the Central Bank bond sale as a corruption issue in the incumbent government. However, knowing that they have to tap into the vote base of the SLFP if they are to make inroads into Sri Lanka's traditional two party system, they are quite critical of the SLFPers remaining within the government, perhaps even more so than their criticisms of the UNP.
Election campaign
The SLFP too is faced with the same predicament. Its harshest attacks are aimed at the SLPP rather than the UNP. In fact, the leaders of the SLFP and the UNP have arrived at an understanding that they will be prudent in their criticism of each other during this election campaign. This may be violated by activists on the ground every now and then but it also prevents indiscriminate sniping at each other.
While the UNP does stand to gain because of the rift between the mainstream SLFP and its dissidents, its victory at the election is by no means assured. This is due to several factors. Firstly, its performance in government has fallen short of expectations, particularly in easing the economic hardships that the electorate is faced with.
Secondly, the Central Bank bond sale issue has dented the party's image. This, coupled with its inability to prosecute leading figures of the previous regime for alleged corruption, means that it can no longer take the moral high ground regarding good governance or corruption related issues.
Thirdly, there are several 'unknowns ' at play at this election. Main among them is the size of the support commanded by the SLPP. The other imponderable is how the voter will react to the re-introduction of the first past the post method through the 'ward' system after nearly thirty years of proportional representation.
All these factors conspire to make the upcoming local government elections a litmus test for all major political parties, particularly for the warring factions in the SLFP. In that sense, there is much more than merely electing representatives for over 300 local government institutions in the country at stake at this poll.
It could revitalise President Maithripala Sirisenas moves to gain total control of the SLFP and it would also provide Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP with an assessment of their popularity. Most importantly though it will almost certainly make or break the political future of the Rajapaksa clan who ruled the country for a decade.

War hero faces untimely death in accident
A former war hero, S. A. D. Rupasinghe, 54, a resident of Pasyala Ranavirugama, whose life was spared during the war, faced an untimely death due to an alleged dispute with his wife on December 26 afternoon.
Reports said that his wife, who could not bear the constant harassment meted out to her by him, had decided to leave him and go and live at a rented house in Veyangoda with her two daughters.
One day, she had packed her household goods and other belongings into a lorry and left with her children to the Veyangoda house.
The war hero husband, who got to know about the development had followed the lorry on his motorcycle in a huff and crashed the motorcycle on to the lorry at Millehewa on the Pasyala  Giriulle road.
As he had sustained serious injuries in the crash, he had been rushed to the Wathupitiwela hospital but unfortunately, he had succumbed to his injuries around 7 pm the same day.

Web-based taxi services: Regulation needed
A few days ago, the European Unions top court ruled that on-demand web-based taxi services should be regulated as transport companies. The EU Court of Justice made this ruling against Uber supposed to be the worlds most valuable start-up company who are in the business of web-based taxi-service.
The decision, which cant be appealed, clarifies for the first time that connecting people via an application to non-professional drivers forms an integral part of a transport service. It rejects Ubers view that its a technology platform connecting passengers with independent drivers, not a transportation company.
In the EU judges view, the most important part of Ubers business is the supply of transport -- connecting passengers to drivers by their smartphones is secondary. Without transport services, the business wouldnt exist, they added.
This case and the judgement should be an eye-opener to Sri Lanka, because we also have here in Sri Lanka over a dozen web-based taxi-services.
Plus-factor
The on-demand web-based cab service is finally getting popular in public transit, and this writer believes that it could reshape the way Sri Lankan city commuters getting around. Just in time too. Sri Lankan Capital and other major cities are growing, traffic is getting worse, emissions are surging, and public transit systems are suffering from years of underfunding and weak management. On-demand, web-based transit services can be fast and cost-effective service and move drivers out of personal cars.
Or it could be the latest shiny object distracting from the time- and cost-intensive solutions needed to fix city travel ills, such as upgraded trains and public vehicles, more frequent service, better roads and road pricing schemes. Yet, this writer thinks its worth a shot.
Issues
However, we cannot sit idly by and see new technologies come and go without trying to figure out how they fit into the public transit landscape. And yes, so many questions are up in the air.
First, the drivers are not permanent employees of the company. They are their own bosses and set their own hours of work. They earn reasonable income - all in the comfort of their own vehicles. One major companys website indicates the requirements of a driver as follows: You must be at least 21- years-old. You must own/have access to a good condition 4-door vehicle - but its safe to say that your car cannot be older than year 2006. And, if you have a valid car insurance, your drivers license (for at least a year), and no major criminal history - youre ready to apply to become a driver.
Does this mean that we leave the fate of the passengers lives in the hands of an independent driver with one-year experience Why havent they asked for a medical certificate issued by a licensed government physician stating that the driver is physically and mentally fit to drive a motor vehicle Or the police clearance that the driver has not been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude or serious accidents resulting from reckless driving What happens if a crime is committed by a driver to a passenger
Three years ago, in New Delhi, a 26-year-old woman was taken to a secluded area and raped by the driver after her booking a journey home with web-based taxi service. There was public outrage and Delhi Government temporarily banned a number of web-based taxi-companies.
Background check
Much of the tension surrounding the deployment of web-based taxi services in London, New York and New Delhi relates to the fact that they do not comply with the existing rules of the relevant countries. One global provider, who is operating in Sri Lanka too, was banned in London for refusing to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the British court.
In most of the developed countries, taxi drivers need to submit to comprehensive criminal background checks that may involve a very high level of scrutiny than those carried out by the web-based service providers. These service providers argue that if stricter controls are imposed, that may keep occasional drivers, who work part-time only, from signing up.
Their point gives rise another counter-point - the number of hours these part-time workers can work in order to ensure that they do not become too fatigued to drive safely. This is especially important in the case of those working other full-time jobs as well. The drowsiness is one of the determinant factor in accidents. Are these taxi-providers doing close monitoring of the drivers
Vehicle safety inspection is another point and an important part of the public safety requirements. In developed countries, there are rigorous safety inspections for taxis. In some countries the check-ups are done bi-annually. Are the companies going through such procedure
Finally, Taxi service providers must provide adequate levels of motor vehicle insurance to meet with accident costs and passenger liability claims, unless those are met by the service provider.
As seen above, web-based transport services in Sri Lanka has plenty of issues to sort. And, these have to be sorted out by the Government authorities.
Example
Let us take, as an example, of a good web-based taxi-service Washington DC Taxi of USA, call/ web-based taxi service. Here, all drivers are tested by the District Council whether they can really drive and know the City streets like the back of their hands. They are insured for the passengers as set by District Council and vetted by the DC Department of For-Hire Vehicles, have thorough FBI background checks, and an average of 20 years professional driving experience.
They do not have surge-pricing. The price estimated before the trip, according to the mileage, will be final price (unless the mileage had increased).
The vehicles are subjected to mandatory inspection by DC authorised companies. Their vehicles have wheelchair accessibility as defined by law.
Indian experience
This is the type of web-based taxi service we also need. Let us now turn to our neighbour - India. The Indian Government has taken a number of steps in regulating the app-based taxi services.
The Government has formulated a number of mandatory guidelines. Among them are: The web-based taxi operating company must be registered in India. Only those having transport badges issued by the government will be allowed to function. A person with three-year experience will be eligible to drive such taxis.
During any booking, the details like drivers names, his photograph and licence number should be messaged to the passenger. Fares should be regularised. Apart from GPS/GPRS system in the vehicle and with the driver, there will be a display of the route and fare to be recovered for the same. It is mandatory to give commuters a bill. Fares will be different for small, medium luxury and large taxis.
The Central Government has asked each State Government to frame regulatory and operational infrastructure compliance guidelines for their own States.
It should also include vehicle profile, working condition for drivers and their compliance, framework for issuing license, duration and renewal among others, general condition, transparency and power to cancel or suspend licenses.
A large number of state governments have already announced their decision to regulate web-based taxi services to ensure affordable travel for commuters
Follow suit
This writer firmly believes that we need to follow the Indian example. Owing to no specific regulatory policy, the web-based taxi services look more like a bureaucratic conspiracy than the product of a competitive marketplace.
It is quite obvious that there is a strong case for subjecting web-based taxi services to comprehensive state regulation in the same way as any other sector is supervised and regulated - for the sake of fairness as well as safety for passengers.

WTOs role crucial for Sri Lanka - Rishad
The role of rules based multilateral trading system led by WTO has become more crucial in paving a level playing field for its members, in particular for small economies such as Sri Lanka, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen in his message to the 11th WTO (World Trade Organization) Ministerial Conference held from December 10-13 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Slow growth in trade, challenges from the digital transformation, attracting FDI, level of unemployment, access to trade financing and sustainable development are some of the great challenges that many developing countries encounter today, said Minister Bathiudeen and added: The role of rules based multilateral trading system led by WTO has therefore become more crucial in paving a level playing field for its members,
in particular for small economies such as Sri Lanka, in supporting their integration into the world trading system. Director General of WTO, Roberto Azevdohas once stated that trade has proven to be one of the best anti-poverty, pro-growth and pro-development tools in history.
The question is how we maintain such positive role of trade and derived the desired benefits in this challenging multilateral trading environment. Members from developing countries while making every effort to align our policies with our multilateral commitments, expect WTO to play a role of the facilitator of our development goals.
Such win-win situation is the key success factor for achieving Sustainable Development Goals ensuring our meaningful and sustainable integration into the world trading system. In this regard, the role of WTO as an enabler of making necessary technical and capacity development assistance for Small Economies, particularly in the areas of Aid for Trade, Transfer of Technology, Trade Facilitation, Trade Finance and Development, are crucial. Such assistance has proven positive gains facilitating way for better integration in to the world trade. 
Sri Lanka considers international trade as the engine of her economic growth. The countrys geographical location, conducive business environment complemented with a knowledge-based society have offered competitive strengths to the country and its trading partners. The growth strategies are therefore, aimed at participatory approach to sustainable development creating opportunities for international trade. 
At this Ministerial Conference the Sri Lankan delegation also included R.D.S. Kumararatne, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the WTO and Gothami Silva and officials from the Department of Commerce. 
Members of Lankan delegation to 11th WTO Ministerial including R.D.S. Kumararatne, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the WTO and Sheitha Senarathne, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
