CEA should re-look polythene ban
With the recent implementation of regulations to ban the use of HDPE to manufacture shopping bags and lunch sheets, discussions are emerging in society on environment protection and reusable bags and issues the SME sector is facing.
While it is of utmost importance to protect our environment we should also look into the repercussions of such regulations and the economic and environmental friendliness of the alternative substitutes which have been introduced to the market, said Shirantha Bokalawela who has 15 years experience in working in the polymer manufacturing industry.
Speaking to Daily News Business he says that the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) must do further studies in this regard before banning use of some substances of polythene as it has a major negate impact for the SME sector and convenience of the public.
Shirantha Bokalawela
First these products which were regularized by the new HDPE ban are products which are mostly used by the low income earners in the country. For example, if we take the lunch sheet, it is mostly used by the low income earning working population of this country, specifically leaving out the high income earners. Secondly the shopping bag is again something used by low income earning population. 
It would be much easy for a high income earning employee to go to a restaurant or bring the lunch in a plate, where the need of the lunch sheet is minimal, whereas if we take the 600,000 people who commute to Colombo on a daily basis in crowded buses and trains the picture is completely different.
An official of the CEA once mentioned that people can bring their lunch in two plates covered by a cloth but this is not practical for people taking public transport. Some manufacturers have spoken of introducing reusable non-woven bags to supermarkets and this option is good. However how many people go to super markets he asked.
He said that the alternatives provided should be economically affordable and should be mindful of the outflow of foreign currency.
The earlier used HDPE 20 foot container was around US$ 21,450 and the new compo-stable material which the CEA encourages manufacturers to use costs US$ 60,000 and this is a staggering US$ 6,939,000 extra outflow. Is this something a country like ours can afford he asked. He explained that the alternative LLDPE (more elastic) bags provided by CEA officials and used in supermarkets too are not the answer to the problem.
These new bags are made of LLDPE and although manufactured in low gauges, takes same or longer time to degrade than HDPE because of the differences in their structure, Additionally because of its elasticity (thin) people tend to use two to three bags instead of one, to ensure that contents stay within, making the pollution twice as much as before the ban!
He said that lunch sheets and shopping bags are not the only the demons that endanger the environment.
In the Meethotamulla tragedy (which cost 32 lives, in April 2017) only 7% of the garbage in it had polymer and plastic products, which means the polymer components (shopping bags and lunch sheets in question) would have been far less than 7%.
Additionally what we have to remember is that there are large amount of other products (which use polymer) such as biscuit packets and shampoo sachet that are not even recyclable. The authorities should look at bring in regulations for these kind of packaging as well.
Before the enforcement of the new regulations, over 200, 000 were engaged in the polymer manufacturing industry and they included home based industrialists and the small scale entrepreneurs.
While the giants of the industry to switch to new high cost materials, the SME sector had no option other than to close down operations leaving behind many to unemployment giving the big players in the industry another leap, as they faced less market competition. They also priced their goods at the higher price and making high profits.
Today the cost of manufacturing of a single lunch sheet using compostable material is Rs.1/= and the market price for it is Rs 3.60/=
He said that the alternative for this problem is the use of Oxo-bio degradable as an additive, to HDPE and LLDPE. The use of Oxo-bio degradable has been around the world for many years by many countries and is very cost effective compared to compostable materials.
This is specifically suitable for Sri Lanka, where the country doesnt have specific seasons and sunlight is available abundantly throughout the year. Oxo-bio degradable use sunlight to degrade the polymers and this happens in approximately 18 months, thus completely degrade minimizing the pollution.
The authorities should focus more on the recycling process, as almost all products which were regularized (shopping bags and lunch sheets) are recyclable. The general public should be encouraged to segregate garbage and to use separate garbage bins to put away recyclable polymer products.
I am taking on this initiative and hope to initiate the first CSR project where separate garbage bins will be installed in public spaces to collect polymer products for recycling purposes.
The second stage of this project would be to educate school children on segregation of polymers and to show them that it is not polymers which destroys our environment but the way in which we dispose of it.
The authorities should focus on a fine system where general public are fined if they do not dispose of polymers (especially at public spaces) properly.

Huge opportunity for Lankan exhibitors  AT Ambiente fair in Frankfurt
Stephan Kurzawski, Senior Vice President Consumer Goods and Board Member Messe Frankfurt Group along with Erdmann Kilian, Director Marketing Communications visited Colombo and at a press conference spoke about the trade fair Ambiente.
Kurzawski said that Ambiente is held every year in Frankfurt, Germany in February and deals with consumer items and where business and creativity come together. The fair is divided into areas of living, giving, dining which offers visitors a clear guide on the products available as there are 4376 exhibitors from 88 countries present at the fair.
The Ambiente is scheduled to be held from 8 to 12 February 2019 in Frankfurt, Germany will have a range of consumer products.
With more than 4300 exhibitors from 88 countries it is one of the most international fairs in the world. Also, with more than 130,000 trade visitors from 167 countries the entire world is present at the fair with the top 10 visitor nations after Germany being Italy, China, France, United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, South Korea and Switzerland. This is a unique chance to interact with the entire world in one location.
A number of Sri Lankan manufacturers and buyers look and visit at Ambiente for the growth of their business. Sri Lanka is very rich in handicrafts, ceramic and other decorative items.
The flow of Sri Lankan buyers going to Ambiente fair to buy high ends lifestyle products is increasing every year. As the demand of the Sri Lankan household changes; retailers will need to response quickly to the changing trends and fashion -at Ambiente this can be seen at the various halls, events and presentations.
Omer Salahuddin, CEO Messe Frankfurt SP Sri Lanka and Hadi Salahuddin, Director Messe Frankfurt SP Sri Lanka were also present at the press conference in Colombo.
Omer Salahuddin, CEO Messe Frankfurt SP Sri Lanka highlighted that five Sri Lankan exhibitors are expected to be participate in Ambiente next year to showcase their products namely Dankotuwa, Selyn, Gospel House Handicraft, AMP Ceylon and Art Decoration.
Kurzawski also spoke about Ambiente offering a vast range of interesting innovations. As a visitor, you may not have the chance to see all of it. This is why we created so to speak some short-cuts, for example, special presentations, like our Point of Experience, the Ambiente Trends, and Solutions. They give you the opportunity to get a quick idea of some important trend developments and learn about some exciting new products.
The Point of Experience area will be focusing on the changing role of trade, in Hall 4.1, showing the transformation of the point of sale into a point of experience. This area will demonstrate how product presentations can attract attention in the digital age.
There is also a show called Solutionsnow entering its seventh edition which features solutions to problems through clever everyday products, especially in the dining, kitchen and household segments. A programme that is of equally great importance is the talents programme. Obviously, the consumer goods industry is an industry based on innovations.

Safe plastic may be dangerous
The safe chemicals used in plastics to replace hormone-disrupting BPA may carry the same risks, a new study reveals.
In 1999, now-renowned scientist Patricia Hunt accidentally discovered that most plastic products contain a chemical that disrupts hormones. Bisphenol A (BPA) - which was used in childrens toys, medical devices, and food packaging - could affect cancer risk, fertility, and more, Hunts Washington State University team found.
Within 15 years, Hunts study had driven the US - and countries around the world - to ban BPA, mandating manufacturers to use safe alternatives, such as BPS.
But today, Hunt reveals, she has suffered deja vu: her latest research reveals replacement chemicals inflicted the same damage on the sperm and eggs of lab mice.
Hunt says that concerned consumers should just stick to one rule: it doesnt matter what chemicals are on the label, plastic products that show physical signs of damage or aging cannot be considered safe.
Hunt warns that our demand for plastic gives firms the impetus to override a slow, outdated regulatory system. Regulators cannot keep up with the pace of new chemicals entering the market, allowing companies to push out poorly-tested alternatives as a quick-fix for our modern day products.
Surprising Results
Hunt insists that even she was surprised by the results of the new study, published today in Current Biology. Again, it happened somewhat by accident.
This time, the changes were more subtle because not all of the cages were contaminated, but a fair few. And this time, they were contaminated by something believed to be harmless.
They saw that the disturbance in the lab was causing problems in the production of both eggs and sperm. Once they got the contamination under control, the researchers conducted additional controlled studies to test the effects of several replacement bisphenols, including a common replacement known as BPS.
Similar abnormalities
Those studies confirm that replacement bisphenols produce remarkably similar chromosomal abnormalities to those seen so many years earlier in studies of BPA.
Hunt notes that the initial inadvertent exposure of their animals was remarkably similar to what might happen in people using plastics in that the exposure was accidental and highly variable. Not all of the animals cages were damaged, and so the findings differed among animals in different cages.
She adds that--although determining the levels of human exposure is difficult--their controlled experiments were conducted using low doses of BPS and other replacement bisphenols thought to be relevant to exposure in people using BPA-free plastics.
These problems, if they hold true in people as has been shown in the case of BPA, will carry over to future generations through their effects on the germline.
The researchers showed that, if it were possible to eliminate bisphenol contaminants completely, the effects would still persist for about three generations.
Hunt says more work is needed to determine whether some replacement bisphenols might be safer than others, noting that there are dozens of such chemicals now in use.
She also suspects that other widely used and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including parabens, phthalates, and flame retardants, may be having similarly adverse affects on fertility that warrant much more study. dailymail

INTERNATIONAL BEACH CLEAN-UP DAY
Task of every citizen to control marine pollution
It is the responsibility of every citizen to control pollution of the marine environment of Sri Lanka. Every citizen should recognise the seriousness of the mammoth task of protecting nature and conserving the environment, President Maitripala Sirisena said in Galle.
The President was taking part in the national ceremony to mark International Beach Clean-up Day together with the National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week held at Dadella, in Galle, yesterday.
The Southern Provincial Office the Marine Environment Protection Authority organised the event.
Our ocean is constantly being polluted owing to excessive naval movements and due to marine accidents, such as the recent oil leak, that take place in the sea in and around our country, the President said. The pollution is greatly harmful to the healthy existence of the ocean. The fishing community and tourists are also responsible for maintaining a spotless and uncontaminated ocean and beach. We all have to understand this national duty. All participants including schoolchildren and the government and non-governmental organisations can rightly take this vital message to society.
Following the beach clean-up programme in which the President also participated, he inaugurated the newly constructed office complex of the Southern Provincial branch of the Marine Environment Protection Authority. To mark the occasion, the President planted a sapling at the new office premises.
President Sirisena also distributed beach cleaning implement among the beach cleaners.
The national project of cleaning the coast and marine environment in 14 districts of the country planned by the Marine Environment Protection Authority was launched by the President by initiating the beach cleaning programme in Galle.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma, Galle district Parliamentarians Piyasena Gamage and Wijepala Hettiarachchi, Marine Environment Protection Authority Chairman Rear Admiral (Rtd.) Rohana Perera and General Manager Dr. Turny Pradeepa Kumara, Galle District Secretary Somarathne Vidanapathirana, members of the Armed Forces and schoolchildren participated.

Thats magic! Hamilton scorches to Singapore pole
Singapore, Saturday: Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton scorched to Singapore Grand Prix pole position with a magic lap that left title rival Sebastian Vettel down in the dumps on Saturday.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull will start on the front row for Sunday's race alongside Hamilton after crossing the line 0.319sec behind the Englishman's blistering 1min 36.015, but an exasperated Vettel could only manage third.
That felt like magic, said a beaming Hamilton of his stunning lap record at the Marina Bay street circuit -- an astonishing 3.476 seconds quicker than last year's pole effort by Vettel.
It was really special, I don't think there was a bad moment in the lap. It was just perfect, he added.
I don't know where it came from but it all came together. It's one of the best laps I can remember. I am overwhelmed.
Ferrari's Vettel, who is 30 points behind Hamilton in the title race with seven races to go, cut a glum figure after encountering traffic on his flying laps and only managing a best effort of 1:36.628.
It's not ideal obviously, we wanted to get pole and didn't, Vettel scowled. The German is running out of time to make inroads into Hamilton's lead and Ferrari had targeted Singapore with its twisty, high downforce layout as a place they could turn the tables on Mercedes, a team that usually struggles in the Lion City.
But now Vettel will have to find a way past the flying Hamilton on one of the most difficult overtaking tracks if he is to close the gap, as both men chase their fifth drivers world championship.
Gone in 60 minutes (Sub Heading)
It was a messy qualifying session and there was too much time missing so we didn't get any better than third, he fumed.
For sure I'm not happy with today. Qualifying wasn't as smooth as it should've been, other people did better than us. There was a lot of other cars around but you can't blame it on that. Both laps weren't great. I think we have a good car so let's see.
Verstappen had complained about a lack of power all through Saturday's third practice session in his Red Bull, so the 20-year-old was excited to be on the front row for a second year in succession.
Honestly this feels like a victory, said the delighted Dutchman.
The amount of problems we have had in qualifying with the engine, to be second is unbelievable and that shows we have an amazing car. Verstappen said that with a good run to the first corner when the lights go out on Sunday he could put himself in with a chance of winning.
We just have to make sure we have a clean start then after that everything is possible, he said. We need to sort out the engine but I'm very happy with the car. Hamilton's teammate Valtteri Bottas will join Vettel on the second row of the grid.
Everyone knows it's going to be difficult to overtake here, said Bottas, who predicted a three-way tussle to the chequered flag between Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull.
All three teams will be close and find it difficult because we're all going for the same thing.
Kimi Raikkonen was fifth in the second Ferrari and a visibly upset Daniel Ricciardo, who has finished runner-up for the past three years in Singapore, was sixth fastest in his Red Bull.
The Australian was at a loss to explain his lack of performance after being fastest in both first practice on Friday and the first qualifying session, only to see his victory hopes virtually gone in 60 minutes.
It fell away in the space of an hour and we don't know why. I'm a little bit emotional, said Ricciardo. I want to figure out and understand why we lost out so much. AFP

Alvarez downs Golovkin with majority decision win
LAS VEGAS: Mexico's Saul Canelo Alvarez ended Gennady Golovkin's unbeaten reign as unified middleweight champion here Saturday, battling to victory by majority decision in a pulsating rematch.
Alvarez showed skill and durability to outlast Golovkin in another attritional contest between the two evenly-matched rivals at the T-Mobile Arena, one year after they had fought to a controversial draw at the same venue.
Alvarez inflicted the first defeat of Kazakh slugger Golovkin's career after two judges scored it 115-113 in his favour, with another judge scoring it even at 114-114.
I am a great fighter, and I showed it tonight, said Alvarez, roared on by a partisan crowd throughout on the eve of Mexico's Independence Day celebrations.
If the people want another round, I'll do it again, added the 28-year-old, who improves to 50-1-2. I feel satisfied because I gave a great fight. It was a clear victory. Golovkin, who fell to 38-1-1 after the loss, left the ring immediately to get eight stitches to a cut above his right eye.
He later said he believed he had done enough to win -- and opened the door for a possible third instalment.
I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo according to the judges, the deposed WBA, WBC and IBO middleweight king said.
I thought it was a very good fight for the fans, and very exciting. I thought I fought better than he did. When asked about a third fight, he said: Under the right conditions, yes. Alvarez's victory ended the 36-year-old's dream of securing a record-breaking 21st consecutive defence of his middleweight titles.
While Golovkin appeared to take issue with the result, there was little sense of controversy about Saturday's outcome.
Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez was among those who had few complaints.
I had it close going into the 12th round, Sanchez said. We had good judges who saw it from different angles - I can't complain about the decision, but it's close enough to warrant a third fight.
Canelo fought a great fight, congratulations. Both fighters fought cagily from the outset, reluctant to trade heavy blows.
- Canelo unruffled -
Golovkin appeared to edge clear in the early rounds, working well behind his stiff left jab, but Alvarez remained unruffled.
The Mexican, who had been accused of running in the first fight, came forward relentlessly and dominated the mid part of the fight.
On all three judges cards Alvarez dominated the middle rounds from the fifth through to the eighth, building a handy lead to defend in the closing stages.
Golovkin attempted to rally, rocking Alvarez with a stinging right hand in the 10th before pinning him on the ropes with a flurry of hooks.
But Golovkin was never able to press home his advantage, and each time Alvarez was able to evade the looming danger to slide away and respond with blows of his own.
With Golovkin needing a big finish in the 12th, Alvarez again proved up to the challenge, shrugging off an early uppercut to hold on for the win.
Although statistics afterwards showed Golovkin had thrown more punches, it was Alvarez who landed more consistently, outscoring his rival 143-116 in power punches.
An array of stars from the movie and sports world were amongst a crowd of 21,965 for the most anticipated fight of the year, with LeBron James rubbing shoulders with Hollywood icons such as Denzel Washington and Will Smith.
But the technical, tactical battle never quite lived up to the explosive classic which fans had hoped for.
The contest followed an acrimonious build-up which saw both camps trade insults in the wake of Alvarez's two failed drug tests in February which forced the cancellation of an earlier May 5 rematch.
The two boxers needed to be separated at Friday's weigh-in after Alvarez charged at Golovkin as they faced off.
Alvarez was banned for six months after testing positive for the banned performance enhancing substance Clenbuterol.
The Mexican blamed the test failures on eating contaminated meat in his native Mexico.
However Golovkin had infuriated the Alvarez camp by repeatedly rubbishing his opponent's explanation for the test results, accusing the Mexican of being a dope cheat.
The acrimony was forgotten in the aftermath of Saturday's bout, with both men embracing in the ring.

Americans cut down on meat
The long, sizzling love affair between America and meat may finally be cooling off, a new report reveals.
Two thirds of Americans said that they have cut back the amount of meat they eat, according to the results of a newly-published Johns Hopkins survey. Public health officials and nutrition experts have been campaigning for people in the US to reduce their red and processed meat consumption for the last few years.
At long last, it seems the American public is starting to listen, for the sake of their hearts, waist lines and wallets. Second only to Australia, Americans have always eaten a lot of meat. But red and processed meats contain a lot of saturated fat, which turns into an oily waxy substance that can line and block off blood vessels.
This in turn raises the risks of diabetes and heart disease. Studies conducted through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggest that eating one additional serving of unprocessed red meat a day raises the risks of death by any cause by 13 per cent. For unprocessed meat, its a 20 per cent increase in mortality risks.
But those alarming statistics - and warnings from major medical authorities like the American Heart Association (AHA) - have done little to curb meat consumption in the US.
When the housing bubble burst and the American economy entered a recession in 2008, meat consumption crashed too. Annual intake continued to decline, reaching a 20-year low in 2014.
But beef, pork and chicken are back, and meat is expected to be a bigger business than ever this year. Analysts estimate that the average American will eat a record-setting 222 lbs of meat over the course of this year.
Many Americans continue to have a strong preference for meat, says lead author of the new study, Dr Roni Neff. But this survey adds to a growing body of evidence that a significant portion of the population may be purposefully reducing their meat consumption without becoming vegetarian or vegan. They should emphasize that meatless meals can be interesting and taste good, and could also provide resources like recipes with other options.

Applause for belles lettre
That rush of joy seeps in slowly across the middle bench of the audience. That is where the shortlisted nominees occupied waiting for the final judgement. As the book covers appear on the large screen, the authors must have felt a pulsing throbbing feeling. Finally, when one book is left in the screen with its name announced as the winner, the recipient must have felt a rapid gentle tremor-like sensation. You are trapped in a starry stratosphere from the moment of rising from the seat through walking across the aisle towards the stage to receive the much-coveted trophy. The whole world reaches a new height right before you.
An award is a token of inspiration for any scribe. The judgement always stirs hair-splitting debates, but the winners satisfaction is beyond words. It reaches a point of culmination when the award comes down from the state.
Yet, as Higher Education & Cultural Affairs Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe emphasised at the State Literary Festival held recently, the winner does not take it all. The winning entry cannot underestimate the rest of the books.
Our responsibility is to felicitate these writers and at the same time, the occasion of State Literary Awards Ceremony would be a motivation for them.
The literature has been a luxurious flow of water that nurtured the human civilisation. The ability this subject possesses to transform the human life into a more meaningful one is unquestionable, Dr Rajapakshe noted.
The cultural activities of a nation, the minister observed, is a measure of its nobility. Most of the literary works in the world having penetrated into the lives of the human being were able to give guidance to the society. It is obvious that excellent literary works were penned in Polonnaruwa, Dambadeniya and Kotte eras, Dr Rajapakshe added.
He also noted that the literary culture was subject to degeneration within the period of nearly four centuries of the foreign rule though there was a subsequent renaissance in literature after gaining independence.
According to the State Literary Advisory Board Chairperson Professor Samantha Herath, the ceremony does not mark a result-sheet of a competition.
We have no intention of pushing writers for competitions whatsoever. At the end of the process of the evaluation for the selection of best literary work of the year, we foresee a quite a different angle which is very wide, noble, and touching the foremost depths of humanity, Professor Herath noted.
He also expressed his belief in a community of writers which are a minority in a large society. This group deserves to be highly respected and honoured. They have engaged in their creative and academic endeavours with the noble intention of sharing their talents and writing skills with the community at large.
Professor Herath defined writing as a human service, without much expectation, extending to a wider social space. Conceptually the writer has the mandate to address the whole society, as he wants, with immense freedom. The real socio-political, cultural stakeholders are writers in any society. They are the erudite, veteran and critical stakeholders. They provide vision critically for the march towards the development of the society. They clear the dark terrain and pave the way and light up for a new thinking process.
A notable feature of the event was Devika Wadigamangawas striking speech performed at no invitation. As the recipient of the Best Literary Work for Children in Translation, Wadigamangawa had no competition among the shortlisted works. Both shortlisted works were hers. Yet she was a bit reluctant to approach the trophy. She was struggling with something to express until the compere Wasantha Rohana offered her the microphone. She revealed her identity as the wife of Free Media Movement Firebrand Sanath Balasuriya and how she capitalised her victimised period to translate the award-winning entry.
Perhaps the least noticed yet most interesting fact is how father and daughter were recognised at the festival. Tissa Abeysekara posthumously received the Best Cinema Script AQward for Weli Kathara while his daughter Charulatha Abeysekara received the Best Novel award for Stories.

Dr. Hilarian Codippily
Erudite scholar
This is an appreciation of Dr. Hilarian Codippily, who passed away on August 16, this year, following his battle against cancer.
Hilarian ('Hilary' to his friends) was a mathematician and economist, who served his motherland as well as the world, with great distinction.
I first met Hilary in 1958, when he entered the Colombo Campus of the University of Ceylon, two years after I did. We both graduated with BSc. degrees in mathematics, but our professional paths diverged thereafter. While I pursued an academic career in Sri Lanka and abroad, Hilary followed a career in economic planning.
After his graduation from the Colombo Campus in 1962, followed by a second BSc. degree from the University of London in 1967, Hilary joined the Finance and Planning Ministry. While at the ministry, he received a scholarship to do a Masters degree in Economics at the University of Warwick, England, in 1973; he obtained the degree in 1975. On returning to the ministry, while carrying out his duties as an Additional Director there, he continued his research in Econometrics in his spare time as an external student of the University of Warwick, earning his PhD in 1979.
Subsequently, Hilary joined the World Bank in 1981 and went on to become the banks leading authority on Small Island Economics. He retired in 2000 and returned to Sri Lanka, while remaining a consultant to the bank for several more years.
While Hilary was an economist by profession, he was also an erudite scholar whose interests encompassed a wide range of disciplines, including mathematics, astronomy and philosophy. He also enjoyed classical music and theatre.
Since returning to Sri Lanka following his retirement from the World Bank, he returned to his early love for astronomy and expended his time and energy developing and teaching a postgraduate course in astrophysics/cosmology at the Colombo Campus of the University of Sri Lanka.
He continued to do so even when his health was failing and he was experiencing pain. In connection with the course, I recall the long trans-oceanic phone calls pertaining to cutting-edge physics issues such as the quantisation of gravity, which Hilary wanted to include in the course.
During these calls, Hilary was eager to keep me updated on the state of Sri Lanka's economy with insightful and balanced analyses, and always adding his thoughts on what needed to be done to improve things. Hilary was someone who loved his motherland; he wanted to do whatever he could for its future.
During his tenure at the World Bank, he was also the Sri Lanka Association President in Washington. In that capacity, he acted as a goodwill ambassador for Sri Lanka.
I counted Hilary as one of my closest and dearest friends of all time, and I will miss him greatly. He was one of those rare persons who combined intelligence with integrity and compassion. He was a credit not only to the country of his birth, but to humanity as well.

Udara Pathirana
Selfless youth
Days, weeks and months have gone by for the grieving parents who lost their well-mannered elder son Udara Darshana Pathirana, to a fatal motorcycle accident, last year.
Udara had his primary education in Singapore. When his family returned to the island, little Udara was admitted to Wesley College, Colombo.
He later continued his studies in the Maths stream. In 2009, he passed his Advance Level examination and joined the University of Sunderland in London, UK, to follow a degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering. Udara obtained the BSc with high-grade honours in 2014.
Having a thirst for knowledge, he obtained a diploma in Advanced Technology from the City and Guilds in London.
He had also registered for a Master's degree, but that was not to be, as he passed away suddenly. Apart from academics, Udara turned his attention to other activities such as young leadership training, future generation's programmes, as well as social services, raising funds for organisations such as HelpAge International.
He also obtained a First-aid certificate from the St. John Ambulance Association in 2001.
Armed with those qualifications, Udara opted to join a private firm to practice what he had learnt, without depending on the financial contributions of others.
A large number of friends who rallied round this dapper personality who was over six feet tall, fondly called him Boola. He was their undisputed leader. Fun-loving Udara was an entertainer, singer, voluntary social worker, but above all, he possessed great humane qualities.
No event was complete without him. He was an active participant in all events arranged by his friends, whether it was a sharmadana campaign, musical show, religious activity or wedding. He always played the role of the 'master of ceremonies'. Udaras maturity displayed during those functions far exceeded his age. Some considered him their role model.
Brother, you were my best friend, but now, you are no longer with us. I miss you more than you will ever know. Your memories will always linger in my heart.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Kenneth Perera
An honest man
Death is inevitable; it comes to all. But when it comes to one who is close to you, it is indeed, sad.
Life seemed cruel for him to be taken away from us so early. He suffered a brief illness and breathed his last a few days ago. Kenneth was a unique friend. He was quiet and reserved with many, but vivacious and hilarious with close friends.
Kenneth was my closest friend for more than 55 years and was my bestman. As schoolboys, we fished in the Lunawa Lagoon, played cricket, and enjoyed eating 10-cent buns and ice cream from the college canteen.
His death has created a vacuum; I have lost a dear friend who is irreplaceable. An emptiness remains in me that I cannot seem to fill. He was a man who reached out to his friendsparticularly, in their times of distress. He was steadfast in his loyalty to them, and this was evident from the large crowd that was present at his funeral. Kenneth gave generously to the underprivileged. Throughout his life, he epitomised love and compassion for the poor and marginalised.
He was the Hendala Lions Club President and was also a strict disciplinarian. Viewed from a Christian perspective, he was a true believer of Christ, with an empathetic heart. His life was an example to all; simple, dignified and social. Kenneth was a handsome, high-spirited, pleasant and humble human being.
Kenneth was always dedicated to his family. He was a loving husband to his wife Priyani and a devoted father to his only son Milinda. He was an amazing family man.
Priyani was a great strength to him in his duties, and looked after him with care and affection, especially when he was suffering from his illness.
He was close to his son Milinda and provided him with the correct education and exposure, laying the foundation for his success. I thank God for his life; for giving me a such a wonderful friend.
I will not say farewell, for I know we will meet again and would laugh once more. May your soul rest in peace.

Janaka Balasooriya
He was down-to-earth
To every man upon the earth, death cometh soon or late. - William Shakespeare.
The famous saying goes; the good die young. It was Multi-system Atrophy (MSA) that snatched the life of our beloved Janaka Balasooriya at the age of 45 years, when his life had just begun to blossom in Melbourne, having migrated in search of greener pastures in 2008.
After his secondary education at Isipathana College, Colombo 5, Janaka graduated from the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI) in Moratuwa in 1991, when he was 20 years old. With the training he received there, he was able to find employment effortlessly. He had been the Transport Manager at D.S. Jayasinghe, Nawaloka Group and Jefferjee Brothers for 15 years, before opting to migrate.
Janaka was multi-talented and social; he had been the Honourary Secretary of the CGTTI Old Boys' Association's in Sri Lanka and Australia. Initially, Janaka had been a laser-cutting technician at a firm before joining Nelson Global in Melbourne. Janaka had also been instrumental in the formation of the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute's Aluminium Global Forum.
He had also played a part in organising many social and cultural events such as bak maha ulelas and other sports tournaments in Dandenong, Australia. Janaka, with his colleague Kanishka Jayalth, had presented the radio program 3ZZZ, every Thursday night. He had also been the co-editor of the Sihanada newspaper.
Janaka was at the helm of numerous social and cultural activities in Melbourne. His sober habits, as well as his unassuming, down-to-earth and low-profile mannerism, were the hallmarks of his popularity. He was known to his colleagues as a sonduru minisek. Janaka received support from his friends and colleagues following his MSA diagnosis in 2014.
Janaka had initially faced difficulties in keeping his balance and later, needed a walker to travel. His wife Praboda, as well as his friends, assisted him from the initial stages of the disease until his demise on October 21, last year.
Janaka's friends had also organised 23 blood donations as well as food fairs, to raise funds to help him battle MSA, although specialists had said that he would not live past December, last year.

A.G. Ranasinghe
Devoted family man
It is with sadness that I write these few lines on my father-in-law Ambagahakottuwe Gedara Ranasinghe, known to family members as loku Appachchi. He passed away on September 20, 2014, after a brief illness.
He was born on January 12, 1926, at Amunugama in Kandy and was the third son in a family of 11. He studied up to Grade 8 and as a teenager, joined the army to fight in World War II. He was stationed at the Polgolla camp.
On being discharged from the military, he served at the Road Development Authority for over 25 years. He also worked as a contractor before going into retirement. He was a devout Buddhist who always prayed at the nearest temple. He never failed to visit the Amunugama Maha Viharaya on poya days.
My father-in-law was the Dayaka Sabha Secretary of the temple in his village and as such, the responsibilities that fell on him were numerous. Following the Chief Prelate's advice, he arranged dhamma discussions, as well as other programmes, for devotees who observed sil on poya days.
He married Wimalawathi from Menikhinna, Kandy and they were blessed with five daughters. After marriage, they moved to Amunugama, his birthplace. His children always held him in high esteem.
My association with his family began in the early 90's, when I married his third daughter Malani, although both of us were of different religions. My father-in-law had amazing qualities and this made him exceptional. He was a loving father and a devoted husband. He did everything possible to make our lives happy and comfortable. As a dutiful father, He advised us. He always said that learning was the foundation which no one could take away from us. He advised me to do my duties with dedication, commitment and integrity.
He was a teetotaler, a lover of plants, and one who considered gardening his responsibility. He attended to his plants so much that those who visited him often saw him toiling in the garden. We are in deep sorrow over his death.
He was keen on having get-togethers once every three months.
A few months before his death, I saw him at his granddaughter's wedding.
May this dedicated Buddhist personality attain the Supreme of Nibbana! May his journey through Sansara be short and smooth!

## Title: Bio Foods partners with GLS Bank, Germany

Bio Foods partners with GLS Bank, Germany
Bio Foods (Pvt.) Ltd. which was established in 1993, paved the way to change the culture of agro chemical ridden conventional farming, by starting chemical-free organic crop cultivation.
This was combined with a fair trade model of treating farmers, where no matter the season, their cost of production was covered and they were always paid an additional premium over market-price to help them maintain a decent quality of life.
This company started out as a family-owned export business based in Kandy, run for 25 years by its visionary founder and Chairman Dr. Ananda Sarath Ranaweera.
Today, this company has grown to be one of the world leaders in biodynamic, organic and fair- trade agriculture.
As they celebrate their 25th anniversary, they have grown to be leading exporters of tea, spices and coconut products. From its very inception, Bio Foods implemented fair trade standards (even before international regulatory body, the Fairtrade Labelling Organization, was established) to protect their farmers from market prices uctuations and middle-man exploitation.
This is one of the many things that differentiates them and makes them leaders in modern sustainable agriculture.
Their business model spans from directly training and certifying underprivileged farmer groups in many rural parts of Sri Lanka, to their own certied processing plants to packing units. It is unusual for a single company to manage everything from the farmer-level to the nal value-added product, in a transparent, sustainable (for both environment and workers) manner.
With their goal of leaving behind clean air, water and soil for all living things, present and future, Bio Foods have always believed in clean, agro-chemically uncontaminated produce. The avid commitment to this target of sustainability is perhaps why they carry the most international certications (organic, biodynamic, and ethical certicates) of any company in the country.
These certications mean that an international regulatory body carries out annual audits and inspections to make sure that all the very rigorous criteria of the certications are met.
This is the sort of standard maintenance that local authorities have not yet consolidated. In order to call a product Certied Organic, all stages of preparing that product, from production, processing, and packing, along with the distributing agent, have to comply with the rules and regulations that accompany the certication displayed.
This contributes to ensuring overall coherence and a proper functioning the certication, and consequently establish trust and knowledge in the consumer of what they are purchasing is a truly organic product.
Due to his longstanding commitment towards this vision and ethical standing, the founder and Chairman of Bio Foods, Dr. Ranaweera, won the rst ever Worlds Fairest Fairtrade Award, presented by the World Fairtrade Labelling Organization (FLO) itself. Presented in 2014 in Bonn, Germany, this was a proud moment for Sri Lanka, as he was selected from over 80 worthy candidates who were recognized for
Their special efforts or innovations within the global fair-trade system. In addition, the Marginalized Organic Producers Association (MOPA) that was founded by the Chairman, was also recognized as the best small producer organization in Asia.
MOPA directly collaborates with over 7400 farmer families to bring internationally certied organic, fair trade and biodynamic food to the world via Bio Foods, because as previously mentioned, they have been exporters for the last 25 years.
In fact, Bio Foods was the rst company in the world to export certied organic, bio dynamic and fair trade spices. They continue to supply for several very large organic brands in Europe (primarily) and North America, with a market that is ever expanding as the world population gets increasingly more educated and conscious of their health.
Now, as part of their milestone 25 year celebrations, Bio Foods is launching a range of products marketed under their own brand. This is a part of their Chairmans initiative to give back to the people of the land that they harvest their wonderful produce from. These products range from teas, spices, herbs, fruits, vegetables, coconut products, to whole grains, and will be accessible to the a discerning, ethically minded, health conscious consumers in Sri Lanka.
They also plan to introduce the exact same products to the international audience as well, because at Bio Foods they believe that the #organic way is for everyone, no matter where they are from. Their 25th year is one of many landmarks. In addition to their rst ever name brand, they also recently partnered up with GLS Bank Germany, the worlds rst socio ecological bank, and now the largest green- bank in Europe. They are known to have always invested in projects that impact the environment positively, and hold a pioneering position in nancing renewable energy projects.
In addition, they also fund agricultural businesses like The Seed Fund, which supports foundations and companies in the organic sector as well as organic seed research and development.
GLS also has a trust built from money donated for good causes, which they then invest in organic farming companies and projects that have social responsibility at heart.
Due to the globally unparalleled scale of the vision, the direct social impact that Bio Foods has had on a large number of farmers, along with the congruence in the end goals of both companies, GLS Bank has decided (in a very infrequent move on their part), to invest outside of Europe, in Sri Lanka.
This new partnership with Bio Foods and GLS Bank is a relationship with a wonderful mission.
Together, they have formed a charitable trust, where a sizable portion of their yearly dividends will be spent on educating the children and farmers of the rural communities with they work.
The decision was made to focus singularly on education, as it is something that no one can take away from the people, is something that can be passed on to the future generations, and because it is something that can spread.
Together, this partnership promises to pave a beautiful road for everyone involved, and sets the stage for Bio Foods to be a global leader in the organic and sustainable agriculture industry.

Britains biggest puppy
A family has adopted Britains biggest puppy  a Great Dane that is over 6ft and weighs 43kg (95lbs). And hes still growing.
Five-month-old Arnie the dog was the biggest pup the team at Dogs Trust in Glasgow has ever cared for.
He was put into care and now a family have fallen in love and decided to adopt him even though he towers over all of them when he stands at over 6ft on his hind legs.
Julie and Colin Reid and their son Josh from Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire have adopted him. Julie said, I received a call from someone at Dogs Trust saying Arnie had come in and that he was a Great Dane. We didnt have a specific breed in mind when looking for a pet but Arnie is the perfect companion. When we went in to have a look at him it was just love at first sight. He is gentle, loving and so playful; he will definitely fit in at home, we are just relieved we have a big enough home to accommodate our new baby hippo. Hes just a big lovable rogue.
Julie and her family  who were unfazed by Arnies size  have four other dogs, including a Dogue de Bordeaux, two Chinese crested dogs and a French Bulldog. She said, Weve always fostered and have had Dogue de Bordeaux which are medium to large dogs. Its so funny taking them for a walk because theyre so different in size. Arnies just a puppy but is so big already, Ive no idea what hes going to be like when he grows up. Dogs Trust said Arnie was handed in to them by a family who cited a change in personal circumstances.
His vet records showed the first time he was weighed at eight weeks he was 10kg (22lbs). A dogs height is calculated, according to the Dogs Trust, from the tips of his back claws, to the tip of their nose, when they are at full extension with his head up. Arnie, who according to Dogs Trust is big for his age and could potentially double in size as he gets older to 90kg (198lbs), eats a kilo-and-a-half of raw meat every single day, along with fish, eggs and vegetables. Luckily his new owners have an acre of land for him to exercise and burn off his food.
Julie, who encourages others to adopt instead of buy from breeders, praised Dogs Trust for their help.
She said, The Dogs Trust Glasgow team have been fantastic, theyve said theyre there is we need any support which is great. Ive had two calls so far about follow ups to do with behavioural advice and making sure everythings OK. But hes still young and hasnt learned any bad habits. Sandra Lawton, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Glasgow said: We are always overjoyed when a dog finds their perfect someone and we are sure Arnie has gone to a home where he will receive lots of love and care. The team cant wait to get regular updates from Arnies family on all his antics because he is definitely a lap dog at heart and has no idea just how big he is. We cant be sure how big Arnie will grow to but, even now, he is still the biggest puppy Dogs Trust Glasgow has ever re-homed. We still have plenty of dogs of all shapes, sizes and breeds in our care awaiting their forever homes so anyone interested in adopting a rescue dog should pop down to Dogs Trust Glasgow for more information.

CAL performs first transaction of  overseas stocks
Capital Alliance (CAL), recently performed Sri Lankas first ever transaction of overseas stocks, marking a milestone in the annals of the nations corporate history.
Previously, Sri Lankan investors were confined to investing in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). However, following the liberalization of Sri Lankas exchange control regulations in November 2017, individuals and organizations domiciled in Sri Lanka are now permitted to invest in listed securities overseas. As per the revised law, a listed company can invest up to USD 2 million per year; whereas an un-listed company can invest up to USD 500,000 a year and an individual may invest USD 200,000 in their lifetime.
Harinlal Aturupane, CEO, CAL Securities said, CAL has supported investors on the CSE for many years, but the liberalization of foreign exchange laws has really broadened the investment universe for Sri Lankans. Our first international investment was on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in Bangladesh. The country is considered one of the fastest growing economies in the region and is currently a hotspot for investment.
We are all set to open-seamless opportunities for our local investors and support them to make strategic investments in stock markets across the world.
Capital Alliance (CAL) is Sri Lankas leading full service investment bank, and its subsidiary CAL Securities has established itself as a premier stockbroker on the Colombo Stock Exchange over the past two decades. The recent foreign exchange liberalization, coupled with CALs deep expertise in financial investments and fund management, means that the organization is now fully equipped to support investors in Sri Lanka who wish to make foreign investments.
CAL partnered with Lanka Bangla Securities, a licensed stockbroker on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in Bangladesh to conclude this investment.

Cattle theft on the rise in Matale
There is an increase of cattle theft in the Matale district, dairy farmers say.
During the past few months, several cattle thefts have been reported from various parts of the district. Organised gangs are engaging in this racket with the assistance of certain villagers, dairy farmers said.
A few cattle thieves were taken into custody by police in the recent past from Dambulla, Galewela and Sigiriya. Dairy farmers suggest the police take immediate action to strengthen village security committees further. Then, cattle thefts could be minimised, they said.

Chamari outshines Mithali as Lanka Women win last over thriller
Chamari Atapatths 115 helped Sri Lanka Women avoid a whitewash by winning the third ODI by three wickets against Indian Women at the FTZ Sports Complex, Katunayake yesterday.
Chasing 254, Sri Lanka held their nerve to win with a ball to spare.
Indian skipper Mithali Raj and Smriti Mandhana put on 102 for the second wicket after India lost Jemimah Rodrigues for a duck in the first over of the game.
Raj went onto score an unbeaten career best 125 off 145 balls with 15 fours and a six as India finished on 253-5.
Mandhana scored a half century off 62 balls with six fours.
Sri Lankas run chase was spearheaded by skipper Chamari Attapattu who scored a fine 115 off 133 balls with 13 fours and four sixes. Chamari figured in a gutsy 101-run stand with fellow opener Hasini Perera (45) to set the tone for the chase.
Hasini Perera was out for 45 but Sri Lanka kept pace with the required rate and in the final over needed six to win with five wickets in hand. Batting at number nine Kavisha Dilhari hit a four off the penultimate ball to seal the win.
The five-match Twenty20 series between the two teams will begin on Wednesday at the same venue.
Scores:
India women 253-5 in 50 overs (M Raj 125 n.o., S Mandhana 51, Dilhari 1-37)
Sri Lanka women 257-7 in 49.5 overs (C Atapattu 115, Hasini Perera 45, A Sanjeevani 22, J Goswami 2/39, M Joshi 2/43).

Kunu Tax-levy
I refer to the letter from Mohamed Zabran as regards levying Kunu Tax appeared in the Daily News on August 8. The writer himself admits that this is a normal santhosam and therefore why should much attention be drawn on this When a person goes to a hotel, he pays a tip to the waiter who serves him in addition to Service Charge included in the bill which will be shared by all. This stimulates special attention. Payment of Santhosam in addition to payment made during Christmas season should not be described as a bribe. The important fact is that they must not demand a sum (not nominal) and refuse to render services in the absence of this payment.
Colombo Municipal Council should concentrate in the collection of Rates and Taxes on time which it is understood to be in arrears to the tune of millions of rupees.
Introduction of Kunu Tax, collection and action to be taken in the case of defaulters will complicate the matter further.
Department of Inland Revenue cannot introduce this tax. It is the Municipal Council which has the power to introduce this. However, the administrative cost for collection of same will be more and these amounts could also go into arrears like the Rates and Taxes.

Clermont continue hot Top 14 start, Lyon crush Montpellier
Lyon, Saturday: Replacements Yohan Beheregaray and Greig Laidlaw helped Clermont grab a 27-23 victory at Pau on Saturday to make it four straight Top 14 wins to start the season.
Franck Azema's men went into the game full of confidence after scoring 18 tries in their first three matches, but struggled for fluency and had to fight back from a 13-11 half-time deficit.
But Beheregaray scored a 76th-minute try, and former Scotland captain Laidlaw kicked the extras and a penalty shortly after.
It was not magic, but essential, said coach Azema. I'm not saying it looked good, but it's a victory and the positive spiral goes on, and now we have to be honest on Monday in training and know what to work on.
Former New Zealand back Colin Slade starred in the first half for Pau, kicking five points and scoring a 34th-minute try to make it 13-6, but Clermont wing Remy Grosso touched down just before the break.
Spain international winger Charly Malie scored Pau's second try early in the second period, though, with Slade slotting over the conversion to increase their lead to nine points.
But scrum-half Laidlaw was introduced and kicked two penalties as Clermont went into the final five minutes trailing by six.
And Beheregaray crashed over with time running out, and the 32-year-old Laidlaw did the rest to continue Clermont's return to form after a miserable title defence last season which saw them finish ninth.
Elsewhere, reigning champions Castres jumped up to second in the table with a 29-13 win over newly-promoted Grenoble, who have lost four games on the trot.
Hooker Marc-Antoine Rallier scored two tries, while Argentinian fly-half Benjamin Urdapilleta kicked 12 points including a first-half drop goal.
Toulouse are level on points with Castres in third place, after a 30-17 home victory over Racing 92.
The capital-city side threatened a comeback despite slipping 21-3 behind, but two late penalties from Thomas Ramos ended their challenge.
We had fun but we were still not out of sight because we were lax in the 50th minute, Toulouse centre Maxime Mermoz, who scored the opening try, told Canal+ Sport.
Earlier in the day, Lyon took revenge for a heavy defeat in last season's playoffs as they crushed Montpellier 55-13 to make it back-to-back wins.
Lyon scored eight tries to one by the visitors to earn a bonus point and climb to fourth in the table.
The hosts dominated and were repeatedly able to accelerate their play as they avenged their 40-14 loss in May.
We were able to mix up our style of play and produce a match that sets the tone for our new players, said Lyon manager Pierre Mignoni.
We really wanted to see a match like that, to see players sparkling on the pitch. AFP

Commencing complementary food for infants
Breastfeeding has important psychological benefits for both mothers and babies. Babies tend to cry less if they are breastfed and are more emotionally secure. Some studies suggest that breastfeeding may help a child to develop intellectually. Low birth weight babies fed in the first weeks of life perform better on intelligence tests than children who are artificially fed (infant formula).
This week Consultant Community Physician Dr. Hiranya Jayawickrama MBBS, MSc, MD (Community Medicine) attached to the Child Nutrition Unit of the Family Health Bureau of the Health Ministry speaks about the importance breastfeeding after commencement of complementary food for infants.
According to Dr. Jayawickrama, exclusive breastfeeding (only breast milk without any other liquids or food) until the completion of six months is very important. It will facilitate the optimal growth and development of infants. Immediately on completion of the six9th month, complementary food should be commenced in addition to breast milk. Breastfeeding should be continued for two years or more. This will promote the better growth and the development of the infant. Complementary food should be introduced in a thick form which is enough to stay on the spoon. This gives more energy and nutrients to the baby thereby facilitating growth. Adding oil, thick coconut milk, butter etc to prepare food will increase the energy density of the food.
After one week from the introduction of complementary food, food of animal origin can be introduced. Food such as sprats, fish, chicken, meat, liver etc can be introduced. This is essential for healthy growth and brain development. Those food provide easily bio available nutrients such as iron, Zinc, Calcium, Proteins etc, Dr. Jayawickrama said.
Adding legumes such as Dhal, Beans, Chicken peas, Cowpea, Green grams etc and nuts such as Cashew nuts, Pea nuts, Kottamba and seeds such as jack seeds. Those varieties of food contain important nutrients required for the child's growth and therefore should be introduced into the baby's daily diet gradually, she said.
Dark green leaves and orange / yellow coloured fruits and vegetables, egg yolk, liver, milk products etc should be included in the baby's daily diet. Such food will provide vitamin A and other essential nutrients for healthy eyes and good health. Frequency of meals should be gradually increased and variety of food should be included in meals, she added.
****
* Gradually the amount of food given should be increased as the baby is growing rapidly while changing consistency.
* Six plus up to eight months :- Start with 2 - 3 teaspoonfuls per feed increasing gradually to a bit more than half a cup of a 200 ml tea cup at each meal.
* Nine to 11 months :- Four third of a 200 ml tea cup.
* 12 to 23 months :- A bit more than one full 200 ml tea cup at each meal.
* Changing in consistency :- From well mashed food at the beginning to five particles ---> coarse particles ---> finger foods and by the age of one year to adult food.
* Avoid force feeding.
* Increase feeding during an illness and after recovery. This will lead to an early recovery and to maintain normal growth.
****
* Feed infants directly. Assist older children when they feed themselves. Feed older children during family meal times.
* Learn to recognize the baby's hunger satiety cues.
* Keep a fixed place for feeding.
* Keep regular meal times
* Minimize distractions (TV, walking around, showing crows etc) during meals.
* Talk to the baby lovingly while feeding with eye contact.
* Praise the baby when eating well.
* Try different methods of encouragements such as different food combinations, tastes and textures.
****
During and after illness
* Continue to breastfeed without any interruption
* Encourage the baby to drink and eat (with lots of patience)
* Feed small amounts frequently
* Offer nutritious food that the baby likes (his/her favourites)
* Offer a variety of nutrient-rich food
* Add oil, thick coconut milk, butter etc as usual (without reducing).

Cricket Australia to investigate claims England all-rounder was called Osama
Cricket Australia is to investigate claims made by England all-rounder Moeen Ali that an Australian player called him Osama during the 2015 Ashes.
England were hosts for the series and won it 3-2 to regain the Ashes.
Moeen, 31, has made the accusation in his soon to be released autobiography.
Remarks of this nature are unacceptable and have no place in our sport, or in society, said a Cricket Australia spokesperson.
We have a clear set of values and behaviours that comes with representing our country.
We take this matter very seriously, and are following up with the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) as a matter of urgency to seek further clarification around the alleged incident.
In an extract of Moeen's book in The Times, he said: An Australian player had turned to me on the field and said, Take that, Osama'. I could not believe what I had heard.
I remember going really red. I have never been so angry on a cricket field.
I told a couple of the guys what the player had said to me and I think Trevor Bayliss [the England coach] must have raised it with Darren Lehmann, the Australians coach.
Lehmann asked the player, Did you call Moeen Osama' He denied it, saying, No, I said, Take that, you part-timer'.
The alleged slur appears to be a reference to Islamist terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Moeen, who was born in Birmingham, is a Muslim of Pakistani and English heritage.
Moeen claimed the incident happened during the first Test, where he scored 77 runs and took five wickets as England beat Australia by 169 runs at Cardiff. BBC

## Title: IN CYBERWAR, THERE ARE NO RULES

## Date: Monday, September 17, 2018 - 01:00
IN CYBERWAR, THERE ARE NO RULES
In 1984, a science fiction movie starring an up-and-coming Austrian-American actor took the box office by storm. A cybernetic organism is sent back in time to seek out and kill the mother of a great war hero to prevent his subsequent birth. The cyborg scans a phone book page and begins methodically killing all women named Sarah Connor in the Los Angeles area, starting at the top of the list.
If The Terminator were set in todays world, the movie would have ended after four and a half minutes. The correct Sarah Connor would have been identified with nothing but a last name and a zip codeinformation leaked last year in the massive Equifax data breach. The war against the machines would have been over before it started, and no one would have ever noticed. The most frightening thing about cyberwarfare is just how specifically targeted it can be: An enemy can leap national boundaries to strike at a single person, a class of people, or a geographic area.
Nor would a cyborg be necessary today. According to U.S. census data, there are currently 87 people in the United States named Sarah Connor. Many of them probably drive cellular-enabled cars that run outdated firmware, use public unencrypted Wi-Fi, and visit doctors who keep unsecured health care records about patient allergies and current medications on computers running the infamously outdated and vulnerable Windows XP operating system.
These days, warfare is conducted on land, by sea, in the air, across space, and now in the fifth battleground: cyberspace. Yet so far, the U.S. government has fumbled on cybersecurity, outsourcing much of that area of conflict to the private sector in accordance with the Trump administrations most recent National Security Strategyleaving the country exposed to foreign attack.
Those third parties operate under exactly the same incentives as any pharmaceutical company. If a companys service is the treatment of symptoms, preventive medicine is a threat to its business model. Meanwhile, pundits, policymakers, and publishers take as gospel what theyre told by so-called cybersecurity experts who have more social media followers than relevant credentials in the field, which is how hysterical The Hackers Are Coming for Us editorials find their way into otherwise respectable publications.
Cybersecurity
Increased fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding cybersecurity have led to a world where we cannot tell what has and hasnt happened. The nature of cyberwarfare is that it is asymmetric. Single combatants can find and exploit small holes in the massive defenses of countries and country-sized companies. It wont be cutting-edge cyberattacks that cause the much-feared cyber-Pearl Harbor in the United States or elsewhere. Instead, it will likely be mundane strikes against industrial control systems, transportation networks, and health care providersbecause their infrastructure is out of date, poorly maintained, ill-understood, and often unpatchable. Worse will be the invisible manipulation of public opinion and election outcomes using digital tools such as targeted advertising and deep fakesrecordings and videos that can realistically be made via artificial intelligence to sound like any world leader.
The great challenge for military and cybersecurity professionals is that incoming attacks are not predictable, and current strategies for prevention tend to share the flawed assumption that the rules of conventional war extend to cyberspace as well. Cyberwarfare does have rules, but theyre not the ones were used toand a sense of fair play isnt one of them. Moreover, these rules are not intuitive to generals versed in fighting conventional wars.
Thats a problem because cyberwar wont be waged with the informed participation of much of the U.S. technology sector, as the recent revolts at Google over AI contracts with the U.S. Defense Department and at Microsoft over office software contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement demonstrate. That leaves only governments and properly incentivized multinational corporations to set the rules. Neither has yet provided a workable and operational definition of what constitutes a globally recognized act of wara vital first step in seeking to prevent such transgressions.
The closest that the U.S. military has come to such a definition is to say that acts of significant consequence would be examined on a case-by-case basis and could require congressional evaluation. But given how quickly a cyberattack could disable critical infrastructure, expecting Congress to react in time to answer effectively is unrealistic.
In a world where partisan politics have been weaponized, a smart misinformation campaign by a foreign state that targeted only one political party might even be welcomed by other parties so long as there was plausible deniabilityand with cyberattacks, attribution is rarely certain.
There is also a serious risk of collateral damage in cyberoperations. Most militaries understand that they are responsible not only for targeting strikes so that they hit valid targets but also for civilian casualties caused by their actions. Though significant collateral damage assessment occurs prior to the United States authorizing cyberoperations, there is no international agreement requiring other powers to take the same care.
National security at stake
A major cyberattack against the United States in 2014 was a clear example of how civilians can bear the brunt of such operations. Almost all cybersecurity experts and the FBI believe that the Sony Pictures hack that year originated in North Korea. A hostile country hit a U.S. civilian target with the intention of destabilizing a major corporation, and it succeeded. Sonys estimated cleanup costs were more than $100 million. The conventional warfare equivalent might look like the physical destruction of a Texas oil field or an Appalachian coal mine. If such a valuable civilian resource had been intentionally destroyed by a foreign adversary, it would be considered an act of war.
In the near future, attacks like the Sony hack will not be exceptional. There are countless vulnerabilities that could result in mass casualties, and there are no agreed norms or rules to define or punish such crimes. Consider the following examples. Once a week, a European aircraft manufacturer cleans all plane cockpits of Android malware. Pilots can pass malware to the plane from their smartphones when they plug them in, which the plane (while theoretically unaffected by phone-only malware) then passes it on to the next pilot with a smartphone. Planes are already covered in viruses, both virtual and microbial. In such a vulnerable environment, even an unsophisticated hack could wreak havoc. A text message sent to the phone of every in-air pilot giving them a national security warning or rerouting their planes could lead to emergency landings and widespread confusion, with more sophisticated attacks potentially leading to far more serious consequences. - Foreign Policy

Depositor claims of  Rs 7 bn to be settled
Depositors of the defunct Ceylinco entities, Finance and Guarantee Real Estate Company (FGRECL) and Finance and Guarantee Property Developers (FGPDL) are in for a new year bonanza as a consortium of local and foreign investors have come forward to pay back encumbered depositors.
The main investor, Chairman, NLH Holdings (NLH), Don Duminda Mayadunna, told Daily News Business that both the Central Bank and the Supreme Court had given the green light to find an investor for these two companies two years ago.
The Central Bank had proposed that depositors of FGRECL and FGPDL shall be eligible to receive a minimum of 61% and 51% respectively on the principal outstanding on deposits.
We have taken a decision to completely settle the 1,500 depositors claims for Rs. 7 billion by way of offering them cash and sharers. This will start from end of December 2018 and would be completed in less than two years.
He said that their restructure plan has been already given to KPMG and the Ministry of Finance too is backing them.
Our company has previously executed a turn-around strategy under similar circumstances, undertaking a similar approach, objective, and process outlined herein and we already have restructure four of the Ceylinco companies, that included NLH Holdings Pvt Ltd, Nations Building Society Ltd (The only Building Society registered under the National Housing Act) Ceyhomes Credit & Investments Pvt Ltd and Ceylinco Prosperity Pvt Ltd.
After taking over these four companies, 42 out of 60 installments under the agreed repayment amounts have been returned to depositors.
Also, non-voting shares of equivalent value has been issued for the remainder of the deposit value. Plans are underway to list the company so that depositors have the opportunity to realise further value through their ownership in the company equity.
We are a financially stable company and NLH holds an asset base of Rs. 3 billion of which 25% is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and liquid assets.
Over Rs. 1 billion in an additional pool of shareholder capital is available to invest into target mergers and acquisitions.
NLH will be forming a JV with ZRA Holdings Pvt. Ltd, which will be listed shortly to carry out the investment and restructuring of FGRECL and FGPDL.
A minimum of Rs. 500 million will be allocated as new capital infusion into FGRECL and FGPDL to help stabilise the company working capital requirement, rebranding initiatives, help complete ongoing projects, and most importantly, to help instill confidence and sense of security to affected depositors.
He said that the both FGRECL and FGPDL have assets such as lands in key locations, incomplete buildings and also recoveries that have to be made.
We have a business plan that would be implemented to maximize these assets.

Dig the garden together
Whether you have an acre of land or a few pots on a balcony, plant a family garden: Youll all live healthier! Gardening is an easy activity to share and youll harvest benefits along with your fresh vegetables, colorful flowers, and aromatic herbs. Even better, you dont have to wait for your plants to bloom to see those benefits. When parents and kids work together to plant and care for a garden, they can all enjoy these perks.
Physical Activity
Gardening and yard work are moderate-intensity exercises, which we all need every day (for at least 30 minutes). While tending your family garden doesnt require the vigorous activity its still beneficial to your body. Gardening incorporates fine-motor skill strengthening and stretching.
Lower Stress, Better Mood
Gardening is excellent stress relief for a combination of fascinating reasons: exposure to fresh air and sunlight, relaxing and repetitive tasks, and even contact with harmless bacteria in the soil that helps release serotonin in the brain.
Outdoor Time
Children are prone to spending a lot of time indoors, which can negatively affect their behavior and health. A family garden gets them outside enjoying and experiencing the natural world.
Better Sleep
All of the above (physical activity, reduced stress, being outside) can contribute to more and better sleep for everyone. And better sleep, in turn, can improve kids behavior and performance at school.
Healthier Eating
Kids who grow vegetables eat vegetablesor at least, they are more willing to taste unfamiliar veggies, which is the first step to incorporating those new flavours into their diet.
Family Time
Planning, sowing, and tending a family garden offers physical activity with a purpose shared by everyone. It helps teach kids responsibility and gives them a sense of accomplishment. It gives all of you a project to work onand enjoytogether, which reinforces your family bond.
Family Garden Chores for Kids
Kids can do a lot of the work for your family garden, either independently or alongside an adult. While you dont want them to burn out on tedious tasks like weeding, taking responsibility is part of what makes a family garden meaningful. Set a goal, such as clearing one small, designated area or working for 15 minutes then do something else.

Five-time Asia Cup champs Sri Lanka on the brink of exit
Do or die contest against Afghanistan today
DUBAI, Sunday: Eight months ago in January Sri Lanka suffered their heaviest ODI defeat at the hands of Bangladesh by 163 runs at Dhaka and went onto win the Tri-Nation Series.
Sri Lanka were then led by Dinesh Chandimal who unfortunately had to miss the ongoing Asia Cup with a hand injury.
Today Angelo Mathews will be hoping for a similar turnaround from his beleaguered team when they take on high riding Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi in a contest the Lankan skipper termed as a do or die game for them.
On Sunday in their Asia Cup curtain-raiser Sri Lanka suffered a humiliating 137 runs defeat at the hands of Bangladesh and the five times champions face an early exit from the tournament unless they beat Afghanistan by a big margin.
We are definitely under pressure. We have got one life-line. It is a do or die game for us. Looking forward for it and it is a quick turnaround. We have got one day training and next day we are travelling to Abu Dhabi, said Mathews.
We have to click in all three departments. We cannot let go off one department as it could hurt us badly. Sri Lanka were badly let down in their fielding and batting departments that contributed to their loss to Bangladesh. Sri Lanka batting coach Thilan Samaraweera put down the batting failure to lack of options and clarity when under pressure.
We dont lack skill. We are improving. Against South Africa the last three matches was a good improvement, but here again everything is back to square one, said Samaraweera.
We dont start off competitions well and that has been evident in the last seven months. If you take the tour to Bangladesh, we lost the first two games. Then against South Africa in the first ODI we lost something like five wickets for 30 runs. We lost 60 for six yesterday.
When they are under pressure, they lack options and clarity. The decision making becomes poor and they lack confidence. They were too scared to take decisions and they played with self doubt. We need to make their mental aspect right, he said.
Mathews himself was guilty of starting the fielding rot when he floored a catch offered by Mohammad Mithun at mid-on before he had scored. Mithun was also given another relief at 2 when Amila Aponso made a similar spill at long leg but fortunately it was signalled a waist high no-ball. Lasith Malinga was the bowler on both occasions.
Worse was to follow when Mushfiqur Rahim was let off at 10 by Dilruwan Perera at square leg and at 85  a return catch to Dhananjaya de Silva.
Both batsmen capitalised on these fielding lapses and made Sri Lanka pay dearly for it. From two down for one run they took the total to 134. From there onwards Bangladesh gained the ascedancy to pile up a competitive total of 261.
Mithun made 63 but the most damaging knock came from Mushfiqur who hit a career best 144. The innings of the former Bangladesh skipper overshadowed the fine spells of bowling produced by Malinga who ended up with figures of 4 for 23 in 10 overs.
The 35-year-old speedster returning to the international stage after one year bowled with the venom that had made him one of the most feared fast bowlers in one-day cricket. From Sri Lankas view point it was the only positive that came out of the match for them.
The balance of the side also left much to be desired leaving Sri Lanka with one specialist batsman short.
We had to change our combination looking back at the South Africa series. After Danushkas (Gunathilaka) and (Dinesh) Chandimals injuries we had to change a few things, said Mathews.
We went one batsman short as Dilruwan (Perera) can also bat. But the bulk of the batting has to be done by the top order and we let the team down. Unfortunately we made a few bad decisions while batting, he said.
Dilruwan more of a Test player than in the one-day format came as a replacement off spinner for Akila Dananjaya who was not available for the first game. Dilruwan however did not fit the bill as he spilled a vital catch and conceded 25 runs in his three overs without taking a wicket although he contributed with 29 which was the highest score made by a Lankan batsman.
We knew that there were a couple of guys whom we had to be aware of. We knew that when we made the decision, said Mathews. Obviously the fast bowlers are putting a lot of effort. We went in for some experience and when you are trying to balance the side you need both experience and youth. It didnt go our way. Dilruwan is playing a game after a long time. You have to make less mistakes moving forward.
Gambling with middle-aged cricketers Sri Lanka paid a heavy price on the field.
It is just that we are not consistent. We have one brilliant day and one extremely poor day. That cannot happen in a tournament. If you lose one game you are under a lot of pressure, said Mathews.
We have let the opposition off the hook. We had them three for three and then with the next two batsmen having scored less than ten runs we dropped them. They really cashed in. But as I keep saying, 260 we take any day and the batters let us down.
Afghanistan return to the tournament as a full member having been beaten to the sole qualifiers spot by the UAE in the 2016 T20 edition of the Asia Cup.
The odds of them lifting the trophy are still at some distance, but they are far from rank outsiders this time round. The audacity and pluck they showed in 2014 is now an assured, even arrogant confidence.
In March, at the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, they booked a berth at the diminished Cricket World Cup 2019 ahead of two other full members  Zimbabwe and Ireland.
The last time Sri Lanka and Afghanistan met in an ODI was in the 2015 World Cup where the minnows gave the Lions a fright before losing by four wickets. Chasing 233 to win Sri Lanka were 18-3 before recovering to win in the 49th over.

Fake news: Democracy in danger
In 2014, at the World Economic Forum, the rapid spread of misinformation online was considered the 10th top trend in terms of global significance.
Fake accounts on social media (i.e. those which either do not have a human user behind them, or are run by a human who pretends to be someone else) are the foot soldiers in this form of warfare. They can be used to amplify messaging and force hashtags into the trending lists. On occasion, they can be used to intimidate or block other users.
The online falsehoods and false accounts detailed above can be used in short-term and long-term ways. Short-term uses focus on a specific event, such as a vote, demonstration, natural disaster or security incident, and attempt to achieve an effect by the massive and sudden deployment of false stories or accounts.
Longer-term operations typically focus on promoting or attacking a particular point of view. This can range from partisan and one-sided coverage, through hate speech, and into incitement to violence. In extreme cases, online hate speech can be a contributing factor in individuals decision to commit terrorist acts. This was the case of British citizen Darren Osborne, who drove a van into a crowd outside a North London mosque in 2017, and who was found by a judge to have been exposed to racists and anti-Islam ideology via Twitter.
For Sri Lanka, election campaigns and tensions between different social, religious, political, economic and ethnic groups are likely to be the main targets of any such attempts, as the campaigns tend to gradually inflame tensions and hollow out the political centre at the expense of the fringes. Relations with neighbouring countries can also be the focus of targeted disinformation or influence campaigns.
We are highly susceptible to organised and deliberate disinformation campaigns trying to interfere with democratic processes, destabilise society and undermine institutions. We are a small and multiracial society that can be easily overwhelmed by a larger adversary taking advantage of our societal fault lines.
An aggressor could attempt to peel off one particular ethnic group or religion, using social media and disinformation to appeal (as the case may be) to deeply ingrained historical, cultural issues, setting off one group against others, or even against the government. Data-driven political consultancies (whose methods may involve disinformation) appear to have been engaged by political parties, as well as individual candidates.
A number of responses are needed to deal with this challenge. In all responses, legislation should be the last resort. As far as possible, information, even false information, should remain outside the purview of government. This is essential for the health of democracy.
Amplification networks are best dealt with by the social platforms. Governments should therefore engage with platforms, especially Facebook and Twitter, to find a means by which networks of false, automated or inauthentic accounts, can quickly be shut down.
It is therefore important to educate internet users in the basic principles of digital awareness and hygiene, and to work with the platforms on solutions, rather than against them. Essential skills such as how to identify a bot or a troll can be taught without recourse to sophisticated software or analytical techniques. Such skills are vital for normal users, and particularly for media outlets, which can otherwise amplify fraudulent accounts.
Online insertion points are best dealt with by civil society, researchers and the platforms, working in combination. Researchers can identify websites or social media accounts which repeatedly post information which is demonstrably false; these can then be flagged to the platforms. Given the sheer size of the platforms, it is not practical for them to monitor their content unaided.
Many countries have called for a tough stance to be taken against fake news, including the US, UK and Germany, or to put in place more effective measures to counter fake news. Germany, for example, is considering a draft law that will require social networks, websites, including Facebook, to remove fake news which amounts to illegal content from their platforms. So, make the network itself responsible. Social networks which fail to comply with such a request could face very stiff fines. In Germany, it is being suggested 50 million  that is a lot of money  under the draft legislation.
****
Successful falsehoods tend to have four components
* They have an instant emotional appeal;
* They claim authority by referring to an unimpeachable source;
* They have an insertion point into the information space; and
* They then have an amplification network which passes them on to a broader public. Stories which lack one or more of these elements tend to fail.
****
Combat disinformation
In some countries, the best anti-disinformation websites and portals are run by citizens, journalists, or a coalition of both. In many instances, it is the citizenry and journalists (as well as media experts, branding experts, and marketing consultants) who are better placed to act, and to act quickly, to combat disinformation. Ukraines Stopfake.org, which positions itself as public service journalism, is a crowd sourced journalism project that launched in 2014 to combat fake news spreading across the Internet during Ukraines crisis in Crimea. The widely-respected site provides fact checking, verifies information, and refutes incorrect reports and propaganda about events in Crimea, which are widely believed to originate from Russia. In Indonesia, the volunteer run Turn Back Hoax, which has been online since 2016, has grown into an important resource for Indonesians to check the veracity of memes and fake stories.
****
Key developments
* First, the number of platforms and channels by which falsehood can be spread has increased radically. On Facebook alone, the number of active monthly users grew from 100 million in Q3, 2008, to over 2 billion in Q4, 2017.
* Second, the relatively low cost of creating an online platform has made it far easier for those who spread falsehoods to look like traditional reporting outlets, without adhering to traditional editorial standards.
* Third, social media have allowed peer-to-peer interactions on an unprecedented scale, allowing malicious actors to bypass traditional editorial verification and spread their falsehoods (literally) unchecked.
* Fourth, the borderless nature of the internet has made it much easier for foreign actors to impersonate internet users in the target country, and thus to infiltrate target communities.
* Fifth, modern editorial techniques have made it progressively easier for malicious actors to create false or misleading content, ranging from photo shopped images to doctored videos which can make a speaker appear to say something they did not.
****
Fact-checking groups
Governments should not seek direct involvement in this process; however, they have a valuable role to play in bringing the tech and analytical communities together to facilitate cooperation. The appearance of authority is best countered by fact-checking groups, which have proliferated in recent years. These have the expertise to expose the various techniques of falsehood, and the reputation to make their work more credible. Many fact-checking and verification operations now exist, such as First Draft, Snopes and Politifact in the U.S., MalditoBulo in Spain, Les Dcodeurs of Le Monde in France, the Bellingcat group, the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab and numerous units within major broadcasters such as the BBC.

Florence dumps epic amounts of rain fall
US: Authorities on Saturday warned residents displaced by a killer hurricane that its devastation was far from over, as Florence dumped epic amounts of rainfall across the southeastern United States, bringing catastrophic flooding and up to 13 deaths.
Most of the fatalities occurred in North Carolina, where officials confirmed eight victims. They included three who died due to flash flooding and swift water on roadways, the Duplin County Sheriffs Office reported.
A woman and her baby were among the first casualties, when a tree fell on their house, contributing to a death toll that US media said had reached 13 -- 10 in North Carolina and three in South Carolina, according to CNN.
Florence made landfall Friday as a Category 1 hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, even as it continued to wreak havoc along the East Coast, downing trees and power lines and forcing 20,000 people to flee to shelters.
On Saturday some residents tried to return home, driving through flooded highways and armed with chainsaws to clear fallen pine trees that covered the road.
North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned against such behavior as roads became increasingly dangerous.
In a separate briefing, Steve Goldstein of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said some areas have already received two feet of rain and could expect up to 20 inches more as the system moved slowly, nearly stationary over eastern North Carolina.
In New Bern, a riverfront city near the North Carolina coast that saw storm surges of up to 10 feet (three meters), residents took stock of the damage after flood waters began receding and authorities rescued hundreds of people who had been stranded.
Charles Rucker, a retired teacher, had only spent five nights in his newly-purchased house, built in 1830, when Florence struck.
It was like a bullet train coming through the living room. Nothing I ever experienced before, I was truly scared, he told AFP. In one piece of good news, authorities said 16 wild ponies on hurricane-struck Ocracoke Island, located off the North Carolina coast, were safe.
South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster on Saturday announced the death of a 61-year-old woman who died when her car hit a downed tree on a highway.
CNN also reported a man and a woman died in South Carolinas Horry County due to carbon monoxide poisoning.
President Donald Trump tweeted late Saturday that five deaths have been recorded thus far, and expressed sympathy to the victims families.
The White House said Trump would visit hurricane-hit areas next week once it is determined his travel will not disrupt any rescue or recovery efforts. More than 800,000 customers in North Carolina were without power and 21,000 people were being housed in 157 shelters across the state. Tornadoes remain a threat, with the NHC saying that a few tornadoes are possible in southeastern North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina. About 1.7 million people in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia are under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders, and millions of others live in areas likely to be affected by the storm.
In South Carolinas Myrtle Beach, Victor Shamah, the owner of The Bowery bar, decided to open because people wanted to eat, they didnt have any place to eat. They wanted a drink. - AFP

Harrison preserves leaders Leeds unbeaten run
LONDON, Saturday: Jack Harrison scored a late equaliser as Championship leaders Leeds United maintained their unbeaten start to the English second-tier season with a gruelling 1-1 draw away to Millwall on Saturday.
Jed Wallace gave south London side Millwall the lead 10 minutes into the second half with an effort that went in off the woodwork at the New Den after he got on the end of a flick-on from Jake Cooper.
But Harrison, on loan from Premier League champions Manchester City, equalised with a low shot into the bottom corner with a minute left on the clock.
Millwall could still have snatched victory but a stoppage-time header from Tom Elliott hit the inside of the post without crossing the line.
Middlesbrough kicked off the day in second place but suffered their first defeat of the season when going down 1-0 away to Norwich City, with Finlands Teemu Pukki scoring the only goal of the game in the 58th minute at Carrow Road.
It was the first goal Boro had conceded in 561 minutes of league football.
Brentford capitalised on their defeat to move up into second with a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Wigan.
Neal Maupay scored his sixth goal in as many games when he got on the end of Said Benrahmas cross in the 24th minute.
Wigans Sam Morsy was sent off in the 58th minute at Griffin Park following a clash of heads with Yoann Barbet, who played a key role in west London club Brentfords second goal when his shot was blocked on the line before Maupay doubled his and the Bees tally by slamming home the rebound in the 63rd minute. Bristol City went third, with Marley Watkinss header nine minutes from time securing a 1-0 win over Sheffield United at Ashton Gate. Elsewhere, Derby County manager Frank Lampard was sent to the stands as the Rams three-game winning run ended with a 1-0 defeat away to Rotherham. Derbys Tom Lawrence was sent off for a foul on Richard Towell in the 58th minute and five minutes later the Millers made their man advantage count when Ryan Manning scored from the penalty spot after Kyle Vassell was ruled to have been fouled.
Former Chelsea and England midfielder Lampard then saw red as his frustrations boiled over at New York Stadium.
Swansea went sixth after a goalless draw at home to Nottingham Forest, while QPR made it three wins in a row as they won 2-1 at Bolton, who avoided administration earlier this week. Luke Freeman and Eberechi Eze scored for Rangers before Josh Magennis pulled a goal back for Bolton.
In the late kick-off, Conor Hourihanes well-struck free-kick deep into stoppage time saw Aston Villa to a 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers, who had led through a goal from Bradley Dack.  AFP

Hong Kong find Pakistanis quite a handful
DUBAI, Sunday: Off-spinner Shadab Khan with a double-wicket over and fast bowler Usman Khan with a triple-wicket over made short work of the Hong Kong batting as Pakistan opened their Asia Cup campaign with a facile  wicket win at the Dubai Sports City Stadium on Sunday.
Winning the toss and batting first Hong Kong batters found the Pakistan bowlers quite a handful as they were bundled out for 116 at the start of the 38th over well before the dinner break.
A half century stand between Kinshit Shah (26) and Aizaz Khan (27) was the only redeeming feature of the Hong Kong batting.
In the seven overs before the interval Pakistan openers Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq knocked off 35 off those runs.
Fakhar lost his wicket for 24 after resumption bottom edging a catch behind the wicket and Babar Azam also followed in similar fashion after scoring a fluent 33, but only after becoming the joint second fastest to get to 2000 runs in ODI cricket playing in his 45th innings. Imam carried on nonchalantly at the other end completing a fine half century off 69 balls with three fours and a six as Pakistan completed victory with Shoaib Malik hitting the winning boundary.
Usman Khan took the man of the match award.

Impressive Chelsea, Liverpool maintain lead over chasing Man City
LONDON, Saturday: Chelsea and Liverpool continued to throw down the gauntlet to Premier League champions Manchester City as all three were victorious on their return to action on Saturday.
Liverpool showed their credentials in targeting a first title since 1990, and such was the Reds dominance in their 2-1 win at Tottenham, the scoreline did not do Jurgen Klopps men justice.
Chelsea also made it five wins from as many games under Maurizio Sarri thanks to the brilliance of Eden Hazard, who scored a hat-trick in a convincing 4-1 win over Cardiff to edge ahead of Liverpool on goal difference.
City remain just two points back, though, and looked back to their best in tearing apart Fulham 3-0 thanks to goals from Leroy Sane, David Silva and Raheem Sterling.
Manchester United and Arsenal stay six points off the top after 2-1 wins at Watford and Newcastle respectively.
Liverpools first win away at Tottenham in four attempts for Klopp was another sign of the progress made under the German, particularly as they suffered a 4-1 thrashing at Wembley last season.
Nobody will play the perfect season. Its still early, five games, fantastic we won all five and improved. I like that development, said Klopp.
Now we have to prove that and do it again and again.
Spurs paid a heavy price for the absence of captain Hugo Lloris through injury as stand-in goalkeeper Michel Vorm flapped at a corner six minutes before the break and Georginio Wijnaldum looped a header over the line before Vorm could scramble clear.
Roberto Firmino tapped home a second nine minutes into the second half and Liverpool should have added to their lead as Sadio Mane and Naby Keita were denied by Vorm.
However, the visitors had to see out a nervy final few seconds when Erik Lamela skilfully volleyed home from a narrow angle and Son Heung-min had a penalty appeal waved away with the final attack of the game.
SANE RETURNS IN STYLE
City and Chelsea await in Liverpools next three league games and secured comfortable home victories to boost their own title chances.
Pep Guardiola started Leroy Sane for the first time this campaign and last seasons Premier League Young Player of the Year looked more like his old self as Fulham were put to the sword.
Sane tapped home Fernandinhos inviting cross inside two minutes before Silva smashed his 50th Premier League goal and Sterling completed the rout.
In the period he didnt play, we never doubted Leroys quality, said Guardiola. He is 22 and this little bit of up and down can sometimes happen at this age. But Im delighted with his performance, a big compliment to him.
HAZARDS HAT-TRICK
Sarri is still to taste anything but victory in English football, but had a scare early on at home to Cardiff when Sol Bamba put the visitors in front at Stamford Bridge.
However, Cardiffs failure to significantly strengthen over the summer means they are liable to being outclassed at this level and were undone by the brilliance of Hazard.
I thought that Hazard was one of the best players in Europe. But now I change my mind because maybe he is the best, said Sarri.
The Belgian scored twice in seven minutes to send Chelsea in ahead at half-time and completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot before Willian added a fourth.
United further eased the pressure on Jose Mourinho by ending Watfords 100 percent record at Vicarage Road.
Two goals in three first-half minutes from Romelu Lukaku and Chris Smalling put the visitors in command.
But they had to withstand some late pressure after Andre Gray halved their advantage and Nemanja Matic saw a late red card.
In the second half we decreased our intensity, then the goal happened, then the game is open, said Mourinho.
I think this last Lukaku tackle as a right-back shows everything. I think he is the image of the team, a team that played very well in long periods in the first half.
Mesut Ozil quietened his critics with his first Arsenal goal since February at St James Park as the Gunners ground out a third straight win. Bournemouth moved up to fifth with an impressive 4-2 victory over 10-man Leicester with Ryan Fraser scoring twice.
And Wilfried Zaha underlined his importance to Crystal Palace with the only goal on his return from injury in a 1-0 win at Huddersfield.

Construction cost of WPC building
JVP calls for Auditor Generals intervention
The JVP has made a written submission to the Auditor General requesting to intervene and audit the expenditure for the newly constructed Western Provincial Council building amounting to over Rs.7000 million.
The JVP has also requested the Auditor General to probe the spending of public money on various posts in the Provincial Councils which the JVP claims are not legitimately recognised.
JVP Councillor Lakshman Nipuna Arachchi told the media yesterday that his party has made written submissions to the Auditor General over the twin matters. Nipuna Arachchi said the estimated cost for the building and relevant facilities was Rs.7,029 million and already Rs.5,854 million has been spent but the expenditure far exceeds the actual work completed.
The building is beautiful on the outside, hollow on the inside. Essentials such as building maintenance, vehicle parking facilities, audio systems, seating facilities, canteens, office equipment and various other facilities are yet to be completed but they have only Rs.1200 left, the Councillor charged.
Nipuna Arachchi also questioned the decision to import chairs for the Western Provincial Council (WPC) at an exorbitant cost of Rs.640,000 per chair and the alleged attempt to spend Rs.15 million on a new chamber door.
The JVP member thanked the Western Province Governor for cancelling the acquisition of Chairs at such a high cost and also the media, politicians and others who exposed such matters in the public domain.
He also charged that for the installation of a camera system and sound system, a Tender has been awarded for Rs.109 million although the actual cost should be Rs.72 million. Also, the Councillor said that spending public money on posts such as Leader of the House, Chief Government Whip, Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip was illegal as they are not legitimately recognised.
The JVP member said the WPCs term was slated to end in seven months time and charged that some powerful politicians were trying to embezzle public funds to spend for their re-election bid to the WPC at the next polls.

LOST AMONG RUINED CASTLES
Every year I visit Wales and end up at the Dylan Thomas Centre in Upland Swansea much to my brother's annoyance. For me Thomas is as great a writer as Shakespeare and Welsh are rightfully very proud of him.
Beside Thomas, Welsh are very conscious of their heritage hidden among the ruined castles. Why it never occurred me to go on a rampage discovering some, remain a mystery and this time when I did, I was amazed at their rich civilization written on stone, some still standing erect and steady as a witness to their history.
HISTORY BEHIND THE CASTLES
What did I know about them
Almost nothing: not until I decided to explore one from another with limited time left for me to fly back. Believe me, I was stunned to learn that Wales is full of castles than any other country in the world. This fact alone is ample proof to their rich heritage, especially in line of royalty and great leaders. Wales is an area of land mostly mountainous, fought over by rebels for ten centuries to protect their leaders who dwelled in them. Looking deeper, they are visible remnants of ancient history. Wales is unique in having so many and also preserving their great splendor, beauty and charm in such architectural depths that enhance history-search by scholars, visitors and tourists. No surprise that kings and knights, political and religious leaders flexed their muscles to take control of Wales at different eras and time in history. They certainly would have had architects of high caliber who left their skilled mark on these buildings for us to judge them against the high-tech skyscrapers or revolving towers of today.
What a world.
How it has changed ; amazing and unbelievable.
STOOD THE TEST OF TIME
The true period of building castles covered the years between Norman conquest of the 11th century and the Wars of Roses in the mid-15th century. The first people to experience the resistance of the Wales and discover and the necessity for a system of fortress and communication were the Romans under Scapula who invaded Wales in A.D. 49. As the Roman rule in Britain came to an end, the Saxons were defeated by Arthur to be followed by the Orthodox Christianity brought to England isolating Wales.
Wales stabilized its border in 757 as Danish attacked Britain began, in 851. Began the significant era with the entry of the royals with the Normans under Fitzosbern to South Wales in 160 as William the Conqueror dies in France to be succeeded by William 11. As Henry I comes to the throne of England and Norman domination spreads when Norman bishops replace Welsh in St. David's. Welsh unite to defeat Henry's army but is divided again. In 1189 Richard 1 (Lionheart) is the beginning of the Third Crusade. As Llyelyn attacks border areas, Edward invades Wales and the first Edwardian castles spring up in Wales.
Henry IV is unable to quell Wales rebellion when Sir Henry Percy is killed as rebels hold most of Wales while the French support Wales. With the passing of years, the Wars of the Roses began with Welsh embroiled between but holding on steadily with many kings on throne one after the other keeping Wales out of their reach until in 1642 when Wales support Royalist cause in Civil War.
All this history is wrought in their castles as a testimony to a proud country who passed down the legends what meet our eyes today.
These castles are located to their nearest town or village and their country. Many castles were special for visitors to visit in large numbers who has to be mindful that they are the remains fragmented and isolated. Many are pre-Roman or Roman in origin but are devoid of titles not recognized as castles but equally important to the Welsh history. Every castle I visited had its own special identity, all written on rock and fading wood. Many resembled churches but nowhere near places. Some had vague inscriptions in Welsh. These castles are not monuments in stone as each has a story to tell why it stands tall even today though much literature is not available and some I acquired from a nearly library.
BEAUMARIS CASTLE at Anglessey is on low flat land is the towering grandeur the opportunity to the Master of King's Works the most attractive design which is a classical example of an extremely strong concentric castle. There is a strong balance and proportion with six towers and two powerful gate walls defended by the towering fifteen-foot- thick walls. On appearance, it looks like a fortress. Beaumaris Castle would have daunted even the most unimaginable native attackers. The castle could hold a large garrison. The striking chapel that is vaulted is on the east side.
There were few questions the Welsh failed to understand when it was an anticlimax the Beaumaris castle's formidable defenses were not put to test. May be potential attackers realized they would never succeed and perhaps the castle need never have been built at all. But when the castle was garrisoned for Charles 1, it was held by the Royalists until 1646.
CONWY CASTLE Full of English history, Conwy castle influenced Shakespeare's plays and his characters arose from within its portals especially beginning with the end of Richard 11's reign. I cannot comprehend as to why the Conwy castle had to be in Wales instead of in England. Early in the War of Roses an event occurred which the Welsh took much pleasure in remembering, even though the slain soldier was Welsh. Conwy was the held by Yorkists and facing a probable attack by Lancastrian forces.
For 200 years Conwy Castle's history is undistinguished by events and became gradually more and more dilapidated. So, in 1628 it was sold for a mere  100 to Viscount Conwy and this was at a time when many distinguished men were born there. One was John Williams. The Archbishop of York who was much admired by Charles 1.

Major relief for people, despite immense debt burden - PM
Despite various economic difficulties and constraints, the government has been able to steer the country forward by providing extensive relief measures to the people.
The next step envisaged by the government is to increase foreign exchange earnings by developing industries and enterprises and totally rid the country of its immense debt burden, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after distributing Samurdhi relief among 5,400 families at the Edward Playground, Matale on September 15.
Last week, another 3,000 families received Samurdhi relief at a meeting presided by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Prime Minister said during the last three years the Unity Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena has doubled the amount of monetary relief granted to Samrudhi recipients and offered the Samurdhi entitlement to a large number of new families.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said since 1995, new families had not been included in the Samurdhi benefit scheme.
In 1995, they were able to grant Samurdhi relief because the UNP government had built a strong economy. Since 1977, the garment industry, tourism and industrial zone projects recorded a massive development. As a result, the Treasury had enough funds to pay the Samurdhi relief under the UNP government, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said when they took over the government in 2015, the country was englifed in an enormous debt.
The countrys income was insufficient to even to pay back interest on loans. The former President called a Presidential election two yeas before schedule because he feared the imminent economic crash facing the government, the Prime Minister said.
He said at the last election they took the responsibility of mending the countrys economy and they had kept that promise during the last three years.
However, they could not achieve the expected targets in 2017 because they had to contend with floods in the South,the collapse of the Meetotamulla garbage mountain and several other national calamities. The price of coconuts sky-rocketed in the local market. The people blamed the government for these unexpected calamites and it faced defeat at the Local Government elections, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Allthough some clamoured for a postponement of local elections, they did not do so because they valued and protected democratic rights of the people, he said.
The Prime Minister said despite the electoral setback, he was confident of saving the country through the pragmatic steps taken by the government.
In 2019, our foreign debt will stand at 4,000 million dollars. Thereafter, they would be able to resolve this situation and more forward, the Prime Minister said.

The lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir construction work has been idling for years. A 3.6-km long dam over the Bogoda village near Thantrimale has to be built to complete the project. Rs. 13,500 million has been spent on the project to date. The reservoir will contain 169,440 acre-feet of water submerging 3,500 hectares.
Reportedly, lack of funds is the main reason for the delay. Sources said Rs. 55 million was allocated to survey lands but it is incomplete yet. Nearly 500 families has to evacuate for the project.
Tisawewa, Nuwarawewa, Mahakanadarawa, Pawatkulama and Akithamurupu tanks are at the upper and lower river basins.
Project Director Engineer T.P. Alwis said a meeting was held to discuss the delayed work of the project led by the Prime Minister and all stakeholders participated in it. The Chinese CAMSE Engineering Company completed the Yanoya Reservoir headwork construction and now they carry out the work of the 20-km long left bank canal construction and they will likely to get the lower Malwathu oya reservoir construction work as well.
The project will supply water for cultivating around 36,000 acres in Anuradhapura and Mannar. Five million cubic meters of drinking water will be supplied annually through the project. It will supply 4.68 megawatts to the national and resolve flood issue in the districts.

Marina in Marawila to commence this year
A consortium of Chinese, German and Sri Lankan investors would start building Sri Lankas first Marina in Marawila by the end of the year.
According to The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.) founder and Chief Executive Officer of A.G.S.E.P. Dietmar Doering it would be a mixed development project including a 200 room hotel, two condominium towers of 23 floors each providing 308 apartments and the marina.
The total investment for the project would be in the excess of US$ 150 million. Two German investors, China Overseas Economy Cooperation General Company and AGSEP are the main investors for this mixed development project. The KPMG has conducted the feasibility study for the project which is now forwarded for approvals.
He said that their research in Sri Lanka has found out that one of the international marina is a great vacuum for the country and this why they came up to fill this void. Though Sri Lanka is a much sought after by tourists and despite having 1,300 Km of coastal line it does not have a single marina. In contrast Croatia which has 650 KM of coastal line has 60 marinas.
For the first time in Sri Lanka we also hope to commence special round cruise tours around Sri Lanka linking all major harbours where passengers could embark and disembark.
In addition we will also call for ship repairing companies and also offer Dry dock facilities under this project. Attracting permanent foreign residence to occupy our apartments too is another project under this development.
Consultant of the project, Tissa Jayaweera said that under the Prot City Development project in Colombo, a marina is proposed but it would be ready in 2021. Our plan is to have the Marina Bay Marawila by end 2020.
The proposed Marina would have facilities to dock 100 yachts and also two cruise boats up to 80 passengers. With the two apartments and the hotel, we expect many other related businesses also coming up and it will help to generate an annual gross income of in the excess of US$ 400 mn and provide over 500 direct employment.

MSMEs: A concept in poverty alleviation
Lack of formal employment has raised the number of people, mainly the poor, relying on informal activities such as self-employment and micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs).
The International Labour Organization has also rationalised the need for the development of MSMEs for poverty alleviation and economic and social empowerment of the poor. Therefore, promoting MSMEs is a strategy used in developing economies in poverty alleviation and economic and social empowerment programmes as it represents a promising source of productive employment, especially for the lowest income groups. Further, micro, small and medium enterprises represent a major source of employment and income in many countries of the Third World and detailed surveys in a number of countries suggest that as many as a quarter of all people of working age are engaged in MSME activities.
Similarly, MSMEs are important in bringing economic transition effectively using the skill and the talent of people without the necessity for high-level training, a large amount of capital or sophisticated technology and these MSMEs are recognised as a real engine of economic growth and technological progress. This makes MSMEs a major area of concern for government and non-governmental organisations with an objective of unemployment reduction, income generation, equitable income distribution, import substitution, innovation and poverty alleviation.
Apart from contributing to the national income, MSMEs are instruments of inclusive growth, touching the lives of the most vulnerable and the most marginalised groups. For many families, it is the only source of livelihood. For others, it supplements family income. Thus, instead of taking a welfare approach, this sector seeks to empower people to break the cycle of poverty and deprivation. It focuses on peoples skills and energy.
In India, The MSME sector is the largest source of employment after agriculture and this sector enables many of men, women and children living in slums, upcoming towns, remote villages and isolated hamlets to use indigenous knowledge, cultural wisdom and entrepreneurial skills for the sustenance of their lives and livelihoods.
Confirming that, the International Labour Organization also views the MSME sector as an essential catalyst for job creation, unemployment reduction and social progress, since it takes the lion share of the fast-growing labour force across the world, comprising 48 percent in North Africa, 51 percent in Latin America, 65 percent in Asia, and 72 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa.
There is no universal definition for MSMEs. However, there is some agreement on the general characteristics of these enterprises practised in developing countries. According to the International Labour Organization, MSMEs are small scale, use low level of technology, have low access to credit and lack managerial capacity. Further, a low level of productivity and income, a tendency to operate in the informal sector, fewer linkages with the modern economy and non-compliance with government registration procedures are other features.
These enterprises can be considered a heterogeneous group. Generally, micro enterprises are artisan-based, use local skills and resources, and sell their products locally. These enterprises involve lower levels of investment in machinery and provide largely part-time employment. Small and medium enterprises use power-driven machines and possess some technological sophistication.
On the other hand, the majority of micro and small enterprises consist of one person working alone. Self-employment is thus a central element in this sector. With most enterprises operating as single-person undertakings, it is not surprising that the largest employment category is working proprietors, a group that comprises more than half the MSME workforce in most countries. When unpaid family members are added, the numbers reach three-fourths of the workers in most places. Further, it is a common perception that micro and small enterprises are primarily vendors and small traders. There is truth in this perception, since in several countries the majority of enterprises are engaged in commerce. It is important to recognise, however, that, in all countries, small manufacturing activities are also an important component of the MSME sector.
Employment in MSMEs expands as a result of new enterprises springing up and also through expansion of existing enterprises. Some projects aim to promote new business by addressing the constraints that make it difficult for people to establish new enterprises. Other projects provide assistance aimed at countering the forces that cause existing enterprises to fail, while still others seek to help existing businesses improve their performance and expand.
The dimensions and determinants of MSMEs growth are vast and complex. Factors influencing an enterprises performance can be grouped into several categories, namely, demographic (gender, marital status, etc.), human capital (whether the entrepreneur has had training, the level of education, etc.), family ties (whether the enterprise is a family business or traditional, whether family members work in the business, etc.) and enterprise-related factors (amount of first loan, size of labour force, method of investment, receipt of a grant, type of enterprise, source of micro-finance, etc.).
MSMEs that began operation with higher initial investment are more likely to grow than their counterparts that started operation with relatively smaller initial investment. Therefore, as the initial investment size of MSMEs increases, the probability of moving forward from being survival MSMEs increases. Management-related factors such as maintenance of accounts, managing separate funds for business and household expenses, and registration of business also influence the success or failure of an enterprise. Further, the success of entrepreneurial businesses is limited by the availability and quality of five fundamental ingredients: (i) innovation, (ii) entrepreneurship, (iii) leadership, (iv) infrastructure, and (v) risk financing. On the other hand, most closures of these enterprises occur in the early years of a firms existence. MSMEs are particularly vulnerable during the initial years, when entrepreneurs are learning how to operate a new business. Further, differences in the amount of capital invested, access to capital, ability, risk aversion and spending the business grants on household investments have an impact on the growth and success of enterprises.
In addition, the location and the sector in which the MSMEs operate are instrumental in the growth of these enterprises. Moreover, MSMEs located in commercial districts were more likely to survive than those that operated in non-commercial areas. Proximity to growing markets would thus seem to be an important determinant of the prospects for an enterprise to survive.
It was also found that MSMEs suffer from a number of constraints and weaknesses. A predominant number of enterprises are in the unorganised sector. The sector is heterogeneous and the majority of units suffer from low technology base, resulting in low productivity and poor quality of products. As the units are small in size, they also have poor access to equity and credit. In most cases, capital comes from savings and loans from friends and relatives rather than through banking systems. This problem is particularly acute for the lower end of micro industries. This sector continues to face a shortage of skilled manpower due to lack of affordability and poor managerial capabilities. Another major weakness is the absence of marketing channels and brand-building capacity. Consequently, workers engaged in the MSME sector have very little bargaining power and are exploited by middlemen, unit owners and big business houses. They are unable to take up aggressive marketing like big players and they cannot find customers despite good quality and competent prices. In addition, the dispersed, unorganised nature of the industry also raises issues of quality, bulk production and inability of meeting big orders.
Further, MSMEs identify financing, especially medium to long-term finance, as their topmost obstacle to growth and investment. MSME constraints in access to finance are described as follows: (i) MSMEs are regarded by creditors and investors as high-risk borrowers due to insufficient assets and low capitalisation, vulnerability to market fluctuations and high mortality rates; (ii) information asymmetry arising from MSMEs lack of accounting records, inadequate financial statements or business plans makes it difficult for creditors and investors to assess the creditworthiness of potential MSME proposals; and (iii) high administrative and transaction costs of lending or investing small amounts do not make MSME financing a profitable business. In addition, there are fewer customers and sales due to the smaller population in an area, so that every customer is needed. The result is that businesses without the personal touch can fail faster than a similar other business would. The market potential for such firms is limited.
However, it is important to recognise that only a portion of MSME closures can be described as traditional business failures, where the firm was not financially or economically viable. Somewhat less than half of the MSME closures were in this category; lack of demand and shortage of working capital were the two most frequently mentioned underlying causes of these closures due to bad business conditions. However, those who closed their business for demand reasons were more likely to start a new enterprise than those who closed because of a lack of working capital. For the others, approximately one quarter of the MSMEs closed for personal reasons such as illness or retirement, while the remainder closed because the entrepreneur was able to move onto better options.
Therefore, it is clear that the micro and small enterprise sector contributes significantly to the socioeconomic development of vulnerable communities and enables them achieve socioeconomic equity. As such, MSME development emerges as a key instrument in poverty reduction efforts. However, MSME development strategies should be country and context specific. Each country may have its own challenges, opportunities and priorities for change. In addition, resources available for implementation may also vary by country and context.
Therefore, results achieved may also be different. Further, MSME development requires a cross-cutting strategy and the development strategy has to be inclusive and may have a more holistic approach, involving measures for creating an enabling environment, publicprivate dialogue and business development services facilitation (including capital, training, consultancy and advisory services, marketing assistance, technology development and transfer and business linkage promotion).

Oil slick cleaned up  CPC
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) said on Friday that as per information from the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), the major oil clean-up operations were completed on September 12 and small groups are engaged in beach-cleaning operations continuously.
However, Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd. (CPSTL), MEPA, the Coast Guard and the Sri Lanka Navy will continue to monitor the affected area.
CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatungaon said, The burst in the buoy hose could have occurred due to rough sea conditions that prevailed on September 8. However, we are yet to determine the exact reason for the rupture and we have requested the Petroleum Resources Development Secretary to conduct an independent investigation to identify the exact cause. Taking into consideration the possible impact of the oil spill on the environment, we took immediate measures to stop the leakage and informed the relevant authorities to enlist their support in the clean-up effort.
CPC and CPSTL together with the MEPA, Sri Lanka Navy, Air Force, Army, Police, Coast Guard, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, immediately joined to manage the spill and over 300 personnel were on ground to salvage affected areas. We highly commend their tireless efforts, working around the clock to contain the oil spill and minimise any damage to these areas, Ranatunga said.
Commenting on the operation to contain and reverse the effects of the oil spill, MEPA Chairman Rear Admiral (Rtd) Rohan Perera said, We took prompt measures to remove the oil accumulated on the coastal area to minimise damage to the coast environment. Together with the combined resources, we first focused on the area of the spill in Dikkowita and after its successful containment, we completed the operation by securing the Uswetakeiyawa coastal area. Im thankful to everyone involved in this effort to protect our coastal belt and the environment.
With regard to the CPSTL operation, the faulty hose has been removed and replaced and the buoy is in operation now and fuel discharge has re-commenced, the CPC said.

Oldest and deepest lake in the world
Often mistaken for a sea, Baikal is a lake unlike any other on Earth. It is the worlds largest freshwater lake (by the volume of fresh water), and it is the deepest and the oldest lake in the world.
Located in the southern part of the Russian region Siberia, the lake contains 20 percent of the worlds freshwater making it the biggest reservoir of fresh water on Earth.
Known as the Pearl of Siberia, Lake Baikal is estimated to be 25 million years old and it is the home to more than 2,000 endemic plant and animal species of exceptional value to evolutionary science. Although it is hard to decide, the Nerpa seems to be the most famous of all endemic species that can be found at Lake Baikal. It is one of a kind species of seal that is restricted exclusively to a freshwater habitat. Sadly, the seal population has been reduced in recent decades and this unique seal faces an uncertain future due to climate change.
With a surface area of 12,248 square miles (31,722 square kilometers), Lake Baikal is bigger than many countries in the world including Belgium, Armenia, Albania, Haiti, Israel, Slovenia, and Qatar.
It is one of the three lakes in the world with a depth of over 1000 meters (3280 feet). At 1,642 meters (5387 feet) Lake Baikal is 172 meters (564 feet) deeper than Lake Tanganyika, and it is 617 meters (2024 feet) deeper than the Caspian Sea.
Lake Baikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular destinations for photographers and adventurers.
The lake freezes five times a year, and its ice is so thick that it can handle a vehicle over 15 tons.

Sri Lanka has a better health service than that of the US. The Wold Bank report says that a poor people-friendly health service is in Sri Lanka.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka achieved all those goals because the primary healthcare system in Sri Lanka has been developed now. All types of body organs are now transplanted. Bone marrow, liver, heart and legs are transplanted now.
Even the WHO praised our health service in this regard, the Minister said.
The Minister said third heart transplantation at the Kandy General Hospital will be carried out by Consultant Dr. Anil Abeywickrama very soon and the first ever heart and liver transplantations took place at the hospital.

Reaping the harvest
In a Home Garden the post harvesting period is a most satisfying and wonderful time where you reap the results of your hard work. It is a time of great joy where you have a healthy, nourishing and wholesome source of food. Green Thumbs speaks to Maharagama Agrarian Service Center, Agriculture Instructor Anuruddhika Perera on the Post Harvesting Period.
A home garden has many crops such as vegetables, fruits, root crops, leafy vegetables and spices. Here it is crucial that we identify the correct stage of reaping the harvest. This differs from crop to crop. This is because all home garden crops are perishable. If we do not harvest these crops at the correct time, the quality decreases. Your crop is your source of food and it can even be your income, it the crops are left to over-mature you can lose a valuable stock of crop which will be a major setback to your home garden. If you operate a home garden where you sell the excess to the market, then your post harvesting involves cooling, cleaning, sorting and packing.
If the crops are left to over mature the Carbohydrates start to convert to Sucrose (sugar) and because of that the quality decreases. And then the water percentage also decreases. The fiber amount increases. Then the appearance of the crop changes and it perishes. If we do not harvest at the correct time we lose 20  30 percent of the crop, said Perera.
Perera also pointed out that when the crop over matures the ethylene hormone develops. Here one must be very careful. The parts of the fruit or vegetable that is over matured (with a high percentage of ethylene hormone) needs to be discarded or separated. Otherwise the other parts of the crop get affected. The parts of the crop that are matured start to quickly over mature themselves and those that are not yet matured start to mature. So there are advantages and disadvantages.
Let us now examine how to reduce the post- harvest loss in vegetables in the home garden: It you take Okra, you know when to harvest it when it feels soft to the touch. When fiber increases it is hard. When it can be easily broken you canharvest. You need to use the correct tool to pluck it or the plant gets damaged and the next harvest will be late. Snake Gourd has over-matured when dark green strips emerge and the ashy texture decreases. When it is ashy colored you can harvest.Bitter Gourd comes in three forms  Thinnaveli, Hybrid and MC 43. Thinnaveli has a white color. Hybrid and MC 43 have a green and white color. When Thinnaveli over matures it turns yellow color. When Hybrid and MC 43 over matures it is dark green or red. Brinjals are harvested when they become soft. When it over matures the color changes. Harvest when the area near the stem increases in wholeness.
If we take root crops and leafy vegetables after harvesting we cannot keep them for over two or three days in the normal environment. Manioc should be kept under ground for eight to ten months. Sweet potato harvesting time is 3  months. Leafyvegetables, from the day we first plant, it can be harvested after 1  months. If not they over-mature and the fiber amount increases. Here it needs to be cleaned. If the leaves becomes yellow they must be removed. Otherwise the rest of the crop become yellow.
If you take fruits, they too must be harvested at the ideal time. Fruits can be divided into two  Climacteric and Non- Climacteric.
Climacteric fruits need to ripen on the tree. It if is not ripened on the tree and it is plucked then it will not ripe. However if it is Non-climacteric and it is picked before ripening on the tree it ripens on its own. Examples for Climacteric fruits are mango, Rambutang, Beli and Anoda and examples for Non Climacteric are Guava, Papua and Avocado. If you take mangoes, when the gum appears we know that it is at the mature stage and ripening. Because of the gum the fruit starts to perish. So the correct tools need to be used. Here the hot water technique should be used.
The mango fruit needs to be dipped in warm water then cleaned and stored in a dry place, pointed out Perera.
Insect damage too needs to be minimized and for this an organic pesticide can be used such as Neem extract. As discussed in our early articles if there is a lack of soil a hydroponic system can be used or you can cultivate in soil. Here when cultivating in soil you need a ready availability of compost because compost has a direct effect.
****
REASONS FOR LOSING 20- 30 PERCENT OF THE CROP
Use of proper tools will prevent unnecessary injury to the produce being harvested.The Correct maturity stage has been overlooked/ improper harvesting (This differs from crop to crop)
The vehicle is overloaded and the load is not stable and well ventilated.
The produce is not protected against sun, rain and dust and needs to be covered by a light colored tarpaulin
Excessive speeding, sudden stops and jerk causes squeezing and bruising of the product
Poor roads, uneven surfaces, pot holes, winding corners will all greatly increase mechanical damage unless adequate care is taken.
Transport problems (here transport conditions need to be taken into account along with cleanliness/ sanitation and temperature)Mechanical damagesInsect damage Environmental conditions  drought, flood and heat damage Poor handling of the produce from the field through to the market placeInappropriate container and use of packaging materialLack of adequate and appropriate storage facilities/ poor storage conditions

Rs 10 mn initiatives to boost  SME packaging, competitiveness
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has launched new initiatives to strengthen local SME packaging sector.
This initiative will be carried out in two stages and involves 150 SMEs as beneficiaries. Under the first stage around 100 SMEs were trained and equipped in packaging at a cost of Rs 6.2 million. In the planned next stage (2019) another 50 SMEs will be strengthened in packaging at a cost of Rs 4.5 million. In addition, yet another project is also being planned by the Ministry to build skills for SMEs especially for promotions and market access.
Printing and packaging are important elements in branding Sri Lanka to the global markets, especially for our SMEs striving for international markets and this is the reason the Ministry is investing in this segment, said Minister of industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the launch of Lankapak 2018.
Though high quality exports packaging is important for competitive international markets, many export items with cover packaging and non-recyclable packaging are now faced with increasing challenges abroad. Also the international packaging requirements are impacting on our exports.
Deputy Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Dr Shilpak Ambule addressing the event said that packaging is as important as the product itself. Indian packaging industry has become the fifth largest packaging industry in the world.
Huge investments in food and FMCGs have boosted the packaging sector in India.
Sri Lankan industries partnering with Indian industries through outsourcing is an asset to India. Considerable volume of Lankan exports to India are in food products-such as tea. The process of recognition of Sri Lankan (food testing) labs by Indians has been a long-standing demand by Lankan industry.
The Food Safety and Standard Authority India (FSSAI) is currently working on the certification of Lankan labs. We expect growth of export of food products from Sri Lanka to India even further.
A strong presence of Indian packaging sector is seen at the event which came to and end yesterday.
In 2017, Sri Lankas total trade with India was at US $ 5.1 billion increased by 18% from 2017s $4.3 billion. Exports from Sri Lanka to India was at US$ 689.5 million while total imports from India to Sri Lanka was at US$ 4,496 mn.

In search of healthy wealth
The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), is an advocate of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) for all. They have joined hands with the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka (FPASL) of Sri Lanka to tackle a host of problems ranging from unwanted pregnancies, teen pregnancies unsafe illegal abortions, rape, incest, womens access to secure livelihoods and economic resources and HIV/AIDS
Director General of IPPF, Dr. Alvaro Bermejo was in Sri Lanka recently and met multiple stakeholders from the government, Civil Society, Healthcare delivery system and community leaders to discuss IPPFs commitment towards strengthening healthcare delivery in Sri Lanka.
Daily News met up with Dr. Bermejo at a Media Interaction where he discussed some of the key issues that IPPF is tackling such as new technologies related to HIV and how we need to adjust to developments in the 21st century.
In March this year the National STD/AIDS Control Program of the Ministry of Health, which spearheads the national response to HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka, said that the country is at the verge of successfully eliminating mother to child transmission of HIV. Also Sri Lanka continues to have very low HIV prevalence.
I am coming to the end of my trip to Sri Lanka. I was appointed only six months ago and I came to Sri Lanka because I wanted to visit countries that were successful in family planning. I also want to visit countries that have done well in HIV prevention. So I want to visit countries with family planning associations who have played an important role in achieving them. And there is no doubt that Sri Lanka is a country that has done well in family planning. Sri Lanka came in top of the list for this region and it is the first country that I have visited in Asia, said Dr. Bermejo.
Dr. Bermejo pointed out that though Sri Lanka still faces many challenges overall, it is doing well in family planning compared to others in the region and others outside of the region.
It is commendable that Sri Lanka has kept HIV prevention low. And it is happening during a transition period for Sri Lanka, as the island becomes an upper middle income economy. So I have been visiting the delivery sites of FPASL, the HIV prevention work that is being done, and talking to the government officials that FPASL works with, as well as visiting pharmacies. I do all of this because I feel Sri Lanka has been shy as a country to show their success internationally. A lot of us can learn from what has been done in Sri Lanka. I want to be a part of supporting Sri Lanka to do that. Now Sri Lanka has joined the international community in the family planning 2020 partnership. Now a large new generation of young girls are becoming sexually active at a reproductive age, and we must think how we can cater to them who are different in their approach to the world. How do we try to understand them So that has been a really interesting debate. And I have learnt a lot from Sri Lanka, said Dr. Bermejo.
UNAIDS targets are for 90 percent of people with HIV to be diagnosed, 90 percent of diagnosed people to be taking treatment, and 90 percent of people on treatment to have a fully suppressed viral load. Achieving these targets will greatly reduce the spread of HIV.
Dr. Bermejo pointed out, that in his visit to Sri Lanka, he has had a discussion with the Director of the National AIDS control program.
So we discussed the 90-90-90 target and the challenges that we face in reaching it. So we spoke about identifying 90 percent of those living with HIV by 2020. And so that 90 percent will be accessing treatment, and those that are accessing treatment, 90 percent will be immune suppressed so they will not be able to transmit the disease. That was the target that has been set internationally, and from the discussion we had, we understood that Sri Lanka is not going to meet that target. It is going to fall short. We were discussing as to why Sri Lanka is going to fall short The reality of Sri Lanka is that it is doing well once the person is diagnosed with HIV and linked to care. That person stays in care and complies very well with treatment and reaches immune suppression and does not transmit the disease to others. But the problem is we are not able to diagnose many of those who are living with HIV. We are not reaching them or they are not reaching the health system. So we were discussing what we could do about that, explained Dr. Bermejo.
How can FPASL reach out to some key populations that are not being reached  particularly men who have sex with men and do not identify as gay.
We were also discussing other technologies that are not being registered here that could be helpful. For example HIV self testing. There is technology with which you can test yourself from the privacy of your own home. In 20 minutes you get results. That is not yet available here in Sri Lanka. It is still commercially expensive. But it could be brought down to a lower price. That was one discussion, pointed out Dr. Bermejo.
Bermejo also pointed out that he had had a discussion with the Director of the Family Health Bureau. (FHB)
I congratulated the Director for bringing Sri Lanka into the Family planning 2020 partnership. We were talking about the challenges of young women who are not accessing services and how we have a big cohort of young women who are about to reach reproductive age, and become sexually active, and we dont really know a lot yet. We do not know a lot about their health care seeking behavior. These girls come to the clinics the way the older generation came to the clinics or maybe not. How will they express their sexuality
What other countries have shown is that these girls and boys tend to be adopters of new technologies. They have phones that can access internet that brings good and bad possibilities. It provides lots of new information and new options, and we need to adjust to that because these girls will self- diagnose and self- medicate. That is the reality in many countries. In HIV self- testing, Adolescents are the first ones who dont want to go to the clinic and talk about having had sex and needing to test. And if they can find tests available on the internet they can manage to get someone to buy that for them. And then they will test. If they can access emergency contraception on the internet, that is what they will do. So how can we adjust our services to this new reality which is there So we need to make sure that they access information that is correct and information that is safe and products that are correct and safe rather than going the wrong way, explained Bermejo.
Touching on nutrition for children, Bermejo commented that the problem of mothers who are young and underweight is still a serious problem, as they deliver very low birth weight babies.
These children never manage to catch up. We financed several studies that show that these babies, not only do they not catch up in weight. They do not catch up in cognitive development and they dont catch up in economic development. In a study we have financed for twenty years, we find their income is lower than others. It is a multi- country study that was also done in India. What can we do to prevent this vicious circle, because these babies become underweight girls It is very clear that the first 1000 days are key. Pregnancy and the first two years is what matters. So early intervention is necessary to impact those babies and those toddlers. We need to be able to reach them.
The most exciting program is about cash transfers. For family planning, my personal view is that if you trust the mothers they usually make the right decision. Most of the time. A lot of the studies we have done in India and other countries, is that about 50 percent of the income will be used  if you tell the mother, this is income you are getting because of your new born baby to make sure that it does not become under -weight or stunted, the mother will spend at least 50 percent of that income in nutritious food for the baby. With the mothers having bank accounts you can make sure the money gets to the mothers, explained Bermejo.

Sri Lanka detains five Indians over match-fixing fears
Sri Lanka crickets anti-corruption unit detained five Indian spectators on suspicion of match-fixing during Sundays third and final womens ODI between the hosts and India, an official said.
The five were initially asked to leave the ground at Katunayake, just north of the capital Colombo, and later detained by police for investigations, the official said.
We felt their behaviour was suspicious at the grounds and all of them were seen excessively communicating on their phones, the Sri Lanka cricket official, who declined to be named, told AFP. We exercised our right to remove them from the ground and the police took over the investigation.
Authorities believe that the suspects may have had links with foreign gambling operations. Betting on sports is illegal in Sri Lanka. Police said they were questioning the suspects.
Sri Lanka won Sundays match by three wickets, but India won the three-match tournament 2-1.
Last month, two Indians were apprehended in Sri Lanka after officials spotted them behaving suspiciously and making repeated calls on their mobile phones during a domestic T20 tournament match.
Since last month Sri Lanka Cricket has deployed more anti-corruption officials at match venues.
Sri Lanka has also announced plans for tougher laws against sports corruption and a special police unit to deal with match-fixing following an Al-Jazeera documentary in May exposing corruption in global cricket in which three Sri Lankan officials were filmed agreeing to sway matches.

Story of thirst
In 1967, John Berryman was in Ireland with his wife and child, on a Guggenheim Fellowship. He had won a Pulitzer Prize for the first volume of The Dream Songs, those incantatory stanzas about Henry and Mr Bones, all dialect and scholarship, saturated in drink  I have a sing to shay.
A journalist from Life magazine met the poet in Dublin and wrote an eight-page profile under the headline Whiskey and Ink: These are the fluids John Berryman needs. He needs them to survive and describe the thing that sets him apart from other men and even from other poets: his uncommonly, almost maddeningly penetrating awareness of the fact of human mortality. Later that year Berryman was to be found vomiting blood at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. The second volume of The Dream Songs came out in 1968.
In 2016, in the New Yorker, the poet and critic Henri Cole wrote of The Dream Songs:
Some readers have wondered if these uncomfortable poems were the result of alcoholism, or of double doses of chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic) or Dilantin (an anticonvulsant), which had both been prescribed to Berryman.
But I do not really care, since beneath the gruff surface and the high jinks of these poems we hear, deeper down, a vibrant, loving man with a vast spirit. Exacerbated and enormously learned, Berryman was a master of the poem written with manic energy from the edges of human experience . . .
Manic energy
What catches in that passage Is it the vibrant, loving man with a vast spirit Is it an image of centripetal manic energy Or is it the But I do not really care
It would be uncool, priggish, unthinking to care too much about the artists intoxication. Torments require relief and expression: numbing and utterance; alcohol and art. You cant unpick the work from the circumstances of its creation, nor should you want to. In 1975, the critic Lewis Hyde tried caring about Berryman.
A few years after the poets death, Hyde published an essay, an angry blast against the romanticization of the inebriated artist. When Hyde read The Dream Songs he didnt hear the genius so much as the booze talking. Its tone is a moan that doesnt revolve. Hyde seemed to believe  unfashionably  that Berrymans work would have been better had he been sober.
In The Recovering, Leslie Jamison returns to this myth of whiskey and ink, as a writer, an academic and an alcoholic. When, a few years sober herself, Jamison read Hyde on Berryman, she whispered a secret Amen. She wanted to believe that giving up booze didnt mean giving up electricity, and Hyde was suggesting that the fruits of alcoholic composition werent glorious but deeply compromised.
Jamison grew up in a high-achieving family in Los Angeles (dinner was conducted once a week in French; love felt to her like reaching). Her mother was a nutritionist, her father was never around, and then her parents separated. Jamison went to Harvard, then the University of Iowa; she taught and travelled, wrote a novel, The Gin Closet (2010), and a book of essays, The Empathy Exams (2014). Now, she directs the non-fiction programme at Columbia University. A constant throughout all this is a sense of lack and a corresponding need. But her set-up here is like a strange jigsaw, in which the size and shape of the hole changes while she is rummaging around for the missing piece.
Unromantic portraits
In romantic portraits of the artist  like unromantic portraits of the addict  we tend to picture a lone figure, longing for someone or something else to fill them, but they keep coming unstuck against an inability to feel sated or reach perfection. They swear off the humdrum, the community, the other pieces that might fit; they work alone. It is impossible for them, or anyone around them, to discover what they really need  they are absorbed in the process of becoming themselves, rather than simply being.
Part of Jamisons own recovery involves her identification of what she needs: a story to get sober in; she needs to know if stories about getting better could ever be as compelling as stories about falling apart. And her own story about falling apart is, in moments, crackling and bright. Her shame, which is a concept best relayed  in a synaesthesia slip  through smell, rises stinking from the page. Alcoholics Anonymous helps her, because, in many ways, AA was all about embracing need: resisting self-sufficiency, seeking humility, granting help and receiving it.
As she carries us through this story of thirst, Jamison also considers the lives and works of many drunk and high artists  among them Berryman, John Cheever and Jean Rhys. - Times Literary Supplement

Stunning Harry Potter themed wedding
When Allison first laid eyes on her husband, her first thought was that he looked like Ron Weasely.
In fact, she was so taken aback by his ginger locks and him similarities to the adorable sidekick she immediately offered him a job at the cinema she was working at. And luckily Steven shared her love of all things Harry Potter, so after years of dating it seemed only fitting that their wedding was themed around JK Rowling's incredible wizarding world.
Steven, 30, popped the question last year with a special ring designed to look like a golden snitch - and the theme grew from there. Naturally, they picked Harry's birthday, July 31, for their big day and their invitations were in the style of the Marauders Map. On the day itself they arrived at their local registry office in a blue Ford Anglia - the same car used by Harry and Ron in the Chamber of Secrets.
Allison, 45, from Aylesbury, Bucks, said, "The bridesmaids were sorted into houses and had dresses in their house colours. "I took pages from the books to make their flowers and put real flowers in their too, the Gryffindors had red, Slytherin green. The table decorations were all around Harry Potter, they had names like the Leaky Cauldron, the Three Broomsticks, Hogwarts, etcetera. The table savers were Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans and chocolate frogs. The name placement cards had the unforgivable curse printed on them and every seat had a wand. The cake was also themed with all our favourite professors, our patronuses and our house crests - I'm a Hufflepuff and Steven is a Ravenclaw." Allison said she fell in love with the Harry Potter franchise when she was working at a cinema and had to watch test screenings of the films. She was hooked, and when Steven, who is now 30, came for a job interview she hired him on the spot - partly because he looked like Ron Weasley.
Allison, now a shop manager, said, "I prefer the films, but Steven likes the books. I like the way they were adapted for the cinema. I interviewed Steven years ago - he was ginger and we gave him the job because he looked like Ron Weasely. We were just friends then but we stayed in touch. We had the same social circle and we would hang out together. I don't really know how it happened but we ended up together."When it came to planning their wedding the loved-up duo decided to stray away from tradition.
Allison added, "Harry Potter was something we shared. We've been together for nine years and our relationship has been fun and we wanted the wedding to be like we are - fun and not too formal.
The wedding was amazing, we had the most fun - it was a truly magical day. It was perfect."

A Kuwaiti man and woman convicted of assaulting Sri Lanka Customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport earlier this year, were handed a six-month jail sentence suspended for five years, the Arab News quoted an official as saying.
A magistrate on Friday sentenced the 32-year-old woman and her 29-year-old male partner, who were also fined Rs. 138,000.
They were arrested for trying to smuggle a Burmese Mastiff into the country in July without following quarantine procedures. The woman was caught on CCTV cameras assaulting Customs officers who tried to stop them.
Bringing pets into the island without quarantine clearance can lead to the forfeiture of the animal as well as a fine of up to Rs. 100,000.

TAMBA VILLAS LAUNCH IDYLLIC HOME AWAY  FROM HOME DEVELOPMENT IN TALPE
The Southern coast which in recent times has witnessed a flurry of development and related activities, will soon be home to an idyllic, luxurious, yet at the same time, a home away from home development; Tamba Villas.
To build a home that is so exceptional that coming home either for a holiday, or to live there permanently would be the ultimate in paradise living! This is Eduard Hempels vision for his latest venture, Tamba Villas, which he expressed at an exclusive gathering held in Colombo at Tintagel, to appraise those present of his latest project. Eduard Hempel Director & Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas, a project in excess of US$ 15 million, went on to say , we want to give each home owner an idyllic life in a beautiful, safe space with all the comforts of modern day living. Our collection of 37 Villas have been purpose-built for people who like to work, holiday or retire in one of the most beautiful areas of Galle, a place that affords them a 5-Star life-style; in short Tamba villas in Thalpe. Tamba Estates Pvt Ltd, a Sri Lankan Limited company, owns 100% of the land that Tamba Villas. In Sri Lanka very specially for the launch of Tamba Villas were Architects to the project Darlene Smyth and Warren Liew from AD Lab Singapore, Anita Ricquier, Financier, Trust Singapore and Trevor Morgan, Director & Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas. Previously, foreigners could only buy Freehold from the 4th floor up, and consequently Sri Lankans were wary of buying the lower floors since they couldnt sell them to foreigners, but this latest development now opens the doors wide for foreigners to invest in real estate in Sri Lanka, said Hempel.

Tamba Estates Ptv Ltd, a Sri Lankan Limited company, owns 100 per cent of the land that Tamba Villas will be built on and this coupled with the fact that foreign investors can now buy Freehold in a condominium development, ensures that the Tamba Villa development will indeed be a sell out.
In Sri Lanka very specially for the launch of Tamba Villas were Architects to the project Darlene Smyth and Warren Liew from AD Lab Singapore, Anita Ricquier , Financier, Trust Singapore and Trevor Morgan, Director and Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas.
Previously, foreigners could only buy Freehold from the fourth floor up, and consequently Sri Lankans were wary of buying the lower floors since they couldnt sell them to foreigners, but this latest development now opens the doors wide for foreigners to invest in real estate in Sri Lanka. The timing is perfect and we are incredibly excited, as we are just going into market with our delightful Condominium/Villa development in Thalpe, and it is the first of its kind in the Country. Our timing couldnt be better! Foreigners can now own their Free-hold, which opens up the doors globally said Hempel.
Tamba Villas is a collaboration between Shakticola and Award-winning A D Lab, a Singaporean Architectural firm focused on cutting edge residential projects, while STIX, another award-winning landscape designer designed the lush tropical gardens. Together, they have designed generous spaces for tropical living in the form of unique villa homes which coexist in harmony with nature.

Technology, an opportunity for creative brains
Wayamba University has earned a great reputation as a fast-growing university responsive to industry needs with significant improvement of infrastructure, new faculties, departments and academic programmes. I am delighted to see the increased emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship with initiatives such as the establishment of a business incubator and transfer of value-added innovative products specifically in the agriculture sector.
At a time when the university is striving to be innovative and entrepreneurial and when the graduates are starting a new chapter in their lives with the newly acquired qualification, moving from a learning environment to the world of work, I choose the topic The need for innovative and entrepreneurial graduates for my convocation address. I will address this under four subtopics: Efforts of wealth creation; The power of innovation and entrepreneurship; The fear and social acceptance; and our individual and collective role.
We create wealth for our country by selling our products and providing our services outside our country and earning foreign exchange, and by reducing importing products or services in an open economy. This means that our products and services must be globally competitive.
Rapid economic growth takes place when the export products and services are value added. Value addition occurs with innovation when new knowledge is inbuilt to products so that the production cost and the selling price have a big margin. A good example is your smartphone. When a significant portion of a countrys export products has such value addition we say that the country has a knowledge economy.
Unfortunately, we have not been improving our value-added high tech products over decades and according to World Bank statistics in 2016, in Sri Lanka, it stands at 1% of all exports. This is insignificant compared to countries like Thailand (22%), Malaysia (43%) and Singapore (49%). What is alarming is that even poorer countries such as Ethiopia (17%) and Myanmar (8%) are better than our country. There are many reasons for our failure the most important being very poor investment on research, development and innovation; lack of researchers; no incentives to attract highly qualified professionals; poor national innovation ecosystem aligning investment, policies, players and needs instead many barriers for researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs. For example, according to the latest statistics, our R&D investment is 0.106% of GDP, the lowest in the region; it is 0.63% in India, 1.3% in Malaysia, 2.2% in Singapore, 4.23% in Korea and 4.27% in Israel. We are less than even poorer countries such as Kenya (0.78%) and Nepal (0.3%). Sri Lanka has only 6117 scientists in all fields and only 944 PhDs. It is 106 full-time equivalent for a million population. In China, it is 1036, in Malaysia 2261 and in South Korea 7087.
Enterprise Sri Lanka project
However, the good news is that many are now realising this including the government and they are talking about it and taking some action. For example, the efforts of the Enterprise Sri Lanka project to increase awareness of the need among the masses; the facilities extended for SMEs in securing funds, in obtaining technical and business advice.
Furthermore, the efforts to leapfrog the IT-BPM industry by building regional capacity to support its growth driven by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) and the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) with the support of ICTA, Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) and the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT).
These efforts will go a long way in making Sri Lanka an Enterprise if properly implemented with proper policies, adequate funding and addressing issues promptly to ensure an improved national eco-system. Today invention (discovery) to innovation (application) is very fast and explosive. This explosion of technological advancement has led to rapid improvement of technologies in many frontiers with the profound change seen in information technology leading to the Internet of Things (IOT) which in turn has opened up opportunities for rapid innovations disrupting the conventional ways of doing business.
Compare these innovative companies with Sri Lanka having a total economy of US$ 93.45 Bn. The company Facebook is worth US$ 541 Bn and its founder Mark Zuckerberg is worth US$81.6 Bn. Airbnb is a US company providing an online marketplace and hospitality service for people to lease or rent short-term accommodation without owning any of those facilities.
It has used technology to carve out a multi-billion dollar business opportunity making money by charging a commission from hosts and guests. Its current market value is US$ 38 Bn. The company Uber is also a US company providing ridesharing, taxi cab, food delivery and transportation services operating in 633 cities worldwide without owning a single taxi.
Its market capitalisation is US$ 72 Bn. Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma is a Chinese company, and one of the worlds largest online market platforms hosting millions of users and millions of merchants. It makes money by charging a commission from the users and subscription by the merchants. Its market value is US$ 444 Bn. What is important is that these disruptive companies have evolved with simple ideas, innovative and creative thinking and with no significant capital requirement.
Innovative enterprises
Can one of you be one of those innovative, disruptive, creative entrepreneurs with your brilliant brains If at least one of you can come out with such an idea to carve out a technology opportunity, our poor country can generate wealth pretty fast. Please try. Even if you do not end there, you can certainly make a significant difference.
With the best university education, and with knowledge, skills and competencies in your own area of technical expertise, the graduates are in the best position to create such innovative enterprises. This way, you can become job creators rather than job seekers while significantly contributing to wealth creation for you, your company and our country and thereby bring great reputation to your university and pride to your parents. Will you take up that challenge
We certainly have such personalities among you and I know some of you are ready to take up that challenge. However, there is the fear of failure and lack of social acceptance as an entrepreneur, at least during the formative years. To begin with, the parents of graduates usually do not like their sons and daughters to experiment with such enterprising ideas because they too fear failure.
They would like to proudly say that their son or daughter is working in a government institution or an established private institution rather than say that they have their own company. This may even be a matter to be considered in marriages as some parents would want to ensure that their daughter is married to a person with a solid income with no risk.
This needs a complete change of perception on entrepreneurs who take a risk and venture in to carve out vast untapped opportunities with the potential of earning much more wealth than regular employment. This situation is, however, gradually changing with some success stories.
For example, at the University of Moratuwa, a new culture of innovation and entrepreneurship is evolving with more and more students venturing into building their own enterprises with innovative and creative ideas, products and services, with some having branches even outside Sri Lanka. I am sure Wayamba University too has produced such entrepreneurs.
My appeal to the new graduates is that at least some of you consider creating your own enterprises perhaps now or even a bit later and become a success story creating more wealth for you, your company and our country, thereby support our ailing economy.
My appeal to parents is not to prevent your sons and daughters from taking such initiatives but to provide moral and other support to those who will become the saviours of our nation in the fight to win the economic war while they themselves become heroes.
While the university will strive to do the best for you, the key message for the graduates passing out today is that it is your performance mainly that will contribute to our economy and raise the standard of living of our people. You have a great role to play to make us globally competitive. It is also your performance that will demonstrate your own personal and professional success.
This is where self-leadership is required because to be successful you need to provide leadership to yourself first before leading others.
Personality and leadership development
I hope that at least some of you have read the world famous personality and leadership development book Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. I was really fascinated to read this book and learn from it. It quotes Life is a book and you are its author. You determine its plot and pace and you only you- turn its pages. How do you determine your plot and pace You need to identify what you want to achieve. Now is the time when you need to make your life targets if you have not made them already. In order to provide leadership for you to be successful, you need to set your goals and these goals are your benchmarks to be achieved. Your benchmarks are  in different aspects of your life  education, marriage, wealth, health, house, employment, your skills, competencies, sports and even your behaviour, value addition to yourself, they all converge to your ambition and they need to be set. Then they will be your stimuli, drivers, motivation and purpose.
When we know the stimulus we respond. We all respond to various stimuli in our lives in different ways. Why Because between every stimulus and response, there is a very important space called freedom to choose. This space is available only to humans, it is almost zero for animals who respond to stimuli without any space to choose. Those who make a very appropriate decision for success are those who set the stimuli and maximize this space  freedom to choose, using their Self-awareness, Imagination, Consciousness and Independent Will. Those of us who do not identify life targets or identify targets in only some directions and not others are short of ambition right from the beginning.
Moreover, if you do not use the space between the stimulus and response most productively using Self-awareness, Imagination, Consciousness and Independent Will, you will surely fall short of your life targets.
As new graduates beginning to write a new chapter in your life, I earnestly hope that you will decide your plot and the pace of your new chapter by setting your stimuli, your life targets proactively, positively and optimistically. Then use the space, freedom to choose, most effectively with Self-awareness, Imagination, Consciousness and Independent Will to steer yourself towards outstanding success and at least some of you become outstanding innovators and entrepreneurs of our motherland.

Twentieth Amendment will fail - Minister
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution which was presented to Parliament by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna would not be successful, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said.
He was speaking at a media briefing in Colombo on Saturday.
According to my experience, bringing in an amendment to the Constitution after a government passes its first year in office is only a dream. That is the nature of our political culture. It is not a matter of legislature, but a matter of the current political culture, Minister Rajapakshe said.
He said that the 20th Amendment presented to Parliament will not be successful as it was presented by the JVP which has only six members in the House. There are 225 members in Parliament and so just six members cannot get a Bill passed, he said.
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution handed over by the JVP to abolish the Executive Presidency was published in the Gazette as a Private Members Bill last July.
Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the President will be appointed by Parliament, instead of through a Presidential Election. The President will continue to be the Head of State and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but he will no longer be the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed 20th Amendment will be implemented only after the current term of office of President Maithripala Sirisena.
As per the draft Bill, the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers will be the Prime Minister. The Presidents powers are distributed among the Cabinet, Prime Minister, Constitutional Council and independent commissions. However, the President will continue to have the powers of appointing the Governors of Provinces as with the 13th Amendment. The Presidents power to appoint Ambassadors and High Commissioners and grant pardons will be subject to Cabinet approval as per the proposed Amendment. The draft Bill also removes the Presidents power to prorogue Parliament.
The 20A requires the President to seek Cabinet approval when granting a Presidential pardon. The number of Presidential staff should also be approved by the Cabinet. The President, once elected by Parliament, cannot hold any position or membership of a political party during his or her tenure, according to the draft Bill.

Unilever, UNDP Deliver PPP Policy Paper to Presidents Secretary
Unilever Sri Lanka Chairman Carl Cruz and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Country Director Jorn Sorensen recently handed over a policy action paper for the promotion of public private partnerships for sustainable development to the Secretary to the President, Udaya Seneviratne.
The paper was the direct result of last years Unilever-UNGC-UNDP Forum which brought together Sri Lankas business leaders across a myriad of industries in the private sector, key personnel from the public sector, and key development partners to work on driving mutually beneficial partnerships towards the achievement of key priorities related to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Udaya Seneviratne, Secretary to President of Sri Lanka, said,
While the government continues to work towards bringing about sustainable development we commend the private sector for taking up the cause as well. I look forward to seeing the steps outlined in this policy paper in action.
Carl Cruz, Chairman, Unilever Sri Lanka, said, The changes required by the SDGs are neither small nor narrow. Therefore, if we are to achieve these goals we must work together to help the nation realize its vision of a brighter future.
Only together can we bring long term sustainable change to the nation and help propel its growth. The steps that we as a nation need to take are outlined in the policy paper that we handed over to the Presidents Secretary.
Jorn Sorensen, UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director, said, Sustainable development is the future and by investing in it now, we are securing Sri Lankas place in that future. However, to achieve sustainable development we will need the Government, businesses and development partners to work together towards our collective vision for the nation. The outline for this collaborative framework is laid out in the policy paper that we handed over to the President.
The policy paper outlines several projects targeted at specific SDGs. These include project SustainabiliTEA which will target sustainable agriculture. The aim of the project is to ensure that all tea produced in Sri Lanka comply with sustainable agricultural practices by 2020. Partners in the project are Unilever Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence, Dialog Axiata, and Sri Lanka Tea Federation.

Unlikely story of an Auschwitz Survivor
Born and raised in New Zealand, my rural upbringing allowed for adventures through the stories of others, and I was often punished for vivid daydreaming. Far-away lands with exotic inhabitants and strange animals excited and enticed me. I wrote plays, but our rather dull jersey cows contributed nothing to my attempts to engage them as actors. My parents called my attempts at play-writing a waste of time. There were more appropriate chores for me. They won out and eventually my fanciful daydreaming ended. I stopped writing, but never gave up on reading, the one thing they did encourage me to do in the evening, when all chores were done.
Even after I moved on from my small town, after I had traveled, had love affairs, got married, and had three children, I was restless. Something was missing in my life. It wasnt until I started working in the social work department at a large metropolitan hospital that I realized I missed writing; something there had allowed me to start telling stories again. This time, instead of looking elsewhere for inspiration, I began using some of my own experiences in my writing.
Creative work
I wrote a screenplay about a boy in the hospital very much like the one where I worked. It was never produced, but it set me on a path that changed my life. I began looking for real-life inspiration for my creative work. I saw a small article in a newspaper about the 1956 Melbourne Olympics noting the head of security had been only 23 years old at the time. I sought out the man, now nearing retirement, and asked him about his life. I learned the secrets and details of lies, spies, murders, and abductions that took place during these Olympics. It was a screenwriters dream.
Developing a story based on real-life events and subjects felt natural to me. Everywhere I looked, I saw potential story lines. Knowing I was always looking for real-life subjects, a friend of a friend told me about a man with a story to tell, a man who needed his story told, though he didnt necessarily know how it should be told, or to whom.
On a Sunday afternoon in a quiet, tree-lined inner suburb of Melbourne I climbed the stairs to Apartment 3, knocked, and 87-year-old Lale Sokolov opened the door, guarded on each side by a dog, one the size of a small pony, the other smaller than my cat. Lale had been a prisoner in Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he met his wife Gita and fell in love with her. I knew from the beginning that theirs was not a simple love story. Lale had held the hand of a trembling young girl, her head shaven, dressed in rags as he defiled her body with numbershe was a tattooist at the concentration camp.
Nearby console
He spoke to me for two hours the first day I met him. At one point he got up and retrieved a photo from a nearby console. A smiling Gita looked at us both. She was beautiful, wasnt she he whispered. He clutched the photo to his chest for several minutes before placing it on the table between us.
It was Gitas death that led her husband of 58 years to ask their son to find someone to whom he could tell his story; a story he and Gita had kept to themselves since 1945.
I visited Lale two to three times a week for six months. I deliberately chose not to take any recording device with me for the first several months; it was important for Lale to take his time, and for us to get to know each other. I was getting his story piecemeal, often told at bullet pace with limited coherency and with no flow or connection to the many, many stories he told. But it didnt matter. Sitting with him, listening to him was spellbinding. Over time, I began to make sense of the various pieces. The vignettes of Lale and Gitas life in Auschwitz were combining into the most amazing love story. I was hearing of acts of incredible bravery and compassion alongside acts of atrocity and barbarism known all too well. Sometimes Lale seemed confused or refused to share details that seemed important. It was obvious he was still grieving terribly; he often repeated that he wanted to be with Gita.
Concentration camp
I knew from the beginning that theirs was not a simple love story. Lale had held the hand of a trembling young girl, her head shaven, dressed in rags as he defiled her body with numbershe was a tattooist at the concentration camp.
Still, we continued to meet regularly. Every second or third visit, we would go out for coffee, or to a movie, or meet up with some of his old friends and I would scold him for introducing me as his girlfriend. I knew it was important to spend this kind of time with Lale, to get to know him well enough that hed be comfortable telling me things hed never told anyone but Gita, and also so that I could get a more complete picture of the kind of person Lale was, the things he liked to do, the way he conducted himself.
Over the next six months I learned a lot about Lale. I learned he still considered himself a mummas boy, that he felt connected to women more than men, preferring their company. - Lit Hub

Villagers demand Galaha Hospital re-opened
A large group of people held a protest at Galaha on Saturday demanding that authorities reopen the Galaha Hospital closed following a tense situation recently after a child's death.
They complained that they are inconvenienced by the closure of the hospital as the next nearest government health facility is at Deltota, 10 km from Galaha.
The Police Special Task Force and riot squads were deployed recently following a tense situation outside the Galaha Hospital following a death of an child admitted to the hospital.
Close to 2,000 people attacked the hospital forcing police to provide security to the hospital and its staff.
The crowd alleged that the one-and-half-year-old child died following a delay in administering treatment at the hospital. The parents had then taken the child to the Peradeniya Hospital in a three wheeler, but the child died before they reached the hospital. The angry mob had damaged hospital property and several vehicles parked at the hospital. Central Province Health Director Dr. Shanthi Samarasinghe transferred doctors at the hospital and health authorities and the police commenced separate investigations.
Seven persons allegedly responsible for damaging public property were arrested later.

In terms of value, Central Finance & HNB led foreign purchases while JKH & Sampath Bank led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equities ended the week on a negative note for the 1st time in 4 weeks as concerns over a currency crisis (prompted by a report from Japanese investment bank Nomura) spooked investors. Despite a healthy recovery of ~108 points since 28th August (from its 17-Month low of 6010.23 points), the W-o-W loss on heavy weight stocks such as JKH (-3.26%),Commercial Bank (-3.31%), Distilleries (-6.28%) & Sampath Bank (-3.81%) dragged the ASPI down by ~87 points (or 1.42%) during the week. The YTD loss on the ASPI consequently widened further to 5.9% (cf. 4.6% till last week). A subsequent correction by the Nomura regarding an error in its short term external debt repayment calculation for Sri Lanka however, helped calm markets to some extent and despite the losses on the Index, activity levels in the market recovered during the week.
Weekly turnover consequently increased ~227% to Rs.4.4Bn from Rs.1.3Bn last week, helped by Janashakthis acquisition of 31.14% of Dunamis Capital on Wednesday at Rs.36.60. Meanwhile, Local HNI and Institutional investors returned to equities during the week, resulting in crossings for the week rising to ~64% of total market turnover (cf. 30% last week).
Transactions on Dunamis Capital accounted for ~50% of the weeks total crossings and 33% of the weekly turnover. In addition, Local HNI and Institutional investors were also interested in blue-chip JKH (~13% of the crossings) and Sri Lankas largest retailer Cargills (~14% of the crossings). The foreign equity sell-off on the bourse meanwhile increased during the week as foreign investors recorded a net outflow of Rs.564Mn cf. Rs.64Mn last week.
JKH lead the net foreign sales with ~Rs.640Mn while Sampath bank accounted for Rs.84Mn. Markets in the week ahead are likely look for cues from economic and political developments, including Q218 GDP growth figures.
Brent crude oil falls 2% from 3m high
Global oil price headed for a weekly gain, with benchmark Brent crude oil reaching its highest level of $80.13/bbl. since mid-May 2018 on Wednesday. Although commodity prices have been on a declining trend since early-July, oil prices were buoyed by a fresh round of global oil supply concerns as U.S. crude oil inventories dwindled to a 31/2 year low, falling by 5.3Mn barrels last week.
Risks to demand (such as heightening trade tensions between the U.S. China) were overshadowed by the oil markets focus on fears of supply shortages (due to slowing crude oil production growth) and threats of Iranian sanctions. Iranian production has fallen to its lowest since July 2016, at 3.63Mn barrels a day.
Despite Wednesdays 3-month high, shifting oil market perceptions led Brent crude oil falling 2% on Thursday to settle at $78.18 per barrel as investors focused on the International Energy Agencys (IEA) warning of mounting global economic risks for oil demand from challenges in emerging markets such as currency depreciation versus the dollar and trade disputes.
In its latest monthly oil report, IEA warned that the oil market is entering a very crucial period and predicted that the market could break out above $80 a barrel unless oil producers meet the shortfall from Iran and Venezuela.
The upward movement in oil prices is likely to further worsen Sri Lankas trade deficit which rose to $5.7Bn between Jan-Jun 2018(cf. $4.8Bn in Jan-Jun17) amid higher import prices and volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products. CPC import prices of crude in July rose to $78.76/bbl compared to an average of $74.96/bbl between Jan-Jun18 reflecting the upwards movement in oil prices and the potential impact on the countrys Q318 trade deficit.

A welcome suggestion
The Traffic Police plays an important role by regulating traffic as well as probing violations of road rules by motorists and pedestrians. They have the power to issue traffic fines and/or produce traffic rule violators in court. This is a very important mechanism to deter motorists from committing repeat offences.
However, there are many complaints from motorists that traffic policemen demand bribes in cash or kind to send them off without writing a ticket or even to write a lesser offence that attracts a lower fine. This is, of course, a violation of the countrys bribery laws. In such a case, both parties are in the wrong  giving a bribe is also illegal and immoral.
Until now, there has been no proper mechanism for the public to complain against such errant police personnel. Traffic Police DIG Ajith Rohana has now requested the public not to hesitate to record and send audio or video clips taken from mobile phones on incidents involving activities of traffic police officers who seek bribes or other favours.
This is a step in the right direction. With almost everyone having a smartphone and many cars having front dashcams, video evidence can readily be obtained. To be fair, the Police too can record the conversation with the motorist. This way, an independent court or other forum can decide who is wrong and who is right. With the number of bookable traffic offences now nearing 35, disputes are bound to be common and video evidence will help resolve any impasse.
It is important that the Traffic DIG has cleared the air on the right of motorists to record their interactions with traffic police officers since there have been a few incidents where the Police had grabbed the cameras/phones of some motorists and motorcyclists. In the light of what the Traffic Chief says, this would be strictly illegal  the Police have no right to stop a recording by a member of the public. Furthermore, dashcams and action cams (worn on top of the helmet) can help the Police in the event of an accident  they can analyse the footage and see which party is responsible for an accident.
The authorities must also explore the possibility of providing Body Cameras at least for Traffic officers. This is already a common practice in many other countries. Then the Police will also be able to record what goes on during a traffic violation stop and produce such evidence in court. If both parties present audiovisual evidence, the court will be able to tell who is telling the truth. The widespread use of Police CCTV vans and fixed CCTV cameras makes motorists think twice before committing an offence and body cameras would increase this awareness further. It is also time that the Traffic Police force is updated with electronic breathalyzers, electronic narcotics use detectors, electronic tint meters and other modern equipment to nab errant motorists.
However, there is absolutely no need for the Police to hide behind trees and bushes to nab unsuspecting motorists. This a highly dangerous practice, because some motorists may not be able to stop their vehicles in time  they may actually hit the pouncing policeman. The Police should be out in the open where the motorists can easily see them  it is only then that fear will be instilled in a motorist who would otherwise try to ignore road rules. The Police must get one thing clear  their primary role is not collecting fines. It is educating the public and creating awareness on the importance of adhering to road rules. In fact, the public has little or no idea of the recently expanded list of traffic offences. The Police must make extensive use of the media to make motorists aware of these changes.
There are other concerns vis--vis the Traffic Police. They must leave the traffic lights alone during rush hours instead of turning them off and trying to control the flow of traffic manually. A single policeman cannot regulate a six-way junction manually with any degree of effectiveness. The usual result is a mile-long traffic jam in every direction. On the other hand, traffic lights have been programmed and timed to give all lanes a chance in the most efficient manner. On top of that, they never get tired, angry, sleepy, hungry or distracted.
VIP convoys are another worrying factor. Only the President and the Prime Minister need motorcades for reasons of security and efficiency. No other person, regardless of stature, needs a motorcade in an environment sans any discernible threat. One feels that these are just for show and for intimidating the very voters who made them peoples representatives. These VIP drivers have absolutely no regard for road rules, other motorists and of course, for traffic policemen. It is time that they are reined in for the safety of the public at large. And the Traffic Police must be fair to all. We have seen plenty of instances where traffic policemen salute VIPs who run red lights. This kind of servile behaviour has to stop if the Traffic Police is keen to enhance its reputation.

What David Foster Wallace ate
The writer David Foster Wallace (19622008) didnt really eat food. When I met him, in 1996, when I was twenty-three years old, I really couldnt cook, though it wouldnt have occurred to me to consider this something we had in common. Wallace, who died by suicide on September 12, 2008, ten years ago today, burst into fame in the late eighties with experimental metafictions that took on the modern junk culture of advertising, celebrity, addiction, and alienation through technology. He struggled with those entities himself and was famous among his acquaintances for living mainly on packaged foods.
Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story, the excellent Wallace biography by D.<U+2009>T. Max, is littered with information like he lived on chocolate pop tarts and soda and he had a love of showering, Diet Dr Pepper and blondies and there were only blondies and mustard in the fridge. In 1995, the journalist David Streitfeld saw a kitchen with little more in it than a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and elicited the confidence from Wallace that whats really sick is I like to eat it cold.
English muffin
For my part, I was a noncook to such an extent that my boyfriend, fed up with making meals for me, once angrily coached me through making him a dish he called toaster-oven pizza. This involved an English muffin, a bag of grated cheese, and a jar of red sauce. I made it, but I thought he was being completely unreasonable.
What I was mostly interested in back then was books and writing about them. I met Wallace because Id transformed my dubious qualification of having read the advance proof of Infinite Jest twice into the opportunity to interview him during the books publicity tour. The interview ran on Stim, a newfangled kind of publication that in 1996 we called an online magazine. (That interview is still available online as part of the Wallace minor arcana and was just republished in August in an updated edition of Melville Houses The Last Interview series.)
The writer crush I developed on Wallace had come to me full blown when, one night reading alone in my first New York apartment, anxious and probably hungover, I sobbed my way through the end of Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way, the last story in the 1989 collection The Girl With Curious Hair. Westward, seen today with the jaundiced eye of adulthood, is a creaky metafiction about students in a fiction-writing class, whose plot, to the extent it has one, is about a road trip to a McDonalds ad-campaign reunion. The main character is Mark Nechtr, a sweet Midwestern boy fiction writer who is addicted to eating fried roses. Nechtrs foil is a clever postmodernist girlfriend, who commits fictional suicide in the end (meta, complicated, story-within-a-story). Wallace later repudiated the story as a horror show  a permanent migraine  crude and naive and pretentious, but there was also a time when he felt it was the best thing hed ever written. Max says that upon the storys publication Wallace felt it was what he had been born to write and that it said all he had to say.
Hilarious in retrospect
That anyone could cry over Westward is hilarious in retrospect, but truly, I did cry. The demographic of young women seriously upset by postmodernism must be vanishingly small, but in the midnineties, it described me. Id gone off to college with the squeaky overachievers excitement to discover the meaning of life (and then, you know, apply it to what came next). To my dismay, no matter what the subject was, its underpinnings were in French critical theory, which I understood to be a poised intellectual valueless-ness and destruction of meaning. This was embarrassing, and not the kind of thing one admitted to ones friends majoring in semiotics, but it clouded my college experience in secret but real ways. Wallace, in Westward, seemed to get it. A bit of beautiful doggerel from the story, critiquing the seminal postmodern story collection, Lost in the Funhouse, by John Barth, has run through my head for the past 22 years.
Barths funhouse metaphor points to the infinite regression of the narrative viewpoint in fictioneven if you reveal the meta-story behind the story, youre just adding another fallible and relative layer. None of it is real. On the contrary, Nechtr, the Wallace stand-in, desires, some distant hard-earned day, to write something that stabs you in the heart. - Paris Review

Where everyone has an equal voice and choice!
International Day of Democracy was celebrated on Saturday September 15, this year. In 2007 the United Nations General Assembly resolved to observe this day with the intention of promoting and upholding the principles of democracy and invited all member states and organisations to commemorate the day in an appropriate manner that contributes to raising public awareness.
It is meant both as a celebration of democracy and as a reminder that the need to promote and protect democracy is as urgent now as ever. This years theme of democracy and conflict prevention focuses on the critical need to strengthen democratic institutions to promote peace and stability. A more integrated approach to foster resilient societies calls for effective and inclusive democratic governance with respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally - either directly or through elected representatives - in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in a monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy.
It is only with educated citizens that a sustainable culture of democracy can emerge. Democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. The UN has been stressing the continuing need to promote democratisation, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally - either directly or through elected representatives - in the proposal, development and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in a monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy.
No consensus exists on how to define democracy, but equality, freedom and rule of law have been identified as important characteristics since ancient times. These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights.Democracy is a universal value based on the freely spoken and expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems in all aspects of their lives. Evolved over centuries, democracies share many common features, but cannot be reduced to a single model. In short, democracy pertains to the idea that everyone has the right to have their own beliefs and to say and write what they think.The date chosen for Democracy Day corresponds to the adoption in September 1997 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union of a Universal Declaration on Democracy. That Declaration affirms the principles of democracy, the elements and exercise of democratic government and the global scope of democracy. Activities carried out by the UN in support of efforts of governments to promote and consolidate democracy are undertaken in accordance with the UN Charter and only at the specific request of the member states concerned. A review of democracy in people of all backgrounds and nations are invited to help raise awareness for the purposes of democracy. In short, it is a reminder to governments, schools and workplaces everywhere that the hallmark of successful and stable democracies is the presence of a strong and freely operating civil society in which government and civil society work together for common goals for a better future.
One of the strongest global trends today is the empowerment of citizens and their desire for dignity and freedom. It is quite appropriate then for us to celebrate the strengthening of citizens voices for democracy.
The role of the citizen in improving the quality of democracy and in political and institutional reform is fundamental. During the past year alone the world has witnessed many examples of citizen-led movements across all continents demanding more responsive government and unless democracy responds to its citizens, it faces a major crisis. When powerful citizen movements spring up as a response to socio-economic crises across all continents, this is a clear call that politics as usual needs to be re-examined. Citizens have always been the driving force behind democratic change and international actors should respect their leadership in building their democracies. Citizen-led assessments provide citizens the needed spaces for dialogue on matters concerning their democracies. It is through citizen-led and owned democracy assessments that they can periodically assess the quality of their own democracies and build consensus around an agenda for broadening and deepening their democracies.
The citizen-led approach to assessing democracy is founded on the conviction that all people including women, youth, minorities, persons with disabilities, indigenous people, the poor and marginalized  know their democracies well and have clear aspirations of how they would like them to develop. They are viewed to possess legitimacy, which external actors are seen to be lacking, to make judgements about the quality of their democracies, debate emerging issues and build consensus around an agenda for broadening and deepening their democracies.
Democratic governments are accountable. Officials and politicians are answerable for their decisions and actions. This reduces the opportunity for corruption. Democracy also subjects governments to the rule of law, which means the law treats everyone, including the government, equally. Rule of law is important because, while it respects the will of the majority, it also protects the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups.
Civil society is the oxygen of democracy. Civil society acts as a catalyst for social progress and economic growth. It plays a critical role in keeping Government accountable and helps represent the diverse interests of the population, including its most vulnerable groups.
Yes, democracy has many forms but the most important part never changes, giving everyone a voice.
When people engage in the democratic process they have a say in the decisions that influence their lives. Democracy can be found everywhere, from governments creating laws to friends deciding on what game to play and the rules they are played by.

Worcs beat Sussex to lift Twenty20 Blast trophy
LONDON, SaturdayL: Worcestershire won the Twenty20 Blast for the first time as they beat Sussex at Edgbaston by five wickets in the final played at Edgbaston on Saturday.
On their first appearance at Finals Day, Moeen Alis side chased a target of 158 with nine balls to spare.
Just as in their semi-final win over Lancashire earlier in the day, Worcestershire owed most to captain Moeen and wicketkeeper Ben Cox.
Moeen took 3-30 in Sussexs 157-6 before hitting 41, while Cox saw them home on 158-5 with 46 not out.
Although sadly watched by a mere 500 Worcs supporters after problems with ticket allocations to the four semi-finalists, it was still a memorable day out in Birmingham.
Coxs match-winning innings followed to his earlier 55 not out off 34 balls against Lancashire, and his winning hit for four over square leg off Jofra Archer triggered wild scenes among their small band of followers as Worcestershire celebrated their first trophy since 1994.

Work progressing on over 1,270 reawakened villages
The Housing and Construction Ministry has begun construction on more than 1,270 reawakened villages throughout the country. Our target is to complete 2,500 reawakened villages by December, 31, 2019, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
This is a big challenge. But, after completing 2,500 villages, we will begin work at another 5,000 model villages on January 1,2020. Without stopping at that, we will inaugurate work on another 10,000 model villages and thereafter on another 2,500 villages to ensure that each and every family in Sri Lanka has a roof over their heads by 2025, Minister Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting after opening the Nadeejayagama reawakened villages in Paragoda west Bulathsinhala recently.
This was the 4th reawakened village opened in the Kalutara district by his ministry so far.
Minister Premadasa said the Yahapalana Government had ensured tangible development work throughout the country.
He said however, that he was not content with the 30 new village built in the Kalutara district. The target he gave the district manager was 50 villages. But he had decided to increase this to 100 villages by year end.
Minister Premadasa said the people elected them to power with immense hope sand expectations. Therefore, it is their duty to work around the clock to fulfil these expectations.
Commending NHDA officials in the Kalutara district for a job well done in bringing the reawakened village to fruition, he added that he would grant them promotions with attendant salary increments. He said India which was inspired by the housing development program undertaken by the government had extended a credit line of 600 million Indian rupees to boost Sri Lankas housing development programme. Thereafter, India granted another 600 million Indian rupees with Cabinet approval for the housing programme in response to a request made by him. In hindsight, he was wondering whether the Opposition would conduct an agitation against Indian assistance towards the housing programme alleging that the government was selling off assets to India.
Minister Premadasa said the Opposition also agitated against the 1990 Ambulance Service donated by India. So many innocent live had been saved in this country, thanks to this ambulance service.
He said the Pohottuwa party which was smarting under the failure of is Janabalaya Colambata was trying to find a scape goat by bringing a false milk packet issue to hide its utter flop.
