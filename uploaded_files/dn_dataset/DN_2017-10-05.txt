National Food Production Plan to create agriculture revolution
The proposed national drive for an agriculture revolution would commence tomorrow countrywide under the theme Ekwemu  Negitimu, Atukotu  Purawamu.
The national programme which is the brain child of President Maithripala Sirisena and titled Jathika Aahara Nispadana Sangramaya (National Food Production Plan) will be carried out for three years with the participation of the entire farmer community. With the national drive, agro production would be boosted to produce the countrys food requirements, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanyake said that every ministry will be part of this programme which aims to increase local food production.
Under this national drive, the entire country will be subjected to a rapid agriculture revolution aiming to gain significant progress in the agricultural, sector. Besides, attention has been drawn to the progress of various other sectors including animal husbandry, industry, fisheries, etc.
Minister Dissanayake addressing the media yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat said they plan to increase the income of farmer family by three fold within three years in addition to increasing food production. The Minister said that measures will be taken to cultivate 150,000 acres of abandoned paddy lands. Other suitable crops will be cultivated on lands which are unsuitable for paddy cultivation.
Uncultivated lands would be cultivated. However, the ownership of the lands will not be changed he said.
In line with this national programme,the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority (SLMA) will carry out Mahaweli Week centralising all Mahaweli Zones from October 5 to 12. Besides, farmers in the Mahaweli Zones will be encouraged and assisted aiming to make the best use of lands, the Minister said.
He further added that with the participation of 27,000 women from Samurdhi recipient families, 27,000 home gardens will be established countrywide.
Coconut will be cultivated on 10,000 acres of land in the North Central Province to bring about a long lasting solution to the increasing prices of coconut, Minister Dissanayake said.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that the Education Ministry will also join this national drive. Accordingly, students will be encouraged to indulge in cultivation through the establishing of 1,000 home gardens in schools.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that it has been planned to add 10,000 fingerlings to inland reservoirs and tanks aiming to increase inland fish production.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said 23 Agriculture Zones will be established countrywide. The Government has planned to double the volume of exports by 2020.
Even though Sri Lanka is an agricultural country, food items amounting to Rs.300 billion are imported annually. It has now been planned to reduce this volume to Rs.150 billion by 2020, he said.
Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said that in line with the national drive, the total annual egg, milk and milk production would be increased significantly by providing farmers engaged in animal husbandry with various facilities and introducing modern technology.
Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayarathne said measures are being taken to increase the productivity of Mahaweli lands. Accordingly, it has been planned to increase the annual paddy production to 500,000 MT, Chili production to 3,856 MT and Vegetable production to 46,000 MT respectively.
We are already aware of the importance of preparing a National Agricultural Policy. Through an Agricultural Policy, the state and private sectors would be able to work together under a common plan to achieve future development goals, the minister said.
He further added that the main objective of introducing the National Food Production Plan is to boost economic growth through national food production.

Probe into conduct of Police officers on duty near refugee shelter
The Special Investigation Bureau of the Police Headquarters has begun an investigation into the conduct of Police officers who were at the scene during the agitation near a refugee shelter in Mount Lavinia that housed 31 Rohingya refugees.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the investigation is to determine whether there had been any lapse on the part of the Police Officers.
Responding to a question at a press conference at Welikada Police Station yesterday, SP Gunasekara further said two more suspects are to be arrested in connection with the Mount Lavinia incident. They are Ven. Arambepola Rathanasara Thera and Prageeth Chanaka Gunathilake.
These two suspects are absconding from the Police. Prageeth Chanaka Gunathilake has three court cases pending against him and he is out on bail from Panadura Magistrates Court. Two of those cases are about damaging religious places and one case is over threatening the Principal of a Girls school in Panadura, he said.
He said the five suspects arrested in connection with the Mount Lavinia incident would be produced for an identification parade on October 9, adding that those who violently behaved during that incident had committed a number of offenses coming under the Penal Code and several other laws.

Abortion laws should not be looked at by religious lobbyists: Dr. Deepika Udagama

Human Rights Commission Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama advocating on the revision of abortion laws in the country stressed that the public policy on health matters should not allowed to be dictated by religious lobbyists.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Dr Udagama said her Commission is in full agreement with the draft changes to the law to permit abortion under strict conditions in the case of rape and if the fetus is malformed.
Joining in the on-going debate on relaxing abortion law, the Chairperson observed the public policy on health ought to be made on the basis of strong medical and secular grounds and not on religious beliefs.
The Commission respects the religious views and freedom of speech of everybody, but these are issues that ought not to be decided on the basis of religious beliefs. Those who have such religious beliefs can make personal choices even if abortion is permitted on the above mentioned grounds, she noted.
Dr Udagama, observing that the abortion is a public health issue that affects the reproductive rights of women, highlighted the need to have a modern and healthy debate over it in Sri Lanka.
We have to look at what is going in the rest of the world as well. Sri Lanka has already undertaken obligations in this regard by ratifying to the UN convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), she said.
She recalled even in 1995, when the Government proposed an Amendment to the Penal Code with the aim to relax abortion laws, it could not be presented to Parliament due to religious lobby.
The discussion on abortion laws has been there for decades but it has always been centered on religious beliefs. It is time we think seriously on the health rights dimension of this problem. We believe it is a very important reproductive health issue for women and medical sciences do back up this position, she added.

Basil seeking petty political gain at militarys expense: Field Marshal Fonseka
Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka yesterday said former Minister Basil Rajapaksa had sought petty political gain at the expense of the entire military when he remarked in Jaffna recently that individuals within the Security Forces may have committed crimes during and after the war.
Fonseka said that Rajapaksa who was in Jaffna last week to promote his new party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, had betrayed the entire military for petty political gain.
Addressing Journalists in Colombo, Fonseka said that during the recent elections, the Tamil people in the North had clearly rejected the Rajapaksas and added that now Basil Rajapaksa was stooping to low levels to win them back for his new political party.
Fonseka also charged that those who protested when he made allegations against former Army Commander Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya of crimes, were silent about comments made by Rajapaksa.
The minister said he had only pointed the finger at one individual and said he was always of the view that if anyone has committed crimes they should be punished, irrespective of status.

The Agonshu sect was founded in 1978 by Most Venerable Seiyu Kiriyama Thera. Born on January 5, 1921, the Thera was in a difficult phase of life due to illness. Although he decided to join armed forces during the World War II, his health condition did not let him fulfill that aspiration. The doctors predicted that he cannot live more than 25 years. The Thera, still a layman then, was largely affected by this medical prediction. He was on the verge of committing suicide.
After becoming a Mahayana monk, Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera was engaged in extensive research on the Buddhas teachings.
He travelled to a number of countries to pass on the Buddhas teachings. He combined the traditions of Theravada, Mahayana and Tibet Buddhism and founded the Agonshu sect. Within a short span of time, the Agonshu sect became an instrumental tradition of Buddhist teachings across the globe. Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera became an iconic figure among the Buddhists who took up Agonshu tradition.
The Foundation has a number of noble objectives. Foremost among them is offer a helping hand to Sinhala Buddhist students with financial difficulties. Renovating Buddhist places in remote areas, equipping the youths with vocational education, providing medicines and dry rations to helpless patients and improving the infrastructure of temples and Buddhist libraries are the other core activities of the Foundation.
The 25th Scholarship Award Ceremony sponsored by the Foundation will be held at the BMICH on October 21 at 2 pm. The Silver Jubilee Scholarship Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation will be held under the patronage of Mahopadyaya Maha Nayaka of the Sri Rohana Chapter of Siyam Nikaya Most Venerable Udumalagala Sri Mahinda Nayaka Thera and delegation from the Agonshu Temple headed by Most Ven Fukada Seia Thera.

## Title: Buddhism and Western Psychotherapy

Buddhism and Western Psychotherapy
The early and mid-twentieth century saw a variety of renowned scholars, teachers, clinicians and writers in the West such as Rhys Davids, Carl Jung, Erich Fromm, Alan Watts, Jack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein have attempted to bridge and integrate psychology and Buddhism, from time to time.
Amongst them, British scholar Rhys Davids took a prominent role. He translated Abhidhamma Pitaka from Pali to English and subsequently wrote two other books titled Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics and Buddhist psychology: An inquiry into the analysis and theory of mind.
Buddhism and Western Psychology and sociology overlap in theory and in practice. Over the last century, experts have written on many commonalities between Buddhism and the various branches of modern western psychology.
For example, H.G. Wells, British historian, socialist and writer. wrote: The fundamental teachings of Gautama, as it is now being made plain to us by study of original sources, is clear and simple and in the closest harmony with modern ideas. It is beyond all disputes the achievement of one of the most penetrating intelligence the world has ever known. Buddhism is the advance of world civilization and true culture than any other influence in the chronicles of mankind.
Noble truths
Buddha was commonly referred to as the greatest physician and like any therapist, made it his aim to identify, explain and end human suffering. His therapeutic methods helped millions of people throughout the centuries.
The Four Noble Truths which the Buddha discovered is a diagnostic format to explain human suffering and its cure; the first Noble Truth identifies the disease, the second provides cause of the disease, the third gives a prognosis, and the fourth suggests a remedy.
Psychotherapy
Today the Western world has realized the psychological essence of Buddhism. Many Psychotherapeutic systems in the West are derived from Buddha's teaching.
Buddha showed empathy and non-judgmental acceptance to everyone who came to him. He helped people to gain insight and helped in growth promotion while eliminating troubling and painful emotions. His therapeutic methods are exceptional and can be applied for all times.
Joseph Levine, the American philosopher, suggests a number of commonalities between Buddhism and Western psychology: Both are concerned with alleviating human suffering. Both focus on the human condition and interpret it in natural rather than religious terms. Both see humans as caught in a matrix of forces, including cravings and drives, based in biology and beliefs.
Both teach the appropriateness of compassion, concern, and unconditional positive regard toward all beings. Both share the ideal of maturing and growth. And both acknowledge that the mind functions at a superficial and deep level.
Psychoanalysis
Carl Jung, renowned a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, says, In addition to being a religion, Buddhism gives voice to a philosophy, a psychology, and ethics as well. The primary concern of the Buddhism is to understand the nature of experience, and thus the reality on which it focuses is conscious reality. For this reason, the philosophical enterprise of the Buddhism shades off into a phenomenological psychology.
Many modern psychologists have found that the discoveries and explanations of the Buddhism coincide with their own recent discoveries and new ideas; as though the Buddhist principles, which was taught 2,500 years ago, had been redeveloped in the modern times.
Buddha said that life is suffering. Existential psychology speaks of ontological anxiety (dread, angst). Buddha said that suffering is due to attachment. Existential psychology also has some similar concepts. We cling to things in the hope that they will provide us with a certain benefit.
Buddha also said that suffering can be extinguished by attaining nirvana. The Buddhist concept of nirvana is quite similar to the existential psychologists concept of freedom. This concept has, in fact, been used in Buddhism in the context of freedom from rebirth or freedom from the effects of karma. For the existential psychologist, freedom is a fact of our being, one which we often ignore.
Finally, Buddha explained the path to attain nirvana in order to extinguish suffering.
For the existential psychologist, the therapist must take an assertive role in helping the subject (patient) become aware of the reality of his or her suffering and its roots. Likewise, the subject must take an assertive role in working towards improvementeven though it means facing the fears theyve been working so hard to avoid.
Right Mindfulness
Right Mindfulness traditionally is the seventh part of the noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism, but that doesn't mean it is seventh in importance. Each part of the path supports the other seven parts, and so they should be thought of as connected in a circle or woven into a web rather than stacked in an order of progression.
Some Buddhist teachers maintain that Right Mindfulness is at the heart of the Buddha's teaching.
The Pali word for mindfulness is sati which can mean "retention," "recollection," or "alertness." Mindfulness is a whole-body-and-mind awareness of the present moment. Being fully mindful means being fully attentive to everything as-it-is, not filtering everything through our subjective opinions.
Buddhistic mindfulness practices have been explicitly integrated into a variety of psychological treatments. More specifically psychotherapies dealing with cognitive restructuring share core principles with Buddhistic mindfulness practices to personal suffering.
Erich Fromm, German psychologist and psychoanalyst, distinguishes between two types of meditative techniques that have been used in psychotherapy: (i) auto-suggestion used to induce relaxation; and (ii) meditation to achieve a higher degree of non-attachment, of non-greed, and of non-illusion; briefly, those that serve to reach a higher level of being. Fromm attributes techniques associated with the latter to Buddhist mindfulness practices.
Meditative techniques
Another popular program that incorporates mindfulness to assist people with pain and a range of conditions and life issues is known as MBSR (Mindfulness-based stress reduction). It is meant for people who were initially difficult to treat in a hospital setting. Developed by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn of University of Massachusetts (USA) in 1970, MBSR uses a combination of Buddhist mindfulness meditation and body awareness, and also certain yogic exercises to help people become more mindful.
In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been the subject of controlled clinical research. This suggests it may have beneficial effects, including stress reduction, relaxation, and improvements to quality of life, but that it does not help prevent or cure disease.
Another prominent therapy that uses mindfulness is MBCT (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy developed by Zindel Segal. MBCT is designed to help people who suffer repeated bouts of depression and chronic unhappiness. It combines the ideas of cognitive therapy with meditative practices and attitudes based on the cultivation of mindfulness. The heart of this work lies in becoming acquainted with the modes of mind that often characterize mood disorders while simultaneously learning to develop a new relationship to them.
Kabat-Zinn, wrote: Although at this time, mindfulness meditation is most commonly taught and practiced within the context of Buddhism, its essence is universal. Yet it is no accident that mindfulness comes out of Buddhism, which has as its overriding concerns the relief of suffering and the dispelling of illusions.
Not surprisingly, in terms of clinical diagnoses, MBSR and MBCT have proven beneficial for people with depression and anxiety disorders; however, the program is meant to serve anyone experiencing significant stress.
Many of the principles like MBSR and MBCT incorporated in the theory of rational-emotive psychotherapy are not new.
They were used in Buddhist countries several thousands of years ago. To give one example, Buddhism identifies anger and ill-will as basic hindrances to spiritual development. A common Buddhistic antidote for anger is the use of active contemplation of loving thoughts (Metta). This is similar to using a MCBT technique known as emotional training.

CEB to purchase 100 megawatts
The Ceylon Electricity Board has received Cabinet approval to purchase 100 megawatts of supplementary power by entering into Independent Power Purchase agreements, if the countrys utility provider fails to meet the peak hour demand of 1800 megawatts during the next few months.
Speaking to the Daily News, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary, Dr. Suren Batagoda said tenders will be called as early as next week and the lowest bidder will be chosen through a competitive international bidding process.
Dr. Batagoda referred to the additional purchase as supplementary power citing that emergency power negates the need of a tender process. Were currently purchasing a unit of power from the CEB plants at Rs.50, however in the past weve purchased power at Rs.28 by entering into similar IPP agreements, hence we feel that this might be a more economical way of saving up.
He also added that should there be an unexpected interruption in the grid, power will not be disrupted due to the availability of supplementary power. We are relying heavily on gas turbines which are required to meet the peak hour demand between 6pm to 10 pm. However if the supplementary power is available, we will not need the gas turbines.
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has warned of serious consequences if the CEB does not forge ahead with long-term generation plan.
Shortcoming of implementation of Sri Lankas Least cost longterm generation expansion plans (LCLTGEP) has resulted in cost overruns, load shedding, and unplanned power procurement in the past few years, the PUCSL said in a statement.

Prestige is not yours, Mr Clean!
Arjuna Ranatunga earned the Mr Clean accolade after winning the 1996 World Cup. But following the appointment of his brother to the position of Ports Authority Chairperson while being the minister, Mr Clean lost the sheen. His brother is neither qualified nor credited with any relevant experience.
Minister Ranatunga condemns the SLC on a regular basis. He slams Thilanga Sumathipala, a respectable and decent politician. Little has he realised that his family had been in this legal business for quite long. Mr Clean is blind to the fact that Sumathipala is well positioned to point the fingers at Ranatungas family as one full of fraudsters. Arjunas brother, Prasanna Ranatunga, for instance, has been indicted in the court for a colossal fraud. Nishantha, another Ranatunga sibling was a shameless part of many frauds such as the missing golden rivet while holding the prestigious position of Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary a few years ago. Thanks to the heavy political backing, Nishantha could escape the investigations.
It is now amusing  or hilarious, rather - to see this so-called Mr Clean seeking the intervention of the Mahanayaka Thera to intervene and save the SLC.
He always accuses the Sport Minister of not being knowledgeable about cricket. It is not foolish to seek the Mahanayakas intervention. His motive is clear. Ranatunga wants his sibling back on the wheel.

IS conflict: Iraqi army 'recaptures central Hawija'

Iraqi forces say they have recaptured the centre of the town of Hawija, one of the last enclaves of so-called Islamic State (IS) in the country.
Hawija, where tens of thousands of civilians live, has been under the militant group's control since 2014.
Once the surrounding area falls, IS will be left controlling only a stretch of land along the border with Syria.
On Wednesday, the Iraqi army said it had killed 196 IS militants and recaptured 98 villages around Hawija.
Troops, police and paramilitaries "liberated the whole of the centre of Hawija and are continuing their advance", the operation's commander, Lieutenant General Abdel Amir Yarallah, said on Thursday morning.
On Tuesday, Iraqi forces captured the Rashad air base south of the city, which was used as a training camp by the militants.
The UN said on Tuesday up to 78,000 civilians were still trapped in Hawija. Iraqi security forces said IS militants were preventing some people from leaving and might have laid explosives around the town.
About 12,500 people had fled since the army's operation began two weeks ago, according to the UN. It is unclear though how many civilians have escaped in the past couple of days.
Iraq's army, alongside militia allies and backed by airstrikes from the US-led coalition, has been engaged in a sustained offensive against IS' self-styled caliphate, retaking the country's second largest city Mosul in July after a nine-month battle.
IS continues to hold parts of Syria.

Crossing the realm of death
In South Asia, during the rainy season, the monsoons rains come pouring down mightily and heavily. When the rains pour down, the rivers swell up and widen, and their current becomes fierce and tumultuous. Seemingly out of nowhere, many streams previously non-existent appear throughout the countryside.
The water from the rain sweeps down over the mountains and hills, filling up the creeks and brooks until they too become rivers. Yet despite the arrival of the rainy season, people still have to move from place to place  for business, shopping, or family affairs  and to travel to distant destinations they often have to cross these rivers. For this reason the image of crossing a river, of moving from this shore to the far shore, plays a prominent role in the different forms of Indian religion and spirituality, and Buddhism too makes ample use of this image.
Within this image, this shore represents samsara, the round of rebirths through which all unenlightened sentient beings have been roaming and wandering without any first point in time. Samsara is divided into various realms. Those beings who run up and down this shore are those who move from one plane of existence to another, without seeing any route of escape.
Ancient Indian mythology
Sometimes they go from a lower realm to a higher realm, sometimes from a higher realm to a lower realm. But, whether they go up or down, they are like animals in a cage, just running in circles without getting anywhere. What keeps us bound to this round of rebirths, according to the Buddha, is our ignorance and craving, which in conjunction with our volitional actions (karma) drive us to one realm or another.
Some modern interpreters of Buddhism say that this whole teaching about karma and rebirth is part of ancient Indian mythology that the Buddha just accepted and took on board as part of his Indian cultural heritage. They say that if we are to make Buddhism meaningful for modern people, we should strip away all these ancient cultural accretions and devise a version of Buddhism that applies exclusively to life here and now. If we take this attitude, it seems were directly challenging the enlightenment of the Buddha.
The Buddha didnt say that these teachings of karma and rebirth should be accepted because they belong to the Indian spiritual heritage. He says, rather, that he has realized and seen these things for himself. To remove these teachings from Buddhist doctrine is in effect to remove the world-transcending aspect of the Dharma, leaving us with a version of Buddhism that is little more than a sophisticated ancient psychotherapy. Its a little bit like taking a car and then thinking, Why should we keep the tires on the car It would really look much better without them. So we remove the tires, convinced that now we have a really super-looking car. But if we get in and try to drive, we dont get anywhere. From this we can see how important it is to preserve the integrity of the original teaching by retaining these doctrines.
So, in the Buddhist worldview, this shore is samsara, the cycle of rebirth driven by ignorance, craving, and karma; and the far shore is Nirvana, the birth less and deathless. Whereas samsara is the realm of suffering and commotion, Nirvana is the state of supreme bliss and peace. The task the Buddha sets before us is to move from this present shore of samsara to the far shore of Nirvana; and what takes us across from the near shore to the far shore is the Buddhist path. That is why the Buddha compares his teaching to a raft: it enables us to cross the stream and reach the far shore.
Dhamma practice
In the verse the Buddha says: those who in this well-expounded Dhamma practice in accordance with the Dhamma. If we examine the discourses spoken by the Buddha, we can easily see that they are well expounded. First, theyre completely clear. Even though they might be deep in meaning, the thinking they display is razor sharp, not at all vague or muddled. The teachings are consistent; they all fit together into one piece. Ethically, the teachings are impeccable; one cant find any faults in them. They are realistic in that they describe things the way they really are; the teachings dont lead us down a garden path into realms of wishful fantasy.
The Buddhas approach is non-dogmatic and experiential. When one practices the Dhamma, one can see for oneself that it brings beneficial results right here and now. On this basis, one can develop the confidence that if one practices diligently one will eventually win liberation from all suffering.
In order to gain liberation from the realm of death, its not enough just to have an excellent or well-expounded teaching. Above all, its of prime important to practice it. The practice of the teaching unfolds methodically and systematically, stage by stage. One has to begin by leading a moral life, by accepting the precepts and disciplining ones conduct in harmony with the precepts. By accepting and following the precepts, one transforms ones behaviour so that it conforms to the ideal standards of the noble ones.
Then, on the basis of morality, one has to develop concentration or samadhi. Concentration is the process of learning how to make the mind calm, composed, and inwardly focused. When the mind is concentrated, one undertakes the development of praja, wisdom. Wisdom is the insight or understanding that arises from direct contemplation of phenomena. It discerns, perceives, and recognizes the true nature of things, their true characteristics.
The true characteristics of phenomena as taught by the Buddha are threefold. The first is the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena. The second is the dissatisfaction of all conditioned phenomena, the fact that all conditioned phenomena are in some way bound up with suffering, unable to satisfy our yearning for perfect security. The third is the selfless nature of all phenomena, the fact that all phenomena are devoid of any substantial self or intrinsic essence. Of these three characteristics, the deepest and most difficult to see is selflessness, yet it is just this that must be seen if we are to cut the bonds that hold us to the round of birth and death.
As our wisdom matures, it cuts through subtler and subtler layers of ignorance and craving, until it cuts off the fetter of ignorance entirely, just like cutting through a leather strap. As we cut through the fetter of ignorance, the four bonds fall away. With the first cut, the bond of wrong views falls away.
With the next cut, the craving for sense pleasures falls away. With the third cut, the craving for continued existence falls away. And with the last cut, the subtlest bond of ignorance falls away. When we accomplish this, we have crossed the stream and reached the final goal  the far shore of Nirvana.

Deities in Buddhism
It is often asked if there are gods in Buddhism. The short answer is no, but also yes, depending on what you mean by gods.
It also is often asked if it is all right for a Buddhist to believe in God, meaning the creator God as celebrated in Christianity, Judaism, Islam and other philosophies of monotheism. Again, this depends on what you mean by God. As most monotheists define God, the answer is probably no. But there are lots of ways to understand the principle of God.
Lets start with poytheistic-type gods. In the worlds religions these have been understood in many ways, Most commonly, they are supernatural beings with some kind of agency---they control the weather, for example, or they might help you win victories. The classic Roman and Greek gods and goddesses are examples.
Practice in a religion based on polytheism mostly consists of practices to cause these gods to intercede on ones behalf.
If you deleted them the various gods, there wouldnt be a religion at all.
In traditional Buddhist folk religion, on the other hand, the devas are usually depicted as characters living in a number of other realms, separate from the human realm. They have their own problems and have no roles to play in the human realm.
There is no point praying to them even if you believe in them, because theyre not going to do anything for you.

despairing Sharapova out of Beijing
Beijing: Maria Sharapova opened up on the despair she feels in defeat after she was ruthlessly knocked out of the China Open in the third round by Romanias Simona Halep on Wednesday.
The world number two was an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 winner to leave five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova still searching for her first title since returning from a doping ban in April.
It was the 26-year-old Haleps first victory over the Russian in eight meetings.
Sharapova, a former number one now at 104 in the world rankings following her 15-month suspension for taking meldonium, gave an insight into the rollercoaster of emotions in top-level tennis.
Hard work is not good enough any more, maybe it was I dont know how many years ago but thats just not a factor any more, said the 30-year-old, asked about comments in a book she recently released.
The reason I say that is theres some incredible moments, very high moments, and there are very low moments.
There have been times where I get off the court and you think, I dont wish this on my future child.
The feeling is so tough and disappointing.
Halep, the second seed on Beijings outdoor hard courts, is the first woman into the quarter-finals, where she will play either defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska or Daria Kasatkina of Russia.
With world number one Garbine Muguruza exiting in the first round with a virus, Halep is now favourite.
Sharapova said it was the best Halep had played against her and Halep agreed.
The two met in the first round at the US Open a few weeks ago and Halep said she was delighted to finally taste victory against Sharapova: Im really happy that I could do this.
Its my first victory against her and I just want to enjoy the moment. AFP

Fisheries Minister to crack down on blast fishing
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the Police and Navy to strictly enforce the law against fishermen who engage in blast fishing or dynamite fishing.
During the advisory committee meeting held recently at the Ministry, Minister Amaraweera instructed relevant authorities to raid and arrest persons engaged in dynamite fishing and transporting and selling those fish.
The Minister further instructed the security forces to look for the persons selling explosives to the fishermen and arrest them too.
Blast fishing or dynamite fishing is the practice of using explosives to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection and this illegal practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding ecosystem, since the explosion often destroys the underlying habitat such as coral reefs that supports the fish, said the Minister.
During the meeting the representatives from fishery unions briefed the minister that dynamite fishing has increased in the Eastern province, causing huge damage to the ecosystem. The officials also stated that such fish are likely to rot and become inedible quickly.
The Director General of the Fisheries Department said that around 352 raids have been conducted by department officials following public information. The persons arrested have been produced before court.

Fresh Bids For Tuticorin, Colombo Ferry Service
The government will once again call for Expressions of Interest (EOI) for the ferry service between Tuticorin, India and Colombo.
The procurement process initiated in January had only attracted two proposals and the Ceylon Shipping Corporation and Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee had recommended that the previous procurement process be cancelled and fresh bids be called for.
It was pointed out that not much interest had been generated towards the project initially due to inadequate publicity provided to it.
The Ferry Service which used to operate prior to the war came to a standstill with the breaking out of hostilities in the North. In 2011, the government decided to relaunch it but was soon stopped due to less traffic.
But the Foreign Affairs Ministry this year said it will also consider freight services in addition to passenger services, to make it more economically viable. The ferry service is an important project for both countries across the Palk Straits as an initiative which will not only increase connectivity between the two countries but also one that would be both culturally and economically significant.

Glee actor Mark Salling admits possessing child sex abuse images

Former Glee actor Mark Salling has pleaded guilty to possession of images of child sex abuse.
Salling, 35, now faces between four and seven years in prison and has been ordered to pay about $50,000 (38,000) to each victim.
The actor was arrested in 2015 after a tip off he was in possession of images of children being sexually abused.
Investigators eventually found thousands of images on his laptop and hard drive.
Salling was charged with two counts of receiving and possessing images of child sexual abuse in May 2016, and faced a possible 20 years behind bars.
But documents obtained by several outlets show he has entered into a plea deal with California's district attorney.
As part of the agreement, Salling will be subject to 20 years supervised release and will have strict restrictions placed on his contact with under-18s, accordingto celebrity website TMZ.
Salling played bad-boy football player Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the hit US show Glee from 2009 to 2015.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President and the Prime Minister expressing its objection on the appointment of Prof. Colvin Goonaratne as the new President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing media during a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that Prof. Goonaratne is well known for his pro-SAITM stand and his appointment is not acceptable to the majority of SLMC registrants and organisations representing them. He is also involved in the pharmaceutical industry as an advisor.
According to Dr. Aluthge, Prof. Goonaratne was the only SLMC member who voted against appealing against the Appeal Court Judgment given, ordering the SLMC to register a SAITM medical student. There was a meeting at the SLMC which was headed by then SLMC President Carlo Fonseka to decide what to do in connection with the judgement. Only Prof. Goonaratne wanted to register the SAITM student at the SLMC and all the others in the SLMC opposed it. That is how an appeal was made at the Supreme Court by the SLMC against the Court of Appeal judgement. Now the court case is ongoing.
The GMOA has received information that the Health Minister made the appointment after discussing it with the SAITM owner. While the Judiciary and the SLMC is trying their best to safeguard the peoples' right to life and safety, the Health Minister tactically acted to defeat those efforts, he added.

Investigation called on death of heart transplant patient
The Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister has called for a complete investigation into the cause of death of the second heart transplant patient.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said it was not the surgery but a post-operative infection which was the likely cause of death of the patient.
The patient, 19-year-old Sachini Sewwandi passed away on Saturday (30) at the Kandy General Hospital. The cause of death was said to be high blood pressure in the lungs.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday, he reiterated that there was no sign of sabotage in the case.
I had discussions with the surgeon concerned and he explained his side to me. The childs disease was only seen through one angle. The surgeon had been warned not to undertake this operation but he had gone ahead with all the inputs from his senior professors and was well prepared. From his side, he did it well. The heart started to pump and the child regained consciousness, he explained.
The operation has been rife with controversy from the start with a tug of war between the surgeons at the hospital having caused delays to the operation. They had also complained that they were not given the right machines to undertake the operation.
Minister Senaratne however, explained that he had made all the arrangements to get the machines they needed and that they started with all the necessary equipment.
The operation was successful and the patient recovered faster than the first one. She was young and so was her heart, said the Minister.
He added that she would have caught the infection during her recovery in the ICU.
Senaratne said they were awaiting the microbiological report on the patient to further confirm their initial findings.

Itll be Johnson 2.0 in Ashes, warns Starc
Sydney: Fast bowler Mitchell Starc warned England to expect a repeat of the carnage caused by Mitchell Johnson four years ago when Australia unleash their pace attack in the upcoming Ashes Tests.
A fully firing Australian attack looks formidable, with spearhead Starc returning this week from a foot injury to vie for a place with Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jackson Bird and James Pattinson.
With England's top order largely unproven, Starc said it could be much like the 2013-2014 Ashes, when the mustachioed Johnson took 37 wickets with terrifying pace as Australia won 5-0.
"We've got a really solid attack and we complement each other," he said in the Sydney Daily Telegraph Wednesday.
"If it's not me, you've got Pat Cummins who can bowl fast bouncers and Josh Hazlewood bowling consistent line and length.
"It'll be much like that attack did when Johnno took all those wickets, I think we complement each other really well.
"Throw in Jackson Bird, and Coulter-Nile is back bowling really well. So we've got five really good guys there and if Patto is fit to go, six."
With Starc again raring to go, Pattinson is the only injury cloud with inflammation in his back. But England are in a state of disarray ahead of their arrival in late October.
As well as an unsettled batting line-up, they could be without talismanic all-rounder Ben Stokes, who is suspended until further notice after his arrest during a night out.
Starc believes there is a chance for Australia's bowlers to land early psychological blows on England, whose top order is relatively inexperienced aside from Alastair Cook and Joe Root.
"They've obviously got Root and Cook up the top, who have played a lot of cricket and are probably their main guys with the bat," he said.
"The guys in the top order around them are pretty inexperienced and, hopefully, we can exploit that here in our home conditions."
Despite this, Starc is not underestimating England, even without Stokes.
"He probably makes their team a bit more balanced but he's not the be all and end all of their team.
There's plenty of guys we need to worry about."

Kandy-Colombo luxury bus timetables not practical
It is not practical to operate buses according to the timetables given by the Chairman of the National Transport Commission. Both bus owners and commuters will fall into difficulties if buses are operated according to them, Chairman Kandy-Colombo Luxury Bus Services Company Newton Pieris said.
Addressing a press conference held at Devon Rest, Kandy, Peiris said, timetables were prepared by obtaining the services of a group of people devoid of practical knowledge on bus operations and buses could not be operated according to such impractical timetables. He said, according to the new timetable, a luxury bus leaving Colombo at 5.15 am should reach Kandy at 8.30 am and it should be parked in the bus terminal at 9 am to start the return journey to Colombo at 9.20 am.
Accordingly, a bus should cover the Colombo-Kandy trip in 3 hours and 13 minutes and only half an hour is available for the bus crew to have breakfast and morning ablutions. This was quite impractical and the Commission Chairman tried to dodge questions after introducing impractical timetables.
Although an appointment was sought from the Chairman through Higher Education and Highways Minister to discuss matters, there had been no response from him on two such occasions.
Even though finally an opportunity for a discussion was given last week, the Chairman ended up avoiding it too saying he had no time.
Pieris alleged that the Commission Chairman had been so vicious as to lodge a false complaint of assault against bus owners to Police and take them to Court. Pieris said, the Commission Chairman should take responsibility if commuters faced any accident when drivers operated under pressure according to the present timetable.

Katina the moment of goodness
Katina Pinkama or offering of robes to Bhikkhus takes place on Vap Pasalosvaka Poya in temples throughout Sri Lanka. Religious ceremonies mark the conclusion of the Vas period for the Bhikkhus.
This notable religious ceremony called Katina Pinkama, as usual, takes place in the early hours of Vap Poya. Before sunrise, the devotees make their way in Perahera to the temple where Bhikkhus have spent three months confining themselves till the end of the Vas or rainy season that begins after Esala Poya.
It was the practice during the time of the Buddha for his followers who had given up their lay life to sojourn with the idea of propagating the Buddha Dhamma. This practice continued even during the rainy season.
The Buddha once saw his followers walking in the rain with their robes wet and advised them to confine themselves to Aramas or temples. The rainy season Vassana or Vas evolved into an elaborate religious ceremony over the years. In Sri Lanka, with the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BC Bhikkhus spent their time in temples during the Vas period when they received the special attention of the lay people.
Bhikkhus are expected to discuss matters relating to their faith with lay people who visit temples. The requirements of the Sangha are met after inquiring into their needs.
On the day of Vap Poya, Katina Pinkama is held in which robes are offered to the Sangha in a ceremony to accrue merit.
Vas period of the Buddha
Special attention is paid to Bhikkhus who observed the Vas period in keeping with the practices performed from the time of the Buddha.
There are other incidents connected with the life of the Buddha. The first sermon based on Abhidhamma was delivered by the Buddha to the devas (deities) in Tusita heaven before returning to the city of Sankassa in India was called in ancient times.
Thus began the visit of the Buddha in propagating his doctrine. The first sermon by him was delivered to his five disciples who became his followers after they were convinced about the true nature of things in life.
With the first Vas period of the Buddha, the 61 people who became followers of the Buddha renounced all their worldly things in preference to lead the life of recluse mendicants.
Another notable event that happened in Sri Lanka on Vap Poya was the sending of emissaries by King Devanampiyatissa to Emperor Asoka of Dambadiva asking him to send a Bo sapling of Sri Mahabodhi in Bodh Gaya.
It was brought by Theri Sanghamitta within a period of six months after the arrival of Arahant Mahinda during the time King Devanampiyatissa who ruled the country from Anuradhapura.
The Council of Bhikkhus met to rectify the Vinaya rules meant for the Bhikkhus. This was done in case any abbreviations were found in the Vinaya rules written in books and corrected.
Centre of religious observance
The Vap Full Moon Poya is important on account of the Katina Pinkama when the ceremony of the offering of the new robe is held as an important event of the year.
For the ceremony, a white cloth is cut in the form of ridges of paddy fields, sewn, dyed and dried and then made into a robe. The robe is taken round in the early hours of the day (before daybreak) in a procession to the temple.
The temple becomes the centre of religious observance. During the night Bhikkhus chant pirith and after offering gilanpasa, heel dana, dana, the night after Vap Poya, bana preaching follows. It is then that Katina robes are offered to one Bhikkhu on behalf of the Sangha.
The Bhikkhus who had received Upasampada (higher ordination) are entitled to observe vas. The practice is only one Katina Pinkama can be held in a temple even if there are many Bhikkhus who had observed vas.
Mahavagga describes how Katina Pinkamas and observing vas began. The first vas period was observed by the Buddha and his five disciples at Isipathanarama, setting an example for others to follow.
It is seen from these ceremonies that lay people take a keen interest in the welfare of the Sangha providing them with the necessary material required. On the day of Katina Pinkama, a branch of a mango or jak tree is placed in the premises of the Bana Maduwa where offerings are hung as offering to the Sangha. It is called the Kap Ruka, wish-conferring tree.

In the past they have produced several top class teams and cricketers. At Kingswood cricket takes pride of a place and many cricketers have enjoyed the game.
Some of the best products Kingswood has produced are Maurice Fernando who in 1958 brought honor to the school when he was unanimously chosen as the Schoolboy cricketer of the year by a panel comprising eminent cricketing personalities.
On his way to the award he beat Lareef Idroos, Michael Tissera (S. Thomas College), Sarath Silva (Nalanda College), S.W. Seneviratne (St. Anthonys College) and Russell Duckworth (St. Peter's College).

Once again the lads from Randles Hills are fortunate to have the service of old Antonian Indika Fernando as coach.
Last year he guided them to win one outright and five on first innings. They should enjoy another good season. Fernando played for St. Anthony's College from 1994 to 1996, and was a right-hand bat and a right-arm leg- spinner.
Later he played Sara Trophy cricket for Kandy Cricket Club and Kandy Youth Sports Club. He has completed his Level one and two coaching courses organized by Sri Lanka Cricket and conducted by Australians Terry Oliver and Darren Holcer. His assistant coach is an old Rajan Harsha Udara a level III SLC qualified coach who played for his school for four years. Jagath Pushpakumara is the physical trainer and the experienced Sarath Ekanayake is the MIC.
This season Kingswood played their first match with Vidyartha College at Police grounds matting wicket which ended in a draw. On the same wicket they played St Thomas College Matale but their tournament game against Royal College was postponed due to wet weather.
On October 3-4 they will play St. Anthonys College at Katugastota, 9th-10th vs Sri Sumangala College in Panadura, 19-20 St. Sylvesters College in Kandy, November 1-2 Wesley College in Colombo, 9-10 Dharmaloka College Kelaniya at Kirindiwella, 2018 January, 11-12 with St .Johns College Jaffna in Kandy. 18-19 Piliyandala Central in Kandy, 25-26 Kegalu Vidyalaya in Kandy, February 1-2 Sri Piyaratne College Padukka in Kandy, 22-23 St. Thomas College Matara in Kandy, 27-28 St. Marys Kegalle in Kurunegala, March 16-17 (Big Match) vs Dharmaraja College at Pallekelle, and the one day on 25th at Pallekelle.
This year they are led by fourth year coloursman Ganidu Kamburugam, who bats left hand in the middle order. He is also a fine off spinner and a good close in fielder. Last season, he scored over 350 runs and took 42 wickets. This year much is expected from him with bat and ball and also as captain. He has two deputies, Dulin Wijenarayane in his third year, a good left hand batsman and the stumper of the side, and Saumya Piyasena, also a third year player who bats left hand and bowls off spin.
The rest of the players in the squad are Dhananjaya Maduranga a left hand batsman, who is also a good wicket keeper, Deegayu Bandara a third year bats right hand and a right arm fast bowler, Uthpala Jayalath second year a right arm fast bowler and middle order hard-hitting bat, Kashan Vithanarahchi second year and right handed bat, Madhwa Dhanajaya second year off spinner, Hashika Gamage fresher a steady right hand bat and leg spinner, Dumindu Dharmasala fresher a left hand opening batsman, Lakmal de Silva fresher a steady left arm spinner, Harshana Wickramasinghe right arm medium paceman and Dilsha Senaratne a right arm fast bowler.

Kusal will come right soon - Tillakaratne
DUBAI, Wednesday: Batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne said that it was only a matter of time before Kusal Mendis, one of the most exciting young finds for Sri Lanka would start to make the big scores that he is capable of.
Mendis in recent innings has had a lean run that in his last eight innings in Tests and ODIs he has failed to pass 50. His last innings of note was the hundred he scored against India in the SSC Test.
Mendis was even rested for the fifth ODI against India to allow him to recover mentally as he had been playing continuous cricket since his Test debut against West Indies in 2015.
I think he is a talented young guy. Just that he got hundred against India and he is working hard and he will come back strong. We are working on his back foot play and leg side play and he is a very keen student. I am sure they way he is working he will come right, said batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne.
While Mendis has been struggling to find his form another young exciting cricketer Niroshan Dickwella is showing maturing in his batting in comparison to his approach during the Indian series.
It is very pleasing to see someone adapting to the condition so well and he is one of the top players for Sri Lanka. He has improved his batting zone well and he is a very keen student and he is performing very well, said Tillakaratne.
He is very talented and skillful and we dont want to change his game but the first few 50 balls it is very important and after that it is upto him to play his shots
Tillakaratne said that he
was pleased the way the Lankan batsmen ran up a total of 419 in the first innings in trying conditions.
We had a good batting plan and all the batsmen batted according to it. There is no guarantee when you got to bat that all the batsmen can get a hundred or a fifty but partnerships were very good, said Tillakaratne.
It was very pleasing to see skipper Chandimal getting a big score and showing the other players how to do it.
He has been working very hard the last few weeks and it is pleasing to see him get 155 not out. Dimuth 93 and Dilruwan and Dickwella also contributed.
Sri Lanka will be making their debut in a night Test and playing with a pink ball for the first time and Tillakaratne said that everyone was looking forward to it.
It is something new to us, we did have a net at Khetterama. How much the pink ball defers from the red depends on the condition. At Khetterama it moved a bit, here we have to wait and see.
We watched Pakistan playing against West Indies and the ball did not do much and it was a good batting track, he said.

Lankan passenger hid two kg  of gold in stomach, rectum
VISAKHAPATNAM: Around two kg of gold was recovered from the stomach and rectum of a Sri Lankan passenger who was detained by the Customs officials on his arrival at the Vizag airport. The doctors of King George Hospital, where the passenger was kept under observation for more than 24 hours, recovered 16 packets of gold weighing around 125 gm each.
The passenger boarded a SriLankan Airways flight on Colombo and landed at Vizag airport at around 9.30 am on Sunday. Growing suspicious over the awkward gait of the passenger, the Customs officials detained him. He was shifted to KGH for full body scanning and the reports confirmed that he was carrying gold in his stomach and rectum.
A team comprising a radiologist, a general surgeon, a physician and other doctors recovered the gold packets from the stomach of the passenger through natural excretion method by administering laxatives.
According to the sources, the customs officials recovered two gold packets from the passenger on Sunday itself. On Monday and Tuesday, the KGH doctors recovered 14 gold packets.
Asked about how the accused managed to carry the gold packets, KGH superintendent G Arjuna said, The passenger seems to be a professional smuggler. He might have cut the gold bars into small pieces of 1 to 1.5 inch each and packed them in 16 black polythene packets neatly stitched with a sliding tape which might have helped him swallow them. The sliding tape also ensured the free movement of the packets through the stomach and rectum. - THE NEW INDIAN EXPRESS

It is believed that the merit you gain is solid like a rock. It can be never shaken. It is so powerful. The Katina Cheevara is exclusively offered to those monks of the order, who observed rain retreat know as Vas. During this rainy period, months stay indoors. They perform their meritorious deeds and attend to religious activities in their temples.
While turning the pages of Vinaya Parivara Pali mentors would say: Katinassa Attharamaso Janitabbo, which means beware, it is also called the Katina Masaya the month of Katina Robe, which will be presented to the monk.

Higher ordination
They are the ones who have received Upasampada or higher ordination. There are two kinds of Buddhist ordination. The lower by which a man becomes a novice Samanera, the higher by which a Novice, becomes a monk, headed by a senior monk at least 10 years standing, taking part in set form for ordaining of novices and monks.
The prestigious Sri Lankan history reveals that from the time of Devanampiyatissa, during the Anuradhapura period. Vap Poya religious ceremonies were performed in Sri Lanka during the region of great Parakramabahu I. He donated Katina Cheevaras to 80 temples. King Parakramabahu VI donated 3432 Katina robes. The last ruler to offer the Katina Cheevara was King Rajadhirajasinha.
Another important incident that took place is related to the Future Buddha, Maitreya. In his Sansara journey as Bodhisattva, Maitreya Buddha entered the order on a Vap Poya Day. King Devanampiyatissa sent a diplomatic delegation headed by Foreign Affairs Minister Aritta to India to meet Emperor Asoka on a Vap Poya Day.

NEW CONSTITUTION  NEEDED - Malwatte Prelate
Can devolve power, without dividing country 
The country needs a constitution which devolves power without dividing the country and does no harm to the nation and religion.
The misunderstanding certain groups have that power devolution amounts to a division creates a wrong picture to the outside world, Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake thera of the Malwatte Chapter said.
The Malwatte prelate made this observation when a delegation of the National Movement for a new constitution called on him at his Aramaya in Kandy on October 3.
The delegation included Dr. Wickremabahu Karunaratne, Ravaya Editor K.W. Janaranjana, Saman Ratnapriya, Gamini Viyangoda and Ven Mahagalkadawara Punnasara Nayake thera.
Dr Wickramabahu Karunaratne expressing his views on the occasion said they had arrived in Kandy that day to participate in a satyagraha campaign.
Certain groups were making misleading statements alleging that the proposed new constitution was harmful for democracy and Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism had gained world repute and recognition since some predictions made by the Buddha had been approved scientifically today. If people resorted to tribal behaviour it would be anti-Buddhist.
Dr Karunaratne said they had fruitful discussions with the Malwatte prelate. The Mahanayake thera also took the position that the constitution needed to be changed.
The prelate also pointed out the need for a discussion among the Maha Sangha on this issue. Some Parliamentarians were making false public statements quite in contrast to the stand taken by them in Parliament and the Steering Committee stages. The standpoint taken by the Malwatte prelate when Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardene called on him was a great source of strength for those campaigning for a new constitution which was the need of the hour.
Translation of the proposed interim report to other languages may involve certain misinterpretations which could be ironed out. But the fact remained that the country needed this new constitution, Karunaratne said.
Gamini Viyangoda said they were conducting the satyagraha in Kandy after staging a similar campaign in Colombo. Their objective was to ensure the fulfilment of election pledges given by the Yahapalana government and appreciate the pledges fulfilled already. Devolution of power to the peripheries and the abolution of the Executive Presidency were absolutely necessary, he said.
The incidents experienced in 1978 proved the dangers involved in the Executive Presidential system. The President had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency.
Our other objectives are to secure a change in the system of elections and devolution of power. Saman Ratnapriya said certain elements were trying to arouse communal and religious passions through greed for power. Ravaya Editor K.W. Janaranjana said they have planned their next satyagraha campaign in Anuradhapura. Copies of two books titled New Constitution and Power Constitution and Power Devolution were presented to the Malwatte prelate by K.W. Janaranjana and Ven Mahagalkadawara Punnasara thera respectively.

NINETEENTH AMENDMENT  ENHANCED GOOD GOVERNANCE
Sri Lankans are proud to be recognised as a role model for other countries by the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU), Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
He made this observation addressing the inauguration of the Eighth Conference of the SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians Association held at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo.
The Speaker also said that Sri Lanka also has a proud record of upholding parliamentary democracy for a continuous seventy years despite many obstacles including two failed military coup attempts and a three decade civil war that crippled the life of the whole country.
The 19th Amendment to the constitution passed in Parliament, is one concept of good governance introduced during the last three years, Speaker Jayasuriya said. The same amendment introduced the Constitutional Council which is responsible for the appointment of members to nine independent commissions,Speaker Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker said the Prime Ministers question time was increased. The Committee was strengthened by the establishment of Sectoral Oversight Committees and a Public Finance Committee. The Standing Orders of Parliament will also be amended in order to fall in line with the international best practises, he said.
The current President of the Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians, the Speaker of Maldivian Parliament Abdullah Maseen Mohamed said Sri Lanka has been offered the Chair of the Association for the next year.
He also appreciated the warm welcome extended by the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Northern youth to revive our cricketing glory
foundation of Goodness in collaboration with Tokyo Cement launched their campaign in search of the next cricket prodigy as they commenced cricket coaching camps in the Norther part of the country.
Cricket has always been one of the magical golden threads, that binds our country together. We have all witnessed time and time again how cricket tore barriers down to bring almost every man, woman and child on to the streets, cheering, dancing and pulsating to a uniquely Sri Lankan rhythm that unites them behind one flag, one team.
We are at a moment where the entire nation eagerly looks forward to bask in that glory yet again.
Everyone agrees that in order to rekindle our cricketing spirit, we as a nation must keep unearthing new talent and provide them opportunities to sharpen their skills, in order to produce future cricket legends who can place us on the world map.
Tokyo Cement was among the few who led on this mission to discover cricketing talent from among our youth in every corner of the country. The company, together with the Foundation of Goodness organize monthly cricket coaching camps, where youngsters are given the chance to show off their raw talent and get polished up under the guidance of top class coaches and cricket experts. The programme was initiated in the South, with the setting up of required infrastructure for coaching and practices in Seenigama and Hikkaduwa.
The objective was to make impact on the lives of rural cricketers by enabling them to pursue their talents and achieve a successful sporting career.
Marking another key milestone on this journey, Tokyo Cement Group and the Foundation of Goodness recently extended the monthly Cricket Coaching Camps to the North and East.
The inaugural camp, held at the Jaffna Central College on the 26th of August, was conducted by renowned cricket coach Mr. Hemantha Devapriya and his team of experts, with the participation of 35 students between the age groups of 13 to 19. The showcase of talent by the participants surpassed all expectations of the seasoned coaches who conducted the training session, lighting up hopes of seeing another Sri Lankan cricketing spring in the near future.
Tokyo Cement intends to expand the reach of these Northern cricket coaching camps from Jaffna to other key areas; Killinochchi, Oddusudan, Mankulam, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya.
The programme, headed by Anura De Silva, Sports Director of the Foundation of Goodness, plans to take 50 Northern youth under its wings and train them to become sparkling cricket stars who will shine their light on the game and the nation. Kushil Gunasekera, Founder/Chief Trustee of the Foundation of Goodness said, Our country is blessed with amazing talent and skill in the rural sector which we continue to harness for the greater development of our Nation.
The coaching camps, conducted by the Foundation of Goodness with the sponsorship of Tokyo Cement, have so far trained over 600 schoolboy cricketers from the South, producing a number of national players.
Tokyo Cement also extended their support to Cricketing Legend Muttiah Muralitharans initiative, with the patronage of Sri Lanka Cricket, to construct 30 concrete cricket pitches for schools in the North and East. The company has also associated consecutively with the Murali Harmony Cup, which hosts nearly 400 budding cricketers from 24 schools from all parts of the country, giving them exposure in a T20 style cricket tournament.

Nuwarawewa Reservation encroachers evacuated
The Nuwarawewa Reservoir, the main water source supplying drinking water to Anuradhapura, is in a devastating state due to the encroachers residing in the tank reservation.
In Nuwarawewa reservation, a large number of buildings including hotels have been put up which badly affect the wellbeing of the tank. In order to save the tank, there is no other alternative than evacuating the encroachers and the buildings, Anuradhapura Divisional Irrigation Engineer P. U. K. Tilakaratne said to Daily News.
In the meantime, the farmer organizations have complained to Anuradhapura Government Agent and the District Agriculture Committee that the Encroachers Evacuating Program was showing a very slow progress. They have indicated that zonal irrigation authorities have no power to take legal action against the encroachers. The land and legal section coming under the Irrigation Director General is handling the institution of lawsuits against the offenders and hence the enforcing of law to address the encroaching menace is being carried out efficiently and promptly.
The major tanks such as Nuwarawewa, Tisawewa, Abhayawewa, Mahawilachchiya and Mahakanadarawa come under the Anuradhapura Irrigational Division. At a recent survey it has been found that there are 2,933 and 161 encroachers within Nuwarawewa and Tisawewa Tank Reservations. The number of encroachers in Abayawewa Tank Reservation is 44 and in Mahakanadarawa there are 20 encroachers. The number of encroachers stands at 57 in Mahawilachchiya Tank Reservation landscape. Three cases against the encroachers in Nuwarawewa Reservation were decided against them in courts and we have already demolished one house and two more to be evacuated. We have to continue the process through the land and legal section at Irrigation Head Office and not at the zonal level, Tilakaratne added.
The Divisional Irrigation Engineer stated further that there were sewerage systems opened to Nuwarawewa and the toilets built within the close proximity to the tank causing gradual water contamination. According to him, in some encroachment cases the encroachers were found possessing land grants and land permits which seemed to be issued illegally. There are three Jayaboomi land grants holders within the Nuwarawewa Reservation, he revealed. Tilakaratne has informed the DAC that if such lands were declared crown lands, they could be acquired at any given time.

PMs lament
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered a telling indictment on the direction that country had taken after 70 years of parliamentary democracy, on Tuesday. Addressing the special session of the House, to mark 70 years of parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, the Premier lamented that the people of Sri Lanka, who have enjoyed 70 years of parliamentary democracy and 60 years of independence had failed to come together as Sri Lankans. He said the Sri Lankan people failed to establish a true Sri Lankan identity by forging goodwill among all ethnic groups. This (failure to establish a true Sri Lankan identity) did not allow Sri Lanka to reap the maximum benefits of the open economy, introduced in 1978. The nation was embroiled in six decades of ethnic conflict and an ethnic war that lasted 30 years, he noted.
The Premier's lamentation no doubt has its foundation in the vituperative and contentious politics practised down the years, to the present day. Political opportunism overtook any other consideration. As a result, golden opportunities that were presented, on a platter, to solve the ethic problem, and other major issues confronting the nation, were spurned. The ethnic conflict was allowed to fester, until the genie was released from the bottle in the form of a full blown ethnic war that ate into the country's vitals, relegating it to the ignominy of a failed state. To think that the late Singaporean Prime Minister once, in the 50s, declaring he wanted S'pore to emulate Sri Lanka, in its development model.
The gains that could have been derived under a true democratic polity, if only the leaders of the day acted as statesmen/women instead of playing politics, would have made this country a prosperous nation today. Like the Primer argued, the advantages that could have accrued to the country under the market economy was squandered by the deep seated ethnic conflict and the prolonged war, that stemmed from it. The open economy that was operating successfully until the ethic flare up in 1983 simply foundered, thereafter, with the violence, and the blackened image of the country, not holding any prospects for investments and expansion.
What is worse, when the country today is enjoying peace, efforts are being made to scuttle progress by politically driven elements. Strikes, protests and acts of sabotage have become the order of the day, with even people who should know better, such as members of the medical profession, in the forefront of these acts. Bigoted elements, are, also, all out to scuttle efforts to bring about ethnic peace and communal harmony. They have taken the mantle of the protectors of the nation and the Buddha Sasana.
What the PM implied in his speech was that opportunities to build ethnic harmony were blocked, at every turn, by the leaders succumbing to the pressure of the radical elements, as what is being played out today. S.W.R.D. capitulated and so did Dudley. Both the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact and the Dudley- Chleva Pact were consigned to the dustbin, following the pressures exerted by the hard line nationalist elements led by militant Buddhist clergy. Regrettably, we are witnessing more of the same, at present as well, with strident nationalist voices attempting to scupper the creation of a new constitution, that will pave the way for reconciliation and ethnic harmony. Echos of the past are being heard once again in this enlightened age, with politically driven Buddhist monks beating the sell out drum and inciting the masses, even defying the sober sentiments expressed by the Mahanayaka of the Malwatte Chapter, who in turn, is being challenged by these chauvinist elements.
The tragedy is doubly so, since this is a golden opportunity to set about righting matters, with both major political parties, who right along were at each others jugular, having joined together to form a unity government, and despite repeated assurance by the President and Prime Minister that no clause will be included in the proposed constitution, that will be inimical to the sovereignty of the state, or the preeminent status accorded to Buddhism.
Namal in a twist
Former first son Namal Rajapaksa has made a grand discovery. He says that Germanys Angela Merkel had won a fourth term as Chancellor, and that, the Yahapalanaya leaders had lost no time in congratulating her. This was in contrast to the big hue and cry made, when his father, Mahinda Rajapaksa, went for a third term via the 13th Amendment. Young Rajapaksa, no doubt, sought to demonstrate the double standards of the Yahapalanayites.
Rajapaksa junior has certainly got things mixed up. The German Chancellor is a parliamentary leader and became Chancellor (for the fourth time) by virtue of her Christian Democratic Union party winning a majority in the Bundestag (German parliament),ahead of the Social Democratic Party and the Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Hence, she did not go for the poll, as a candidate for President, for which a two term is the norm.
On the other hand, a single political party can be elected to parliament for more than two terms, as has happened in Sri Lanka.

PM ALLAYS  FEARS OF RUSHING  THROUGH WITH  NEW CONSTITUTION
The interim report that was tabled before the Constitutional Assembly is not the draft of the new constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said that although some quarters are alarmed that the government will pass a constitution tomorrow, that is wrong. He added that the Interim Report contains only the views of the sub committees and not the views of the Steering Committee.
He also said that during the course of the formulation of the draft of the new constitution, the views of all the stakeholders other than politicians will be given consideration.
This stage which is very significant will commence early next year. He said the new electoral system also has to be tested in the impending election due to be held in January next year.
Addressing the inauguration of the Eighth Conference of the SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians Association held at the Hilton Hotel, Premier Wickremesinghe said Speakers and parliamentarians of the SAARC region are here to mark this occasion and secondly to commence the drafting of a new constitution.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his delegation is due to hold bilateral talks with the Prime Minister of Finland Juha Sipila and other high level leader in Helsinki.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be accompanied by Prof (Mrs) Maithree Wickramasinghe, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, Finance and Media Ministry Secretary Dr H.

PM leaves for Germany, Finland
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is due to leave for Germany today, October 5 on a private visit.
After a tour of Berlin he will proceed to Finland on an official tour from October 9.
The Finland tour is intended to strengthen bilateral relations between Finland and Sri Lanka and establish new mutual ties in the trade, economic and industrial fields.
He said candidate Maithripala Sirisena pledged a new constitution to strengthen democracy with national unity at the last election while addressing issues at the base of ethnic conflict.
During the process of formulation of the draft of the new constitution, the first task was to get all the parties together, the Premier said. We set up a national government. The tradition of enacting a new constitution was to appoint a select committee, which we thought was not appropriate for Sri Lanka.So we used the modified version of a Constitution Assembly where we converted parliament into a Constitution Assembly by resolution and gave powers to that assembly of Committee of whole Parliament to prepare a draft of constitution to present to Parliament.This way,we can get consensus.All members could express their views and narrow the differences.
The Premier said that the Constitutional Assembly will enable them to consult the whole country before they reach an agreement. If an agreement could not be reached, the Assembly has to report so to Parliament, the Premier said. A steering Committee has also been appointed in this connection. During last year, the issues were vibrantly discussed during this process. The forum was to get the views of the members and not the views of the parties. We consulted the political parties in the Parliament Chief Ministers, Governors Leader of the Opposition the Womens focus in Parliament and some of the other groups. We identified six subjects namely Law and Order, Public Security, Fundamental Rights etc and were directed to six sub committees. They submitted their reports. Another adhoc committee study the practical issues and by January this year we had all reports ready and tabled in Parliament.
He said further that the report contained the views of the Sub Committee and not the views of steering Committee. He added that by June they had reached consensus on some areas.
On the other areas, we have to narrow the differences, Premier said. We felt that we should start writing the report that contain the views of everyone including which had the consensus, agreements and also which should be discussed further. What we have brought out is a report of the whole committee. This Interim Report has been presented to Constitutional Assembly by now. There has been an alarm in some quarters that we are going to pass a constitution tomorrow. No this interim report was to be debated by a constitutional assembly for a start of general debate in the country. Then the Interim Committee will start meeting different stakeholders other than the political parties who love to express their views. This stage is an important one and we will debate at the end of October.This is not the last report.We will start talking all the stakeholders later.
He added that all agree that this country cant be divided. It will be Ekeeya in Sinhala,Premier Wickremesinghe said.Buddhism is given the foremost place while all other religious rights will be guaranteed.In January we will hold the elections to the local authorities under a new system, he said.

Rainy retreat
It is such a beautiful feeling to be devotees of the Sangha during Vassana which emphasizesnot only the development of Samadhi and wisdom but also the cultivation of other essentialvirtues such as generosity, loving-kindness and moral discipline, that reflect the nature ofthe Buddhist path. Vassana terminates with Katina Puja the most sacred event towhich every Buddhist attaches the highest mportance.
Ayan Vassana Kalo. This is rather the climax of the Vassana season.Anujanami Bhikkave VassaneVassan UpaganthunAnujanami Bhikkave VassanUttanan Bhikkunan Kathinan Aththartitun
The above stated in Maharaggapali Vinaya Pitaka reveals the observing of Vas and its culmination in the Katina Cheevara Puja, the highest punyakarma that one could perform. Every Buddhist monk blessed with the higher ordination (upasampada) should observe the Rains Retreat during the three months commencing from Esala Poya and they are entitled to the receipt of Katina Cheevara from the laity.
This noble meritorious deed is considered the most sacred wholesome act of Ata Mahakusal while at the same time, it is said to suppress the ill effects of bad Kamma. The practice of observing Vassana continues to this month as the fulfillment of a disciplinary requirement as laid down by the Buddha.
Spiritual upkeep
It is Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that govern and guide the minds of the laity during this period. Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha-all are in one entity during this traditionally accepted vassana. Sangha is a group or an assembly of learned monks committed to Dhamma and thereby observe and follow the doctrine to the best of their ability in the interest of the laity their love and compassion to the laity is so vast that they occupy a very high place in lay minds.
They sacrifice their comfort valuable time and energy for the sake of the devotees they are committed to carrying the Buddhas message throughout especially during Vassana. It is such a beautiful feeling to be devotees of the Sangha during Vassana which emphasizes not only the development of Samadhi and wisdom but also the cultivation of other essential virtues such as generosity, loving-kindness and moral discipline, that reflect the nature of the Buddhist path. Vassana terminates with Katina Puja the most sacred event to which every Buddhist attaches the highest importance.
Supreme gift
There are other events for which the Vap full moon day is important in the annals of religious history in Sri-Lanka. One such event was the arrival of Therini Sanghamitta. With the introduction of the supreme gift to Sri-Lanka by Arahat Mahinda, the royalty and countless numbers accepted Buddhism and when Queen Anula was anxious to enter the order of Bhikkuni the king was instructed to request Emperor Asoka to send Therini Sangheimitta for the purpose and it was on Vap poya day that the king sent envoys to the city of Pataliputta under the leadership of Minister Maha Aritta.
On his return he entered the order with a retinue of 500 and having gained a considerable knowledge of the Vinaya rules, he held a Vinaya Sangayana in Thuparama. Arahat Mahindas wish was that Buddhism in Sri-Lanka will not be established until a person born and bred here holds a Dhamma Sangayana after completing the study of Dhamma Vinaya rules.
Hence according to early chronicles, this was fulfilled by Minister Maha Aritta. Hence the propagation of Buddhism on a sound footing on a Vap full moon day is said to be the beginnings of a Golden Era in Buddhism.

Rajitha hails Basils Jaffna speech: Roadblock to returning occupied land removed
Joint Opposition pledge support to reconciliation
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne yesterday announced that a major obstacle to reconciliation had been removed with a nationalist party making a U-turn to support the governments return of occupied land in Jaffna.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said he welcomed former strongman Minister Basil Rajapaksa who leads the new nationalist Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) declaring his full support to end military occupation of privately-owned land.
His statement means that there is no one else who is objecting to the return of land, Minister Senaratne told reporters at the weekly Cabinet press briefing. We should complete the return of land because the last obstacle has now been removed.
While announcing the major policy shift for the fledgling SLPP, Basil Rajapaksa claimed in Jaffna on Sunday that the regime of his elder brother Mahinda had returned 80 percent of lands to rightful private owners in the former war zone. Strong supporters of the SLPP such as Dinesh Gunawardene, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa faction within the SLPP are opposed to returning private lands occupied by the military in the north.
However, Basil Rajapaksa claimed that the Rajapaksa regime had also had a policy to return land but they could not fully implement it because they were defeated in January 2015 and again in August 2015 elections.
We had returned about 80 percent of the lands (In the north). We believe that all private land should be returned to their owners, Rajapaksa said.
Not only that, we should give state land to those who do not own land. Land and homes is a problem everywhere in the country, but especially in the north we must and should address this problem at the earliest.
Basil Rajapaksas comments to the Press Club of Jaffna are in sharp contrast to the repeated objections of those supporting the SLPP and former president Rajapaksa who have accused the current government of compromising security by freeing up land occupied during the decades-long Tamil separatist war.
His statement regarding the provision of state land to the landless in the north, goes well beyond the return of private lands currently underway. President Maithripala Sirisena has pledged that he will press ahead with restoring private land ownership while pursuing his reconciliation efforts.
In another policy shift, Basil Rajapaksa supported attempts to end the problem of tens of thousands of people still missing eight years after the end of the separatist war. He said the issue of people who had disappeared during and after the war should be addressed humanely and a solution found at the earliest.
It is a question that must be addressed. We were trying to solve it (during our time), it is an emotional issue. It must be solved in a very humane way, he said without going into details.
He lamented that moderate Tamil parties did not cooperate with the Rajapaksa regime, but was accommodating the government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
Basil Rajapaksa was in the Northern peninsula to establish a grassroots network for his SLPP. The party has been set up as a fallback for dissidents within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to contest future elections should they fail to secure nominations from their party leader President Sirisena.
The former strongman of the Rajapaksa regime and the ex-presidents political strategist also dropped a bombshell on security forces in Jaffna accusing them of committing crimes even now.
He said security forces commanded by his brother Mahinda committed crimes during and after the war. It is the first time that a Rajapaksa regime member admitted, in the former war zone, that armed forces had committed crimes.
His remarks strengthened charges made by Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka that there may have been individuals who stepped out of line and who should be investigated and punished to clear the good name of the Sri Lankan forces.
Asked for his views on Field Marshal Fonsekas remarks, including his willingness to testify before any war crimes tribunal, Rajapaksa said he was reluctant to comment, but ended up admitting to crimes by security forces.
I think our forces didnt do war crimes, but individuals might have done. It is not war crimes. We can call (it) crimes, Rajapaksa said dispensing with a Sinhala-Tamil translator and switching to English.
However, he made it clear that he was unhappy with Field Marshal Fonsekas comments. I dont think the person who led the forces at that time should talk like this.
Basil Rajapaksa and his brothers had described Fonseka as the worlds best military commander after he crushed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and declared an end to a war that had inflicted immense suffering on all Sri Lankans.

RBN Performance rekindles ties with CCR
RBN Performance, a sports specialized garment manufacturer strengthened its partnership with Colombo City Running (CCR), a popular community-based recreational running group by introducing their latest running specialized sports wear during a ceremony at the Renuka City hotel, Colombo recently.
CCR was founded in 2015 by Omar Alif, who sought a community with which to share his passion for running. In a little over two years, CCR has evolved into a team that goes beyond recreational running with most members preparing to participate in competitive marathons and other fitness competitions both in Sri Lanka as well as in abroad. With the vision of promoting and improving running in Colombo, CCR is a non profitable organization with voluntary participation. There is no monetary commitment from members, and participation in CCR is open to novices as well as seasoned athletes.
RBN Performance, one of Sri Lankas leading apparel manufacturers first partnered with CCR in 2016 and has extended their support to CCR as the communitys apparel partner. CCR runners will sport RBN Performance apparel as they represent the community in local and international competitions, as well as in regular CCR runs. We are delighted to rekindle our association with CCR and support them in their efforts to promote fitness and healthy living, both of which are synonymous with the values of RBN Performance, said Business Head, RBN Performance, Dhananjaya Weerakoon.
RBN is Sri Lankas first performance wear brand for men and women, built with the Sri Lankan athlete in mind. Sri Lanka is currently undergoing a fitness revolution, and RBN has been at the forefront in purpose designing and engineering a range of performance garments that suit local climate and user conditions, combining both style and performance for athletes at all levels.
The brands core competency is its strength from design, material engineering and technical capabilities, and we specialize as a product development hub for manufacturing technical garments, said Weerakoon. RBNs apparel is powered by Sportech, the brands own moisture management and anti-bacterial platform. RBN has further provided specific performance factors, such as compression for athletes with demanding performance needs. RBNs products are specifically engineered for Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans, while maintaining world class product development and manufacturing standards.
At present CCRs membership comprises 340+ individuals, of which the vast majority are from Colombo. Every CCR run comprises of a routine of pre-run warm-up and dynamic stretches, and post run cool-down, followed by static stretches.
Invariably, CCRs weekend runs are followed by a post-run detox and hydration session combined with some fellowship. Hydration, as much as proper clothing and equipment is part of a runners gear, said Asha De Vos, a CCR spokesperson.
CCR also provides its members run training in the form of midweek speed runs, support and advice and a platform for participation in major events such as the LSR Colombo Marathon. Members also benefit by following a training schedule designed by the more experienced runners in the group that supports individuals to achieve their personal objectives at their chosen event.
Some of the key highlights of RBNs sporting season for 2016/17 were the RBN Rugby partnerships with St. Peters College, St. Josephs College and Zahira College Colombo. Additionally, the brand was the platinum sponsor for Run for their Lives, the annual cancer fund-raising project hosted by the Rotaract Club of Colombo Uptown.

## Title: Redesigning the legislature

Redesigning the legislature
The government last week began grappling with its latest and most daunting challenge- the task of introducing a new Constitution to replace the Executive Presidential system of government introduced in 1978. This is while the de-facto opposition, the Mahinda Rajapaksa faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which has styled itself as the Joint Opposition (JO) suffered twin political setbacks.
It was only last week that the government succeeded in passing the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill in Parliament with a two-thirds majority. This meant that the elections to three provincial councils- in the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces- would be deferred for at least several months, until these regions are subjected to a process of re-demarcation of electoral divisions.
This was a severe blow to the JO because it was aiming to test its electoral strength, at least in the North Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces where it believed it has significant grassroots level support. A Supreme Court verdict declaring that the 20th Amendment to the Constitution required a referendum had given hope to the JO that the polls would be held, if not later this year, at least early next year. That is not possible now.
Hot on the heels of that came another court verdict- from the District Court of Colombo- where a lawsuit seeking the re-instatement of Rajapaksa as President of the SLFP was dismissed by Colombo District Judge Sujeewa Nissanka who upheld the preliminary objections that were raised.
Election victory
It will be recalled that shortly after President Maithripala Sirisenas election victory, a discussion was held between President Sirisena, Rajapaksa and then Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa at the latters official residence where it was decided that Rajapaksa would hand over the leadership of the SLFP to President Sirisena.
That itself was a consequence of Rajapaksas actions. Keen to wrest control of the SLFP from former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Rajapaksa, soon after he became President, had the SLFPs Central Committee approve a resolution that if a SLFPer was the leader of the country, he or she would also take over the mantle of party leadership. It was a resolution that came back to haunt Rajapaksa after he lost the presidential election to President Sirisena in January 2015.
However, the petitioners in the District Court had a different argument. They submitted that President Sirisena was not entitled to that privilege because he contested from an opposition party and ran against a candidate from the SLFP. That submission however was not put to the test as the District Court held that the President had immunity from legal action under Article 35(1) of the Constitution.
This verdict is a setback to the JO because many saw this as a last resort attempt by the Rajapaksa camp to remain as stakeholders within the SLFP. Now, whether they like it or not, they will be compelled to market themselves as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), nominally led by G. L. Peiris.
The mainstream SLFP, on the other hand, is now keen to forge ahead, without seeking alliances with the Rajapaksa faction, if and when the provincial polls and elections to local government institutions are eventually held. Towards this end, President Sirisena met with SLFP stalwarts last week, urging them to reactivate the party machinery in preparation for polls.
Constitutional reforms
Another course of action the President Sirisena is likely to pursue is disciplinary action against dissidents. Ever since he assumed office, the President has been extremely lenient on rebels from his own party, even though they have brazenly flouted party discipline by staging rival rallies on May Day and criticising the current leadership in numerous public pronouncements. This is likely to change now. At an electoral level, JO members are likely to lose their organiser posts and be replaced by other party members.
Meanwhile, the government has also announced proposed Constitutional reforms that could very likely lead to a new Constitution. This was a key pledge by both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the election campaigns in January and August 2015. These proposals are included in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, which was appointed to draft a new Constitution. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe chairs the Committee.
While there is consensus regarding abolishing the Executive Presidency as it exists today, it has been proposed that the President should be elected by Parliament for a fixed term of office. It has also been proposed that the President should be conferred with powers, including those in relation to Provincial Councils in specified situations.
Earlier it was believed that while the SLFP wanted to retain the Executive Presidency as it stands now, the United National Party (UNP) was keen to have it abolished altogether. There was even some apprehension that this issue could drive the two partners in the National Unity government apart. Now, there appears some compromise on the issue.
The interim report also addressed two vexed issues: the system of election and the unit of devolution of power. On the issue of election, there is agreement that it will be a hybrid between the first past the post Westminster system and the proportional Representation (PR) system. It has been suggested that the new legislature consist of 233 seats- eight more than the current 225- of which 140 seats will be directly elected while the others will be through the PR system.
It has also been proposed that, within these 233 seats, a specified number of extra seats shall be allocated to the Northern Province for a specified period of time, to compensate disparities caused due to displacement of persons.
Differences of opinion
A senate style second chamber, consisting of 55 members, 45 of them drawn from the Provincial Councils, has also been proposed. The other ten members should be persons of eminence and integrity who have distinguished themselves in public or professional life. It is not proposed for the second chamber to have veto powers. However, it is envisaged that it may refer legislation back to Parliament for reconsideration.
On the issue of devolution of power, there appears to be consensus that the main unit for the devolution of powers shall be the province. However, the steering committee has provided three options regarding the possible merger of provinces for consideration: that mergers not be allowed, that they be allowed subject to a referendum of the provinces concerned and that the Northern and Eastern provinces be considered as a single province. Clearly there are differences of opinion on this issue.
It has been stressed that while these are proposals where wide ranging consensus has been reached, they are still only the basis for further discussion. There is no doubt that there will be much deliberation and more analysis before a final consensus is arrived at.
Already generating controversy in this regard are concerns raised mostly by the JO that Buddhism will lose its special status which it now enjoys under the current Constitution. The government has been at pains to state that this is not so and the Mahanayaka of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Ven Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera this week publicly stated that the assurances provided by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe about this should suffice.
In this respect, the interim report has suggested two options to set out the relevant clauses of the Constitution. Both options include the words, Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana.
The government does not anticipate an easy passage of the new Constitution through the processes it must navigate. It is only too aware of the difficulties it has in repealing the 18th Amendment and enacting the 19th Amendment to the Constitution early on in its tenure of office, amidst stiff opposition from the JO. So, it expects the possibility of numerous challenges both in Parliament and outside it, in the courts of law.
Therefore, there is a sense of expectation within government ranks that there would be a referendum on the issue. In any event, replacing a Constitution, that too after nearly forty years is a major event in a nations history and it would be more viable if it receives the stamp of approval by the people at a referendum. This is the major next hurdle the government is gearing itself for.

Rs. 25 million to enhance Kithul industry
Seventy percent of the whole population of Sri Lanka is part of the rural economy.
The majority of them are engaged in various fields including agriculture, livestock and handicraft. Various projects have been taken into effect to enhance the number of rural industries by the Ministry of Rural Economy.
Measures have been taken to enhance the Kitul Industry. Rs. 25 million has been allocated for this purpose.
Training programmes have been launched for traditional and younger generations who are engaged in the Kitul Industry, to direct and give necessary guidance for Kitul production. Thirty five training programmes will be held for 720 beneficiaries under this.
Moreover, the ministry has taken measures to donate a number of equipment including belts, knives and cookers, for this industry, free of charge.
As there is an increasing demand for Kitul-related products in both local and foreign markets, there is a good potential for developing the local Kitul industry commercially.
The objective of the ministry is to increase opportunities of self-employments for rural people and to increase the income of Kithul industrialists and entrepreneurs, thereby boosting the economy of rural areas.

SL womens cricketers ready to face West Indies challenge
The Sri Lanka womens cricketers, who will embark on a tour of the West Indies from October 5 to 27, have improved with the experience derived from this years world cup, according to team Manager Indrani Abeyratne.
The 15-member national womens squad will meet the West Indies in three (03) ODIs on October 11, 13 and 15, and three T20s on October 19, 21 and 22.
The players have worked hard on their preparations, and there is a changed outlook as a whole, she said while adding that there was a new inclusion in wicket-keeper batsman Rebecca Vandert.
Expressing optimism of getting the better of the West Indies, she said that Sri Lankas captain Inoka Ranaweera was an exceptional player. She had the rare distinction of being the only womens cricketer to have taken a hat-trick in world cricket against New Zealand away in 2015.
Meanwhile, coach, Hemantha Devappriya said that while the team had struck a pleasing balance in most every department of the game, a buoying factor was that the team had averaged a score of 190 in an innings during this years world cup.
The team used to average 130 which were not good enough. But in the 7 matches in the world cup we averaged 190, he said.
Much home work had gone into the effort of raising their game. We developed a range of shots to increase the number of singles. We were therefore able to increase from an average of 40 runs to 80 at the world cup through singles, the coach explained.
Commenting on the player capacity, he said that it is an advantage to have 7 specialist batsmen including wicket-keeper batsman Rebecca Vandert. Two of them were all-rounders. There were 4 major spinners in right arm bowlers Shashikala Siriwardena and Chamarie Athapattu and left armers Chandima Weerakkody and skipper Inoka Ranaweera. In the pace bowling department, there were 4 specialists in Sripali Weerakkody who is also a middle order batsman, Hasni Perera, Udeshika Prabodini, Ama Kanchana and Achini Kulasuriya. The batting was quite strong with 3 openers in Hasini, Nipuni Hansika and Yasoda Mendis. The middle order comprised Atapattu, Dilani Monodara and Shashikala.
The Lankan womens team to west Indies - Inoka Ranaweera (Captain), Sripali Weerakkody (Vice Captain), Rebeca Vandort (Wicket Keeper), Prasadani Weerakkody, Chamari Athapaththu, Dilani Manohara, Nipuni Hansika, Hasini Perera, Yashoda Mendis, Chandima Gunarathne, Hansima Karunarathne, Shashikala Siriwardena, Ama Kanchana, Achini Kulasuriya, Udeshika Pabodinie

Social media smear campaign hurts Muslim hotels in Galle: Single Koththu misconstrued
World renowned Financial Advisor, Ziad K. Abdelnour in his book Economic Warfare once said Rumours are carried by haters, spread by fools and accepted by idiots. This quote has aptly described the recent round of gossip spread over social media that Muslim hotels in Galle were selling food mixed with contraceptives to the Sinhalese who come to dine in their hotels.
The following is our investigation into the rumours, and not surprisingly, we found that they were fabricated and spread with little knowledge of the real story.
Tale of Sinhala Kottu"
A few weeks ago a post on the Facebook wall of a certain individual stated that two Muslim hotels M.J.M. Hotel at Galagediya Handiya on Hiribura Road and Thalal Hotel at Thanipolgaha Junction in Galle had been sealed off and their businesses closed. The posting further warned the Sinhala community not to buy food from Muslim hotels, for food sold at these hotels had been found to be mixed with contraceptive drugs.
In another Facebook posting it was published that another hotel named Rizla at Saranthukade Junction had been closed down in the same manner- this has also been proven to be a lie.
The gossip on the post however spread quickly, many have started to believe it and business in Muslim hotels declined drastically within a very short period of time. On inquiry we heard a hilarious yet weird story about what led to such a post on social media.
Story behind the post
One night a drunk person had come to the hotel at Thanipolagaha Junction in Galle and ordered a Kotthu and subsequently the hotel employee placed the order with the Rotty Maker yelling out, A single Kotthu which meant that he needed one portion of Kotthu. The drunk man however had misheard it as Sinhala Kotthu due to the erroneous pronunciation of the word by the Tamil speaking Muslim worker.
The person who was under the influence of liquor shouted at the hotel staff alleging that they were selling a different kind of Kottu to Sinhala people and left the place making various accusations and challenging legal action against the hotel.
Nevertheless, he did nothing against them, but propagated the tale which was well fostered and improved by racial elements.
When we visited the areas mentioned in the post, we could not trace any hotel which had been sealed off or closed down. When inquired from the Galle Police and Galle Municipal authorities they denied that any such incident had taken place.
A business world conspiracy
I inherited this hotel from my father, the late Mohamed Jasail. He ran the hotel for 35 years and handed over the business to me. By now I have been operating this business for the past 30 years. Altogether the hotel has existed for 65 years.
During such a long period in business, we have not been charged by Municipal Health authorities or any other institution for even a minor offence connected to the business.
I have six cooks employed in my hotel. Two of them are Sinhalese. In addition there are four other employees working at the hotel as well. Among them there are both Sinhalese and Tamils. Majority of my customers are Sinhala people and they have been patronising my hotel throughout. People from far off villages come to my hotel for food, said the proprietor of M.J.M. Hotel and Chinese Restaurant M.J.M. Faizal.
They had closed the hotel from September 2 to 4 in lieu of the Haj festival and had displayed a notice regarding it at the entrance.
This however, was taken as a fact which authenticated the post on Facebook by some people and they used this opportunity to further spread the offensive and damaging gossip.
However, the destructive story adversely affected my business. I have already made a complaint at the Galle Police. They have already initiated investigations and identified the suspects.
Galle Police have also reported the matter to the Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Centre (CERT/CC) for further investigations. I hope that I would receive justice," explained Faizal further.
U.M.G. Jagath Kumara (34), a cook at the hotel said he had worked at the hotel for over 15 years and that the contraceptive' story was a complete lie.
I too eat food from this hotel. I feed my wife and children with food here. I have three children and at present my wife is expecting again. If it was true, I would also have been infertile, he quipped.
T.L. Karunathilake (54), another cook at the hotel added that a large number of Sinhalese came daily to the hotel for meals and the place is quite popular for having clean and tasty food.
We do not even add Ajinomoto the famous flavour enhancer to our foods, he added.
He further explained that his child who attended Nagoda Royal College was ridiculed in class over the incident because he worked at the hotel.
This is my 21st year of service at the hotel. I am a waiter here. Many of the doctors at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital come to this hotel for food. If any harmful ingredients are mixed with food, the doctors would know. The doctors always praise the cleanliness and hygienic conditions of the hotel, said, G. Piyasena (52) an employee of the hotel.
Muththusami Balachandran (39), from Wanduramba who has worked at the hotel for 13 years, voiced his concern as the number of customers coming to the hotel was decreasing at an alarming rate.
We fear that we would lose our jobs if this continues. Already two people left the hotel owing to the decrease in the number of people coming to the hotel, he said.
Sameera Sampath (29), the Steward of S.M.J. Chinese Restaurant, joined the hotel five years ago, reiterated that the gossip about the hotel was fabricated, and that youth from faraway areas such as Mapalagama, Nagoda, and Yakkalamulla came to this hotel for Chinese food.
Further, a number of businessmen in the area also commended the hotel for its unblemished, grand services and clean food.
We also met M. Nuwaizer (39) the Owner of Rizlat Hotel at Saranthukade Junction in Galle which was said to have been sealed off for selling drug mixed food.
I ran the hotel in a rented premises. At the end of the lease agreement I handed over the building to the owner and selected another building just opposite the former one, on the other side of the road.
I named my new hotel as Bhasha, he explained.
Police response satisfactory
Subsequently, some persons had circulated a malicious story about the closure of my former business, he added and informed the public that the hotel was sealed off. I had to keep it open during the day, so all could see the actual state of my former business place, he said.
He also explained that three days ago, an unknown person threw a petrol bomb at the former hotel premises. He has lodged a police complaint CIB 253/418 dated 13.09.17.
A separate complaint has been made to the police over the Facebook allegation under complaint No. CIB 231/120.
Galle Police swiftly initiated investigations into my complaints. They have already identified the suspects and informed the CERT/CC for necessary action to be taken.
I am satisfied with what the police have done so far, said Nuwaizer.
The penultimate explanation over the incident came from the Southern Provincial Councillor Ven. Dr. Baddegama Samitha Thera who made a special statement over the issue.
He explained that he personally investigated the incident and the respective Facebook gossip was a premeditated commercial conspiracy targeting the Muslim business community in Galle by some chauvinist groups.

Steps to solve graduate unemployment in NCP
The North Central Provincial Educational Information reveals that there are 1000 teachers vacancies to be filed in the province. Recently, 488 graduates were absorbed as Sinhala and Tamil medium teachers for the province. According to the level of scoring at the competitive examination and the interviews following it, the North Central Governor's office and the Provincial Public Service Office are considering the possibility of recruiting another batch of graduate teachers for the province.
Provincial Chief Secretary H.M.P. Bandara referring to the issue told Daily News that by December 31, 2016 the number of teachers in the pay list was 15,901 and by July 12, 2017 the provincial teachers for NCP was 16,830. Steps could be taken for filling the balance vacancies by the relevant authorities.
The graduates should be offered suitable employment. The Provincial Council has no provisions to recruit graduates as Development Officers. But in NCP, there is accommodation to absorb 1,200 graduate trainees. Preliminary steps have been taken to recruit 853 for the Trainee Graduates Scheme. We are waiting for the approval of the Economic Policies and Planning Ministry and the Management Services Department to proceed with this matter. If the approval has been given, it will help to solve the burning problem of the unemployment of graduates to a certain extent, Bandara emphasized.
Meanwhile, the graduates who have not been accommodated to be in the Provincial Teachers Service who protested to the authorities about the recently held competitive examination and the interviews for the recruitment of Provincial Graduate Teachers, met the Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake and submitted their grievances and the injustice alleged to have been committed in the recruitment process at the Minister's Anuradhapura office. Duminda Dissanayake promised the graduates to take up the matter with the appropriate authorities to give them some relief.

Vegas shooter wired $100,000 to partner in Philippines
Shooter's girlfriend returns to U.S.
THE PHILIPPINES: Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock transferred $100,000 to his girlfriend in the Philippines who travelled there last month, authorities in Manila said Wednesday, citing the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said the FBI, its US counterpart, had sought help in finding Marilou Danley.
Danley arrived in the Philippines last month, and then there was a wire transfer to her account for $100,000 from Stephen, NBI spokesman Nick Suarez told AFP.
Danley is an Australian citizen who moved to the United States 20 years ago to work on the casino strip, the Australian government confirmed Tuesday.
There are reports her ID was used for booking the hotel or some such detail, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock returned to the United States on Wednesday from the Philippines, as authorities in Manila said they were looking into reports he transferred $100,000 to her.
Marilou Danley flew out of Manila's international airport on Tuesday night for Los Angeles, immigration bureau spokeswoman Maria Antoinette Mangrobang told AFP.
She was met in the United States Tuesday evening local time -- Wednesday in the Philippines -- by FBI agents. The 62 year-old is classified as a person of interest to investigators but remains free to go wherever she wants, US media reported.
The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said the FBI, its US counterpart, had sought help in finding Danley.
The FBI has coordinated with the Philippine office of the Interpol to look for her, NBI spokesman Nick Suarez told AFP.

Way of the arrow
As humans, we are always eager to explore all thoughts those pop up in our minds. At times we do not correctly identify the inapplicability of some thoughts and engage in them, just for the sake of short-term happiness. For this reason, we become so visionless in our behavior and make our own lives so miserable, in a longer perspective. Although the life is full of suffering such shortsightedness aggravates the sufferings and blocks the path to end suffering. Sometimes we take such blindness even in understanding the spiritual path to end suffering and set wrong priorities. As Buddhists, we sometimes forget, knowingly or unknowingly, that Buddha himself has set an example for his life for setting right priorities and ignoring undue concerns.
Cula-Malunkya Sutta, sometimes referred to as Cula-Malunkyovada sutta, is a great source that teaches us why we should not follow the notions that would divert us away from the final goal and lead us to further suffering. Buddhists should always remember that the Buddha had only one clear and consistent message in his teachings for the sake of spiritual awakening and liberation: Nibbana, the end of suffering. Cula-Malunkya Sutta: The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya (Found in Majjhima Nikaya in Sutta Pitaka of Tripitaka), is another sutta where the Buddha is challenged regarding the so-called Great Questions of all times. In the dialogue found in this sutta, the Buddha consistently refuses to answer anything that would prove to be a diversion from the goal of the Eightfold Path, citing how such an act would only reinforce ignorance.
Speculative notions
Today, we live in an educated society where everything is looked upon with a scientific approach. Madly, we want to know the exact nature of everything around us, believing, that would one day end our distress. The importance of this Sutta arises due to the fact that the un-awakened monk Malunkyaputta represents the modern intellectuals who are more interested in philosophical arguments based on a mechanistic approach than in personal development; self-centered speculative notions than in selfless people orientation. The Buddha, through his wisdom, realized and showed us the path of the true purpose of spiritual life, and what the real and immediate questions of life are. After going through the article one can clearly understand how the Buddha avoided explaining matters that are not connected with the spiritual path and the final goal for ending of suffering.
This sutta can also be considered as one which discourses the well-known ten undetermined views set aside by the Buddha due to their unexplainable nature and invalidity in the path to the final goal. The ten points are as follows, where the first 4 views are about the cosmos, next two are about the self or soul and the last four views are about Tathagata: 1) The cosmos is eternal. 2) The cosmos is not eternal. 3) The cosmos is finite. 4) The cosmos is infinite. 5) The self is the same as the body. 6) The self and the body are separate. 7) A being* [satta] exists after death. 8) A being does not exist after death. 9) A being both exists and does not exist after death. 10) A being neither exists nor not exist after death. (*In Pali this is referred to as tathagatha)
Although these were declared as undetermined here, one should apprehend the fact that Tathagatha himself was aware of the answers to these questions and these were explained in different other suttas. The argument here is about the validity of such questions in the context of life that we spend and not about the questions, per say.
One of the Monks of the Sangha, Malunkyaputta, when in isolation in the Jetawanaramaya, Anathapindikas monastery, this thought occurred to him; There are speculative views those have been left unanswered by the Blessed One, namely: The cosmos is eternal, the cosmos is not eternal, the cosmos is finite, the cosmos is infinite. Also, self (or soul) is the same as the body. The self and the body are separate. On the other hand, a being exists after death. A being does not exist after death. A being both exists and does not exist after death. A being neither exists nor does not exist after death.
Questions answered
The monk was confused and went and met the Blessed one to clarify them so that his questions are answered. After paying homage to the Buddha, he sat down at one side and said: Bhante, the following thought arose in my mind. These speculative views have been left undetermined and set aside by the Blessed One. He then put forward the 10 great questions and said, If the Buddha does not declare them for me, then I will give up being a monk and return to the normal life.
He then reiterated those questions challenging the Buddha, If the Blessed One knows the cosmos is eternal, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, The cosmos is eternal or, if the Blessed One knows the cosmos is not eternal, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, The cosmos is not eternal. If the Blessed One does not know: the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal, then, it is only honest for one who neither knows nor see to say, I do not know, I do not see.
Then he went to his second question and said If the Blessed One knows the cosmos is finite, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, or if the Blessed One knows the cosmos is infinite then, let the Blessed One declare to me. If the Blessed One does not know the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite, then, it is only honest for one who neither knows nor see to say, I do not know, I do not see
Eternal cosmos
Venerable Malunkkya went along the same line of argument for other theses as well, one by one. The Buddha listened to the monk carefully and at the end replied;
"Malunkyaputta, did I ever say to you, 'Come, Malunkyaputta, live the holy life under me, and I will declare to you that 'The cosmos is eternal,' or 'The cosmos is not eternal,' or 'The cosmos is finite,' or 'The cosmos is infinite,' or 'The soul & the body are the same,' or 'The soul is one thing and the body another,' or 'After death a being exists,' or 'After death a being does not exist,' or 'After death a being both exists & does not exist,' or 'After death a being neither exists nor does not exist'"
"No, lord". Replied the monk.
"And did you ever say to me, 'Lord, I will live the holy life under the Blessed One if, in return, he will declare to me those"
"No, lord". The monk replied again.
That being the case, who is there to abandon what If anyone should say thus: I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me, all these that would still remain undetermined by a Tathagata and, meanwhile, the person would die. Suppose, Malunkyaputta, a man was wounded by an arrow, thickly smeared with poison, and his friends and companions, his kinsmen, brings a physician who is a dart remover to treat him. If he were to say, I will not let the arrow-removing physician pull out this arrow until I know whether the man who wounded me is a Kshatriya [noble] or a brahmin [priest] or a vaishya [merchant] or a shudra [worker].
Or, if he were to say, I will not let the arrow-removing physician pull out this arrow until I know the name and the clan of the man who wounded me... until I know whether the man is tall or short or of medium height... dark or brown or yellow-skinned... lives in such and such a village or town or city... wild or cultivated... feathers fitted to the shaft from a vulture or a heron or a hawk or a peacock or a stork
Buddha added few other such possible different categories a man can think of and said, All these would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would die. Similar way, Malunkyaputta, if anyone were to say thus: I will not lead the holy life under the Blessed One until he declares to me, the truth about these theses about the cosmos, the soul and the being, that would still remain undetermined by a Tathagata and, meanwhile, the person would die.
