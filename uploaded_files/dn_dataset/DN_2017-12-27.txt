President thanks Russia for lifting tea ban
Governments prompt action paid off
Prompt action by the Government has paid off, said President Maithripala Sirisena in a tweet yesterday, following Russias decision to lift the import restrictions placed on Sri Lankan Tea.
The President stressed that diplomatic relations between Russia and Sri Lanka were exemplary.
The tea exports issue is yet another example of this friendship, tweeted President Sirisenas official twitter account.
He also took the opportunity to thank Russia for its cordiality. Russia imposed a ban on Sri Lankan tea exports on December 18 due to a Khapra beetle larvae being found in one of the packages of tea sent to the country. A Sri Lankan delegation that visited Russia last week discussed ways in which the ban could be removed and if Russia needed any additional quality control procedures imposed on Sri Lankan tea.

2017 a terrible year for Sri Lanka cricket
If the comment made by Sanjay Manjrekar is to be taken quite seriously then it more or less defines what Sri Lanka cricket has gone through during 2017.
The former India cricketer turned international cricket commentator said during the third and final T20 international at Mumbai that the Indian team no longer enjoyed the success they had against Sri Lanka and the fielders and the bowlers hardly reacted to dismissing a Lankan batsmen because the contest has got to a stage of being a foregone conclusion.
What we see here is cricket of a past era where players didnt run into congratulate or hug each other and traded high fives at the fall of a wicket which is the present trend, said Manjrekar. Capturing the wicket of a Sri Lankan batsman has become no longer a thrill for the Indians who have been so dominant in the two one-day formats.
India completed another triple series victory over Sri Lanka in back to back contests winning the Test series 2-0, the ODI series 3-0 and the T20I series 3-0 to go with their 3-0 (Tests), 5-0 (ODI) and 1-0 (T20I) victories three months ago.
It is unfortunate that Sri Lanka had to be pitted against the top ranked Test, number 2 ranked ODI and number 2 ranked T20 team in the world twice in such a short space of time when they are struggling to build a team that could compete and win consistently. If the defeats they suffered at the hands of India have not mentally defeated them then they stand to gain a lot from playing one of the top most teams in the world, if not, the results could have a detrimental effect on the future career of the players.
Where the Lankans have erred is their lack of consistency in building an innings to give their bowlers a chance to get at the opposition. There have been one or two individual contributions in each match but such returns dont build partnerships to give a side a competitive total.
The batting has to a great extent contributed to the downfall of the Lankan side that with new coach Chandika Hathurusingha taking over, chief selector Graham Labrooy expects it to be put right. Although Sri Lanka has a team batting coach in Thilan Samaraweera, Labrooy feels that Hathurusingha taking overall charge would have a bigger impact and expects to see a big improvement.
When Hathurusingha was head coach of Bangladesh he roped in Samaraweera as the batting coach and the combination worked very well for the Tigers who feared nothing and took on the opposition toe to toe without feeling inferior. What Hathurusingha brought to the Bangladesh team was self-belief and mental toughness which they lacked to compete with the best.
Hathurusingha is renowned to work on the mindset of the cricketers and there is no better person to validate that than Samaraweera himself. Samaraweera was such a defensive batsman in the early part of his Test career that he hardly made the scoreboard tick despite the many hours he spent at the crease. Such defensive ploys also saw him lose his place in the national team. A meeting with Hathurusingha who was then the coach of the Sri Lanka A team changed all that.
In 2005 when I went through a bad patch I met Chandika, he changed a few things then my mindset got better and better, recalled Samaraweera. He is very good in all three departments tactically, mentally and technically the main thing is he clears the mindset of the batsman he gives them the freedom to play. That has been the reason for his success as coach from 2009 to 2010 with the Sri Lanka team. Thats the biggest ability for him.
Sri Lankas dismal record for 2017 is: TESTS  Played 13, Won 4, Lost 7, Drawn 2; ODIs  Played 29, Won 5, Lost 23, No Result 1; T20Is  Played 15, Won 5, Lost 10.
One hopes that 2018 will be a better year for Sri Lanka cricket.
A lot of emphasis has been laid on the success of Hathurusingha taking over as head coach. You dont need rocket science to understand what is required to get the Sri Lanka team up and running. Its just that Hathurusingha should be allowed to do what he thinks is right and given time to make Sri Lanka a competitive and consistent nation across all three formats.
He is no magician so lets give him the courage and the backing to put the team back on track without throwing obstacles in his path and hinder the progress that the entire nation is eagerly waiting for.

Better public transport to ease congestion
The Government is planning a series of measures at improving public transport usage as a solution for easing traffic congestion within Colombo and the Western province.
An official at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry said as an immediate measure, plans are afoot to increase the public transport usage currently at 52 per cent in the Western Province (WP) to 60 per cent. Consultant to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry and Senior Lecturer of Civil Engineering Department of the Moratuwa University Dr. Dimantha de Silva said a feasibility study has been initiated with foreign help to identify railway corridors that could be established with the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system.
Out of the 52 per cent who use public transport, only four per cent travel by train. But, in the corridors where there are railway facilities, around 40 per cent use the train as a mode of transportation.
Therefore, development of the LRT where there is no railway system would bring a considerable reduction in the traffic congestion rather than developing a Bus Rapid Transit System, he added.
Dr. de Silva said that under the directions of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, plans are being made to construct integrated LRT sytems covering a considerable area in the Western Province. He added one would be around Colombo city from Kollupitiya, Pettah via Bambalapitiya, Borella, the BMICH, Slave Island, Eye Hospital and Gamini Hall.
Another will be constructed from Maradana to Mattakkuliya via Kotahena. Another from Bambalapitiya to Kirulapona and to Dematagoda.
Another two lines would be constructed to Kottawa and Kaduwela from Malambe while another would be constructed from Armour Street to Kadawatha via Kiribathgoda.
Meanwhile, Project Director of the JICA supported LRT project Chaminda Ariyadasa said the loan agreement for the construction of the LRT line from Malambe to Fort (Separate line from Union place to Kollupitiya) would be signed next year if the feasibility report gets the green light.
He added the Malambe-Fort LRT would run via Battaramulla, Rajagiriya, Borella, Eye Hospital and Gamini Hall.
He added that the loan would be a soft loan from JICA of which the loan interest rate would be 0.1 percent.
Ariyadasa also added that the country also would receive a 10 year grace period following the completion of the project for repayments. He said when completed travel time between Malabe  Fort or Malabe  Kollupitiya could be reduced to less than 30 minutes. Meanwhile, a passenger ferry service using the canal network in and around Colombo too will come into effect in order to minimise traffic congestion.

Boult leads New Zealand to Windies series sweep in rain
Christchurch: New Zealand completed a clean sweep of the West Indies in their one-day series with a commanding 66-run victory in a rain-affected third and final match in Christchurch on Tuesday.
With the match reduced to 23-overs-a-side, the West Indies were set a revised target of 166 in reply to New Zealand's 131.
At the close they were 99 for nine, after recovering from an initial collapse which saw them at nine for five and threatening Zimbabwe's world record ODI low of 35.
Captain Jason Holder revived the innings with a quick 34 off 21 deliveries.
But there was little other resistance as fast bowlers Trent Boult and Matt Henry along with spinner Mitchell Santner took the batting apart.
The latest drubbing, following New Zealand's five-wicket win in the first ODI and a 204-run victory in the second, continued a miserable tour for the West Indies who also lost the Test series 2-0.New Zealand elected to bat first, and were 83 for three after 19 overs when rain forced the players from the field. They added 48 in the four available overs after the resumption.
Ross Taylor ended unbeaten on 47 while Tom Latham made 37. After the Duckworth-Lewis revision, the target of 166 should not have been beyond the World T20 champions, but they found themselves in trouble in the first over.
Chris Gayle, back in action after being sidelined by illness since the half-way stage of the first ODI, only faced six balls in which he hit one boundary before he steered a Henry delivery to Colin Munro at point.
Boult removed Shai Hope (two) in the second over before Henry came back to win a dubious lbw decision against Kyle Hope and the West Indies were seven for three. Boult, in his second over, accounted for Jason Mohammed for one and Chadwick Walton without scoring to put the pressure on Jason Holder to lift his side out of the mire.
Holder put on 48 with Rovman Powell (11) in a sixth-wicket rally but with their departure the innings folded quickly.
Boult finished with three for 18, Santner took three for 15 and Henry two for 18. The West Indies end their tour with three T20 matches starting in Nelson on Friday. AFP

Bus ploughs into Moscow underpass; five dead
RUSSIA: Five people were killed Monday when a Moscow bus ploughed into a pedestrian underpass in the west of the city, officials said.
It was not immediately clear what caused the accident as authorities said they were looking into several possibilities, including a technical malfunction. Authorities did not mention terrorism as a possible cause.
"Nine people are currently in the city's clinics... four people died on the spot," the Moscow city hall said in a statement on the website.
Footage broadcast on national television showed the bus driving onto the pavement and then down the stairs of the underpass, running over several pedestrians before coming to a stop.
Moscow police said in a statement they were looking into two possible causes -- the driver losing control of the vehicle and a technical problem with the bus.
"The driver of the bus began movement and then changed his trajectory, which resulted in the bus going down into the pedestrian underpass," the statement said. "The driver has been detained. Police employees are working with him," the statement said. "According to the driver, the bus was parked and suddenly began to move by itself," said a statement by the Russian Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes. "Despite his attempts to stop the bus, the breaking system did not work and the bus continued moving," it said. Investigators said they were questioning witnesses and plan to examine vehicle documentation and order medical examination of the driver.
The accident happened around 3 pm near Moscow's Slavyansky Boulevard metro station, a prestigious residential area near one of the capital's main avenues.
Sirens were blaring around the metro station, with authorities preparing to pull the bus out of the underpass, an AFP correspondent at the scene said.
The underpass and surrounding area were cordoned off and several black body bags could be seen on the pavement, partially covered with falling snow.
The emergencies ministry said helicopters had been dispatched to the scene to help evacuate the victims.
"There are dead and wounded," tweeted Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin. "We are providing emergency aid," he said, offering condolences to families of the victims.
Sobyanin also visited the scene, telling journalists he had ordered a full inspection of the entire Moscow bus fleet.

CB receives first payment from CMPort
The first payment of USD 292.1 million from China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) Co Ltd for the handing over of operations of the Hambantota Port has been credited to the US Dollar account of the Government of Sri Lanka maintained at the Central Bank, states a press release from the International Operations Department of the Central Bank yesterday.
The Port was handed over to the Chinese company on December 9, where Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was given a cheque of USD 292,097, 400 million as an advance payment.
The Government in November decided to amend the clauses of the Hambantota Framework Agreement between CMPort, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Government of Sri Lanka, CMPort, Hambantota International Port Group (Pvt) Ltd, and Hambantota International Port Services Company (Pvt) Ltd to fast track the scheduled payments from the deal.
The new agreement stated that 30 percent would be paid on the date of signing, 10 percent after a month since signing and to pay the remaining 60 percent within six months of signing.
The Government signed the Framework Agreement with CMPort for USD 1.12 billion.

A challenge for 2018
President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed separate commissions to probe the massive losses at SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka, which was more or less absorbed into SriLankan after this government came to power. This is a step in the right direction that will help unravel what went wrong with these institutions.
These probes will help the government to decide the future of SriLankan Airlines in the coming year.
The authorities are yet to find a strategic partner for the airline, which has continued to make heavy losses since the termination of the agreement with Emirates Airline of the UAE by the previous Government. It has made a loss of nearly Rs.6.5 billion for the last financial year (2016/17).
With some experts saying that the only other option would be closing down the airline, it is imperative that the Government should find a partner for the airline, preferably from the aviation sector itself. However, if this option is not available, offers from non-aviation companies should be entertained. This process has now gone on for more than a year, with no tangible results.
Thus 2018 should be a watershed year for SriLankan, which is now a member of the prestigious Oneworld Alliance. Closure should not be an option for the airline which flies our flag around the world. But it cannot go on making losses, despite the progress made and awards won for in-flight service. The airline has expanded services to India and started a new daily flight to Melbourne, which is a sign that the present management is keen to turn it around. More destinations are likely to be added next year, as more A320 New Engine Option (NEO) aircraft are delivered to the airline. The Government should also make a decision on whether or not to go ahead with the purchase of four Airbus A350 aircraft, a part of a transaction carried out by the previous Government under dubious circumstances. However, there is a school of thought that SriLankan should go ahead with this purchase and start more long-haul flights, including resuming the Paris and Frankfurt sectors.
Several ministers have spoken of the need to protect the national airline, but this should not mean closing down our airspace for foreign carriers. Despite years of talking, we still do not have an Open Skies policy. The idea of protecting SriLankan should not clash with the Governments avowed goal of bringing in nearly four million tourists a year in a few years. We need more airlines to fly into Colombo to get to this figure. Already, two airlines have announced new flights to Colombo in 2018  IndiGo of India and Edelweiss of Switzerland, a subsidiary of Swiss Airlines. We must invite more new airlines to come to Colombo and also urge existing carriers to start more flights, taking advantage of Bilateral Air Services agreements. More landing/take-off slots will become available as the expansion of the Bandaranaike International Airport is completed around 2020, which will enable officials to pitch the airport to more foreign airlines.
There has been much debate about the proposed plan by Air Asia to set up a subsidiary company here, with an eventual fleet of 25 aircraft based at Colombo (BIA), Jaffna and Mattala airports. (This way, Mattala will be able to shed its reputation as the Worlds Emptiest Airport). A proposal to this effect has already been submitted for Cabinet approval. This is a timely proposal that aligns perfectly with the plans to bring in more tourists over the next decade. The new budget-oriented airline will be able to tap into unserviced or unutilized routes, without offering direct competition to SriLankan. No damage will be caused to the public purse in this exercise as the entire operation will be funded by Air Asia Sri Lanka which hopes to invest billions of dollars here. Air Asia has set up similar programmes in India, Indonesia and Thailand. It might even be able to begin domestic flights using smaller aircraft.
Many have drawn comparisons with Mihin Lanka in this regard, but it was a vanity project of the previous administration without any sound rationale. On the other hand, Air Asia is an internationally reputed company which has turned around many difficult aviation markets. Colombo is yet to realise its potential as an Asian aviation hub and the Air Asia proposal is a nod in that direction.
Being an island, air travel remains the only regular method of travel to and from the island, apart from the few passenger cruises that call at Colombo Port. Priority should be given to developing the aviation sector, including the revival of SriLankan Airlines. The aviation sector can make a greater contribution to the economy from landing fees to airport taxes. A world-class flight school at Mattala, for example, will be able to attract students from other Asian countries, thus generating foreign exchange. The proposed expansion of the Ratmalana Airport, which is much closer to the Colombo city centre, will also enable more smaller international aircraft to land there. A SriLankan-Air Asia duopoly will serve our aviation and tourism interests well, even as more airlines are vying to begin flights to Colombo.

The first Sri Lankan cricketer in the WBBL
Chamari Atapattu - living the dream in the WBBL
Why are the cars not honking
It wasnt quite the first question Melbourne Renegades coach, Tim Coyle expected from his teams international signing, Chamari Atapattu while driving her from the airport to the team hotel. Accompanying Coyle in the car was Atapattus uncle, Vernon Tissera, who quickly explained to his niece that Australia is significantly different to Sri Lanka and there was a fair chance she might never hear a sound of a horn during her tenure down under.
It is her first trip to Australia, so I had to explain to her the rules in Australia and Tim just looked at me in a funny manner Tissera said.
Tissera, a cricket enthusiastic and young cricketers development program co-ordinator in Melbourne, played a crucial role in luring Atapattu to the Renegades for the third edition of the Womens Big Bash League.
We run the young development of cricket program in Victoria. It is nearly running for 10 years - it is mostly for boys, but few years ago we started to take a girls team over to Sri Lanka during the winter months, he explains.
It is during that first tour with the womens team that Tissera ran into Atapattu at the St Josephs school in Colombo. The pair was introduced to each other by the then Sri Lanka womens team coach, Harsha De Silva and have stayed in touch via email and social media ever since.
We used to keep in contact and she would ask if there was any opportunity to play cricket in Australia. Unfortunately, the womens game wasnt big back then, so it was difficult, especially for a girl to be sponsored by a club, Tissera adds.
The minute the WBBL was launched, Tissera decided to try his luck and contacted Cricket Victoria to check if there was an opportunity for Atapattu. But for two consecutive years, he was politely advised that there was no room for an international player at the Melbourne Stars or the Renegades.
Come September this year, only three months after Atapattu stroked a masterful 178 against Australia during the Womens World Cup in England, Tissera decided to try his luck again.
I sent the email at night and next morning I received a call from Tim Coyle [the Renegades coach] saying they were definitely interested and wanted to get in contact with Chamari.
I immediately called Chamari in England, she was playing in the Kia Super League and told her that she will get a call and to accept the offer
She was so excited, the minute the phone rang I think she answered Tim [Coyle] - saying Yes, yes, yes - I want to play in the WBBL
The deal was done and Atapattu became the first Sri Lankan female cricketer to be signed by a WBBL team.
Yes, my uncle [Tissera] - helped me get the contract and Im grateful to him Atapattu said. The WBBL is now a big competition - lots of people come to watch us play and I really wanted a chance to play in it.
Atapattu accepts that the opportunity might never have eventuated if it wasnt for the blistering knock against Australia - a 143-ball 178 in a losing cause.
It was the most important innings because now people were talking about me. After that match - Alex Blackwell, Meg Lanning and Elysse Perry came to me and praised me (for) my knock. They all said they were happy about the way I batted and congratulated me on my performance.
It was a very satisfying feeling for me to have my opponents come and praise me in that manner she says.
During her epic innings of 178, Atapattu bludgeoned the Australian pace bowling artillery of Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt and Belinda Vakarewa to all parts of the ground. Throughout the World Cup, she looked at consummate ease against some of the finest pace bowlers in the world and cites her upbringing for handling pace comfortably.
Throughout my earlier career, I would play with the men. Right from Under 15s , 17s and even Under 19s, I played with boys who used to bowl fast. I was able to compete with them, so that was big boost for me.
It was a great experience playing against a lot of bowlers bowling over 120kmph when I was still coming up through the system. Looking back at that period, it helped me handle the pace bowlers and now in the womens game, Im very comfortable handling the faster bowlers. It does not trouble me and I feel I can handle it, she adds.
In fact, so confident is Atapattu against fast bowling that a couple of months ago, during a net session, she even asked Sri Lankan pace sensation Lasith Malinga to bowl to her.
Atapattu was introduced to cricket at the age of five in her home town of Kurunegala, but despite playing the game for most of her life, she is still trying to master the T20 format.
Tissera says she loves the challenge and is extremely determined to prove herself in the WBBL this year. Her immediate goal is to ensure the Renegades qualify for the finals and then hopefully propel them to their first WBBL title.
For me, the WBBL is teaching me how to play in the T20 format. The bowling, where to bat, how to rotate strike, build partnership, how to finish - to be able to do that in this competition I feel will only enhance my game, she says.
Tissera has played an instrumental role in ensuring Atapattus participation in WBBL03 and he is determined to ensure he can help her out as much as possible.
Initially, she found it difficult to adapt to the food, so we had her over for a nice Sri Lankan meal. Now, she has settled well and has never said, uncle Im home sick.
Atapattu believes her Renegades team members along with the support staff have made it easy for her to fit in as well.
Renegades have been terrific for me. They have helped me settle in Australia. They are always encouraging me - I love playing with them.
For now, not only is Atapattu fine tuning her game, but is also picking up on a few Australian phrases such as no worries mate or want a cuppa. Importantly, she has made a decent start on the field scoring a fine innings of 42 in the opening game.
Hopefully, I can do well and then play again in this tournament next year she concluded.
If she does do that, she might well be inspiring many more Sri Lankan women to want to take up cricket and even show off their skills in Australia.  Cricbuzz

Rejection of nomination papers at LG elections
Nomination papers of candidates were rejected at several places. Some nomination papers were rejected due to very simple and obvious reasons. This is causing lot of confusion. Why cannot the Department of Elections follow some more reasonable procedure
If there is a simple obvious mistake in a nomination paper, it should not be rejected. There should be provision to do the necessary corrections and accept the paper.
A nomination paper can be rejected if there is a fraud or if they are purposely trying to hide facts. Otherwise last moment corrections should be allowed. We have very qualified government officers. We have very qualified lawyers. With their help these things should be sorted out in a fair manner. Sri Lanka is a democratic country. There should be transparency. Government officers should not impose unnecessary rules and harass the people. They are there to help the people. They should not behave like dictators.
Human beings are not perfect. Nothing is perfect in this world. See how many babies are born with defects. Are we rejecting all of them We give necessary medical support and correct the defects.

Classical liberalism and conservatism
Common ground for a new vision
This countrys full name, the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, offers brief insight into the major political lens through which its economy is handled. From State-run hospitals to tuition-free universities to government-set and regulated price points for key supermarket purchases, the countrys socialism-though not entirely comprehensive-dominates its economic identity.
This socialism also permeates major debates in the country. The issue of SAITM (South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine)-which dominated newspaper headlines, triggered mass protests and demonstrations, and led to the abstention from classes by medical students-was at its core about whether or not certain private institutions, in this case educational, can exist in a place where government regulation and administration of certain services is the norm.
The result of the issue, which saw the government shut down and abolish SAITMs medical faculty in October, suggests that the answer is no.
Yet there are a group of prominent Sri Lankans seeking to challenge this view. They believe there is a better way.
What is classical liberalism
Dr. Asanga Welikala.
In late December of 2017, the first official meeting of a new classical liberal organization, the Night-Watchmen Society, took place. The organization derives its name from an idea adjacent to libertarian political philosophy, which stakes claim to the belief that the best type of State performs only the functions of a night-watchman-essentially protecting people and their property from harm and theft-and nothing more.
On a practical level, then, the only functions of a night-watchman State would be to provide citizens with a military, Police force, and Court system. The night-watchman State fits well under a more general political ideology called classical liberalism, which advocates civil liberties under the rule of law with an emphasis on economic freedom.
At this first meeting, held at the Royal College Skills Center, Professor Razeen Sally took up the task of defining and explaining classical liberalism to an eager and varyingly informed crowd, many of whom lamented that there lacks a proper forum in Sri Lanka to discuss deeper level economic ideas.
Sally, a self-proclaimed classical liberal, is an associate professor of public policy at the National University of Singapore and chairman of the Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo. He was on the faculty of the London School of Economics for eighteen years, and his research and teaching focus on global trade policy and Asia in the world economy. Sally is also a senior advisor to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media.
Quoting David Hume, Sally said his affection toward classical liberalism stemmed from his belief that it is the system under which bad men who might gain power can do least harm. He proceeded to chart the history of the ideology, explaining that it came about in the 19th century during the Scottish Enlightenment with a focus on individual, positive freedoms or liberties.
In the economic sphere, this individual freedom is the freedom to produce or consume under guaranteed property rights for the private individual, out of which results a sophisticated market economy and in it, the kind of division of labour that Adam Smith described, Sally said.
He then revealed this type of market economy as laissez-faire, a French term for a system in which transactions between private parties are free from government intervention such as regulation, privileges, tariffs, and subsidies.
The umpire and the sports player
For a classical liberal, justice is not redistributive or social, but procedural. Sally likens this procedural justice to rules of the road which govern drivingjustice which comes from fairness in processes to resolve disputes and allocate resources.
Concluding his speech, Sally provided an example of an umpire and sports player to explain how he believes classical liberalism should be applied to legislation.
The basic [socialist] argument is that the State should be both umpire and player. The State should design and enforce the rules of the game, but at the same time, the State should be a player in the process or economy, he said.
The classical liberal argues that the State should be an umpire, but it shouldnt be a player. The State should be in charge of enforcing the rules, but it should not be a player in the game. It should neither set prices nor control them, it should not play around with property rights, and it should not interfere with production and consumption.
The conservative counter-view
Providing a response to Professor Sally was another Sri Lankan academic, Dr. Asanga Welikala, whose economic idealswhile not classically liberalmore closely align with Sallys than with those of the current Sri Lankan government. He was tasked with answering a question posed by Sally: is conservatism compatible with classical liberalism
Welikala, a lecturer in public law at the University of Edinburgh and a research fellow with the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) in Sri Lanka, focuses on comparative constitutional law, applied constitutional theory, and Commonwealth constitutional history. He identifies as a staunch conservative.
I am very much a Tory in the United Kingdom. But Im a liberal in Sri Lanka, he quipped. Because if youre not an ethnic nationalist here, you must be a liberal. This is the negative definition I give.
He conceded that, in execution if not in pure ideology, his conservatism looks fairly similar to Sallys classical liberalism. Both worldviews believe in little government, and that government has little to no place in the regulation of commerce so long as the rights of others are not infringed upon.
Then he shifted his focus over to the country and what he says are the two ideologies it has identified with since its inception: ethnic nationalism and socialism.
Theres an expectation of miraculous things from the State. That is the reason we want the State to do everything for us. And when the State is not doing that, then it is seen as an uncaring State. That is not true, he said.
If we value our freedom and our autonomy to do things on our own, and believe in the State as the essential instrument only of law and order in social life, we would have different expectations.
He explained that he finds it easier to defend the conservative position in the United Kingdom versus in Sri Lanka because there, is a reliable and respected tradition of the ideology.
Like Sally did with classical liberalism, Welikala also acknowledged that conservatism is an ideology borne of the western world, and as such would perhaps have to be adjusted and tweaked to make its mark as a successful governing lens here.
Applying these ideologies to the present
In a lively question and answer session after the two academics spoke, many questions were raised that sought to ground the two relevant ideologiesclassical liberal and conservativein the here and now by applying them to present-day issues.
One audience member asked how Sri Lanka could deal with its history of racial and ethnic tension in a classically-liberal manner, since, he said, classical liberalism is silent on this matter.
Sally responded that a classical liberal would be vehemently opposed to assigning Buddhism a foremost place in the constitution and would never allow for customary religious law such as Sri Lankas current Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, which among other things legalizes child marriage. Welikala, on the other hand, agreed with the audience member asking the question that classical liberalism does have this blind spot.
Another audience member asked about the classical liberal view of the provision of healthcare and education. Sally responded that he feels its a grey area. While a libertarian might say the government should have no say and both healthcare and education should be left up to the market, and a socialist might say the government should be the primary actor in these arenas, Sally suggested that classical liberalism might strike a balance somewhere in the middle.
You cannot rely on the market to provide these goods. Because there are gaps in market provision, they may well be under-provided, particularly for the most vulnerable sections of society, so the State has a role beyond pure umpiring, Sally said.
He offered a voucher system as a solution, wherein the government would help finance the provision of these goods but still abstains entirely from the direct provision and administration itself.
Then the question of Sri Lankas tentative gender quota for government arose. Welikala, to the surprise of audience members, stated that hed gone against his conservative, government-regulation-free ideology in 2005, when he was part of a commission responsible for inputting a gender quota of 40 percent into Iraqs constitution.
I departed from my first principles there. Confronted with a violent and increasingly Islamizing society, we began to realize that the hard-man dictators social liberalism was preferred by what replaced if afterward. So we had to think of constitutional devices to protect the role of women in public life in Iraq, to which women in Iraq had been long used, Welikala said.
So I would make a very practical accommodation with what is needed in a certain context. And I think that in a place like Sri Lanka, generally speaking, we must do all we can to encourage the participation of women in public life, because they will have a qualitatively-enhancing impact on the electoral process. We must do away with the kinds of things like violence and corruption that keep the full participation of half of our population from the political process.
Sally disagreed, claiming that though he is no expert on gender quotas, he has reservations. He sees such quotas as open sesame for all kinds of group rights.
If you allow that in the electoral system, what about companies Shouldnt boards have 40 or 50 percent female representation Where does it stop
Welikala said this problem could be addressed by drawing a clear divide between quotas in the public and private sectors.
Most memorable from this session, though, was an impassioned outburst, in which one audience member questioned how western capitalist ideologiesspecifically those borne in the United Kingdomcould be held up as exemplars.
Is there any greater example of a rampant state than the English state in the world When youre talking laissez-faire, they were basically robbing the seas around the world, installing slavery.
To this point, as was emphasized throughout the night, both Sally and Welikala concluded that the western histories of both their preferred ideologies were far from perfect. Still, they see them as preferable to the present politics of the country, and insisted that their respective ideologies could be amended if implemented here to best suit the specific needs of the country.

A driverless luxury bus collided with a car and four motorcycles damaging them badly in Vavuniya.
The bus from Colombo to Vavuniya reportedly ran after the driver had parked it by the main road and gone to withdraw cash from a ATM.
A three wheeler driver had noticed the incident and chased after the bus along with a friend. They had managed to stop the bus but only after it collided with a car and four motorcycles.
Even at that time, the bus driver was not aware that his bus had run without him.

False propaganda being spread against me: Sumanthiran
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran yesterday alleged that a spate of false propaganda are being spread against him as Local Government polls heat up.
Local Government polls have led to internal rifts between Sumantiran and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran more apparent.
One rumour, he said, was certain media organisations and the Northern Province Chief Minister spreading news that he and the TNA leadership had tried to stop a meeting between the Malaysian Prime Minister and Vigneswaran.
I did not do such thing. I was asked if Sampanthan would be available for a meeting and I said he was going to be in Trincomalee and would not be able to meet the PM. I did not have any conversation with either the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister in this regard. It was some official from the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry I spoke to, Sumanthiran stated in an email sent to Vigneswaran, explaining his stance.
He took the opportunity to remind the Northern Province Chief Minister that it was the TNA leader, who insisted that Prime Minister Modi meet him, though the Indian PM had not scheduled a meeting with him.
The Chief Minister has said that if I was not involved in sabotaging his meeting with the Malaysian PM, I should deny it. That is why I wrote to him. He has been propagating these lies without even checking with me, Sumanthiran said. The TNA MP stressed that certain electronic media and websites had been fabricating news for political advantage, They have reported that I have been appointed a minister and that I have been given a house in Colombo 7. I am not a minister and I have never seen such a house, he said.
As his own party member joins in the fray, MP Sumanthiran remarked, Everyone knows that the Chief Minister is estranged from the party for some time now. Despite this, we will win the Local Government elections hands down.
He has very little influence. Even during the 2015 Parliamentary elections, he asked people to vote for another party but that did not work, Sumanthiran said.

Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Elections Commission Chairman said the media has a special responsibility to encourage the participation of the public in the democratic process, and to ensure that the candidates have the opportunity to present their views on an equal basis during the period of an election.
He said every media institution should provide accurate, balanced and impartial information in broadcasting or telecasting their news bulletins and any other programmes relating to political matters. The neutrality and impartiality of the media shall be monitored regularly by the Standing Committee of Permanent Representatives on Elections Complaints and the Standing Committee of Permanent Representatives on Media Guidelines.
Every telecasting, broadcasting and print media should also be neutral and impartial in their reporting of matters relating to any election and should not act in a manner which is discriminatory against any contesting political party, independent group or a candidate or causing a special benefit to any such party, group or candidate in allocating airtime and allotting space for such political party, independent group or a candidate in the newspapers.
Editorials published in the newspapers should not be commented by electronic media as opinions in such commentaries may be confused and biased. Whenever an editorial opinion is broadcast, telecast or published, the affected party shall be given an opportunity to broadcast, telecast or publish material to counter such opinion, he said.
He said every presenter of programmes and announcer of television and radio channels should refrain from expressing personal views at the newspaper desks where newspaper headlines and cartoons are presented which may promote one party while prejudice another.
It is the responsibility of the news and current affairs divisions of all electronic and print media institutions not to broadcast, telecast or publish any biased programme or supplement during the election period, if such programme, supplement or news item is inconsistent with the election laws and media guidelines of the Elections Commission.
Every media institution should refrain from broadcasting, telecasting or publishing propaganda that may create or induce hatred and intolerance among Sri Lankan people on various grounds including the religious beliefs, faith practice, languages spoken, ethnicity, customs and castes. Every media institution should avoid broadcasting, telecasting or publishing propaganda activities that promote hateful politics among political activists and within society, he said.
Every media institution should refrain from republishing or repeat telecasting of any statement made previously by any candidate or a supporter about another candidate of another political party without the consent of the declarant and honour the request made by a declarant not to repeat such statement made by such person previously, he said.
Any media institution shall not give coverage to anonymous notices or propaganda and to the notices or propaganda under the names of fake organisations or persons. The responsibility in this regard shall lie with the respective media institution.
The Chairman said the Elections Commission and the Police Department alone cannot ensure the free and fare election and political parties, candidates, media and citizens should also be contributed to the effort.

India-Sri Lanka cricket match
Four held for betting in Kalyan
Four people were arrested on Monday for allegedly accepting bets on the India-Sri Lanka cricket match on Sunday night.
A raid was conducted jointly by the Khadakpada Police and the Unit III of the Thane Crime Branch in a residential building on Gandhari Road in Kalyan. We had received information that a gang with international links was operating from one of the flats. Four suspects were detained, and 15 cell phones, two laptops, six notebooks, and INR 100,000 were recovered, said an officer attached to the Thane Crime Branch.
The suspects, identified as Hiralal Talreja, his son Kunal, his brother Mahesh Talreja, and their associate Kamlesh Lakhiyani, were taken to the Unit III office. The call records of the cell phones were examined, and the police found that the four had consistently been taking calls from various parts of the State for the entire duration of the match.
The four were questioned, and after preliminary inquiries, Police booked them under the Maharashtra Gambling Act, Indian Telegraph Act, and the Information Technology Act. They were arrested on Monday morning.
The accused would accept bets from punters based in Thane district and neighbouring areas, and place bets through an online portal. An analysis of their call records has revealed that they made numerous calls to a Dubai-based number registered to one Jatin at frequent intervals. We suspect that their leader is based in Dubai and was communicating the rates to them based on developments in the match, the officer said. Owing to the Dubai connection, a possible link between the accused and underworld gangs is being probed. Apart from Jatin, an accused identified as Deepak Talreja is wanted in the case.
Police are also working on identifying the people who placed the bets, and they have received inputs to indicate that the arrested quartet is part of a larger network of bookies, which accepts bets on ongoing cricket tournaments.
The professional set-up of the racket indicates that the accused have been active for quite some time, and we are finding out how long they were operating from the building in Kalyan. Such racketeers keep changing their base every tournament. Some gangs even shift bases every few matches in order to avoid being apprehended, an officer said.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an island-wide strike in January if the Health Ministry does not respond positively in two weeks to the proposals handed over by the GMOA one year ago regarding the allowance paid to doctors for additional duties, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the strike will be launched in January if the Health Ministry does not respond in two weeks.
Dr. Aluthge said they would not accept non-payment of the allowance to doctors for additional duties on any grounds since the Government pumps Rs. 300 million every month for the SAITM owner even though the Government still not taken over his hospital. From 2017 budget the Government abolished the tax relief available for doctors' allowance for additional duties. The doctors completely oppose this move. The allowance was revised for the last time in 2013. All the other state departments have already increased all their allowances in parallel to the salary increase granted in January 1, 2016, he said.

Lambs abroad Buoyant India target maiden win in SA
New Delhi: Virat Kohli's India head for a gruelling tour of South Africa on Wednesday looking for a record-breaking tenth straight Test series triumph, but they will have to overcome a reputation for being bad travellers.
India, who beat New Zealand, England and Australia in a powerful home season to consolidate their number one Test ranking, celebrated their last major away victory in 2008-2009 when they beat the Kiwis 1-0 in a three-Test series.
"Looking forward to the South Africa tour, it's going to be a different challenge," said Rohit Sharma, who captained the Indian limited-overs side in Kohli's recent absence.
"But I want to reiterate about our home season, it's never easy to beat anyone. We were challenged at different times and we came back."
Overseas success against weakened West Indies and Sri Lanka sides in the past two years, and India's invincibility at home, has led pundits to back Kohli's side to put up a strong challenge to South Africa, who are second in the Test rankings and have never lost to India at home.
India will play three Tests, six one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches during the two-month tour. The series begins with the first Test in Cape Town on January 5.
"They had a very good 2017. They have to carry on with the good work overseas also, away from Asia. At any given time you cannot sit on your past laurels," former captain Bishan Singh Bedi told AFP.
"To prove it to yourself, not to the world, that you are worthy of the number one position. It's not easy to get there but even more difficult to stay there," the ex-spinner added. AFP

## Title: Local Government election dynamics in the North and East
## Supertitle:

## Date: Wednesday, December 27, 2017 - 01:00
Local Government election dynamics in the North and East
Despite the year-end holiday season, the political focus is on the upcoming local government elections scheduled for February 10th next year. With nominations closing by end December, January will witness the campaigning by the candidates and the political parties for the sovereign Sri Lankan peoples vote. The election has clear ramifications beyond the local bodies, as nationally there is a redrawing of political lines as the government and opposition factions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), led by President Sirisena and by former President Rajapaksa contest the elections separately for the first time.
A relevant factor in the political dynamic is the politics of the North and East, which though important and impactful on Sri Lankan national life is often not taken into consideration in the political discourse. In the Tamil majority Northern Province and in the Batticaloa District in the Eastern Province, the TNA dominate the political landscape. Often polling well over seventy percent in their constituencies, the truth of the matter is that the TNA, its leader and Leader of the Opposition, the veteran Rajavarothian Sambanthan has a lock on the Tamil electorate that far exceed even the mid sixty percent which Mahinda Rajapaksa hit at the zenith of his post war popularity in 2010, a political high which had dissipated by end 2014.
Making the news a couple of weeks ago was the formation of a new Tamil political alliance, created supposedly to challenge the dominance of the ITAK led TNA, between the TULF of Anandasangari and the EPRLF faction of Suresh Premachandra, who finally decided to try his political luck outside the TNA. It is noteworthy that the TNA leadership has still left the door open for a post-election return to the fold by the EPRLF (Suresh faction) but not taking in the EPRLF faction led by Sugu and other more left oriented political moderates.
Elected counsellors
A fairly sober assessment of the prospects of the TULF / EPRLF combine would likely indicate that the TULF which has no representation in the Sri Lankan Parliament but nonetheless, the Anandasangari family having more electoral fortune in Canada, with son Gary Anandasangari being elected to the Canadian Federal Parliament from the Scarborough area of Toronto for the governing Liberal Party. The EPRLF (Suresh faction) succeeded in electing Shivashakthi Anandan at the August 2015 election from the Vanni, though Suresh himself was unsuccessful in retaining his seat from Jaffna. Similarly, Sureshs brother, now a Minister of the Northern Provincial Council, after the ITAK decided on principle to move away from the Provincial Administration of Chief Minister Wigneswaran, was barely elected to the Northern PC, coming in one but the last in a long list of elected TNA members, basically 29th out of 30 elected counsellors. This does not augur well for the ELRLF chances in Jaffna, their pocket boroughs in the Vanni likely to provide their combine with the TULF, with some elected local representation but not much.
The other factor in the Northern and especially Eastern Province is of course the Muslim political dynamics and in this regard, the traditional Muslim leadership of the Sri Lankan Muslim Congress (SLMC) has been under some pressure in recent years from its breakaway the Sri Lankan Peoples Congress of Minister Rishard Bathurdeen. The SLMCs former General Secretary Hassen Ali, who rather acrimoniously departed from the SLMC has tied up with Rishard Bathurdeen and will likely pose a very tough challenge to the SLMC. In fact, in certain constituencies, the Bathurdeen / Hassan Ali combine will overtake the SLMC.
However, in the context of national politics, this is unlikely to cause any effect as both Muslim alliances remain firmly within the national unity government. In the case of both the Muslim parties, they will run some candidates in partnership with the national parties, mostly the UNP, while in some areas, generally the Muslim majority Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas, they will run independently. An election to watch in terms of Muslim politics would be the impact that State Minister Hisbulla can make in his pocket borough of Kathankudy for the SLFP, the votes from there being insufficient for his own parliamentary election and hence the need for an SLFP national list slot for him, but nonetheless polling well.
No political appeal
This brings us to the electoral prospects of the national parties in the North and East. Likely to standout from among the national parties is the UNP, which has a parliamentary representation from every district including Jaffna, which is more than the SLFP led UPFA can boast of after the 2015 elections or before. Now when contesting separately as the SLFP / UPFA and the SLPP / JO, the reality is that with the minority support base of the SLFP / UPFA is solidly with President Sirisena. The SLFP effort in the North is led by its young national list MP, Angajan Ramanathan, whose either brawn or brains should deliver some SLFP votes in Jaffna, drawing deep from an old tradition of Alfred Duraiappa, the last SLFP mayor of Jaffna, whose assassination was the launch of the LTTEs armed challenge to the Sri Lankan state.
It is however the SLPP and the JO which in the North and East will lay bare its political limitations and lack of attraction outside a section of the majority Sinhala Buddhist community. Should the good Professor Peiris and brother number two (no pun intended) Basil Rajapaksa, succeed in running SLPP lists in the North, they would be fortunate to get back their candidate deposits. It was an academic and colleague from the Kumaratunga Administration days who coined the phrase the Sinhala National Alliance (SNA) as a better term for the Rajapaksa comeback project, rather than the SLPP.
However, it is not desirable that an aspirant for national political power has no political appeal in the North and East. The dynamics of the North and East, completes the national political landscape and any serious analysis and discourse would be incomplete without its inclusion.

## Title: LOCALISATION OF CONFLICT RESPONSES
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, December 27, 2017 - 01:00
LOCALISATION OF CONFLICT RESPONSES
While localisation has long been a mantra in international development and peace building circles, there has over the past few years been a much louder call for genuine localisation in mainstream policy debates. In particular the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 signaled the emergence of localisation as a central issue on the international humanitarian agenda. This is all the more pressing in the Arab region, which as home to a disproportionate amount of contemporary conflicts and crises, faces a major challenge in translating global responses into local solutions and identifying existing grassroots, community-level capacities for responding to conflict and dealing with its aftermath.
In short, considering the scale and nature of conflict in the Arab world, localization has been transformed from a policy choice to a necessary, default option  which calls for a critical interrogation of its meanings, potentialities and shortcomings.
What is localisation
The concept of localisation possesses a number of properties. It is in essence about scale, not only geographical but also in sociological, political or economic terms.
Localisation entails notions of community participation, local ownership, local knowledge, empowerment, autonomy, and increasingly resource sharing. One response is to locate the family, village, community, clan, or city as the local. By contrast, localisation in humanitarian action often refers to much broader processes of nationalisation and regionalisation, entailing a relative move towards being more local and less internationalized.
Localisation and conflict resolution
International peace builders share a common culture that perceives conflict as resulting from national and international level tensions which has produced a dominant top-down, diplomatic and macro-political peace building apparatus whose purpose is to address the nation-state and international system.
This system is not geared towards addressing tensions at the local level at which many of the deep-lying drivers of conflict are located. This will require an understanding of conflict in fluid environments based upon traditional patterns of living and a highly localised view of the way conflict manifests within the structure and dynamics of society. There is a need, then, for a conflict analysis that emphasises the local-level relationships and social cohesion between clan-structures and other groups.
The nature of protracted conflict has distorted community-based traditional forms of conflict resolution, which in various cases have either disappeared or been eroded in terms of values.
Tribal structures have been weakened by long-term trends including a loss of youth respect for elders, which can be observed in contexts including Somalia, Syria, or Yemen, and the attempts by secular states over the course of decades to dismantle tribes, thus rendering tribal structures for conflict resolution less relevant. While these capacities have often been eroded, due to the persistent nature of conflict, the repeated failures of outside intervention to resolve conflict, and increasingly large obstacles to accessibility, it often suddenly becomes fashionable to seek out customary forms of peace-making. Yet the speed with which external constituencies demand peace processes to operate under often does not permit these local mechanisms of conflict resolution sufficient time to build their reputation or test their legitimacy.
Local ownership and post-conflict recovery
The state remains the fundamental purveyor of security. Yet it often fails to fulfill its security obligationsand at times has even become a source of threat to its own people. That is why attention must now shift from the security of the state to the securityof the people to human security. In many respects, human security requires including the excluded.
In the Arab context, in particular following the Arab Spring, we find ourselves in a landscape of fragile and failing states at a scale not seen before. International panic and concern within this situation of conflict engulfing the region and overwhelming societal capacities, rather than a principled and proactive effort to ensure the coherence between international state building models and local realities, has been the primary driver behind the recourse back to identifying and working with traditional modes of customary and tribal governance. Furthermore, international approaches to fragility in the region must contend with large areas under non-state control, which brings a range of new local actors into consideration.
In the context of Syria, with over a million people under siege the role of local municipalities as service providers in extremely challenging circumstances has been brought into focus. In the case of Yemen, breakdown in governance structures has led to a greater interest on the part of external parties of the potential role of tribes in delivering a workable political settlement. These moves have been taken out of necessity where centralized states have been unable to fill in the gap.
Barriers to localisation
Definitions and Context: Contexts of protracted conflict render the operational environment increasingly complex with many new dimensions. Various actors are, out of necessity, placed in a situation in which they must make value judgements on who is a good local and who is a threat to aid delivery or peace.
Capacity: Inadequate local capacity has been long perceived by locals as an excuse invoked by the international community for not implementing genuine localization.
Budget and Accountability: While efficiency may be a secondary consequence  and in some cases genuine localisation may prove more costly - localisation should be primarily about empowerment and effectiveness.
Political Will: A major barrier is insufficient political will both nationally and internationally. At the national level, where localisation involves working with communities, state authorities must cede some control and resources to allow localisation to take root. At the international level, a psychological shift may be needed to accept the reality of locals playing a leading role in conflict response.
Inadequate Vertical Linkages: For instance, the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan in Response to the Syria Crisis (3RP) has been lauded as a paradigm shift in that it has blended humanitarian and development approaches and enabled the emergence of a multi-scalar response that takes into account national approaches integrated into a joined-up regional framework.

United welcome Burnley to Old Trafford on Tuesday but City, who have a huge 13-point lead over their city rivals, wont play again until Wednesday night when they travel to Newcastle.
Last Saturdays 2-2 draw at Leicester was the first of four top-flight games in 10 days for United.

Peak Federer, Peak Djokovic or Peak Nadal: Whos the best
Recently Robin Soderling and Rafael Nadal stoked a debate on who would be the winner in a timeless match between two of the greatest players to ever grace the game, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, if both were at their peak. But we decided to bring in another player in the fray - Nadal himself.
If we go purely by the existing head-to-head, then it would be a very close call with Djokovic edging out the other two and Nadal bagging the second place ahead of Federer. But tennis is more than just head-to-head records, isn't it
Let's do a more in-depth analysis of these players and take each surface separately.
CLAY
Nadal is like a sponge on this surface. Due to the slow speed of dirt, his defensive capabilities are magnified. He is able to slide on the surface very effectively, defusing every missile thrown his way.
It is obvious that the King of Clay will best the other two.
But who would win between Federer and Djokovic Both of them have had relatively equal success on the red surface and have each won one French Open at the peak of their powers.
Djokovic, the prefect specimen of a textbook player, would be able to absorb a lot of pressure with his immense court covering abilities. But at the same time Federer, the artist and the ultimate innovator, would be able to attack Djokovic's forehand with impeccably timed cross court shots.
On clay, the slowest surface, the thing that matters the most is stamina; the ability to chase down every ball and be ready for the next point again. And stamina is something in which Peak Djokovic can trump basically anyone. So that does it for clay. Nadal would take the lead over his opponents and Djokovic would trump Federer, but just barely.
Final Ranking: 1. Nadal 2. Djokovic 3. Federer
GRASS
Grass is generally the fastest of the three surfaces, which benefits aggressive players with good volleying skills. Federer, from 2003-2007, had a serve which was almost unreturnable on fast courts. His service games usually didn't last for more than 1.5-2 minutes.
He also had a volley that he could place where he wanted, and he glided on the court like Muhammad Ali in the boxing ring. In short, it would've been nearly impossible to beat the man at his peak on grass. Now we come to the other two. Nadal showed inspired tennis at Wimbledon from 2006-2010 (apart from 2009, where he pulled out due to injury). He won arguably the greatest tennis match of all time by defeating Federer in 2008, and in 2010 he dismissed Tomas Berdych in teh final.
Djokovic, however, has won it on three occassions - in 2011, 2014 and 2015. If you look at Nadal's best showing at Wimbledon, that is the 2008 win, he heavily relied on his ability to hit glorious passing shots, and also a bit on Federer's unforced errors. Djokovic, on the other hand, is neither too fond of coming to the net nor does he commit too many unforced errors.
So even though the match would be a very interesting one, Djokovic should be able to win it.
Final Rankings: 1. Federer 2. Djokovic 3. Nadal
HARD COURT
Hard courts are faster than clay but slower than grass, and require a fine balance between aggression and defense. This surface has been a thorn in the side of Nadal, who has only won four of his 16 grand Slams on it, whereas Djokovic and Federer have won 8 and 10 respectively.
Nadal's not-so-great attacking abilities occasionally let him down on this surface, with his knees also constantly giving him problems.With that in mind it wouldn't be unfair to say that Federer and Djokovic would both edge Nadal on hard courts, when at their peak.
When it comes to Federer and Djokovic, this surface poses the hardest question. With their styles of play and apparent invincibility on hard courts during the height of their powers, it is almost impossible to separate these two.
Djokovic has better defence but Federer has better offence. They both have an impeccable serve. They both handle pressure really well. After brainstorming for hours, we finally came to a conclusion that this is one match which can only be decided if someone is able to make a time machine and pit 2006-07 Federer against 2015-16 Djokovic.
Final Ranking: 1. Tied Federer-Djokovic 3. Nadal
So there you have it. Each of the Big 3 at his peak would be able to defeat the other two at their peaks given a particular surface. With due apologies to Messrs Soderling and Nadal, it's not entirely fair to say any one of them is the 'best' at his peak. - SK

Significant accomplishments of yesteryears politics
In our age there is no such thing as 'keeping out of politics.' All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. - George Orwell
None of the present class of politicians measure up to these historical greats. The lack of quality in our political top tier is mysterious and apparently outside natural law. -But why cant we have gentleman politicians Why cant we have another Senanayake, Bandaranaike, NM Perera, Keunamen, Kadirgarmar or a TB Jayah The unity regime is incapable of moving forward as a unit. Corruption free governance, political reforms through a new constitution, reconciliation, minority rights are put on hold. Apart from minor gains here and there, the government has not achieved any significant accomplishments, but significant erosion of its popular support base. With increasing public disappointment, political survival of the unity at local government elections is expected to be at severe risk.
Looking nostalgically back almost little over a generation, I reminisce life of three LSSP politicians, in the period from late 1940s up to early 70s. All three of them belonged to either middle-class or lower middle-class; they were men of principles and high integrity, they never betrayed the trust placed by their supporters. Disproving George Orwell, they engaged in politics sans lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. They won elections without spending a cent; did not accumulate wealth and finally retired, back home with no pensions and penniless.
Moratuwas Merrill Fernando
In early 1960s, I was travelling from Panadura to attend an A/L class in Dehiwala. A lean fair neatly dressed gentleman in white shirt and red tie, and a white drill coat hanging on his left arm entered the CTB double-decker bus that I was travelling in. A passenger recognized him and offered a seat, Wadivenna, Merrile Sahodaraya [Comrade Merrile, take a seat]. Merrile Fernando, from the fishing coastal village of Koralawella, was one of the leading rebellious fighters of 1953 Hartal. He won 1960 March and July elections under LSSP defeating business magnate of Moratuwa, Ruskin Fernando of Velona fame. The writer, while returning from work in 1967 met a somewhat familiar person who travelled with him in the same compartment.
I failed to recognize him until he got off at Koralawella Station, to be greeted by two fisher folk women, Merrill apita, Api Merrilta  [we are for Merrill and Merrill is for us]; there was no scarcity for slogans. Merrille, the ideologist broke away along with other revolutionists on principles when the LSSP leadership aligned with Capitalist Sirimavo, in 1964; hence he lost Moratuwa seat to his former colleague Wimalasiri de Mel [LSSP] in 1965.
Henry Peiris of Panadura
MP for Panadura, Henry Peiris, [1947-1952], travelled within his constituency using the only precious vehicle he possessed, a push bicycle during 1947 campaign. As the MP he used to attened Parliament by public transport [South Western Companys Road Bus, as there was no CTB then].
Comrade Henry Pieris MP was the father of veteran media man, the late Janadasa Pieris. At the parliamentary elections held in 1947, he defeated the Deputy Speaker in the State Council, Sir Susantha de Fonseka, who contested on UNP ticket. Sir Susantha came from one of Panaduras affluent property owning families.
He used to tour his constituency [a large area covering part of present Bandaragama and Kesbewa], on horseback, with his chauffer driven limousine following. The tuk tuk.. noise from horse shoes wakes us; and we would rush to the garden as did all children [I was four years then] in the neighbourhood.
There were no party symbols then: Flags and posters were not a violation of law. Quite often, Henry Sahodaraya, accompanied by a few of his supporters would drop in to discuss campaign strategies with party men in the area.
He would park his Limousine, a Humber push bicycle under a shade, and take out some notices or book-lets from the cane basket, discuss ideological as well as general politics with a few people for half an hour or so.
Wishing good bye with one of the famous, now obsolete, party slogans, Nirdhana Pantiyata Jayaweva- Dhanpathi Bhangaweva [Victory to the Proletariat- Down with the Capitalists]. Here the term Capitalists is erroneously translated by the English educated Marxist leaders, as dhanapathi, instead of Dhanawaadin, further distancing the businessmen from the movement. Comrade Henry rode for his next destination.
Lesley Goonewardene, a son of famous General Practitioner in Panadura was a leader of LSSP, and an equally wealthy man as Sir Susantha. He lost to Susantha de Fonseka in 1936, forcing him to abandon his home seat in search of greener pastures in Colombo North, another strong hold of Marxists.
The LSSP in Panadura were left with no options, but consider our Push cycle-Comrade and editor of partys news bulletin, as the best alternative to fill the void created by Lesley. Comrade Henry, contesting under Dr Colvin R de Silvas break-away group named Bolshevik-Leninist Party, not only he had the courage to take up the challenge, but stunned the Electorate by defeating the giant who was backed by all the Panaduras supra class land-owners who lavishly threw their weight behind their man.
Mal Sahodaraya of Colepetty
It was in early 1970s that I came to know the third LSSPer who lived down Muhandiram Lane, Colepetty, among the labour community in one of those shanty Waththes.
He was one time City Father representing Colepetty ward at Colombos Municipality, [it was in 1950s or 60s, I guess].
The Colepetty Ward included the posh Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo 7. D S Mallawaarachchi, Mal Sahodaraya to the downtrodden people who exceeded the Citys elite going by numbers, ran his small office as Secretary to a Private sector minor employees trade Union affiliated to LSSPDuring this time I was attached to Shaw Wallace and Hedges, the European managed multinational, where most of the labor were members of Mals Union.
One day Bandayiya, a manual labourer in our stores, who belonged to another union went to Mal seeking his help to get a letter drafted, [he had no confidence in his union men], the letter was in response to a dispute he had with the management. After listening to his story, Mal typed the letter in duplicate and got our man to sign it spending almost two hours on the job. Bandayiya, who was reluctant to just say thank you, attempted to palm a five rupee note on D S Mallawaaarachchi. [Bandas days wages]
Responding harshly, the scantily dressed staunch Trotskyite who lived in a temporary plank-walled hut, threw the money away screaming,
I say, give that letter here, if you have money, better go and hire a lawyer and get it done. Bandayiya, back at work with the letter was cautioned by his colleagues who knew Mallawarachchi well. One of them later told me, Sir, whenever he appear before Labor Tribunal in a case, and being invited to have lunch with us; his usual response was, No, If you like buy me a toffee, and as we already had the five-cent toffee ready for him, he would walk up to the bus stop adjusting his badly worn out pair of rubber slippers, wishing us,
Sahodaryange Aragalayata Jayaweva [victory to your struggle].
Remembering those politicians often brings a meaningful smile on my lips; and a painful throb in my chest.

SLFP, UPFA candidates to pledge; disciplined, environmentally friendly polls campaign
All candidates contesting the forthcoming Local Government Election under the SLFP and UPFA banner will pledge to conduct a disciplined and an environmentally friendly polls campaign before President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera told journalists in Colombo that all party candidates will gather at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on Friday to make the pledge.
He said the President will advise party candidates to follow election rules and regulations to the letter while abiding by the party guidelines.
He said President Sirisena was very keen to ensure an environment friendly polls campaign.
Amaraweera also said, there will be a meeting of party leaders, whose political parties contest the forthcoming Local Government Election under the UPFA banner at the BMICH tomorrow (28).
At the meeting all the parties will come to a common stance and common platform with a pledge for contesting the next election as a broad alliance and to maintain a peaceful and lawful election campaign, he said.
In line with the concept of the President to create a better political culture for the country, all parties contesting under the UPFA banner have already come to a conclusion to abide by the election rules and regulations whilst working for a better political culture. We had several rounds of preliminary decisions with the other parties, Minister Amaraweera said.
He said UPFA candidates should not be contractors, or seeking various permits such as bus permits and approvals for filling station, liquor licences and sand mining etc.
All these measures are taken to form a clean Local Government institute,Amaraweera stressed.
Minister Amaraweera said the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) is using the same colour of the SLFP for their political gains.
We came to know that the discussions the SLPP had with the certain SLFP politicians, who intended to crossover, had ended with disputes. Then it is certain that no SLFPer will cross over by tomorrow, he said.
The SLPPs nomination lists are filled with corrupt politicians, such as the former Chairman of the Walallavita Pradeshiya Sabha, who was allegedly caught red-handed while obtaining a bribe, Minister Amaraweera said.
Public Enterprise Development State Minister Laksman Yapa Abeywardana said a considerable number of political kingpins will come forward to assist the SLFP and strengthen the hands of President Sirisena during the period starting from tomorrow to January 10. Asked him to reveal the names of the persons, going to crossover, he said the crossover is certain but he is not ready to mention the names at that moment. He said that the 22 political parties are contesting under the UPFA banner. The SLFP will directly contest for 123 Pradeshiya Sabhas under the Hand symbol. Besides, the SLFP under the UPFA banner will contest for 207 Pradeshiya Sabhas under Betel Leaf symbol.
Minister Abeywardana said all political parties are establishing disciplinary codes for their members and candidates as a result of the fruitful measures taken by President Sirisena to implement certain policy guidelines for the UPFA candidates.

Sri Lanka made remarkable progress in ensuring tourists safety: Sagala
With a strengthened Police force and developed infrastructure, Sri Lanka has achieved remarkable progress in ensuring safety of tourists visiting the country, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
The Minister was speaking to the media at Independence Square, Colombo on Tuesday (26) after the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) handed over 20 motorcycles and four Beach Rovers to the Tourist Police Division.
Safety of tourists plays a pivotal role in determining the future of the Tourism Industry. As a result of our efforts to establish rule of law in the country, Sri Lanka has now been identified as a place where the safety of tourists is guaranteed and it is contributing to the growth of the tourism sector. We have to strive for progress continuously and thats why we took measures to strengthen the Tourist Police Division, the Minister said and extended his gratitude to Tourism Minister John Amaratunga and to the SLTDA.
Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said Sri Lanka should allocate more funds to strengthen the tourism sector.
This is a growing industry and this year we have shown remarkable progress. Supporting and strengthening the Tourist Police Division is an important part of our plans. We have purchased the motorcycles and the Beach Rovers using our budgetary allocations for this year. We will channel more funds next year to develop the sector, Amaratunga said.
The motorcycles will be deployed to the Tourism Police posts at Seegiriya, Arugambe, Anuradhapura, Negombo, Polonnaruwa, Moragalla, Pasikuda, Narigama and Kandy. The Beach Rovers will be stationed at Arugambe, Moragalla, Pasikuda and Narigama.

Sydney to Hobart fleet race to break record
Sydney: Supermaxi LDV Comanche led the fancied big boats as the gruelling Sydney to Hobart race began Tuesday, after a close call that saw the yacht almost collide with rival Wild Oats XI.
Another supermaxi, Black Jack, had led the fleet out of Sydney Harbour, with the vessels chasing a new race record amid dream conditions in the annual dash down Australias east coast.
Four 100-footer supermaxis are among the 102 entries in the 73rd edition of the 628-nautical mile (1,163-kilometre) bluewater classic, viewed as one of the toughest yacht races in the world.
The large boats benefited from the light east to south-easterly winds as they sped out of the harbour in the spectacular Boxing Day launch to the event.
Black Jack was followed by Wild Oats and Comanche, with the pair sparking early drama after almost colliding.
The Mark Richards-skippered Wild Oats appeared to tack too close to its rival near the exit to Sydney Heads, leading to a protest from Comanche, helmed by Jim Cooney.
Comanche took over the lead as the vessels tracked down the coast of New South Wales state, ahead of Wild Oats and Black Jack in a close race, with the fourth super-yacht InfoTrack behind them.
Wild Oats tactician Iain Murray told reporters before the start of the race that in all my 24 times of going down here, its never been as good as this.
Its very rare that you get this continually off-the-wind, cross-the-wind, wind start-to-finish sort of scenario. Its something we all dream about, really.
Murray said that because the super-yachts could reach speeds of up to 20 knots, a new line honours record for the fastest vessel could be possible. AFP

Vandals to receive tougher punishment
As per the instructions of Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Archeological Affairs Department has decided to amend the existing Archeological Act to introduce tougher legal punishments to those who commit acts of vandalism.
Accordingly, a person who is found guilty of committing an act of vandalism can be fined Rs. 2 million hereafter at a Court of law. This move is to reduce and discourage treasure hunters who vandalize ancient Buddhist temples and other historic places of worship in the island.
A large number of treasure hunters have been arrested by police authorities during past few years.
They have already caused immeasurable damage to the culture and national heritage of this country. At present, an offender of this nature can be fined only Rs. 50,000 as the maximum penalty or a two-year imprisonment. But after the proposed amendment of the Act, an offender would be imposed both the new fine of Rs. 2 million and the two-year imprisonment.
In the future, a firm of authority with full legal powers to nab vandals and to re-build thus damaged historic places would be set up, said Archeology Director General Professor P. B. Mandawala, while speaking at a meeting of journalists held yesterday, in Kurunegala.

Warner century after no-ball reprieve hands Australia solid start
Melbourne: David Warner posted a century after a no-ball reprieve and skipper Steve Smith was on track for four straight Boxing Day tons as Australia made a solid start to the fourth Ashes Test against England on Tuesday.
Warner received a massive let-off on 99 to claim his 21st Test hundred as an Australia side chasing a series whitewash took full advantage of winning the toss on an unresponsive Melbourne Cricket Ground drop-in pitch.
The aggressive opener, who had been marooned in the 90s for over 40 minutes, was poised on 99 to bring up his century as he faced the last ball of debutant Tom Curran's fifth over.
But instead Warner top-edged a catch to mid-on and walked off to the jubilation of the England team, only for replays to detect a no-ball for Curran overstepping, meaning Warner was called back to the crease. The next delivery Warner added further to the England team's dark mood when he raised his hundred off 130 balls with a flick off his hip and celebrated by leaping into the air and ripping off his helmet to salute the 88,172 Boxing Day crowd at the MCG.
But Warner didn't stay at the crease for much longer after his massive let-off, as he was caught behind off James Anderson for 103.
Smith, who hasn't been dismissed in a Melbourne Test match since Boxing Day 2014, was still batting at the close on 65 with Shaun Marsh not out 31 and Australia 244 for three.
In the last three showpiece Boxing Day Tests, Smith has scored 192 against India, 134 not out against the West Indies and an unbeaten 165 last year against Pakistan.
So far in this series Smith has amassed 491 runs at a stunning average of 163.66 from five innings.
Australia have already reclaimed the Ashes after taking an unassailable three-nil lead in the five-Test series and are seeking a 5-0 whitewash over the beleaguered tourists.
The Australians freewheeled to lunch at 102 without loss with Warner leading the charge but England's bowlers toiled away under a hot sun to restrict the home side in the remaining two sessions.
In the process of raising his century Warner brought up 6,000 runs in his 70th Test, making him the joint fourth-fastest Australian to do so behind Don Bradman, Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden and alongside Greg Chappell.
Stuart Broad got his first wicket since the second Adelaide Test to end a barren run of 414 balls when he had Usman Khawaja snapped up by Jonny Bairstow for 17, and incoming Shaun Marsh survived a leg before wicket review off the next ball.
England also took the wicket of Cameron Bancroft in the middle session leg before wicket for 26 off 95 balls facing Chris Woakes in the 35th over.
Bancroft shared in a 122-run opening stand and was the passive partner as Warner chased runs.
It was the first toss captain Joe Root has failed to win in the series, and was a potentially bad one to lose on a straw-coloured pitch with an unforgiving day ahead in the field for England.
The Australian players were wearing black armbands in memory of Thomas Maggs, wicketkeeper Tim Paine's father-in-law, who passed away on Sunday. AFP
