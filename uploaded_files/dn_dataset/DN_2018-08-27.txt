Lankan aviation sector making rapid progress
Sri Lankan economy and the vehicle population is growing rapidly, said Minister of Minister of Transport And Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala De Silva.
Similar to the motor industry the Sri Lankan aviation sector too is making progress with several new domestic airports to open regionally, he said.
Speaking at the inauguration of the inaugural Lanka Auto 2018 Expo at SLECC the Minister said the Sri Lankan economy despite challenges in 2017 has made major progress. Sri Lankas economy is expected to grow at 4.2% in 2018 and further expand to 4.8% in 2019.
As we transit into a more competitive, inclusive and resilient upper-middle income country, it is imperative that we also undertake initiatives and implement effective strategies that will upgrade the countrys automotive industry into an international hub in the South Asia region.
Furthermore, the rapid rise in Sri Lankas motor vehicle population is a positive indicator as to the direction the industry is heading.
The Minister said that according to reports it has been reported that even with a human population of a little over 21.4 million in 2017, the countrys vehicle population increased by 7% from a year earlier to 7.2 million in 2017.
He said that several international motor components manufacture and other automotive suppliers are participating in the exhibition in large numbers, and that too is an indication that the Sri Lanka auto industry is making rapid progress.
The Minister said that similar to the motor industry the Sri Lankan aviation sector too is making progress with several new domestic airports to open regionally.
Sri Lanka would also have a fully elevated Light Rail Transit (LRT) system in Colombo which is set to revolutionise Sri Lankas transportation system.
Lanka Auto Expo will provide the perfect opportunity for business end users to browse and buy new equipment and products for their business. Not only will they be able to see the widest international range of products for their business, they will also be able to pick up many special offers and discounts at the show, said Darren Siow, Project Director of AMB Tarsus Events Group, the organiser of Lanka Auto.
The event showcased over 150 international brands and companies with products in the auto parts and servicing industry. At the same time, the exhibition allows local importers of automotive parts, accessories and eequipment to build new partnerships with international suppliers looking to bring their products for the first time into the Sri Lankan market.

Total turnover value amounted to LKR 1.93Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 2.22Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.48Bn (+8.84% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.44Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 0.03% W-o-W (or LKR 0.74Bn) to LKR 2,835.60Bn cf. LKR 2,834.86Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 54.97% (or LKR 1.06Bn) of market turnover. Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Melstacorp & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 95.78% of the sectors total turnover. The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 18.67% (or LKR 0.36Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank and HNB which accounted for 64.87% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 13.79% (or LKR 0.27Bn) to the market driven by Ceylon Tobacco, LMF & Cargills which accounted for 90.22% of the sector turnover.

Top gainers and losers

In terms of volume, Renuka Agri & Melstacorp led foreign purchases while Hemas Holdings & Beruwala Resorts led foreign sales. In terms of value, Melstacorp & LMF led foreign purchases while Hemas Holdings & Sampath Bank led foreign sales.
Point of View
Equity markets closed on a flat note this week as revived foreign buying mid-week helped offset the rest of the weeks lackluster performance.
The Benchmark Index closed just 1.6 index points above last weeks close (6052.69 points vs. 6051.1) as markets held above the Indexs new support level of 6000-points. Revived net foreign buying on the back of lower valuations on Thursday helped the benchmark Index rebound from a 17-month low: The ASPI hit a low of 6040.37 on Tuesday for the 1st time since March 30th 2017, but net foreign buying of Rs.114Mn on Thursday and Friday helped push the Index above this low. Renewed foreign interest in stocks such as Melstacorp, LMF & JKH also helped push market turnover on Thursday to a 2-week high of Rs. 1.06Bn and helped maintain average daily turnover levels for the week in line with that of last week (ie: Rs.0.48Bn cf. Rs. 0.44Bn last week).
The recovery in foreign buying during the latter half of the week also helped convert the overall net foreign position on the Colombo bourse to a net buying position for the 1st time in 3-weeks; net foreign purchases of domestic stocks totaled Rs. 55Mn cf. net sales of Rs. 679Mn last week and compared to the last recorded net buying position of Rs. 23Mn during the last week of July. Despite the mild recovery in foreign appetite for domestic stocks during the week, local HNI and Institutional and retail investors remained staunchly on the sidelines this week as weaker June18 corporate results clouded sentiment.
Crossings over the week amounted to a paltry 24% of market turnover (cf. 40% last week and YTD average of 40%) with the majority (~94%) of total crossings concentrated on Diversified counters such as JKH (43%), Melstacorp (44%) and Hemas (7%). Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain similar muted sentiment.
Jun18 corporate earnings declines 10% Y-o-Y
June quarter earnings for listed corporates indicated a slowdown relative to last June, as earnings of the approx. 90% of corporates who have reported earnings totaled LKR 48.7Bn cf. the LKR 54.4Bn reported by the total market in Jun17. The 10% decline in Y-o-Y earnings over the Jun18 period stands in contrast to the 6% Y-o-Y gain in market earnings recorded over the comparable period last year (ie: Jun17).
The decline in earnings was led by the Diversified sector (which remains a broad proxy for the overall economy and typically accounts for ~18-20% of total market earnings) which fell 49% Y-o-Y compared to a growth of 34% recorded in the comparable quarter in 2017.
The majority of listed Diversifieds recorded Y-o-Y losses in their June quarter earnings with notable blue-chips such as JKH recording a 23% Y-o-Y decline in earnings while Aitken Spence fell by 41% and Hemas fell by 20%. The Y-o-Y decline in overall market earnings was also partly attributable to a slow-down in the Manufacturing sector (-42% Y-o-Y) which typically accounts for ~8% of market earnings, Hotels sector (-74% Y-o-Y) which accounts for ~4% of total market earnings and the Construction sector (-372% Y-o-Y) which accounts for ~2% of total market.
Meanwhile, sectors such as Banks, Finance & Insurance (~35-40% of market earnings) recorded a 11% Y-o-Y growth in earnings over the quarter (cf. 15% Y-o-Y growth in Jun17) while the Food, Beverage & Tobacco sector (which accounts for ~11% of market earnings) recorded a 26% growth in earnings compared to a 1% Y-o-Y loss recorded in the comparable quarter in Jun17. Despite the decline in quarterly earnings, the market PER for by the end of June18 quarter fell to ~10x (from ~11x by the end of Q118 and ~12x at the end of Jun17) amid the 4.4% loss on the market Indexs value.

CEB earns over Rs. 110 mn from power pirates
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has earned over Rs.110 million during the past year (2017) by carrying out raids on power pirates, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy said.
The Ministry said, more than 2000 cases of persons obtaining electricity illegally were reported during last year.
Legal action had been filed against those arrested for power piracy and as result the CEB had earned Rs.110.8 million by way of fines imposed on those found guilty by courts.
According to a Ministry Spokesman, most suspects were nabbed for altering electricity meters and tapping into power lines.
There were some prominent businessmen among those accused of power piracy he added.
According to Ministry sources, the CEB incurs heavy financial losses due to these illegal methods of obtaining electricity by altering the meters and using hooks.
The CEB has set up a special telephone Hotline 0112422259 to receive information from the public with regards to illegal power tapping and urges the people to report any incident or information without delay.

CEB to sell LED bulbs
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will buy 10 million LED bulbs and sell them at a subsidised price to people for them to save electricity.
Power and renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said this at a religious event held under the Presidential Sadaham Yatra programme at the Bokkawala, Morankanda Sri Gnanaloka Bauddha Madyasthanaya on August 25.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that saving electricity is as important as generating it. Today over two million electricity consumers use ordinary electric bulbs burning more energy at their homes and other establishments.
The CEB will encourage them to use LED bulbs that burns less energy.
The Minister said that every temple where the Presidential Sadaham Yatra Programme is held will be made a partner of the Ministrys Solar Energy War. Today over 150 megawatts of electricity is produced through rooftop solar panels, he said.
A person could save over 60 per cent of electricity by using LED bulbs. The CEB will sell LED bulbs to consumers through the meter readers, he said.
If consumers use all these 10 million LED bulbs, we can save 304 megawatts of electricity, the Minister said.

CEYLON PETROLEUM CORPORATION MARKS ONE YEAR OF SAVINGS, FELICITATES LONGSTANDING EMPLOYEES
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) felicitated 73 of its employees who completed 25 years of service, in the presence of President, Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a ceremony which also marked a year since the new management of CPC took administrative control of the entity.
CPC has made significant headway in the past one year in terms of reforming the institution to curtail losses and fortify Sri Lankas energy sector. Under the new directive of Minister of Petroleum Resources Development, Arjuna Ranatunga, Dammika Ranatunga, Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and the Management of CPC, the institution has been successful in achieving record savings throughout its operation, despite several external factors.
When the new management took over operations at CPC in May 2017, the budgeted loss for the year was estimated at Rs. 14.5 billion, but through a series of strategic initiatives and aggressive measures, CPC recorded a profit of Rs. 1.57 billion, resulting in a saving of Rs. 16.07 billion in just seven months.
This turnaround came despite a challenging external environment due to the depreciating value of the rupee, rising global fuel prices and sudden changes to Dollar Loan interest rates.
In the past year, the management of CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) have drastically changed several internal processes and revamped nation-wide infrastructure to increase savings and productivity, strengthen national energy security, improve quality and support national industries.
A zero-based budgeting process was introduced to promote more fiscal discipline, reducing expenditure and being stricter on the negotiation of interest rates on loans, enabling better management of debt. Within this period, CPC was able to record Rs. 11 billion in interest earnings due to improved treasury controls leading to better working capital management when dealing with banks. This was a 30% increase from the previous years Rs. 8.3 billion in interest earnings.
In addition, CPC for the first time in 50 years, comprehensively re-evaluated assets spread throughout the country in an inventory control digitisation initiative, which led to CPCs balance sheet gaining Rs. 10.2 billion from the inclusion of the value of its assets valued during the programme. This enabled CPC to gain more preferential rates when acquiring loans for operations.
It has been a year of transformation. We have taken many steps to ensure a secure, high quality national fuel supply while managing many challenges both externally and internally. Our priority is always to work in the best interest of the people, even over profits sometimes. Everyone at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, CPC and CPSTL have worked incredibly hard to revamp essential infrastructure, introduce new products, bolster support to vital industries and better manage financials so the gains can be passed down to the public. We have recorded significant savings in just one year and we will continue to pursue further progress, which will contribute to the nations journey forward, said Arjuna Ranatunga, Minister of Petroleum Resources Development, speaking at a recent press briefing.
Dammika Ranatunga, Chairman, Ceylon Petroleum Corporate, said, Under the directive of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development together with the Management of CPC, the Management of CPSTL and everyone working in these institutions, we have overcome a variety of odds during this first year.We have had to take several stringent measures to curtail losses and increase savings without passing that burden onto the public. In addition, we had to completely re-evaluate many internal processes which were stifling the progress of CPC and threatening the national fuel supply. Our key areas of focus were increasing savings and productivity, improving the quality of fuel we provide and strengthening energy security while increasingly supporting SMES and vital industries.We have thus far been successful due to a number of key projects and initiatives that we have launched and in some cases, completed, within this short time frame of just one year. This is just the beginning. There are several projects that are in progress and in the pipeline that will benefit the country, and we are steadfast in our effort to reform CPC and transform the nations energy sector.

Colombo Defence Seminar begins on August 30
Colombo Defence Seminar - 2018, the eighth in the global defence conference sequence, themed on Security in an Era of Global Disruptions, will be held on August 30-31 at the BMICH.
Worldwide defence partners, strategists, policy-makers, security experts and analysts, capable of collectively evaluating fast-changing global concerns and exploring ways and means of challenging such issues have already confirmed their presence at the invitation of the Army.
Colombo Defence Seminar - 2018 expects to draw 800 foreign and local participants, including 13 foreign and 14 local speakers. Adding a new dimension to the sessions, many intellectuals, politicians, opinion makers and retired veterans of the field would share their views in separate panel discussions on the second day of the parley.
This years seminar sessions would include the topics Demographic Transformation and Implications on Security, Technological Disruptions, Human-Induced Climate Change and Political Extremism with focus on Human Factors and Homeland Security, Global Challenge of Internal Displacement, Urban Security in the 21st Century, Cyber Conflicts and Future Power, Social Media and Authenticity: Global Security Challenges, Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Weapons, Role of the Military in Response and Mitigating Strategies (Regional Perspective), Role of the Military in Response and Mitigating Strategies (Global Perspective), Climate Geo-Engineering: Challenges and Opportunities, Role Played by Violent Non-State Actors, Ideological Polarisation, Destabilising the International System, Diaspora Communities Amidst Conflict, Technological Creativity: Challenges to Armed Forces, Climate Change: Future of Warfare and Leadership in Mitigating Violent Extremism.
The conference will be organised under the close supervision of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake with the cooperation of the Directorate of Army Training and all the other Directorates.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will deliver the keynote address after the opening address by Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, during the inaugural ceremony. The invitees and contributors to the seminar include high commissioners, chiefs of defence staff, commanders, security advisers, the Foreign Secretary, senior lecturers, directors, senior researchers, senior Tri-service officers, political advisers, under secretaries, administrators, telecom experts, analysts on terrorism and scholars representing more than 40 countries.
This years topic, Security in an Era of Global Disruptions underlines the importance of current security issues that appear to be increasingly interconnected, in the wake of a multitude of threats against the security of nation states.
The Army laid the foundation for its flagship project in 2011. This dialogue is also held this year with the aim of formulating a collective and assertive approach while harnessing diverse opinions, intellects, skills and technical knowhow of global defence partners and also sharing the wide battlefield experiences of the Sri Lanka Army.
Colombo Defence Seminar, which has by now carved a niche for itself in the international arena, is meant to promote global partnership through discussions with focus on expansion of disruptive forces, such as political and violent extremism, human displacement, human-induced climate changes, and the misuse of technology, which in turn have jeopardised the safety and security of citizens.
Emerging security threats and challenges against political and socioeconomic spheres, most of which are non-traditional, warrant collective efforts beyond the national boundaries of any single state.
The Colombo Defence Seminar - 2018 would therefore provide an ideal platform for intellectual brainstorming amid a wide spectrum of equal interests in order to seek collective mechanisms to counter such disruptions for sustaining the peace-building process.
In 2017, over 800 delegates including 77 foreign experts from 35 countries participated in the discussions that stimulated critical thinking on Countering Violent Extremism: Global Trends.
By third week of August, representatives from Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, Chile, Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy, Kenya, Korea, the Maldives, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Nepal, Philippines, Rwanda, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, UK, Ukraine, USA, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe have confirmed their participation.

Huawei nova 3 Series leads smartphone colour trend in SL
Huawei nova 3 series is the newly discovered bright star in the smartphone industry. Having entered the market in early August 2018, the Nova 3 series received record-breaking demand from the Sri Lankan youth due to its revolutionary AI features and trendy design. The product appeals to all youth ranging from the tech community, the fashion circle and also those in show biz.
HUAWEI nova devices have always been gorgeous. Previously, devices in this series earned a warm welcome among the youth with their attractive design. Not willing to be outdone by those that came before it, HUAWEI nova 3 Series comes with a range of trendy hues. The Nova3 is available in Iris Purple, Red & Black while the Nova3i is available in Iris Purple, Pearl White &Black leaving consumers spoilt for choice.
As the first gradient colour offered on HUAWEI nova devices, Iris Purple deserves a proper introduction. Gradient colours are some of the hottest device colour schemes on the market. Huawei has always had great insights into colours and how they affect design.
The HUAWEI P20 Pro graced the Sri Lankan market with the breathtaking Twilight colour, bringing the popularity of the gradient colour to new heights. As a device designed for the young, the HUAWEI nova 3 Series sticks closely to the trends, and launched the highly evocative Iris PurpleHuaweis take on the popular violet purple hue.
News of HUAWEI nova 3 carrying the gradient colour actually leaked prior to its official launch, so consumers had expected it to come, but that did little to dampen its impact and influence that it made at its unveiling. Huawei improved upon its 2.5D curve design to create the new and improved 3D curved glass finish, where the gradient colour shines through with fascinating vibrancy. Humans are naturally allured by colours  and with the gradient color, there are just more colours to love.
Looking back at the history of smartphones, manufacturers have always been keen to bolster their product portfolio with differently coloured devices. And that has worked in the favor of consumers, giving them additional choice. The HUAWEI nova 3 Series, a line-up renowned for its design, is at the forefront of this colour trend. The Iris Purple gradient colour available on both the nova 3 and nova 3i evoke feelings of mystery, excitement and adventure. Such a unique experience is only available through the trendy HUAWEI nova 3 series.
Compared to other devices in the same price range, this series has seen a lot more attention to detail in its design and colour, and the same fact drives the Huawei nova 3 series to lead in the colour and design trends. In the present day the mobile device is considered a fashion expression and addressing this demand is a huge challenge among the handset makers. However the Huawei nova 3 series has accepted the challenge and addressed the demand through the vivid, shifting colours of the Iris Purple.
The Huawei nova3 and nova3i comes with a one year warranty and will be available for consumers at all Huawei Experience Centers with Sri Lankas leading Smartphone marketer, Singer Sri Lanka PLC ensuring the availability of the nova3 series devices island wide. Selected Dialog and Mobitel outlets would also market the new devices with the Huawei nova3 priced at 79,900 and Huawei nova3i priced at 49,900.

JOHN McCAIN, A TITAN OF AMERICAN POLITICS AND PATRIOT DEAD
US: John McCain, a war hero and towering figure in American politics, known for reaching across the aisle in an increasingly divided nation, died Saturday following a battle with brain cancer. He was 81.
The senators passing marked the end of a storied, 35-year political career that brought the independent-minded Republican within reach of the White House as his partys presidential nominee.
Its been quite a ride, McCain, who was tortured during five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, wrote in a memoir published earlier this year.
Ive known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought in a war and helped make peace. I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times. McCain, who had been receiving treatment in his home state of Arizona, was surrounded by his wife Cindy and his family during his final hours.
He was a great fire who burned bright, and we lived in his light and warmth, said Meghan McCain, one of the late senators seven children -- three of them from a previous marriage.
Near the driveway to his ranch in a rural part of Sedona, Arizona, a sign read Sen McCain, thank you for your service. A police escort accompanied the hearse that carried his body, as a fiery sunset cast its last light over the rustic countryside McCain loved dearly, and local residents came bearing flowers for the late political titan.
A steady stream of friends and colleagues had come to bid him farewell at his Arizona ranch in the months since his cancer diagnosis, in July 2017.
US President Donald Trump, who once mocked McCains war record, said he sent his deepest sympathies and respect. McCain had been a rare and outspoken Republican critic of Trump, accusing him of naivete, egotism and of sympathizing with autocrats. He made a decisive vote last year that killed Republican attempts to repeal Barack Obamas health care reforms, and Trump never forgave him.
The sharp-tongued McCain had disagreements with many fellow politicians -- including inside his own camp -- but the Republican stalwart was widely recognized for his deep integrity, and condolences came swift from the highest reaches of American politics.
We are all in his debt, said former President Obama, the Democrat to whom McCain lost the Presidency in 2008.
We shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher -- the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed. Democrat Bill Clinton hailed McCain for having frequently put partisanship aside, while his former Vice President Al Gore said he always admired how the senator would work to find common ground, no matter how hard.
John McCain was a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order, said former President George W. Bush, whom McCain sought and failed to defeat in 2000 and succeed in 2008.
On Capitol Hill, McCain became close friends with Senator Lindsey Graham and former senator Joe Lieberman -- a trio dubbed the Three Amigos. Now that the trio is missing its driving force, Graham wrote that America and Freedom have lost one of her greatest champions... And Ive lost one of my dearest friends and mentor. Hailing him as a truth-teller with unsurpassed dedication to the US and its military, the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said he would seek to rename a Senate building in his honor.
McCain stopped receiving cancer treatment earlier this week, his family saying the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. He had spent more than three decades in the Senate, looming large in debates over war and peace and the moral direction of the nation. Before joining the upper chamber, he served as a US representative from 1983 to 1987.
McCain had been away from the Senate floor since last December, remaining at his Arizona home for treatment of glioblastoma -- the same form of brain cancer that took the life of another Senate giant, Democrat Ted Kennedy, in 2009. - AFP

LAUGFS launches rooftop solar project
LAUGFS Power launched an ambitious project to install solar PV systems on the rooftops of all possible premises of LAUGFS businesses.
As the first phase of this initiative, 324 kW and 47.5 kW grid-tied rooftop solar PV systems were installed with an investment of Rs. 49 million at the LAUGFS Rubber factory in Horana and LAUGFS Holdings Head Office in Colombo respectively.
Launched in line with the Soorya Bala Sangramaya program by the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, the grid-tied rooftop solar PV system at the LAUGFS Rubber factory is expected to generate 490 MWh of clean energy and offset 350 MTs of CO2 emissions to the environment every year. The rooftop solar PV system at LAUGFS Head Office in Colombo is scheduled to generate 68 MWh of solar power, while offsetting 48 MTs of CO2 emissions per annum.
Adhering to international standards and taking advantage of the latest technologies, solar panels sourced from globally reputed US and Korean manufacturers have been used for the installations by LAUGFS Power.
As a renewable energy solutions provider, LAUGFS Power has invested in both mini-hydro and solar power generation over the years. This newest project to convert all possible rooftops of LAUGFS businesses to help generate solar power, will enable us to significantly reduce our dependency on the national grid, while enabling us to continue to minimise our environmental impact, said LAUGFS Power General Manager, Mahinda Senarath.
As per the Central Bank Report 2017, around 69.2% of the electricity demand in the country is at present met through fossil fuel based power generation. With the continuously increasing energy demand in the country, LAUGFS Power has further strengthened its investments in renewable energy solutions, primarily focusing on solar and mini hydro. It currently operates the countrys largest solar power project in Hambantota.
With increasing economic activity, demand on energy will continue to grow and at LAUGFS Power, our focus is on supporting this rising energy requirement with sustainable energy solutions. That is why as a group, we have invested in our own businesses with this project to generate renewable energy through solar power, enabling us to reduce our dependency on non-renewable energy sources for our energy requirements. This means we will be able to significantly reduce our carbon footprint, while delivering cost advantages in the long-term for our businesses, he further said.
With this project initiated by LAUGFS Power, our LAUGFS businesses will become electricity producers and support the governments ambitious plans to increase the stake of non-conventional renewable energy in power generation in the country.
LAUGFS is one of the largest diversified business conglomerates and a trusted name in Sri Lanka. Founded in 1995, LAUGFS today has expanded across 20 industries in Sri Lanka and overseas, establishing a strong presence as a leader and pioneer in the power and energy, retail, industrial, services, leisure and logistics sectors. With over 4,000 employees and an annual turnover exceeding Rs.37 billion, LAUGFS continues to expand and empower millions as a trusted Sri Lankan brand.

The Agriculture Ministry will provide farmers with Rs. 18,000 per hectare to buy organic fertiliser for the upcoming Maha season to encourage them in organic farming,
Minister Amaraweera was participating in an event yesterday (26) to reap the harvest of a three-acre organic paddy cultivation at Yakagala, Angunakolapelessa.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said his Ministry has already drafted the Cabinet Memorandum in this regard.
Paddy cultivating farmers using chemical fertilisers are given a Rs. 500 subsidy for urea fertiliser and Rs. 1,500 for other cultivation. No government has given any subsidy for the farmers in the organic farming so far, the Minister said.
Scientists of the Agriculture Department tested soil and proved that there are enough Phosphorus and Potassium in the soil in many areas of the country. Applying too much of chemical fertiliser to the cultivations is useless, the Minister said. He commended Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and others for promoting organic fertiliser usage.

PC ELECTIONS IN JANUARY
Provincial Council elections could be held as early as the first week of January provided the revised Delimitation Committee report is gazetted by President Maithripala Sirisena within the next two months, Elections Commission (EC)Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Since the Report of the Delimitation Committee for the Delimitation of electorates in Provincial Councils was not approved by Parliament last Friday, Deshapriya explained that the Speaker has to appoint a five member Committee presided by the Prime Minister to revise the delimitation committee report and added that the Committee had powers only to revise the report and cannot make any other amendments.
Meanwhile, the Speaker with the consent of party leaders will nominate the five-member Committee in the next few days., Speakers Media Spokesman said.
In addition to the Prime Minister, the other members to be appointed to the Committee will be intellectuals who are non-politicians knowledgeable in the field.
Sources close to Jayasuriya said the Speaker has already recommended four members to the committee and his office was now in the process of seeking their individual consent.
Deshapriya, meanwhile said the Northern Provincial Council would be dissolved on October 25. If the amendments are made and the revised document is gazetted within two months, the Election Commission could call for nominations by end of October.
He further said that if the government is willing to conduct the elections under the old system, the amendments and the Delimitation Report are not necessary.
In the meantime, Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said the Ministry has nothing to do with the formulation of the report.
The decision is now with the Committee that will be appointed by the Speaker of Parliament under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. They will make the final decision, he said.
The Speaker media unit on Friday said since the Report of the Delimitation Committee for the Delimitation of electorates in PCs was not approved by Parliamentthe Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya has taken Constitutional action according to the Section 4 (12) of the Bill. The issue according to the Speakers Media Unit was discussed at length at the Committee on Parliamentary Affairs and the Speakers view was that the Provincial Council elections should not be postponed..
The Speaker had also exchanged views with the Elections Commission Chairman and the Delimitation Committee for an early election. The relevant parties have agreed to provide full support to hold the provincial elections in January 2018 if the committee appointed by the Speaker and headed by the Prime Minister can provide relevant recommendations by middle of October, Speakers Media Unit sources added.

SS back in the news
If anything, former Chief Justice Sarath Nanda de Silva is a news maker. From the days he was the country's topmost judicial officer, and, even before, Silva made waves, especially where some of his judgements were concerned. He also courted controversy as regards his conduct while holding high judicial office. No other member of the country's highest court in Sri Lanka's post Independence history had been the subject of so much journalistic comment as the otherwise debonair and flamboyant former Chief Justice.
The Ex-CJ is in the news again. According to the main story of a Weekend English publication yesterday, Sarath Silva had acted against the constitution when he presented himself as legal counsel to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the CID questioned the latter at his Official residence in connection with the abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr. Not only that, Silva had taken an active part in the whole affair and even went to the extent of intimidating the investigators, conduct reminiscent of the times he donned the mantle of Chief Justice when counsel pleading their cases were hectored into submission.
It is this self same Sarath Nanda Silva, it was, who begged forbearance from the nation for letting off Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the Helping Hambantota matter. On that occasion Silva, in his unabashed mea culpa, openly pleaded for the countrymen to forgive him for paving the way for a man who should have been behind bars to contest a Presidential Election, instead. It appears that Sarath Silva has gone to the other extreme. Today he was legally representing the very individual he once said should have been thrown behind bars for fleecing Tsunami funds.
Handpicked by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga to head the Supreme Court, by-passing many senior judges, Silva went onto reign with the proverbial iron-fist and brooked no opposition from any quarter.
His was perhaps the most eventful, if not controversial tenure, as Chief Justice in this country that saw a onetime powerful Cabinet Minister thrown behind bars for Contempt of Court and the premature termination of the tenure of a President who was responsible for his appointment. For good measure he also gave judgement against CBK and made her pay compensation to the state in a case where the former President was found guilty of alienating state land for a golf course, for the benefit of a crony.
Controversy did not cease to dog Sarath Silva when he ruled in favour of his chum Mahinda Rajapaksa in the infamous Helping Hambantota case, clearing the path for him to contest the Presidential Election, a ruling which he (Silva) was to bitterly regret later, or so he told the people.
Out of office, Sarath Silva continued to make waves, first by aligning himself with General Sarath Fonseka in the latter's Presidential bid, being an active member of the movement to overthrow the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime which he described as corrupt to the core. It is in this attempt to oust Rajapaksa that Silva made the now famous mea culpa. That this protestation to the public was mere hogwash was proved before long when Sarath Silva did a complete U turn to mount the Bring Back Mahinda platform, addressing rallies in the company of the likes of Wimal Weerawansa, Rohitha Abeygunawardena and Mahindananda Aluthgamage, all over the country.
A lull ensued, where Sarath Silva was concerned, following the defeat of Rajapaksa at the General Election, that is until he was seen at a function to declare open MR's new political office at Battaramulla where he again plunged headlong into controversy. Speaking at the function, this onetime country's Chief Justice taking pot shots at the Prime Minister, flailing the government and FCID and grieving at the plight of Yoshitha Rajapaksa (who was then in remand) went onto attack a private TV station for allegedly setting up business with the aid of LTTE money koti salli. This, obviously, was a means of deflecting from how Yoshitha raised Rs.240 million to establish the CSN TV channel.
As the country's one time Chief Juistice, Sarath Silva should have known better than to hurl such an accusation without producing even an iota of evidence. This was unworthy of any retired judicial officer, let alone an Ex-CJ.
According to the constitution, as we now learn, retired judges of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal are barred from practicing law and appearing for clients. Another proviso should be made in the constitution to prohibit Supreme Court Judges from engaging in politics. The authorities should think of ways to preserve the dignity and honour of the judiciary at all times. Permitting retired judges to mount political platforms and let loose billingsgate stuff was unthinkable in the past.
There was much criticism when Mahinda Rajapaksa re-employed Supreme Court judges as Presidential Advisors and posted as Ambassadors. It was rightly or wrongly thought that such expectations could influence the judgements they deliver. Much worse was to follow, when, for the first time in this country, a retired Chief Justice was seen on the political stage in the company of the riff raff. Isn't this an act of contempt (of court)

This will be done through an Act of Parliament, after which necessary funds would be allocated in the annual budget for its upkeep, State National Policy and Economic Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
He was addressing a meeting at the Hali Ela Foreign Employment Service Centre of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, to mark the extension of the Suwasariya ambulance service to the Uva Province, on August 24.
Under this service, 26 ambulances have been allocated to the Uva Province where they would be stationed at selected police stations in the province. The ambulances were officially handed over to the OICs of Police stations and the ambulance staff, at this ceremony.
State Minister Dr. de Silva said 143 ambulances equipped with the most modern medical equipment and manned by trained staff have been deployed for the Suwasariya ambulance service so far.
A total of 91,547 patients have been serviced by the ambulance service up to August 20.
The government hopes to increase the ambulance fleet to 300 in order to serve all parts of the country. The main objective was to enable the entire population of 21 million to summon an ambulance within minutes in an emergency, so that lives could be saved, he said.

Veteran U.S. Senator and former Presidential candidate John McCain dead
John McCain - the celebrated war hero who became a six-term Republican Senator and Presidential nominee has died at the age of 81.
The Arizona representative, one of the most influential US politicians of his generation, died following a battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer.
McCain became known as a political maverick willing to stick to his conservative ideals rather than follow party leaders, gaining a reputation for reaching across the political aisle and trying to work with Democrats.
Barack Obama, who triumphed over McCain in the Presidential 2008 election was among those to lead the tributes. He said McCain and he shared a fidelity to something higher - the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched, and sacrificed.
Before beginning a 35-year career in Congress, he served as a pilot in the US Navy, enduring a six-year spell in a Prisoner Of War camp after he was shot down during the Vietnam War.
In the final months of his life, the ailing Senator proved a thorn in the side of Donald Trump, with whom he had clashed in the past, ending the Presidents attempt to scrap Obamacare. In one of his final significant acts as a Senator, McCain voted in 2017 against a new Healthcare Bill dooming it with a dramatic thumbs-down on the Senate floor.
Following his father and grandfather, who both became four-star Admirals, into the forces, he enrolled in the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.
He served as a pilot based on various aircraft carriers during in the Vietnam War, before he was captured after being shot down on a bombing mission over Hanoi in October 1967.
Over the following six years,McCain was held as a Prisoner-Of-War, often being tortured and sustaining injuries that left him with life-long physical disabilities.
He was released in 1973 after refusing an early repatriation offer from his captors when they discovered his father was a high-ranking Naval officer. McCain entered politics in the early 1980s after leaving the Navy and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1983. - BBC

Vocational Training Authority to empower youth in English
New English language instructors should empower rural youth to face job interviews at modern industrial and business establishments, without hesitation, on an equal footing with foreign educated youth.
Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama was addressing a batch of English language instructors recruited recently by the Vocational Training Authority (VTA).
The Minister said that due to long standing shortcomings in the countrys education system the youth and especially rural youth face severe employment problems. He said that the traditional education is no longer sufficient to obtain employment at todays workplaces and youth need to be equipped with technical and vocational knowledge and skills, required by the present world of work.
The Minister said that it is the responsibility of his ministry to ensure that such vocational and technical training is provided at an internationally accepted level by all relevant institutions in the country both within his ministry and outside.
He said his ministry has therefore launched a special initiative to give the trainees in the institutions under his ministry a good knowledge of English and adequate skills in its communication.
Dr Amunugama asked the new language instructors to treat their new assignment not merely as a job but as a national duty of empowering the hitherto disadvantaged youth of the country.
