Coach Selvaraja to foster grass root level basketball
Basketball is becoming a rapidly popularizing sport in Sri Lanka and a well known coach, Sivashakthi Selvaraja, better known as 'Selva' has initiated a grass root level basketball development programme which he hopes to conduct in all parts of the country with the support of world basketball governing body, Fdration Internationale de Basket-ball (FIBA) and the National Olympic Committee in Switzerland.
Commenting about the programme Selvaraja said, "I was nominated by the Sri Lanka Basketball Federation and the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka to follow a three-months course in America. It has been a great opportunity for me to participate in this valuable programme where 35 of us, representing different nations of the world were trained under top international trainers. The programme was conducted at the Delaware University with the assistance of US National Olympic Committee. To complete our course each of us must conduct a project in our countries and must submit it to them".

"I have named my project as 'Long term grass root level basketball development in Sri Lanka' and focused on three basic skills of the game, dribbling, passing and shooting. I have selected 80 students from top level basketball schools, progressing schools and non basketball playing schools. I conducted training on these three main skills for six days at the St. Joseph's Girls School in Nugegoda. The progress was very impressive. The students were in different levels and in some cases the gap is very wide in between them.

I started training from the fundamental level and within a short time period all the students showed a great progress to a very satisfactory level. I will conduct a skill challenge to evaluate them on April 2 at the Police Park courts, commencing from 5.00pm. It will be a workout on dribbling, passing and shooting where individuals evaluated with time". Selvaraja explained.
As my project seems very progressive, I hope to seek support from FIBA and NOC in Switzerland to carry out this programme as an ongoing course through out Sri Lanka which will be a very successful way to bring the sport to outstations.
Selvaraja has an illustrious career as a player and a coach who studied at St. Joseph's College, Nugegoda and Aletheia International, Dehiwala. He played basketball from under-13 to 19 and has captained the school teams. He started his coaching career as the coach of St. Joseph's Girls School, Nugegoda and presently coaching St. Peter's College and Wesley College. Selvaraja was the National Youth coach in 2010, 11 and 12. He is also an academic with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Technology degree from the American College.

Govt should take discovery of weapons seriously - Weerawansa

National Freedom Front Leader Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said the government should take seriously the discovery of explosives and weapons from several locations in the North, including the detection of a suicide jacket in Chavakachcheri, instead of hurriedly labeling them as outdated ones hidden during the war.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, Weerawansa stressed that there was a threat to national security and the government should make swift moves to bring the situation under control.
Weerawansa hit out at Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi noting that the comments made by the latter indicates he has taken the findings lightly, which could be a grave mistake.
He said that it was the government's responsibility to conduct a full-scale probe without dismissing the findings as outdated weapons and explosives hidden during the war.
Weerawansa also said that some findings of weapons and explosive have gone unreported.

Windies stun India to reach World T20 final
Bombay, Thursday: India's dreams of a World Twenty20 title on home soil were shattered on Thursday after the West Indies stunned the hosts by seven wickets to reach the final.
Lendl Simmons fired an explosive 82 off 51 balls as the Windies broke Indian hearts in the semi-final clash at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium with just two balls to spare and will now face England in Sunday's final in Kolkata.
The West Indies went into the last over needing eight to win and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni handed the ball to talisman Virat Kohli, who earlier scored an unbeaten 89.

Simmons grabbed a single off the first ball before Andre Russell smashed a four and six as the Windies ended on 196 for three after India made 192 for two.
Simmons hit seven fours and five sixes while opener Johnson Charles notched 52, including seven fours and two sixes.
It was not meant to be that way for India after Chris Gayle's wicket was taken early for just five runs but the hosts were left to rue a no-ball at a crucial stage.
Hardik Pandya thought he had taken Simmons in the 15th over when he was caught by Ravichandran Ashwin but the umpire ruled that it was a no ball and the Windies star made the most of his luck as he stepped on the accelerator. Simmons, who was a late replacement for the injured Andre Fletcher, was given valuable support by Russell who hit an unbeaten 43 off 20 balls, including four sixes as the West Indies made a dash for the finishing line.
Ashwin endured some brutal punishment at the hands of the West Indies batsmen, going for 20 runs in his two overs.
His fellow spinner Ravindra Jadeja was also hit around the ground, conceding 48 runs in his wicketless four-over spell.
The Indian bowlers at times had trouble getting any grip in the heavy dew at the Wankhede.
Kohli had earlier hit 11 fours and one six in his 47-ball knock as India set a target of 193, regarded as a below par score on a pitch which has seen a feast of runs during the tournament.
Kohli injected much-needed life into the hosts' innings after a slow start from openers Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane.
Sharma hit three fours and three sixes in his 31-ball 43 while Rahane took 35 deliveries to reach 40, scoring only two fours and no sixes.
Kohli, who entered the fray in the eighth over after Sharma was bowled lbw by Samuel Badree, upped the tempo, to the delight of a packed crowd at the 33,000-seater stadium.
The defeat could spell the end of Dhoni's reign as India's captain in short form cricket although there was no immediate announcement from the 34-year-old about his future.
The West Indies will take on England at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday after Eoin Morgan's side defeated New Zealand, also by seven wickets, on Wednesday. AFP
