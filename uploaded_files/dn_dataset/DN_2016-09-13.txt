Wawrinka stuns Djokovic to clinch US Open
New york Sunday: Stan Wawrinka became the oldest US Open mens champion in 46 years when he defeated world number one Novak Djokovic to claim a third Grand Slam title on Sunday.
Wawrinka, the 31-year-old third seed, triumphed 6-7 (1/7), 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 after almost four hours of high intensity tennis.
He even held his nerve when the final threatened to erupt into controversy after Djokovic twice called medical timeouts in the fourth set.
Wawrinka is the oldest winner of the mens tournament since 35-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1970 and the first over 30 to take the title since Pete Sampras in 2002.
It was the Swiss players first New York title, following his breakthrough 2014 Australian Open triumph and 2015 Roland Garros crown.
On both those occasions, Djokovic had been the fall-guy, losing in Melbourne in the quarter-finals and ending as runner-up in Paris.
Novak, youre a great champion and a great person and because of you Im where I am today. Id like to congratulate you on everything you have done, said Wawrinka who has now won his last 11 finals.
This is amazing. I came here without the goal of winning it but just to step on the court trying to win.
My goal is to give everything I have to be the best I can.
Djokovic, the 2011 and 2015 champion, had been seeking a third Slam of the year and 13th major of his career.
- Medical timeout -
But the 29-year-old Serb finished runner-up in New York for the fourth time after paying a heavy price for converting just three of 17 break points.
Wawrinka, who had to save a match point to beat unheralded Dan Evans in the third round, committed 51 unforced errors but crucially smashed 46 winners past his opponent.
Stan, you absolutely deserved to win. You were the more courageous player in the decisive moment and you deserve this title, said Djokovic.
We both felt the demanding match that we played, but he came out on top, he was the better player, tougher mentally.
The final started against a sombre but defiant background with Broadway star Norm Lewis delivering a stirring rendition of The Star Spangled Banner, a poignant performance on the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
There are many more important things than tennis matches, Wawrinka said as he accepted the trophy. I want to remember what happened 15 years ago.
Djokovic, playing in his 21st Grand Slam final and seventh in New York, was quickest out of the blocks.
He broke for 2-0 having won the first point of the game with two extreme, against-the-odds retrievals.
Trailing 2-5, Wawrinka, who had spent the best part of nine hours more than Djokovic getting to the final, saved two set points.
The Serb was made to pay for his wastefulness as the Swiss suddenly found his range, breaking back in the ninth game off a Djokovic double fault.
But Djokovic glided untroubled through the tie-break as Wawrinkas serve fell apart.
- Wawrinka rallies -
Wawrinka is used to chasing lost causes against Djokovic, coming back from losing the first set to win their 2014 Australian Open quarter-final and again at Roland Garros last year.
Calling on that expertise, he broke for 3-1 in the second set, recovered from handing the advantage back in the seventh to level the final when Djokovic unleashed a wild forehand on set point in the 10th.
Frustrated, Djokovic demolished his racquet, collecting a code violation from umpire Ali Nili.
Wawrinka saved three break points in the opening game of the third set, which featured a 28-shot exchange, broke in the second and saved another break point in the next for a 3-0 lead.
But at the sixth time of asking in the set, Djokovic clawed his way back with a break for 2-3.
Wawrinka, however, kept up the attack and on set point in the 12th game slotted a backhand deep and into the corner which Djokovic could only push wide.
The world number one looked spent. He appeared to start cramping in the fourth set as he quickly slipped 0-3 down.
Much to Wawrinkas irritation, at 1-3 Djokovic called the trainer and took a medical timeout for treatment for blisters.
Djokovic apologised, claiming he needed attention as he couldnt stand.
At 2-5, the trainer reappeared but Wawrinka saw the job through leaving Djokovic to finish a Slam runner-up for the ninth time. AFP

Great Britain take medal total to 56
Rio de Janeiro Sunday: Richard Whitehead, Beth Firth and Jo Butterfield won gold Paralympics as Great Britain picked up 21 medals on day four of the Rio Games, taking their tally to 56.
Whitehead retained his T42 200m title in an impressive 23.39 seconds as fellow Brit Dave Henson took bronze.
Swimmer Firth dominated the S14 200m freestyle to take gold in 2:03.30 ahead of team-mate Jessica-Jane Applegate.
Club thrower Jo Butterfield (F51) then broke the world record to secure Britains eighth gold of the day.
The other gold medal successes came in the afternoon session, courtesy of the rowing and cycling teams.
It set the tone for a thrilling fourth evening, in which Rebecca Redfern also set a new European record in the SB13 100m breaststroke, finishing in 1:13.81 to take silver.
Thomas Hamer touched home second in the S14 200m freestyle final, while there were bronzes for Amy Marren, Josef Craig and Stephanie Millward.
Whitehead, 40, ensured he retained his title with a strong finish to keep South African Ntando Mahlangu in second place.
His teammate Henson took bronze five years after losing his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan while serving in the military.
I won gold at the Invictus Games in 2014 and a week later I gave up smoking and thought Id give Rio a bash, he told Channel 4.
It just shows you want you can do. People suggested I go for Tokyo but I said I would go to Rio and medal.
Five and a half years ago I nearly died. Ive got my wife and daughter watching at home. Words cant express how thankful I am for their support.
Butterfield, a former army civil servant who was paralysed after an operation on a tumour on her spinal cord, threw 22.81m to break her own world record.
She and Kylie Grimes, who finished fourth in the same event with a throw of 18.75m, previously played wheelchair rugby, with Grimes representing Britain at London 2012.
Jo Butterfield and Dave Henson both come from military backgrounds but after different careers while serving their country, they both now also have Paralympic medals in common.
Butterfield is now a wheelchair user, paralysed from the chest down, while Henson, the Invictus Games hero, has had to get to used to running on prosthetic blades.
It hasnt been easy but with the assistance of Help for Heroes and the support of British Athletics, they have reached their goals of Rio medals - and the future looks bright for both.
Six-time Paralympic champion David Weir celebrated the birth of his son by qualifying first in his T54 400m heat, finishing in 46:66 seconds. I was a bit gutted that I didnt see him being born, but I had to come here and do what I do, he told BBC Radio 5 live. There was disappointment for Sammi Kinghorn who finished sixth in the T53 400m, before being disqualified for a lane infringement. BBC

The Spinners Web
The number 1 Test Team in the World the Australians got entangled in our Spinners Web spearheaded by Rangana Herath and got trounced 3-0 in the recently concluded Test Series.
If this same Australian Team had to face the Indian spin quartet of Bishen Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Sriniwas Venkatraghavan the whole Australian team would have been Signed Sealed and Delivered to the pavilion in no time.
They were known as the fab four in the sixties just like The Beatles in the sixties in England. In their own way they terrorized batsmen in much the same manner as Andy Roberts and Michael Holding, Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee.
Ian Chappell for one reckoned that the tour of India in 1969-70 was the last word in his cricketing education as he had to take on the spin bowlers at their peak on helpful tracks.
One of the best players of spin, Chappell said in an interview if the body had to show tremendous reflexes in trying to negotiate a fast bowler, the brain was working overtime in trying to tackle this four Indian spinners. They had so many ideas so many variations and all this with hardly any change in the action, that the batsman was at his wits end in just trying to see off an over successfully.
Erapalli Prasanna was a 21year Engineering student from Bangalore when he made his debut which was not impressive. He had to give priority to his studies and then get employment so that he could support his family since his father had died. As a result there was a gap in his Test carrer, however he kept on playing first class cricket.
Chandrasekhar also debut at the same time, he delivered the ball with sudden quick and jerky action, there was something puzzling about his bowling arm too. Then it came out that it had been withered by infantile paralysis when Chandra was young. The deformity in his arm gave him a flexibility that enabled him to deliver the ball with a quick and whippy action. He was not a leg spinner, most of them were either googlies or top spinners bowled at medium pace, and they reared up at the batsmen as if a cobra was striking a victim. The batsmen would not know till the last minute where the ball would pitch, how much it would bounce and turn. He bowled with his shirt sleeves buttoned down to heighten the mystery.
A super fast delivery from Chandra baffled and beat the outstretched bat of Vivian Richards in a Test in the West Indies in 1976.So stunned was Richards, (then in the midst of his greatest period ever, by the speed of the delivery), that once he had recovered his composure, he explained to Syed Kirmani behind the stumps:Maan, that was as fast as Thommo(Jeff Thomson).
In the 1966-67 Series the rise of Srinivas Venkatraghavan was almost as meteoric as Chandra and Prasanna. Although Prasanna had clever variations of flight, speed and spin, Venkat was the bigger spinner of the two, with his accuracy he could block one end up.
Bishen Singh Bedi was the fourth member of the spin quartet. He was a left arm orthodox bowler. He used to flight the ball and let it hang in the air so that the batsmen were baffled as to where it would pitch. His clever variations, subtlety, teasing curve and vicious turn and unpredictable bounce had the batsmen in all sorts of trouble.
Bedi was hailed as one of the best slow left arm bowlers, whose action never failed to have the connoisseurs drooling. He was also Indias most outspoken captains.

Hesson hints at playing three spinners against India
Auckland, Sunday New Zealand coach Mike Hesson is aware of the threat Ravichandran Ashwin could pose to his batsmen in the upcoming Test series in India.
On Sunday, he hinted at the possibility of fielding three spinners in a match.
Hesson is impressed with the way his spinners  Mark Craig, Ish Sodhi and Michell Santner  have performed.
Seamers if anything might bowl two-three overs up front and its more likely theyre going to have spin at one end to start with if theyre going to play three of them. And if youve got two left-handers against Ashwin at the top its going to be a big challenge for us. We have to assess conditions and pick what we think is the right mix, Hesson was quoted as saying by stuff.co.nz.
The 41-year-old praised his young spin bowling unit that is expected to play a crucial role in India.
Theyre a young spin-bowling group. Probably Ish and Mitch have found white-ball cricket a little easier than Test cricket, he said. Theyre both evolving nicely and its about giving them opportunity. Ive been really pleased with the way Mark Craig has come back from last season. Hes made a few changes technically and the ball seems to be coming out really nicely.
New Zealand will play a three-day tour match against Mumbai in Delhi between September 16 and 18, before the first Test in Kanpur.
The second and third Tests will be played in Kolkata and Indore from September 30 and October 8, respectively.
Ronchi to open
Hesson said wicketkeeper-batsman Luke Ronchi could be one of the contenders for a place in the XI as the side looks for an opening batsman who can combat spin.
New Zealands regular opening pair is Martin Guptill and Tom Latham. In the only Test he played against England at Headingley last year, Ronchi slammed a 70-ball 88. The Hindu

Johnson wins US PGA BMW Championship in record fashion
Indianapolis, Sunday World number two Dustin Johnson fired a five-under par 67 Sunday to win the US PGA's BMW Championship by three strokes over England's Paul Casey with a tournament scoring record.
The 32-year-old American, who captured his first major title at the US Open in June at Oakmont, finished on 23-under par 265 over 72 holes at the 7,516-yard Crooked Stick layout in suburban Indianapolis.
I played really solid, drove it really nicely, wedged it really good, Johnson said. I played really solid all week.
It was the 12th career victory for Johnson on the US PGA Tour and his third of the year, his personal best following his major breakthrough and the World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational.
I've got a lot of confidence in every part of my game, Johnson said. All the work I have put in on my wedges has really paid off this year. I putted really great this week.
In the 113th edition of an event that traces its history to 1899, Johnson broke the 72-hole record of 22-under set by Tiger Woods in 2007 and matched last year by Australia's top-ranked Jason Day.
Casey settled for second place for the second week in a row on 268, his seventh runner-up finish on the US PGA Tour, after a 67 with American Roberto Castro third on 271.
Day withdrew from the event Sunday after aggravating a pinched lower left joint capsule reaching for a tee at the ninth hole, but was still able to finish among the five season points leaders.
That means Day would win the $10 million season points bonus if he wins the season-ending Tour Championship in two weeks at Atlanta. But so would points leader Johnson, Casey, American Patrick Reed and Aussie Adam Scott.
I'm looking forward to the Tour Championship, Johnson said. It would definitely mean a lot if I win it. I'm going to go out there and play good golf and see what happens.
Day was leading for the Vardon Trophy as the season low scorer but is now ineligible due to the withdrawal.
Johnson opened with a birdie to seize a four-stroke edge, squandered the lead after back-to-back lip-out bogeys at the second and third combined with consecutive Casey birdies, but then birdied four of the next five holes and roared to victory.
I hit a couple squirrelly shots there, Johnson said. It was a little frustrating I lipped them out. It was nice to make a good birdie on four. I rolled the ball really nicely today. I made some nice shots after the first few holes.
Big-driving Johnson, the 2010 BMW winner, went 15-under on the par-5 holes this week as he converted a 54-hole lead into a title for the third time in seven career opportunities.
Sunday's results determined the 30-man field for the Tour Championship. American J.B. Holmes parred the last hole to lock up the last spots for himself and South African Charl Schwartzel with US star Rickie Fowler missing out. Had Holmes missed the final four-foot putt Fowler would have been in and Holmes would have been out.
Schwartzel, Holmes and Scott were in a pack sharing fourth on 276 that also included Americans Ryan Palmer and Matt Kuchar.
Casey, a 13-time European Tour winner who was runner-up to Rory McIlroy last week, won his only US PGA title at the 2009 Houston Open but was level with Johnson with 15 holes to play.
Johnson answered his consecutive bogeys with a 20-foot birdie putt at the fourth, a seven-foot birdie putt at the par-5 fifth and four-foot birdie putts at seven and eight to reach 21-under, restoring his four-stroke lead over Casey.

Home is where your mom is
Things may not be all peaches and cream for these three working mothers, but when they let go and decide do whatever (and whoever) they please, they really take it to the limit.
Much of the films charm rests on Mila Kunis shoulders, with her character being the most developed. She freaks out one day, when she finds out that her husband has being having an affair with a woman over the internet, via video chat. Her two friends are complete opposites of each other, but after a night out on the tiles, the three of them agree - and also bond over the fact - that being a good mother is not exactly the easiest thing in the world. They know theyre far from perfect. Unlike the local alpha-woman Gwendolyn (Applegate), who comes across as leading a picture perfect life and seemingly in complete control of everything. Its not long before Gwendolyn sees an increasingly empowered Amy as a threat to her, especially when Amy tries to become the PTA president. Both Amy and Gwendolyn try to undermine the others social standing, to hilarious results.
Wardrobe makeover
The humour incidentally, is quite bawdy, with the vast majority of the raunchy lines reserved for Carla. For example, the first step in her solution for getting Amys life back on track is for the latter to head to a bar, meet a guy and then head back to one of their places for some no-strings-attached sex. Carla also takes it upon herself to get Amy a wardrobe makeover in order to increase her sexiness quotient.
Bad Moms sometimes falters when attempts at mushy sentimentality are made. That being said, as a buddy flick, it delivers the goods, with a good amount of laugh-out-loud moments too.
Some of the attempts to make the movie look awesome are so evidently desperate, it hurts to watch them. Theres a scene where the ladies, drunk, go grocery shopping to Icona Pop playing in the background. The excessive use of slow motion and propeller fans to blow wind into their hair for such a stupid scene causes huge second-hand embarrassment.
Heavy judgment
But giving credit where its due, the movies heart in the right place. It advocates moms right to cut themselves some slack. We, sitting in a third world country, cannot really comprehend the heavy judgment middle and upper class mothers in the US have to face like not punishing kids, not saying no to kids, feeding kids organic food, not hiring a nanny, not leave your job and still manage to look like a supermodel at the end of the day. Bad Moms tries to give these moms a voice.
Only if it was enjoyable to watch as well.
Kunis is back after the unforgivable Jupiter Ascending and her performance as the way-too-good-looking mother is ordinary. The onus of making the movie funny did not rest on her but on Katheryn Hahn entirely and that woman is an underrated gem. After Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wigg, I trust her to take the baton of female comedy in Hollywood forward.

The lost kids, perhaps, become the best performers
Sidharth Malhotra on his new film Baar Baar Dekho, learning to maintain work-life balance and being the outsider who dreamed of making it big.
Q: You started the year with Kapoor and Sons. What kind of impact has it had on your career
A: The feedback for this film has been very positive. The audience appreciated its craft  the performances, the world its characters inhabit and the emotions and relationships it explores. I have received the maximum love for this film. It is not a very big film and we kept it performance-oriented. There werent big sets, extravagant costumes or elaborate song sequences. The set-up was very basic. Director Shakun Batra wanted to keep the sur (tune) very real. My character, Arjun, doesnt go through any significant transition nor does he have any big revelation to offer in the end, barring his changing equation with his mother. To make that interesting and engaging was a challenge, but it was a fulfilling process.
Q: In the upcoming film, Baar Baar Dekho, you play a man at different stages of his life
A: All my films are very different. This role is more challenging as I am playing a professor who travels into the future. I had no idea about how a 46-year-old man or a father behaves. To create those emotions and to age on screen were exciting for me. It has been, emotionally, the most difficult role to play. The film is about how the present generation prioritises career and materialistic goals over family and loved ones. It is about appreciating smaller things in life. When my character takes a peek into his future, he undergoes a transformation.
In a way, I have been in that position too. I was not from the film industry and my dream was far-fetched. When I came to Mumbai, which is a very different world from my own, I focussed only on my career and let go of some friendships. I could relate to this character. Today, however, I realise that balance is required.
Q: How did you approach the role
A: Nitya Mehra is a first-time director, but a very meticulous one. We read out different scenes, motivations, phases of my characters life. Since it is Jais journey that the audience will be following, we had to keep him endearing in spite of his flaws. So ensuring audience empathy was a struggle which Nitya and the team worked on. Another challenge for me, as I just mentioned, was to adopt the body language of a 46-year-old. I started observing my father for this. I studied his voice and reflexes. I had to bring in nuances like moving less swiftly.
Q: What is it about the film industry that attracts so many youngsters
A: I can speak for myself. As I child, I was not focussed on anything. I never realised that I could become an actor and tried my hands at different things. I was not sure if I wanted to play sport or do an MBA. I hated math and accounting was ruled out. All the lost kids, perhaps, become the best performers in a way because they are not satisfied with themselves and they want to play other people.
Q: Student of the Year 2 is going on floors soon. How do you feel about it
A: We are all excited about it. I know Tiger Shroff is in it and Punit Malhotra will be directing it. I am very eager to see how Punit tells the story.
Q: Though you call yourself a single man, you are currently being linked to Alia Bhatt. Is there any truth to it
A: Thats part and parcel of our profession. I took a while to get used to it. We cant help but be talked out. My relationship with Alia Bhatt is old news, its been circulating since Kapoor & Sons.
I am still enjoying my bachelorhood. We are friends and have worked together. There is nothing more to it.

Will Moana really be different from other Disney princesses
Moana is already joining the Disney princesses unaccompanied by a love interest. Now, the creative team behind the highly anticipated animated film has explained that Moanas body type will also set her apart from Belle, Cinderella, and the rest of the gang.
That was a deliberate attempt, partly inspired by wanting her to be different, Moana co-director John Musker told BuzzFeed.
And then we wanted her to be an action hero, capable of action.
Musker went on to explain, Even the visual development drawings we had done and stuff, based on drawings of people in the South Pacific it just seemed right for this character to have her look like she could physically hold her own for what kind of stunts we wanted her to do, and the physicality of the role. Its certainly refreshing to see a different kind of female body type highlighted in the upcoming movie, but will Moana really be all that different from the princesses who came before her Her waistline certainly looks pretty slim in the stills from the film, and she only looks more athletic and normal when compared to the hypersexualized (and teenage) princesses of Disneys past, who have comical body proportions.
This isnt the first time the body composition of a Moana character has been the topic of discussion. Some have criticized the films depiction of Maui, a Polynesian demigod (voiced by Dwayne Johnson). Detractors say the character appears obese, which they claim portrays a negative stereotype of Polynesians.
Others, however, point out Maui appears solid and muscular, just as the demigod would have been described.
Moana is scheduled to be released on November 23. Refinery

Jackie Chan is BACK!
Majestic and Empire Cineplex brings to its widescreen the latest odd-couple action comedy Skiptrace based on an amiable buddy relationship with partner co-star Johnny Knoxville.
This plot revolves around Chans straight-arrow Hong Kong cop who is captor, then comrade to Knoxvilles genially slippery Yankee con man. Directed by Renny Harlin, this HK-U.S.-China co-production is a perpetual-motion-machine of scenes showing off one exotic international location after another.
Things start unpromisingly on a must avenge my partner note with Bennie Chan (Chan) failing to rescue police colleague Yung (Eric Tsang) from an apparent trap by elusive crime kingpin the Matador. As Yung nobly plunges to a presumed watery grave, he makes Bennie promise to look after his motherless daughter. Nine years later, Yungs now-grown daughter, Samantha (Bingbing Fan), is working semi-undercover at a lavish Macau gambling palace, likewise hoping to find some connection between its owner, Wong, and her fathers death. She ends up being pulled into the fracas that ensues when rhinestone cowboy-styled Yankee Connor Watts (Knoxville) witnesses a murder on-site, while fleeing Russian mobsters after cleaning out the casinos coffers.

Justin Timberlake concert film to debut on Netflix
Justin Timberlakes 20/20 Experience World Tour concert film is heading to the small screen this October.
Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme filmed Justin Timberlake and The Tennessee Kids in Las Vegas, during the final date of the pop superstars mammoth 134-city 20/20 Experience World Tour, which ran from November, 2013 to January, 2015 and amassed a staggering $232 million (174.8 million) in ticket sales.
The film, which also features the 35-year-old singers 25-strong backing band, the Tennessee Kids, will have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, when the Cant Stop The Feeling hitmaker is expected to appear alongside Demme to present the behind-the-scenes show to fans.
Demme previously opened up about the project while it was still in production last year, calling it very emotional, very exciting.
He added, Its a space age music film. Theres tremendous dancing in this piece. Hes got an extraordinary band called the Tennessee Kids. Huge horn section, two lead guitars, two drummers, eight dancers, four exquisite background singers. And we caught them on their last performance. Demme, 72, was an obvious choice for the job, given his background in legendary concert films, which include the 2006 Neil Young documentary Heart of Gold, and Talking Heads famous 1984 film, Stop Making Sense.
He is also a seasoned Hollywood moviemaker, best known for 1991s The Silence of the Lambs, for which he won the Best Director Oscar, and Philadelphia in 1993. Justin Timberlake and The Tennessee Kids will stream on Netflix from 12 October.
Timberlake, meanwhile, is preparing to star opposite Anna Kendrick and James Corden in his first Woody Allen film, an as-yet-untitled project reportedly set in New York City in the 1950s. He also voices a character named Branch in the upcoming animated film Trolls, to be released in November.
