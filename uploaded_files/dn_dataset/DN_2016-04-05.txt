Ravin Sayer - first bowler from Central Province to capture 100 wickets

Trinity College captain and off spinner Ravin Sayer became the first bowler from the hill capital and Central Province to capture 100 wickets this season and he chose to achieve this feat in the 99th "Kandy's Battle of the Blues" against their traditional rivals St. Anthony's College at the Pallekelle International Cricket Stadium which was also the first time this Big Match was played outside the city of Kandy.
When the Antonians were put into bat on the first day Ravin Sayer had 98 wickets to his credit and wanted two to reach the three figure mark. He had figures of 5 for 35 in that innings and in the process reached 100 wickets for the season.
This is the second time he had captured 100 wickets in a season and he did so in 2014 when he captured 108 wickets. In 2015 he captured 96 wickets and a cruel fate denied him of 100 wickets as he had to miss one match for the correction of his delivery action which is now smooth and fine. In his first year in 2013 he captured 36 wickets.
Thus in four seasons of school cricket he had captured 344 wickets which is the highest number of wickets by a Trinitian. The other Trinitians who have captured over 100 wickets in a season are Sachith Pathirana, Rushan Jaleel and Akila Jayasundera. All are spinners.
Ravin Sayer is also a good batsman and he scored 632 runs and scored over 300 runs in 2014 and 2015.
His best bowling figures this season is 5 for 3 against St. Servatius College, Matara and 6 for 39 against Zahira College, Colombo.
His fine leadership saw his school scoring ten outright wins and a first innings loss against St. Peter's College saw his school being eliminated in the quarter finals of the League Championship.
Ravin Sayor's match by match bowling figures are:
Vs. Maliyadewa College 1 for 20, vs. St. Aloysius College 2 for 58, vs. St. Anthony's College, Wattala 5 for 31 and 5 for 56, vs. De Mazenod College 4 for 35 and 5 for 54, vs. D.S. Senanayake College 1 for 17 and 2 for 28, vs. St. Servatius College 5 for 3 and 2 for 40, vs. Wesley College 1 for 48, vs Bandaranaike College 6 for 45, vs. Dharmapala College 1 for 9 and 7 for 19, vs. St. Benedict's College 5 for 107, vs. St. Joseph's College 2 for 27, vs. Dharmaraja College 3 for 21 and 5 for 118, vs. Ananda College 1 for 50 and 3 for 70, vs. Isipathana College 4 for 64, vs. St. Thomas College 3 for 107, vs. Zahira College 1 for 11 and 6 for 39, vs. St. Peter's College 2 for 56 and 1 for 64 (quarter finals), vs. Royal College 5 for 65 and 4 for 64, vs. Maris Stella College 6 for 66, vs. St. Anthony's College 5 for 35 and 1 for 50.
Ravin Sayer was coached by Sampath Perera at under 17 level and upto part of 2016 season before Kavinda Jayasuriya took over in January 2016 the coaching of the first XI.

Junior Match Play Golf Tourney from April 18 to 21

The Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) will conduct the Sri Lanka Junior Match Play Golf Championship 2016 for the Rukmani Kodagoda Challenger Trophy at the Royal Colombo Club course, Colombo from 18th to 2st April. This major golf championship for junior golfers in the country will be once again sponsored by Perera and Sons Bakers Limited.
This championship organized by the governing body for golf in Sri Lanka has drawn the best junior golfers in the country and is a very good move by the SLGU as it will give the promising young golfers an opportunity to compete with golfers within their age group as otherwise they will have to compete with seniors in other tournaments.
The championship will be played in the following divisions:
Gold Division: 15 to 17 years
Silver Division: 12 to 14 years
Bronze Division: 10 to 11 years
Copper Division: 9 years and under
This Junior Golf Championship was inaugurated in 2014 with Perera and Sons Bakers Limited coming forward to sponsor the event and this will be the third consecutive year in which they will be the sponsors and will be played for the Rukmani Kodagoda Trophy. The objective behind this championship is for the SLGU to focus attention on young golfers especially those under 14 years with an eye on the future and to identify and develop their talents.
Late Rukmani Kodagoda is a double international having represented the country in two sports - golf and tennis. She won the national Amateur championship in 1979 besides many other tournaments. Ruki as she was affectionately known established herself as one of the top sportswomen in the country at that time winning trophies after trophies. She held the post of chairperson of the Sri Lanka Ladies Golf Union in 1990 and 1991 and was also the captain of the Ladies section of the Royal Colombo Golf Club. It is a fine tribute that this championship is being played for a trophy named after an eminent sporting personality.
Last year's championship saw some top performances with Prashan Peiris winning the Gold Division. Tanya Balasuriya the Copper Division, Lavon Niyarapola the Bronze Division and Yanik Kumara the Copper Division. One of the top contenders for the Gold Division and the Overall title will be Tanya Balasuriya who is in good nick having won the Mackwoods Sri Lanka Ladies Match Play Golf Championship 2016 played at Victoria last month.
Then there are other promising top golfers like Ananda Flamer Caldera, D Dhanarajan, S Fleming, Januka Dilshan, Tien Kapilasena, Nirek Tejwani, Levon Niyarapola and Sathsara Nilshan who could shine in their own divisions.

Team-work  key to success of Kandy SC, says Udaya Balasuriya

The President of the Kandy Sports Club and Old Trinitian Udaya Balasuriya created a record of sorts for himself and the club when he became the first and only President of the Club who in his maiden year itself won the rugby double with an unbeaten record.
It is not known whether there is any parallel to this record in any other rugby playing club in Sri Lanka but certainly not in the recent past Kandy Sports Club has been dominating the rugby scene since 1992 and winning the rugby double with an unbeaten record is out of question during the past 26 years.
Soft spoken and glutton for work Udaya Balasuriya took office as President of Kandy Sports Club in June last year and it was a challenging task to hold this office at a club like this which had just regained the Rugby Double. He had to maintain this trend and cannot be a losing President and end up a cropper.
Speaking to this writer he said they are great and they performed well. They never gave up when faced with a defeat and when the chips were down. Though rugby is a team game and every player contributed his mite towards the success of the club. There were many times when a player came up with individual brilliance to nail the opponents when they were going to defeat us. For example look at the try scored by scrum half Srinath Sooriyabandara and it came from nowhere as he sliced through like a red hot knife on butter and was unstoppable till he reached the corner flag. Full back Nigel Ratwatte made the try conversion under pressure look easy as the ball sailed over. This was a superb team effort. All of a sudden seven points were on the board and we raced towards victory or snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. This is Kandy Sports Club and the boys have steely determination to succeed.
Towards the end of the season we had many injuries to keep players but our larder was well stocked and our silent operator and coach Sean Wijesinghe rose up to the occasion to motivate and guide the players and made the crucial changes which brought the winning spirit into the boys. He did not panic as he had the utmost confidence in the boys and having himself played with them he knew their potential and harnessed them well.
Udaya Balasuriya at the helm of the club with support from its Trustee and God Father Minister Malik Samarawickrema have been working hard for the success of the club. They are even present during practices, which in turn motivated the boys.
The club has many development plans and has set its sights on floodlights so that matches could be played after dusk and a swimming pool may come in later. The gymnasium has been upgraded. The players are well looked after with lucrative employment so that they could be retained in the hill capital.
Udaya Balasuriya has done a good job for the club often spending his own funds. He hails from the famous Balasuriya family in Kandy and they are business tycoons and have a conglomerate of business in varied fields from tourism to jewllery and even going into agriculture. They have done a lot for sports and one of his uncles had his own club playing A Division rugby which may be unique in the history of club rugby in Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was known then.
Kandy Sports Club has only once before won the double with an unbeaten record that was in 1997 when they became triple champions led by Lasantha Wijesuriya and coached by former Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police and highly successful Police captain and SLRFU President Nimal Lewke who was present at Nittawela for practices all the way from Vavuniya in the days terrorism stalked the country and highways.
This is the success story of Kandy Sports Club and the men behind its success and little is known of them as they are not the try scorers.

MR yearns for reconciliation within SLFP

Priority should be given to achieve reconciliation within the SLFP before trying to achieve it in the country, former President and Kurunegala district Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing the gathering after participating in an Asheervada pooja at the Sri Sambuddha Themagul Viharaya in Tract 4, Maha Vilachchiya on Sunday.
Rajapaksa who referred to the recent finding of a terrorist suicide kit and cache of arms in the North, stressed that they had called upon the government to give priority to national security from the very beginning.
He said although terrorism had been wiped out in the country, the entire outside world was engulfed by terrorism today.
The fact that a few LTTE terrorists had taken refuge abroad was an open secret, Rajapaksa said. He said although reconciliation was an urgent need, he was of the view that reconciliation did not mean dancing to the tune of terrorists.
Rajapaksa said as members of the Opposition, they too considered reconciliation as a good thing.
"But before everything, reconciliation should be first be achieved within the SLFP. The way SLFP organisers were dismissed and shuffled we have suspicion whether reconciliation could be achieved with the SLFP," he said. He said the previous government led by him did much to achieve peace and reconciliation after the war victory by building houses for the displaced, roads and other infrastructure in the North and East to promote peace and reconciliation.
Rajapaksa said it was due to their services that the people in the South and North were able to move about freely in any part of the country.

UNP Working Committee reshuffle only after amendments to party constitution - Prof. Marasinghe

Whilst rumours of a UNP Working Committee reshuffle are on the cards, Head of the Strategic Political Bureau of the UNP, Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said that it would only be possible after amendments to the UNP constitution have been introduced.
'It is not likely that such an event would take place soon,' Prof. Marasinghe said.
Last week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would introduce a new constitution to the UNP by September this year as the country itself looks towards a new constitution.
He also emphasized on the need to groom more second and third level leaders in the UNP.
The Prime Minister however is to leave on a 3-day visit to Beijing on Wednesday (6) to work on several trade agreements with China. Several newly introduced positions to the Working Committee are rumoured to face some change.

NFF requests to be recognized as an independent
National Freedom Front Leader (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa today in Parliament requested the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to recognize the NFF MPs as an independent group in the Opposition.

Rising to a point of order MP Weerawansa said he had already submitted a letter to the Speaker signed by 5 NFF MPs stating they intend to work as an independent group in the Opposition by breaking away from the UPFA.

He inquired the response of the Speaker with regard to this letter. He asked the NFF be granted the rights and privileges of other political parties in the Opposition. MP Weerawansa also said there were many past instances where parties which broke away from the Alliances were recognized as independent groups in Parliament.

He said the NFF decided to submit this letter as the Speaker at a previous time told Parliament that the only reason not to recognize them as a separate group in Parliament was that they had not officially separated from the UPFA. MP Weerawansa said they would continue to work with the Joint Opposition.

Citing a past instance, he pointed out the JVP after contesting under the UPFA separated from it, but it was recognized a separate independent group in the Opposition.

The Speaker said he would first take up the matter at a Party Leaders Meeting and inform the House later. He said he wants to inquire the opinions of other party leaders with regard to it. There are 17 political parties in Parliament, and they have also made various requests from me. It is my duty to protect the rights of all he said.

MP Weerawansa said he has no objection for taking up it at a Party Leaders Meeting, but requested not to reject his request just because somebody objected to it at the Party Leaders Meeting.

At this point Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella asked MP Weerawansa whether he had officially informed the UPFA of his decision to break up from the UPFA. Agreeing to this view, the Speaker observed it would be easier for him to make the decision if the UPFA was officially informed by the MP. 

The other four NFF members in Parliament include Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Niroshan Premeratne and Padma Udhaya Shantha.

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said that it was his responsibility to ensure that delimitation is conducted properly. Local Authorities are an essential component in democracy. As the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, I am responsible to the country and the public to ensure that delimiting is conducted in a proper manner.
He said all of the political parties had complained that there were issues with delimiting and said an election cannot be held without the issued being resolved. Three villages in Vavuniya lost their right to vote under the previous delimitation. That is not good. My responsibility is to do this job properly in a manner in which none of the races or areas will experience any injustice. For that we need a reasonable time period. So I would like to ask that members of PSs endure these circumstances for some time.
He was speaking at the opening of a multi-purpose building for the Aranayeka Pradeshiya Sabha today. He also said the SLFP will not be brought down by hooting. Not even the assassination of Bandaranaike spelled the end of the party, he said.
