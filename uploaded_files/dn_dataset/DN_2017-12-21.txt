Mulled  Wine  is the latest hair  colour of the season
The latest hair colour trend is inspired by a drink and we are already obsessed with the hue. Introducing mulled wine hair, the hue everyone is talking about. From the last few trends CreamSoda, Cider and Spice to Mulled Wine, it is all about holiday cheer now.
Wine, which is mostly a seasonal beverage, just makes this hair colour trend a perfect pick for winters. The colour trend made a way through the viral hashtag and now everyone seems to be obsessed with it. The hue is a mix of deep red, which is also kind of purple and has a hint of chocolate brown.
The shade was a quite a big thing back in the 90s, and is now being celebrated again with a new name. Trending now, the colour has resurfaced just in time for winters and even Aishwarya Rai Bachchan seems to be a fan of this hue. She has been flaunting this shade for quite some time now. Her hair colour is a mix of brown and burgundy shades, which is kind of similar to mulled wine. From winter fashion to nail polishes to even lip colour, this season is all about this timeless shade. So, why keep the hair behind

2018 to be best year for world economy after 2010
The year 2018 looks to be a year of good economic growth around the globe, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Global growth is projected to reach 3.7% in purchasing power parity terms next year.
This will be the most rapid expansion of global growth, measured by this metric, in 7 years, the accountancy and professional services firms forecasted in its report Monday, news outlets reported.
Unfortunately, PwCs forecasts are not so bright for the UK. Unemployment across the Group of Seven countries is predicted to reach its lowest level in 40 years below the 5% line. GDP growth is expected to decline from 6.8% to 6.5% in China next year.
Globally, GDP is forecast to reach 3.7%. The US, France and Germany should come in at levels between 2% and 2.5% with Britain only expected to demonstrate a GDP of 1.4%.
PwC said that, for the first time since 2010, it is revising its global growth forecast upwards, bolstered by a robust cyclical recovery in the eurozone and stronger growth in the US.
We expect global economic growth to be broadly based in 2018, rather than dependent on a few star performers, said Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC.
Even though both the UK and China are expected to show slower growth in the next twelve months, the global economy is expected to bloom in 2018. Generally, we expect monetary policy to somewhat tighten in the G7, reflecting closing output gaps in some advanced economies and stable inflation expectations, PwC said.
The firm sees GDP growth in the US picking up from 2.2% this year to 2.4%. It sees French growth rising from 1.8% to 2%. German growth is seen steady at 2.3%, while growth in China slows from 6.8% to 6.5%.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported late November that the global economy in 2018 is on pace to have the best year of growth since 2010, which was the snapback year after the Great Recession.
Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: The global economy is in the midst of a miniboom that started in mid-2016.
They expect solid 3.8% global growth next year, up from 3.7% this year, with most major economies growing at or above potential.
Their counterparts at Barclays are even more bullish, anticipating that the self-enforcing economic cycle will deliver 4% global growth next year.
The International Monetary Fund said recently that annual global growth of 4% or higher was in fact fairly common in the pre-crisis years.

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatilleke acquitted Liyanarchchi Pragethi, a woman accused of and charged with possessing and trafficking 3.64 grams on December 2013 near the Angulana police area.
Acquitting the accused, the judge stated that the evidence of the policemen who conducted the raid in a house at Angulana clearly showed that the case had been fabricated by them. The police had visited the house to arrest the husband of the woman but he was not there; as such, the judge explained, the police arrested the woman and introduced the drugs onto her person. This was clearly confirmed under the cross examination. The judge commended the lawyer who defended the accused and proved that this was a fabricated case, involving police who tried taking revenge on the husband of the accused woman.
This accused was held in remand with her infant for the duration of this case, Samadara Jayasinghe, the defence attorney, said. The prosecution had failed to prove the case against the accused without any doubt. This is very sad conduct by the police.

Sri Lanka embarks on the road towards a less-cash society
As the unlimited possibilities of a digital economy increase throughout the world, it is exciting to witness Sri Lanka emerging as a nation participating actively in the digital commerce revolution.
All indicators point to Sri Lanka being ready to embrace the benefits of low-cost, efficient digital forms of payment securely, reliably and easily in a world beyond cash. Given the large cash displacement opportunities available regionally, it can be said that Sri Lanka is well placed to experience the transition from using more cash to one that uses cashless payments with ease - empowering the economy and citizen-centric services while driving financial inclusion and accelerating growth opportunities.
I was able to gain key insights into the enthusiasm among Sri Lankans towards a digital economy when I undertook a week-long tour across Sri Lanka recently as a part of a charity drive, during which I opted to only pay with the card and not use cash. It was an interesting journey, given the challenges but also one that highlighted the optimism of people towards digital payments and the opportunity to expand usage at a wide level of markets.
In this connection, the recent YouGov consumer payment attitude study that measured consumer sentiment around digital payments, affirms a growing interest among Sri Lankan consumers (51%) in favour of adopting new forms of digital payments. This also indicates a heightened level of awareness, acceptance and adoption of digital payments among consumers.
With over 18 million debit cards and 1.4 million credit cards in circulation as per Central Bank statistics, it is worthwhile to note that 70% of the population have access to some form of digital payment. Given a high mobile penetration level, it can be said that Sri Lanka has the potential to become one of the first South Asian economies to truly transition into a digital economy.
Central Bank figures already seem to confirm a trend of thriving digital payments; an increase of 15% in credit cards and 11% in debit cards point to a figure of 19.5% of total cards in circulation as at mid-2017.
It is also imperative to note that transactions done on cards in Sri Lanka last year without cash withdrawals, stood at Rs. 290 billion, which includes POS (Point of Sale) and e-commerce engagements.
It can also be said that a growth in Internet penetration together with an increased availability of low-cost smartphones could drive the potential for tremendous e-commerce possibilities. With just 4.2% of electronic personal consumption expenditure, there is considerable room for growth there.
This is significant as digital payments enable individuals, businesses, and governments to engage in transactions efficiently while focusing on growth. For banks, payments providers, financial-technology start-ups, retailers, government and citizens, the potential is remarkable.
In this connection, the recent study by Roubini Thoughtlab reinforces that opening up to digital payments may help Colombo obtain US$0.2 billion in net benefits annually, equivalent to 3% of the citys average GDP. Estimated catalytic impact for Colombo over the next 15 years include 20.4 basis point increase in GDP growth rate and 2.1% increase in employment. Once again, this study helps us learn the actual benefits of going cashless for governments, businesses and consumers, stimulating long-term economic growth in the process.
We at Visa believe that the time is now to seize the opportunity  undoubtedly, digital payments have the ability to transform the economic prospects of millions of people while empowering small businesses through actual financial empowerment. This process can be strengthened through the consolidation of three building blocks: enhancing widespread mobile and digital infrastructure, creating a dynamic business environment for financial services, and paving the way for digital payment innovations that meet the needs of individuals and small businesses in ways that are bigger, convenient and secure.
Of course, making this vision a reality would mean expanding secure access points, while offering consumers more choices that empower their lifestyles. Sri Lanka today engages with global markets while the retail sector is planning for more growth opportunities. The expansion of the tourism industry with more hotels and restaurants coming up would mean enhanced digital payment options. All of which would mean the need to expand the usage of digital payments which will contribute towards bolstering the economic potential.
As Sri Lanka looks to a future of exploring unlimited opportunities, it is good to focus on enhancing digital connectivity, enable digital identification across markets, secure payment innovations, empower citizen centric services, focus on better digital security while creating a greater sense of digital awareness.
However, it is important for all of us to keep in mind that digital transformation is not a technological fix or a one-off plan, or a one-size-fits-all strategy. It is rooted in empowering a shared vision, one in which we can securely embed payments and commerce into any device. In the end, it is all about bringing the global digital revolution closer to meet specific socio-economic priorities through partnerships, innovation, and engagement among all key stakeholders at an economic, social and a community level.

## Title: Asbestos triggers tea ban

Asbestos triggers tea ban
Russias ban on Sri Lankan tea exports is believed to have been triggered by Sri Lankas ban on Russian asbestos.
Plantation Industries Minister, Naveen Dissanayake addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing admitted that unofficially they had come to know that the recent ban was due to the government refusing to lift a ban on asbestos imports.
In 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena issued a ban on asbestos into the country, citing health and environmental reasons.
The ban initially was to take effect in government contracts and would come into effect from January 1, 2018, with it finally being phased out by 2024.
But with the recent ban imposed by Russia, on Ceylon Tea, Sri Lanka has chosen to back down on its stance on asbestos for the time being. Russia produces over half of the worlds asbestos supply and is the major importer of the product into the country.
This is temporary, the Russians have sent us health certifications stating that their asbestos is not harmful.
So we have to look at that, said Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne at the media briefing.
Minister Susil Premajayantha together with a team from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research is expected to travel to Russia and look into the reports of the safety of Russian asbestos.
In the meantime, a team of experts in the tea industry and the Plantation Industries Ministry hope to travel to Russia next week to resolve the tea ban issue, Minister Dissanayake said.
The likelihood of finding a Khapra beetle in our tea is less than five percent, Minister Dissanayake addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing said. He explained that the beetle was a rare species found within the country itself.
We believe that the Khapra beetle larvae found by the Russians on one of our tea packages most likely came during transshipment, he said. On December 15, the Russian Agriculture Safety Watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor informed Sri Lankan authorities that they would be temporarily issuing a ban on Sri Lankan tea exports having found a live larvae of the beetle on one its packages.
Sri Lanka exports 11 percent of its tea to Russia and the minister noted that they had to make certain decisions to save their exports and two million people who depended on tea for a livelihood.
Tea prices in the auctions yesterday (19) and today (20) have not reduced but we hope to resolve this by mid-January. It is the winter season there and during this time tea purchases decrease, so if we can resolve it by then, it wont have too much of an impact on our exports, he said.
Ceylon Tea, according to Dissanayake follows stringent certification processes and adheres to EU standards. However, if the Russians are to demand further testing or certification, the minister said they could incorporate that too in their processes.
We are waiting for them to tell us what they need, he said. Minister Senaratne justifying the deferring of the asbestos ban explained that 80 percent of people still used asbestos in construction, and the fact that there were not many commercially viable alternatives was also a reason behind the ban suspension.
This does not mean it is permanent. We will look into this ban again in future once all problems in the industry have been resolved, he said.

Boost for subsidiary food crops in Ampara
The Ampara district Agriculture Department has taken initiative to enhance agricultural crop cultivation in the district. Paddy, green gram, sorghum, crown nut, kurakkan, cowpea, and other supplementary food crops have been given priority under the program.
Now, there is an increased incentive among farmers of Ampara District to grow ever more subsidiary food crops. These crops are grown in large scales with considerable profits.
Highland cultivators have received a very good income from the produce, especially the harvesting of mize at Ashraff Nagar in the Addalaichenai DS Division, recently. These seeds are sold by the Agriculture Department at reduced and subsidized rates with proper instructions and guidance to arable farmers. In certain areas, the cultivators said that the profits derived from these crops are better than paddy crops which are subjected to various pests and diseases.
Meanwhile, villagers, especially farmers and housewives of Addalaichenai, Oluvil, Palamunai, Thiraikeni, Ashraff Nagar, Meelath Nagar, and Alamkulam, have to deal with monkeys, which invade home gardens, arable crops (Highland crops) and vegetable plots, and destroy tender fruit and vegetable.
They do the most harm to tender coconuts, villagers said. As a result, the livelihood of these people is also affected.

Can anyone stop Kandy
December for us islanders is a compulsive time in every sense ..its those traditions that give us time to reflect and thoughts about others and sharing ....
Wellness and planning, keys to enjoying the season and absorbing its goodness ..
Fitting then that our rugby warriors step away from their boot sweat, favourite playing kit, those quirky superstitions that know no bounds.
We control our endearing and sometimes inexplicable passion, deeper than emotion and beyond expectations, with latent fear
Rugby players drive on adrenaline and an appetite for pain and skill, that beggars description.
The Dialog season in Sri, temporary on hold for the festive jollies and a few determined hugs ...a massive welcome relief for players and management alike.
Time off to recover from injury, plan numbers, examine combinations, asses performance, fitness and finish.. Factors and specifics that eventually control the destiny of each squad with ambitions greater than their club house!
Kandy has held their own, dictating the pace and enjoying the big W's, week after week..
If anything, only CH and Havies, putting pressure on their glittering back division ..led by the enormously skilled Fazil, captain Weeraratne, Nigel Ratwatte, Wiliweera, Richie D, Mr finisher himself, Danushka Ranjan.
What silk and pearls for the lions to reap and reward ..especially consider, Srinath spirits B ..on the bench ...and u, send a utility player
They are 40 points and sitting very pretty as no. 1 in the rankings, Havelocks 29, Army 25, etc..
The million dollar question for all of us including our much sought after experts, in their social media armchairs...is ...who will beat Kandy in the final round Who is strong enough to outplay and sharp enough to outwit the upcountry boys in the next 2 months
CR, Navy, Havelocks and CH have the players ...but can they play as a unit ..and match the defending champs for 80mins ....contain the try hunger and dominate up front
Gaming professionals take heart, breathe deep and the mesmerizing possibility of a new league champion What a tantalizing conclusion to the 2018.dialog season..
Round 2 for Havies, Navy, Army, CR and CH ..means anything is possible ..so it's the belief on the day that dictates an acceptable finish ..with no fixed assurances....Or winners as yet..
All told it's a massive ask to clock up the big Ws and beat Kandys impressive round 1 form and bonus bank...
Our pondering pundits will be itching with great delight to contemplate probable match results between the top 5 ......safe to wish the pundits island luck with the predictions
Our Asian jnr rugby confrontation with Hong Kong for a passage to the jnr world cup ..ended as it began ..quietly and with clinical wins for HK, without much fuss.
The islanders never looked threatening at any stage during both matches ..losing by 37 points at the Racecourse, and by 40 points in Kowloon last Saturday.
The prospects for jnr rugby in Sri and at Asia level is singularly massive ..but needs investing big and efficient planning for 5 years ahead ...its crying to be fixed and needs to eradicate haphazard temporary thinking with immediate effect.
We must focus our resources and acumen on upgrading the whole jnr international rugby approach...aim to get our high performance status, and a practical format that is maximum incentive for players and parents to carry our flag.
Agreed that the 15s and 7s formats need to be separated and given due status.
Schools must be also be rewarded and supported by the national plan for their best players ...recognition and incentives for having players make the national squad is a massive boost to school, to players, their neighbors and the whole town ....most of all, it's our best talent available for national duty.
Thinking positive and focussing on Asia's top rank is our target.
It is a luxury that Japan has long guarded, and protected...now currently Hong Kong stepping up to the mark.
I am certainly looking forward to Sri islanders cutting our performance teeth and out classing all of this Asian domination ..ideally by 2019 and beyond.
Finally with so much in our league crystal ball, to contemplate....let's steer away from the blatantly obvious and ponder wildly about Havies being a force or CR shocking themselves and CH being a genuine threat to all of the top ..including the defending champions.
Christmas is the season for giving and sharing...traditional joy from seeing others happy
Imagine the huge slice of happiness and Colombo wide celebration if Havies beat Kandy in Kandy Or if CH grind a famous victory at the Nittawela cauldron of pain ..it's belief and singular effort of each player to perform out of their skins, be marauding warriors in the loose and rock solid in the sets.
Joyful noise if that were to happen next month. Let's keep an open mind and grin knowingly.
My wish for round 2 ..is more open running rugby and more tries to thrill us fans ...what a sight to behold. Imagine,...good lineout, 65m out, clean catch, zip pass from the 9, perfect hands from the fly half, decent depth and the centre on a loop ..full back overlap and a clinical finish for the winger to beat his opposite shadow ..leave him flat footed and a 25m flying try corner flag ....bula Sri rugby hearts, Merry Christmas to all ..see you for round 2.
Blessings islanders...enjoy the break and jolly!

Strengthening the gentleman's game
Cricket is known as the gentlemens game. It is played all over the world and in Sri Lanka, in many versions. Test, limited overs 50, 20 overs, so on, some say, Cricket is life. I would courteously say life is not cricket, its a game, time consuming, both for players and followers. Some devote and dedicate to the extent quarter of their life by covering the game. Is it worthwhile
By limiting ourselves to control and limitation, we can enjoy the game and save our valuable time for a wholesome wealthy and prosperous life. Too much attention and attachment, sees dismay and disappointment, as we expect our sides to win. The game only wins. Let not cricket fool us. Let not cricket be king, let not cricket rule, let us rule it. Let it not be our master but servant.
I shall politely suggest novelties in cricket. Why not play 25 -25 (twenty five overs a side), Sri Lanka cricket can be pioneering. How about allowing slip fielders to wear gloves, when wicketkeeper is allowed wicketkeepers gloves More catches win more matches.
Why not umpires be allowed to wear protective gear. Corruption too is happening at instances in cricket, some TV channels are using un-ethical information for their earning through cricket, thereby leading masses astray.

Climate change causing problems for Kitul tappers
The number of Kitul jaggery producers in the Kuruwita DS division has decreased to a great extent due to frequent change of climate in the Sabaragamuwa Province for the past few months.
Hundreds of jaggery producing families in Batatota, Mahawattakanda, Parathalakanda, Lassakanda, Sudagala, and Paladeniya face serious financial difficulties at present due to lack of production.
An experienced Kitul tapper told the Daily News that strong winds experienced in the area from time to time stop the 'Kandula' or the sweet toddy ('the lijja') stream of the Kitul flowers. As such, the tapper said, many Kitul tappers have given up Kitul tapping and few newcomers are entering this field.
At present, the quality Kitul jaggery scarcity is prevailing in the market and the price of Kitul-based products has gone up as never before. Accordingly, a kilo of Kitul jaggery is now sold at Rs.800 while a bottle of Kitul treacle is now sold at Rs.750.

The depression that developed to the east of the Bay of Bengal might reach Sri Lanka by next Monday (25) or Tuesday (26), the Director General of the Department of Meteorology K.H.S.Premalal said yesterday.
It may cause changes in the atmosphere as well, he added. However,he said that there would not be a possibility of Sri Lanka affected by a cyclone.
Premalal was speaking at a media brief held at the Disaster Management Center last evening.
Due to a disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, showers or thundershowers will occur in most provinces of the island, he also said. Accordingly, heavy falls (above 100mm) can be expected at some places in the southern half of the island.
Meteorology Department sources issuing a weather report further state that showers will occur at times in the Northern, North-central, Eastern, Southern and Uva provinces and Matale district today. It also states that fairly heavy rainfalls (above 75mm) can be expected in the Southern Province and in the Ratnapura and Kalutara districts and that fairly strong gusty winds (50 kmph) can be expected in Northern, North-central and Central province and Hambanthota, Moneragala and Matara districts today as well.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity, it also said.
Due to an active cloudiness in the sea areas to the south-east of Sri Lanka, the possibility for heavy showers/thundershowers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80kmph) in the deep sea areas to the south and south-east of Sri Lanka is high. the report also said.
Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant in this regard.

## Title: On devolving police powers
## Supertitle:

On devolving police powers
Taking into consideration and reckoning with the recommendations made by the Steering Committee of the Constituent Assembly, we the members of the Association of Chiefs of Police Rtd of Sri Lanka (ACP) at their Annual General Meeting held on November 25 at the Senior Police Officers Mess, Keppetipola Mawatha, Colombo 5, unanimously resolve as follows:
The Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constituent Assembly which was debated in the Parliament beginning on October 30 has recommended that the subject of Law and Order which is a Provincial Council Subject be completely devolved to the jurisdiction of the Provincial Councils, as envisaged in the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
It is vital to point out that the provisions of the 13th Amendment vis-a-vis police powers were never implemented by any government over the past three decades and one reason for this policy which is quite obvious is that such devolution would have positively rendered the country ungovernable. Devolution of police powers would have rendered the all important concept in good governance, namely accountability, inoperative and that is the fundamental reason why so many past Presidents including the present, did not devolve police powers, though what is possible is decentralization, which has already been done.
The policy to divide the Police Service into nine Provincial Police Services is conceptually flawed because it is impracticable and unnecessary in this small country of 25000 square miles and 21 million population, especially, in view of the present and future fast communications systems, road and air transport facilities which facilitates effective central control and direction even in a large country with far bigger population.
It is conceptually flawed for the reason that it fundamentally undermines the unitary and unified command structure. It dismantles the police command structure, thus rendering the chain of command inoperable and national accountability for law and order maintenance impossible. This is especially dangerous in a national crisis or a disaster affecting more than one province, as there will be no one who can be held responsible to the nation in such situations. The most recent example was the petrol crisis, the responsibility for which fell squarely on the Minister in charge of Petroleum and the CPC. This is because the petrol purchasing and distribution was centrally done. The IGP would not have had the authority if police powers were devolved, to give directions to the local police in the southern Provincial Council area relating to the serious cashes which occurred in the Ginthota locality just a couple of weeks ago.
The command and control structure of the Sri Lanka Police Service as articulated by the Police Ordinance is predicated on a unitary model with the IGP at its helm as the head of the Police Force. What is envisaged under the 13th Amendment is the bifurcation of this cohesive entity into two parts by enacting a new Police Act according to which there will be two units, viz National Police and Provincial Police.
The IGP will be a titular head of the National police service exercising effective authority only in the Metropolitan Police area. In view of this division, the IGP cannot be held responsible to the Minister in charge for the law and order of the entire country and therefore the Minister cannot be held answerable to the Parliament for preservation of law and order in the country. The respective heads of Provincial police will be answerable to the Chief Ministers and through them to the Provincial Councils for the law and order function.
The latter will have powers of enacting legislation pertaining to law and order which will result in the country not having uniform penal legislation, despite having a common Criminal Procedure Code.
Coordination, prevention, detection and investigation of crime will become complicated and complex with obstacles placed in the area of cross-border crime and investigation and prosecution. For example, the presently most effective 119 system will be impossible under the new devolved proposals.
The best example of the centralized co-ordination will be the recent gang rape case of Kayts where the main suspect tried to escape through the BIA with the alleged aid and abetting by the Northern Range S/DIG. It is spectacular that he could be nabbed at the Air Port in no time due to the centralized system.
The National Police will have very few and insignificant functions to perform and would not be entitled to wear the Police Uniform when deployed in the Provincial Council areas.
In this untenable situation the IGP can only stipulate standards and guidelines to be followed by the Provinces and there is no guarantee that they will be followed.
Recruitment will be on a provincial basis which will ensure that the loyalty of the provincial police will be to the local politicians which will threaten the survival of the nation as one unit. No police officer could be transferred out of the province on disciplinary grounds even in cases of serious dereliction of duty. The result would be the flourishing of symbiotic relationships among criminals and corrupt police officers and local politicians.
National and public security will be in veritable danger with the fundamental task of collection of national intelligence made impossible by the division of the police into 10 separate parts. The end result will be not only the degeneration of law and order into a state of anarchy but also the destruction of the nation itself.
The President, at page 16 in his Election Manifesto dated December 19, 2014, gave a firm commitment that the Police Service will be depoliticized and that promotions will be granted on the basis of merit and performance. But in view of the envisaged devolution of police powers, the police officers and even the Provincial Police Commissions will come under the control and directions of the Provincial Chief Ministers and Governor, which will make the de-politicization promised, a far-fetched implausible fantasy and a dream.
In view of the foregoing submissions articulated after due and careful deliberation, this House resolves that the devolution of police powers to the Provincial Council will be inimical to the realization of the effective implementation of law and order in the country and to the concept of Good Governance in which law and order occupies a preeminent position and which is in fact the quintessence of good governance.

To date more than 700 students have benefited from the Dialog Merit Scholarship programme, with a total commitment of more than Rs. 100 million by Dialog Axiata PLC.
Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education, who also graced the occasion shared his sentiments by endorsing the initiative and commenting that it takes the Ministry of Education one step closer to its optimistic ambitions to transform learning.
The Nenasa Smart School project aims to transform 250 schools and these will be equipped with Learning Management Systems, connectivity, and empowered smart teachers and students. The Smart Schools project is aligned with global trends in Teaching with Technology (TwT) and Axiata Groups focus on supporting the Sustainable Development Goal 4, Education for All.
Commenting on the launch, Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive, Dialog Axiata PLC said, Dialogs business model is founded on the principle of inclusivity and the company is single minded in delivering its vision of empowering Sri Lankan lives and enterprises with the latest in technology and connectivity.

Drug prices raised by 5%
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said prices of 48 drugs have been raised by five percent to prevent local importers from incurring losses.
This is due to the continuously rising prices of medicine in the global market.
Dr. Senaratne said prices were raised in accordance with a request made by local pharmaceutical companies importing drugs. The importers are making losses due to the price increase in drugs in the global market.
The price increase will be valid for one year with no price increase again even the prices of drugs in the global market increase in future (during the year). The prices of 48 drugs were reduced significantly on October 21 in 2016 (one year and two months ago), he said.
Earlier the price of a paracetamol tablet was Rs. 1.30 and now it is only Rs. 1.37 (only seven cents increased). All pharmacies should sell the drugs according to the prices in the Special Gazette Notification 2049/31 of December 14. The National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will conduct raids to nab pharmacies which sell drugs at higher prices than gazetted, he added.

England face postmortem after Ashes capitulation
PERTH: England will have to make some tough decisions about the futures of some of their most decorated senior players after they were ruthlessly exposed by Australia in a 15-day Ashes capitulation.
Joe Roots team head to Melbourne 3-0 down in the five-match series after being subjected to an innings and 41-run hiding in the third test at the WACA, where opener Alastair Cook and paceman Stuart Broad failed to deliver yet again.
English hopes that Cook could channel the Herculean effort that saw him score 766 runs in their 2010/11 triumph Down Under have proved forlorn. The veteran left-hander has instead reprised his form from the away series of 2013/14 when he stumbled through a 5-0 whitewash under the yoke of captaincy.
Despite being relieved of the leadership burden this time around, Cook has supported his successor Root with only 83 runs at an average of 13.83 this series, comfortably the lowest of Englands specialist batsmen.
Broad, meanwhile, has managed only five wickets at an average of 61.80 and suffered the worst test figures of his career at the WACA, where he went wicketless for 142 runs. His pace partner James Anderson has battled manfully through a difficult campaign, but at the age of 35 the long-serving Lancastrian may not be able or willing to lead Englands pace attack far into the future.
Australia has often proved to be a tour too far for veteran England players, as was shown by the 2013/14 debacle which ended the careers of Graeme Swann, Matt Prior and Kevin Pietersen.
That whitewash also led to the departure of director Andy Flower, but current coach Trevor Bayliss says he is still the right man to lead the team.
You may not (think that), but I think our performances have gone pretty well over the last couple of years, he told reporters at the WACA.
Thats for people above my pay grade to make that decision.
Bayliss has, however, offered no bright ideas on how to rejuvenate England or find faster bowlers that can compete on Australian pitches where they have now lost eight straight matches.
I havent got the answers, said the Australian.
Over the last couple of years weve certainly been on the lookout for a few positions in the team and no one until this tour has stood out.
In Somerset seamer Craig Overton, who bowled with vigour in Adelaide and Perth until suffering a rib injury, England have at least unearthed an encouraging prospect.
But the raw 23-year-old can scarcely be expected to cover the gaping hole which the absence of Anderson and Broads 900-odd wickets of test experience would leave.
Middle order batsman Dawid Malan staked his place in the team with his maiden test century at the WACA, backing up his 140 with a half-century in the second innings.
Cook, by comparison, contributed only 21 runs in his two innings at the WACA.
A fine servant of English cricket with over 11,000 test runs, Cook will be 33 when he lines up for the Melbourne test on Boxing Day.
After 150 tests, Bayliss said, he would know the right time to step down.  Agencies

Family Budget Unit to be established
A Family Budget Unit to review overall supply of essential goods at an affordable price to households would be established, according to a proposal put forward by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to Cabinet this week.
As the Cost of Living soars due to the food supply in the country being affected by extreme weather conditions, the Prime Minister noted that serious measures need to be taken to control the situation.
Measures will also be taken to provide additional support to people who have been affected by the drought and floods. A Coordinating Committee chaired by Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media will also be formed to affirm the success of implementing decisions taken by Subcommittee on Cost of Living.
They would together implement a programme to distribute a relief pack which includes rice, dhal, sugar, sprats, onion, potatoes and canned fish through supermarkets, Sathosa and other shops.
Institutions which participate in the programme will be provided a 50 percent reimbursement in their income tax with relief provided on the electricity bill.
Given that the coconut shortage brought about by the drought had also led to soaring prices, the Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs has been put in charge of expediting the import of coconut kernel.
The government would also seek Australian assistance in implementing a method of quarantine during coconut importation so that it would not affect local cultivations.
Cabinet also approved the proposal to Pay the difference between the compensation paid by National Insurance Trust Fund and assessed damage through District Secretaries before December 31, 2017. Compensation will also be paid to families whose cultivation had been damaged for several seasons in the Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and Vanni Districts.

## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, December 21, 2017 - 01:00
THE FINANCE COMMISSION AND ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 2018
Devolution of power was introduced to Sri Lanka by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution establishing Provincial Councils with the powers granted under the Devolved list (Ninth Schedule List II) and the National Government with the powers granted under the Restricted list (Ninth Schedule List I) and further introducing a Concurrent list (Ninth Schedule List III) that has to be shared by the National and Provincial administrations.
Same amendment to the constitution has established the Finance Commission under 154 R as follows.
154 R 01:
There shall be a Finance Commission consisting of -
(a) the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka;
(b) the Secretary to the Treasury; and
(c) three other members to represent the three major communities each of whom shall be a person who has distinguished himself, or held high office, in the field of finance, law, administration, business or learning.
(Accordingly the current Commission Members are (Udithe H Palihakara  Chairman, Indrajit Coomaraswamy  Ex-officio member and the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. R H S Samaratunga  Ex-officio member and the Secretary to the Treasury, V Kanagasabapathy  Member, H M Zafrullah  Member)
154 R 03:
The Government shall, on the recommendation of and in consultation with, the Commission, allocate from the Annual Budget, such funds as are adequate for the purpose of meeting the needs of the Provinces.
154 R 04:
It shall be the duty of the Commission to make recommendations to the President as to -
(a) the principles on which such funds are granted annually by the Government for the use of Provinces, should be apportioned between various Provinces; and,
(b) any other matter referred to the Commission by the President relating to Provincial finance
154 R 07:
The President shall cause every recommendation made by the Finance Commission under this Article to be laid before the Parliament, and shall notify Parliament as to the action taken thereon.
Though the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has included the Finance Commission in the independent commission list (Section 41B (6) still the mandate of the Finance Commission is derived from the 13th Amendment.
Accordingly, Recommendations of the Finance Commission for 2018 was submitted to the President and the President has laid the recommendation before the Parliament, after obtaining approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Recommendation for 2018 consists of the following Chapters.
1. Introduction
2. Mandate of the Finance Commission
3. Government Grants to the Provinces
4. Assessment of Provincial Needs
4.1 Assessment of Capital Needs
4.2 Assessment of Recurrent Needs
4.3 Capital and Recurrent Needs submitted by the Provinces for 2018
4.4 Apportionment of Provincial Capital Funds
4.5 Apportionment of Provincial Recurrent Funds.
5. Provincial Revenue
5.1 Transfer of Government Revenue
5.2 Revenue Collected from Devolved Sources
5.3 Revenue Forecast for 2018
5.3.1 Transfer of Government Revenue
5.3.2 Targets for Devolved Revenue Sources - 2018
6. Policy Recommendations
The full report of the recommendation is available in the Finance Commission web site fincom.gov.lk
The recommended policies coming under chapter 6 are as follows:
l To achieve Balanced Regional Development in the country, funds distribution among the provinces based on a rational methodology will not be effective if a meagre proportion of the National Budget is only spent through provincial councils. Therefore, it is recommended that the National Ministries should consider the proportions recommended by the Finance Commission in distributing their allocations among the provinces.
l It is recommended that funds disbursed for the development sectors coming under the devolved subjects should be channeled through the provincial councils. It is further recommended that in the event of implementation of projects identified under devolved subjects by the Line Ministries should also be carried out through the Provincial Councils. This would minimize duplications of funds and overlapping of activities, thereby promoting effective utilization of funds and maintaining transparency and accountability of investments.
l In the policy making process for balanced regional development, lack of data and information related to public fund allocation and investment among regions are observed, due to poor inter-governmental fiscal relations and lack of coordination. Absence of common framework in the national planning system is also identified as a main issue that affects effective decision making process. Therefore, the establishment of a common framework for national and sub-national planning system without undermining the concept of devolution is recommended. Further, this can be supported by a national level Management Information System (MIS) coordinated by the Department of Project Monitoring and Management which caters for national and sub-national level information requirements for planning and monitoring.
l Provincial Councils play a major role in regional development in line with national policies and priorities, with the available resources at provincial level as well as funds channeled through the national ministries. Hence, it is observed that the recurrent expenditure of Provincial Councils cover the cost of human resource component of the development activities not only for the Provincial Councils but also for the National Ministries. Accordingly, it is recommended that high priority should be given for the enhancement of human resources in the Provincial Councils. This will enhance the identification of real needs, planning, implementation, and monitoring, evaluating and effective management of development programmes.
l Currently, only business entities with quarterly income exceeding Rs 3mn. are subject to NBT, which is collected at the National Level, while businesses having less than Rs. 3mn. quarterly income are exempt from NBT. Hence, it is recommended that Provincial Councils should be allowed to collect taxes from business entities with quarterly income up to Rs 3mn. Further, it is recommended to enhance provincial revenue through untapped revenue sources such as private schools/tutories/local and foreign collages of higher education, health service providers, and professional service providers.
l It is recommended that 25%-50% of the beneficiary contribution to be made compulsory for any direct grant provided under national and provincial development programmes to ensure commitment of the beneficiary and sustainability of such investments.
l It is recommended that there should be regularization and proper monitoring of private schools and private institutions of higher education in order to ensure quality education.
l It is recommended that the state education should guide students for enhancing skills development.
l It is recommended to introduce an attractive provincial incentive package for private investors who are willing to invest in rural lagging/backward regions. The proposed preferential incentive package should be characterized by interest subsidies, tax holidays, reduced tax rates, concessionary loan schemes and easy collaterals. This will also be helpful to focus public investments on social infrastructure projects which are needed for uplifting the day-to-day life of ordinary people.
l It is recommended to link infrastructure facilities with anchor projects with the provincial growth centres based on industrial activities. Considering the urgent need of linking the provincial growth centres with national level mega projects, special budgetary allocations are suggested to be provided for improving infrastructure by way of facilitating private investments at regional level.

The first ever dry-zone botanic gardens in Sri Lanka at Mirijjawila in Hambantota have gained wide popularity among environmentalists, botanists, sightseers, school children, teachers, scholars, and tourists from various countries around the globe. The construction work of the dry-zone botanic garden commenced on 20th July 2006.
This was the first time a botanic garden was set up in Sri Lanka after 130 years, the former Director General of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Cyril Wijesundera, said. A sum of Rs. 500 million was allocated for the development of the gardens, which is in extent of 300 acres. The first stage of the construction work came to a climax on 14th November 2013 and was opened for visitors. About eighty percent of the construction work of the second stage has been completed and the construction work will come to a climax in 2020.
The flower cultivation has become a money-spinner for growers and members of the flower-growers association formed by the botanic gardens. The dry-zone botanic gardens consist of plants, trees and herbal plants that are grown in the dry zone, a butterfly garden, a plant nursery, a student park, a plant conservation unit, a flower garden, and ornamental bushes. Sumith Ekanayaka, the officer in charge of the dry-zone botanic gardens, said that the director general of the Peradeniya Botanic Gardens, K.N.Yapa, is managing the dry zone botanic gardens under the guidance of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife.
Sumith Ekanayaka said that there are three botanic gardens in Sri Lanka that are the creations of Englishmen, and that the dry-zone botanic gardens at Hambantota are the only ones set up by locals using local technology and expertise. The construction work of these botanic gardens commenced under the guidance of former Director General Wijesundera, who retired from the post some time ago.

Hail the nail!
Christmas is the best time of year to enjoy the festivities. There are numbleless ways to show off your personal style and creativity for Christmas. Not only are your choices in clothes essential to keep you looking ready for holiday, but your nails can become a lovely highlight for the season.
Like a great new haircut or a terrific skin regimen, healthy, well-manicured nails are an integral part of a neat, pulled-together appearance - one that can work as an asset in both the social and the business world.
Say yes to nail care this season
Everyone benefits from a manicure or pedicure treatment. It is deeply relaxing, can give confidence to the receiver about their appearance and helps maintain healthy hands, feet and nails. The benefits of a professional manicure and pedicure include much more than just the appearance of your hands and feet.
Having great looking nails is a good reason alone to have a regular manicure or pedicure. Regular manicure and pedicure treatments will help to prevent and eradicate common conditions such as Ingrown Toe Nails, Fungal Nails, Brittle Nails, Bitten Nails and even the incorrect use/removal of artificial nails.
Most treatments will include exfoliating the skin to remove dead cells, smoothing the surface and stimulating regeneration. Calluses and dead skin are removed from the feet, which not only makes your feet look much better  it makes them feel much better too. Get into the mood of the festive holidays by applying pretty nail polish colours that would suit this happy season.
Benefits of manicures
A manicure will clean and shape your nails and treat your cuticles, which is vital for keeping your nails healthy and strong. During a manicure your hands will be exfoliated to remove dead skin cells and to improve circulation and stimulate blood flow. A manicure generally but not always includes painting the nails. Not only will having a manicure make your nails and hands look good, it is also very relaxing and will promote healthy nails.
Traditional colours of the season
Celebrate Christmas by painting your nails red and green, which are traditional Christmas colours found throughout the holiday season. Either keep them a solid green or red for a classy look, or paint additional holiday images onto them, such as Christmas trees, reindeer or even garlands. You can even stripe your nails with red and white to create a bold and unique candy cane design.

You might ignore your nails all year long; but your nails definitely deserve an extra attention during the festive season. Pamper them to the core with these nail care tips.
<U+27BC> To get party-ready nails, moisturising products are the first things people look for. Apply a rich layer of hand cream nightly to prevent hang nails and peeling cuticles.

<U+27BC> To finish your look, introduce colour with your nail art. When well taken care of, nails can shine like accessories. Its great to visit a nail technician and get professional care, although the budget-conscious can always use a good nail buffer to shape nails.

<U+27BC> Your nails and cuticles are delicate and need lots of care. To keep them in ship shape, apply a gentle nail oil to the area and then lightly push back your cuticles with a washcloth. This will remove the need for cutting the cuticles and repair dry, jagged edges allowing your nails to look good even when theyre naked. Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana

Hambantota curd industry in crisis
The curd industry in Hambantota district is facing a crisis due to an array of reasons, including prolonged drought, lack of fodder and water, lack of grazing lands for buffaloes and cattle, theft of buffaloes and cattle, trap guns laid to hunt wild beasts by unruly elements and transportation of these animals to distant towns by cattle thieves, and lack of high breed cattle and buffalo. All these factors have contributed greatly toward the destruction of the traditional curd industry.
Wildlife officials say that stray cattle enter the national parks and consume fodder meant for wild beasts. Meanwhile, representatives from the farming community complain that stray cattle destroy their paddy cultivations and home gardens.
Cattle and buffalo herd owners say that complaints lodged with certain relevant authorities regarding the issue remain unattended because paddy field owners are mightier than the cattle and buffalo herd owners.
The lands were allocated several years ago for grazing but are now being converted to farming lands with the blessings of certain politicians. During periods of drought such as the present, finding fodder for these animals has posed a burning problem, the cattle owners say. Further, they claim that the price of poonac given to cattle to increase their milk production has increased sixfold.
They have many other grievances but feel there is no one willing to adopt remedial measures for them.

Hambantota fisherfolk and manufacturers left high and dry
Dried fish manufacturers in the Hambantota district have been left high and dry as a result of dried fish being imported in large quantities. Such manufacturers in Kudawella and Mawella who engage in this work said that it is their only means of keeping their home fires burning, and that without it they are unable to meet the expenses of their families.
They said that women widowed as a result of the tidal wave tsunami in 2004, who engage in the dried fish industry as a means of self-employment, are most affected as a result of these imports.
Another issue facing the fishery industry in Hambantota is the inconvenience caused to fisherfolk due to a portion of land in the harbor being brought under vegetable cultivation by harbour officials.
This area of the fisheries harbor, used by the fisherfolk to anchor their fishing crafts and keep their fishing gear, has been brought under vegetable cultivation after the construction of a fence.
The fisher folk said that it was in this area that foundation stones were laid some time ago for the setting up of an iceplant. They have brought this matter to the notice of the State Minister of Fisheries, Dilip Vedaarachchi.

Health Minister trying to establish power: GMOA
The Health Minister is trying his best to establish his power within the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) by appointing persons who can be controlled.
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has informed the SLMC Registrar in writing to take all steps to hold the SLMC election in a free and fair manner, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA will take legal action against the SLMC authorities for tarnishing the image of the GMOA and for insulting it by making a complaint to the police against it.
Meanwhile, the SLMC sources said no one is influencing the SLMC election and it will be held in a free and fair manner.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the committee appointed by the President to solve the SAITM issue had completely ignored the GMOA's proposals and opinion on the issue and had taken decisions to fulfill the requirements of the SAITM owner.
Therefore, the GMOA will not take part in any meeting of the committee hereafter. A letter is to be sent to President Maithripala Sirisena soon in connection with the issue, he added.

High Courts to hear cases daily
Cabinet has decided to make it compulsory to hear all cases in the High Courts on a daily basis.
Justice Minister, Thalatha Athukorala has proposed that amending Section 263 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 to make this provision mandatory, would be the best method to resolve the massive backlog of cases in the High Courts.
At present, the section only states that cases with a jury or without a jury be held every day as far as practical. This lax has resulted in many postponements.

HIV-positive patients number 2,600 on island
Recent informal surveys conducted by health authorities have indicated that there are nearly 45,000 female prostitutes within Sri Lanka who provide services to 300,000 males daily, said Dr. H.A.C.W. Hathurusinghe, specialist doctor of the AIDS control unit of the Kurunegala General Hospital. He gave this statement at a meeting held at the Kurunegala YMBA Hall recently to educate the Kurunegala District school community on the gravity of and preventive measures for incurable diseases like AIDS.
He also said that about 2,600 HIV-positive patients have been identified in the island by now. The North Western Province was earlier reported to contain the highest number of HIV-positive patients, but that statistic is now vanishing gradually due to educational programmes conducted by the Health Ministry continuously to educate the public on the disease over the past few years. The target of the government is to wipe out AIDS from Sri Lanka by the year 2025, and measures are now being successfully implemented countrywide to achieve that target.
About 8,500 health personnel are currently deployed countrywide to educate young people, as those between 15-24 years of age are the most AIDS-affected group within the country, Dr. Hathurusinghe added. Mr. Lakshman Wedaruwa, NWP-Health Minister, Mr. Gamini Ilangaratne, Kurunegala District Secretary, and provincial journalists of the Kurunegala District, school principals, teachers and senior students of school of the Kurunegala District participated in the event.

## Section: Sports

We have deployed one of the best possible head coaches  SLC president:
Its no pressure for me but its all opportunities says Hathurusingha
Former Sri Lanka cricketer and one time coach Chandika Hathurusingha officially took over as head coach of the national cricket team and announced that the role he has been asked to perform was a challenging one but one he was glad to accept.
There is a lot of expectations but there is no pressure for me its all opportunities, said Hathurusingha at his inaugural press conference arranged by Sri Lanka Cricket at their headquarters at Maitland Place yesterday.
Looking at our team from the outside I thought its a great opportunity for me to come here and maximise the potential that is there. I am looking forward to that challenge and I take the challenge as an opportunity to take the team forward.
Its a very proud moment for me and a great opportunity to come back and serve my country as head coach. I think the time is right for me to take on that role, he said.
Six years ago Hathurusingha was being groomed for this position when he was serving as shadow coach to the teams then head coach Trevor Bayliss, but unfortunately the interim committee that was in place at the time under former Sri Lanka cricketer DS de Silva chucked him out on some flimsy evidence of disobeying orders.
This atrocious decision proved to be a blessing in disguise for Hathurusingha who took off with his family to Australia where he went onto make a name for himself as a top class cricket coach being appointed assistant coach of the New South Wales side and also the Australian A team. His credentials soared to such a level that when he applied for the head coachs post, Bangladesh accepted him with open arms. Hathurusingha became the most successful coach in Bangladeshs cricket history during his three-year stint with them taking them to heights the national team had never attained before. Under his guidance Bangladesh recorded 20 ODI wins in 37 matches, 5 wins in 17 Tests (8 losses) and 9 wins in 25 T20Is (11 losses). At the same time he came to be regarded as one of the top notch coaches going around in world cricket today.
WORLD CLASS COACH
To obtain the services of such a qualified person to serve the Sri Lanka team, Sri Lanka Cricket should be greatly privileged.
We have deployed the best possible head coach in the world now its upto the team to show results, said Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala.
We looked at who should be the ideal coach. We looked at the current game and found it was highly technical as well as the coaches are working based on scientific evidence and they are all using soft logic more on technology than technical assistance, explained Sumathipala.
At the end of the day they come down to scientific evidence. In that context we found that Hathuru is among the top world class coaches. He is always one person who believes in deployment of technology and using technology for the best interest of the national team.
We are happy to have contracted with a world class coach for the national team. Hathuru is a matured coach and highly qualified to tackle the kind of players we have. More than anything he is a Sri Lankan and you cant get anyone better than that. He can speak the language of the players which is another big advantage. He is also a world class player as well, a coach and manager. Its all these attributes that is strength for us to make the maximum use of him, he said.
Speaking further Sumathipala said that when SLC informed the Bangladesh Cricket Board that they would like to engage Hathurusingha as their head coach and although the BCB was not happy with the decision they however agreed to release him in good faith and wished us luck.
According to the SLC president Hathurusingha will be responsible to the SLC and as head coach he will have his own technical team and support staff that will be under his purview.
The head coach will be responsible for their entire work. He will also play a big role in the development programs of Sri Lanka cricket and also work with the high performance centre etc, said Sumathipala.
As our current constitution does not provide as per the Sports Law a coach being engaged as a selector we have discussed it with the Sports Minister. He has given us a solution to incorporate him on tours together with our cricket manager and captain, he said.
The SLC president also took the opportunity to thank Nick Pothas who had been looking after the team over the last few months as interim coach. He had a tough task especially as India is the worlds number one Test team. So in such a difficult situation, I thank Mr. Pothas who did a tough job as the interim coach.
CRICKET IS SECOND RELIGION
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who was also present at the media conference said that the entire Sri Lankan community has been waiting for this moment.
The reason for that is cricket is like a second religion. No matter what other sport we play if we lose at cricket it becomes a major talking point in the country, said the Minister. As Sports Minister I have also faced a lot of questions from the public about the poor performances of the team. Losing matches is not a downfall as some make it out to be. I am very happy to note that Sri Lanka Cricket and its president has taken a good decision in appointing Hathurusingha as head coach. I wish Hathurusingha well and hope that he can restore the expectations of the countrys numerous cricket fans by putting the team on a winning trend.
Hathurusinghas first assignment with the national team will be against the team he last coached Bangladesh when Sri Lanka tours there next month for a tri-nation series that also involves Zimbabwe, a series of two Tests and two T20 internationals.
Its a challenge. I know their strengths and weaknesses and likewise they know how I think of the game. Its a good opportunity as coach to have such a challenge ahead of you, said Hathurusingha.

JO uttering falsehood - Devapriya
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya categorically denied that he had a deal with the Elections Commissioner to cancel the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) nomination list for Maharagama.
One cannot influence the Elections Commission headed by the Commissioner, which is an independent institute, Devapriya said.
He said the list was rejected because they had not nominated enough women as candidates. There should have been four women candidates, but there were only three candidates, he said.
In fact, it was the UNP which highlighted that there was an error in the list earlier. It is the Election Commissioner who has the power to deal on all matters pertaining to the election including any rejection or cancellation of nominations.
Since the SLPP cannot contest the upcoming local government election, the victory for the SLFP is certain. Thereby, both UNP and JO have started a mud-slinging campaign against me. The entire Maharagama city experienced development after I became the Western Province Chief Minister. Maharagama people know it very well. Since I am already a Chief Minister, if the
SLFP will won the Maharagama seat, the previous development process can be continued with no disruption, he added.

New bribery act next year
The draft new Bribery Act will be introduced in the next two months, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director General, Sarath Jayamanna PC said.
He said that the present Bribery or Corruption Act is obsolete and some loopholes have been identified since it has been enacted in 1994. Considering these shortcomings, there is a need to introduce a new Bribery or Corruption Act to create a just society.
Launching the new CIABOC website yesterday, Jayamanna said that the draft, which is being prepared, will be open for public discussion.
Positive, fruitful suggestions and public views are encouraged and accepted, he said.
Once the draft is passed in Parliament, it will be the new Bribery or Corruption Act, probably from next year. Some new clauses will be added to the new draft such as the definition of entity and person. Bribes relating to private entities will also be included with the new draft. So far no foreign institutions are enlisted to the Bribery or Corruption Act, but these international entities will be included in the new draft, Jayamanna said.
In line with the web launch, the gathering drew attention on establishing a national action plan to combat corruption in Sri Lanka.
He added that people are facilitated with the new website to lodge their complaints easily. The website (www.ciaboc.gov.lk ) provides all necessary details to lodge a complaint or to get information, he said.
Complaints can be lodged through eight ways such as phoning, emailing, faxing, lodging a complaint with the website etc.
Speaking on the progress of the CIABOC Jayamanna said that 73 cases relating to bribery or corruption have been filed in courts so far this year.
However, the CIABOC has received 2,590 cases up to December 15, from January 1 this year. Of the total number (2,590) CIABOC has decided to investigate on 1,549 cases.
CIABOC Commissioner Neville Guruge said CIABOC will set up sub offices in Kandy Anuradhapura and Matara in future.

## Title: No end to road digging

No end to road digging
Temporary signs mark roads under construction. They are being dug up for huge pipelines to be buried along the road, triggering traffic jams which have become common place in and around Colombo.
Digging up of roads has become a grave menace for the public and commuters, but the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) claimed that the project was initiated with the aim of providing a better water supply facility for the city.
There are two ongoing projects under Water Board they are; the Colombo Water Supply Service Improvement Project (under greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Programme) and the Town East Colombo Package which includes four projects (transmission and distribution of water).
Water Board Chairman K.A Ansar explained that the water distribution pipe network was over 100 years old and it was not capable enough to provide clean pipe borne water to a rising population.
"The project will improve the efficiency and financial sustainability of water services in Colombo. This includes rehabilitating the city's water supply network and reducing the amount of water that is leaked or distributed without payment", he said.
The Colombo Water Supply Service Improvement Project was being funded by the Asian Development Bank to improve water and wastewater facilities in Colombo.
Ansar perceived this project as a solution to the prevailing issues pertaining to distribution of water in Colombo. The project is expected to be completed as planned in three years' time.
"The implementation of the project is currently underway in the city of Colombo, and we earnestly request from the general public for their corporation during this period, and to bear the temporary inconveniences that may be caused in these areas", he said.
Road digging continues
These assurances however do not make the situation easier for many on the roads daily.
"The roads in Colombo have no vacation", said R. Dayasiri, a three wheel driver from Colombo.
"I know that Colombo is the commercial city but look around, it's hard to find a straight road that has not been dug by either the CMC or the Water Board", he said.
He also noted that some construction work takes took much longer than expected to complete.
To this Ansar quipped that they were not going to keep digging the same place for three years though the whole project was expected to finish in three years.
He noted that they had to face many practical issues while implementing these projects.
"We have to get permission from the police and then consult the Road Development Authority (RDA). The police having checked the traffic patterns in the area will give permission to do the work for limited hours in a day", he said.
Ansar explained that the best example of their problems was the replacing of a big portion of pipe near the Rajagiriya overhead bridge.
"According to the scheduled plan, we needed 18 hours to complete the work, to replace the pipe and connect it to the by roads. But the police were able to give us only two hours per day considering peak traffic hours. It was one of the major reasons for the delay", he said.
We need to do this because 45 percent of the water is wasted due to leakage and this needs to be addressed immediately, he said.
"Through the above projects we will be able to bring it down to 18 percent", he added.
He further said that people complain because they are not aware of the projects carried out by the Water Board and added that it is for their own well-being.
Ansar assured that a 24 hour water supply could be provided once the project was complete.
In the meantime, Ansar said that Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Road Development Authority (RDA) were also carrying out independent projects.
The Daily News however learnt that major projects in Colombo at present were being carried out by the Water Board.
State of the roads after construction
The roads that are dug up to lay pipelines and re-laid by contractors appointed by the Water Board are supervised by Road Development Authority (RDA).
"In areas where larger pipelines are laid, it will be the responsibility of the Water Board to re - lay the road and RDA would ensure that it's up to standard", said Ansar.
However, the public pointed out that the city was getting swamped with construction every other day. They raised concerns over bad roads and the traffic problems faced by commuters everyday due to construction work.
Apart from the increase in dust pollution due to the construction work, several commuters complained about the poor state of roads. Newly constructed roads at times had made man-holes causing severe hazards to those driving on them.
Though the traffic police officials have surveyed the areas to be dug in order to minimize traffic problems, Ansar assured that digging would not be carried out simultaneously everywhere.
Ansar claimed that the payment incurred by RDA for supervision was very high.
RDA Project Director, K. Amaraweera agreed that they charged the Water Board for excavating the pipes but refused to comment on the charges made.
"We usually give them an estimation to reinstate the road. When we redo damaged roads, we make sure that they are to the same standards", he said.
Need for service corridors
Sri Lanka however is yet to implement new techniques and technologies in road constructions in order to minimise the damages caused to the roads.
Ansar said that they used micro tunnel methods to find the pipelines without digging the road and Amaraweera assured that they took necessary precautions when the work was being carried out.
"Micro tunnelling is very effective instead of digging a wide section. We only need to dig one inch and lay the pipe. But it's very effective for fiber optic lines and domestic pipe lines", he said.
In the meantime, Ansar complained that most old drawings of Colombo and suburbs were not available and not well maintained, therefore it was hard for them to find where the pipelines had been laid.
"All institutions have that problem where the older drawings were not maintained properly. Since 1983 there have been initiatives to solve pipelines issue but achievement was comparatively less", he said.
Ansar pointed out that Water Board would lay pipes this year and the following year but either the CEB or RDA would have to dig the roads once again to carry out their projects.
"When we formulate a project and receive funds, RDA or CEB might not have funds so we cannot carry out their plans simultaneously", he said.According to Ansar, suggestions to construct service corridors along with new roads have been made.
He said that building service corridors was very expensive and costly and added that they do not have the necessary funds available at the moment."It would be great if the government could provide funds to build service corridors", he said.
Amaraweera also said that to avoid frequent damage to optical fibre cables during construction and widening of roads, the RDA had proposed a utility conduit or duct (service corridors) be made part of the projects.
"The Chairman said that he would see the possibilities of solving the issues related to expense. But there are a few budgetary problems and that need to be sorted out first", he said.
Officials assured that if sufficient space was left on either side of the roads to allow pipelines to be laid or for other projects to be carried out, the government and the public need not undergo the present problems time and time again.
Inconvenience caused to the public
M. Kumarage a lawyer from Battaramulla complained that he had resigned himself to more traffic jams and bumpy roads in Colombo.
Kumarage observed that the problem was not just digging up a road for one project but continuously doing so every time a new project comes along under various departments.
For K.Siriwardane, a shop owner from Slave Island, every month there seems to be some construction work going on, obstructing vehicles and people.
I don't really know who is doing the project now. Because the RDA, Water board and CEB take turns to dig these roads. There are no big shops on this way, and the workers often obstruct the entrance to the shops, he said.
The construction work in Slave Island has been going on for over two months, according to P. M Wasana who lives down one of the lanes there.
The officials said that they are replacing the pipe lines. I once inquired of them when the project was due to end but they were not aware. They said it might take a bit longer than the scheduled period, she said.
She further said vehicle jams in the area had led to many residents themselves not being able to move around freely. G.H Navanithan, a three wheel driver complained that laying of carpet on roads at present was not up to previous standards. After few months, there are potholes in the previously dug up areas. Thats the state of several roads within Colombo, he said.
A disappointed Navanithan said his customers often complained about the state of the roads because they felt it more on a tuk tuk, This is not like travelling in a hybrid car, he added.
This construction project has been a huge nuisance for Amanda who lives on 5th lane, Colpetty.
When I moved into this apartment five months ago, I was told that the construction was almost complete and that it should be done within a few weeks. Five months later, yes, the giant hole preventing vehicles from parking in front of our house is gone, but nightly, starting around 8 pm, drilling begins, she said.
She said their property has been damaged due to construction with workers parking large machines on our front lawn, damaging tiles.
Random road closures clog up traffic, drilling until past midnight disrupts sleep, the air is constantly polluted with dust, and the presence of construction workers  sometimes just milling about rather than actually doing work  makes the otherwise safe road not secure for women to walk down in the evenings due to the stares and catcalls, she explained.
According to Amanda, the constructors do not garner much support from this neighborhood.
Project plan to last 50 years
Zahrah Imtiaz
Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.K Anura speaking to the Daily News about the ongoing and future plans for the city of Colombo said that innovative and sustainable urban plans have been formulated.
Excerpts follow:
Q. The main topic at the recently concluded 30th City Net Congress was how cities can develop sustainably in future. Does Colombo have such a plan
A. When you take Colombo city, it is the heart of Sri Lanka. And this is not a city that can only be managed by the Municipal Council and its officials. We have a population of 650,000 living in Colombo, every day we have another 600,000 travelling into Colombo from outside. So we have to supply essential services to a large population.
If we make development plans centred just around Colombo, it will be unsuccessful. Its boundaries are small but when developing it we have to take into account its surrounding areas, from which people come from.We are an implementing agency where policy decisions are largely taken within the national policy framework.
There is no point in making roads within Colombo without limiting the number of vehicles which come into the city, so it has to go beyond Colombo. To reduce the congestion in the Colombo Railway, we cannot just increase the rail network inside, it has to start from outside. We only have powers within the Colombo Municipal limit. And thus to build our reach beyond its borders, we have the Megapolis Ministry.
When you take sustainable development, all this has been taken into account to develop a comprehensive plan to develop Colombo with all outside factors taken into account.
Q. Cities around the world have taken the initiative and developed home grown strategies to overcome local issues. Their main source of success stems from them asking the people themselves what they want, a form of participatory governance. Do you not think such programmes would be suitable for us also
A. You are asking about developing the essential services within Colombo City. We seek the assistance of the people who live in it for that. Though Colombo is seen as a very beautiful city, around 60 percent live in this city without basic services. So together with the Ministry of Megapolis, we are working to provide them with the basic facilities. In addition we are undertaking the development plans of Colombo city in a very transparent manner. You would see that Colombo gets easily flooded even for the slightest of rains, and we have sewerage problems, the main reason is the outdated sewer network below the city. This is the only city in the country to have an underground sewer and drainage network. Now we are finding solutions to this problem which will last us for the next 50 years, through the ADB funded project, JICA and other agencies, we are at this moment working on a project to develop a storm water drain system.
At present we release raw sewage into the sea. But we are now constructing our sewer treatment plants and in the next two to three years, all waste water will be treated before released to the sea.
Q. Where is this
A. We have planned to build one for the Wellawatte, Bambalapitiya area and another in Mattakkuliya.Then another in Madampitiya.
The biggest problem the city has is storm water and waste water, so we have made comprehensive plans to deal with these two issues.
This is one of the biggest projects in Colombos recent history to be undertaken. Today if you see, most roads around Colombo have been dug up. Over 510 km are dug up so that for the next 50 years water, electricity, and telecommunication facilities, being built. Colombo is on its way for a great transformation and we will only need to break these roads again in another 50 years or so, and hopefully by that time they would have discovered technology which will not need us to dig up roads to add new infrastructure.

OPPO launches TVC F5 to capture the real you
OPPO the global smartphone brand recently launched the OPPO F5 capture the real you selfie camera phone. To reach out to its customers, OPPO had unveiled a beautifully conceptualized TVC with its New Brand Ambassador Sidharth Malhotra alongside Deepika Padukone.
The commercial depicts a romantic encounter of two strangers in a charming old city with cobble-stoned ally ways, castles, church towers and bridges, where people seem to enjoy the beautiful scenery and the romantic ambience.
OPPOs focus has mostly been on beautiful selfies. Though everyone wants to capture good selfies, they also want the selfie to be beautiful as well as real without be seen too airbrushed. OPPO F5 is positioned as a phone that captures ones real beauty, tagged as capture the real you. The old-world charm of beautiful Prague is captured by the new TVC and this serves as the first instance where OPPO features Europe in a television commercial. The TVC is aimed at the young audience who love to use their phones on the go.
Prague is a romantic old city, which has a lot of history. People there are kind and warm. It seems like that there are a lot of romantic stories taking place there. Since Prague was full of blue sky, we added more flowers in the background of the Historic Centre of the city where the commercial was shot in order to make the whole shot more vivid and youthful. a spokesperson for OPPO commented.
Initial response to the commercial indicate that the core target audience - the youth has been touched by the storyline and the mischief between Sidharth and Deepika.
The feedback for the TVC so far is highly impressive with 20 million views on YouTube and 14 million views on Facebook. It seems like people like both the romantic skew in this story and also the music in the TVC. When the sculpture shot was being filmed, the sculpture started moving suddenly without following the actual script. He gave a rose to Deepika which really startled her and touched her at the same time. At that moment, the whole cast improvised. That shot was really good the spokesperson for OPPO added.
The agency behind the TVC is MT Media based in Shanghai with Noe, a young French director with great commercials for Dior and Vogue under his belt.

Peace and  Goodwill  until you get the bill
Close your eyes and imagine a totally make-believe world where families just like yours and mine have a long shopping list in their handbags and pockets. But in this fantasy planet, they spend the whole year without buying a single thing they want. Rather than spread their purchases evenly, they wait until the last few days of the year (like right now) to do all their shopping. Come December, they gather towers and towers of goods from overcrowded shopping malls, exhibition halls, school playgrounds and parks converted into markets. Half of the purchases are gifted to friends and family in a shower of love, in spite of the fact that a great deal of the recipients dislike their presents, anyway. It doesn't work out much better for the stores, who encourage this spending binge by slashing prices and heavy advertising campaigns. And this goes on, year after year as faithfully as the sun rises in the mornings. Ever wondered what civilized planet in the whole wide universe would go through this parade of excessive behavior with such devotion
Ours, of course! So, Merry Christmas!
Is that it One brief paragraph and my last article for this year comes to an end Of course not! As the "totally make-believe" story above tried to show, there is a lot about year-end shopping that never gets the attention it deserves .
Especially so, in the light of the saying, When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping , which in the eyes of psychologists is a phrase filled with immense wisdom.
Retail therapy 
For, according to a survey conducted by TNS Global, more than half the shoppers seen in any given shopping mall on any ordinary day, admit to engaging in retail therapy the act of shopping and spending to improve ones mood. This is in zinc with a previous study, published in the Journal of Psychology and Marketing, that reveals 62% of shoppers purchase something to cheer themselves up, while another 28% purchase goods as a form of celebration.
The concept of retail therapy, however is actually an old idea about the way consumers make buying decisions, albeit with a "brand" name. Scientists say when you shop, your brain weighs the positive consequences  the benefit you will get from consuming  against the negative, or the pain you feel from the financial cost, until one wins out.
There are two parts of your brain involved in this process. The first, the nucleus accumbent, predicts pleasure, while the other, the insula, is involved in the anticipation of pain. It should also be noted that the brain's positive reward center is also closely related to dopamine, the feel-good neurotransmitter, which is released when you anticipate a positive outcome, in this instance the pleasure of possessing something through the act of buying it.
Gift-giving
When it comes to buying gifts for others though, Joel Waldfogel, an economics professor at Yale says, "I find that holiday gift giving destroys between one-third and one-tenth of the value of gifts. What he says might be true. After all, why should you shop for me, when I certainly know what I want better than you do Prof. Waldfogel, believes a lot of gift-giving occurs between people who dont know each other and that not all gifts are created equal. He made his estimates by surveying Yale students about how much they valued the gifts they got at the holidays, compared with those gifts actual purchase prices. Friends and significant others were pretty good at giving gifts the recipients actually liked; it was aunts, uncles and grandparents who bought the least-loved items.
Thankfully not everyone thinks this is right. Recently, members of the IGM Experts Panel at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business overwhelmingly defended gift-giving as an efficient way for people to show that they care about each other. David Autor of M.I.T. pointed to revealed preference: If people give and receive so many gifts, its presumably because it makes them happy. Alberto Alesina of Harvard said choosing a gift is a signal of intensity of search effort, which in other words mean its the thought that counts.
On a lighter note, to return to the concept of Christmas shopping, according to a new study published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, which looks at the therapeutic value of shopping and when it can work to improve your mood, everything depends on the emotional state you are in, before you embark on a shopping spree. If you are sad, a feeling often associated with a sense that large, outside forces are in control of your life, the act of buying can improve your mood by allowing you to make choices  where to shop, what to buy  and reassert some level of control over your life. Another study reveals that while shopping makes most people feel better, some admit that they have hidden their purchases from their significant other. Psychologists, however, advice that if you are buying something you truly want or need there is no need to feel guilty, especially if it is your hard earned money!
This could be why Bo Derek said, Whoever said money cant buy happiness simply didnt know where to go shopping.
This, theory though, will not always be hundred percent successful. If you start out angry, for instance, a feeling associated more with undue influence from other people than your own emotions, you are better off trying something else other than shopping for Christmas gifts.
So, it is best to keep in mind that even though Christmas shopping may help cure sadness it won't help with anger. You can shop all you want, but your boss is your boss.
Catch you next year, if my editor will let me continue to write after that last line.
Till then, enjoy the holiday season!
[emailprotected]


Here are five things that you can do to consume more mindfully this festive season:
Let others know what your expectations are. Do you want presents from everyone that you know, or do you just want something special from your family or partner Don't be afraid to tell those around you that you'd prefer a gift card or donation to charity (or nothing at all!) this festive season. If you explain why, they're more likely to respect your decision.
Make time, not rubbish. Instead of rushing around buying up boxes of chocolates and gifts for colleagues, neighbours and others in your social circle, consider giving the present of your presence. Making time to catch up with someone over a cup of coffee or tea is guaranteed to be a moment that they remember and appreciate long after the wrapping paper has been cleared away.
Give mindfully. Is there something that the person you are giving a present to really wants or needs For those about to embark on an overseas trip, some local currency from their intended destination (easily obtained from an exchange office) can be a thoughtful and enormously practical gift. Have a family member who is a history buff Tickets to a museum exhibition lets them know that you want them to go out and enjoy themselves!
Give moments, not things. When it comes to the special people in your life, by all means give them that piece of jewelery they've been thinking about all year, or that book they've been unable to track down. But if they don't really need or want a "thing", why not invest in something that they'll really appreciate Think a romantic dinner, a weekend getaway, or a voucher to dance classes what experience would remind them how much you love them

Peradeniya student hospitalised after ragging
A first year student of the Peradeniya University who had undergone severe ragging, was warded at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital by University Marshals officers yesterday.
The senior students involved in the ragging incident had taken the student to a private hospital to avoid an inquiry into the matter. The University Marshals officers who received this information had located the student and taken him to the Peradeniya hospital.
The first year student who is a resident of Diyathalawa, was returning to the university after the weekend, when three senior students had taken him to an abandoned area of the university and harassed him until he fell unconscious.
The senior students who had ragged the student had taken him to a private hospital in a three wheeler. They had pretended to be friends of the victim at the private hospital.
Peradeniya University authorities and the Peradeniya Police are investigating.

Pick N Go mobile App to revamp cab services
Pick N Go Mobile App, a taxi hailing application was unveiled at Waters Edge with a view to providing hassle free services to local passengers, easing Colombo's traffic congestion and providing employment opportunities for drivers.
Pick N Go app has fastest functioning capability over the existing mobile apps in the sphere.
The app that is integrated with latest software packages and backed by huge forging investment is available on the Android and Apple store for early adopters to try and experience the difference.
Pick N Go is also poised to contribute towards reducing fuel wastage in vehicles, reducing air pollution and noise pollution and providing a solution to parking problem in the metro.
The event was graced by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara who officially launched the Pick N Go website.
Pick N Go mobile app sheds light on an innovative concept as regards local cab services. It offers unique features first time in Sri Lanka such as multiple bookings, affordable prices, balance less cash payments and varied driver assistance features, said Pick N Go Private Limited managing director Sajith Wanigasuriya.
We believe our business plan will also help ease Colombo's traffic congestion. Our application is simple and user friendly. We offer a decent commission to all our cab drivers around the island and look forward to contribute to the country's economy via providing employment for drivers. Being a one hundred percent Sri Lankan company, Pick N Go is on a quest towards making money rotate within the country with its operations, he added.
Our operations are not confined to Colombo. Vehicle owners and drivers could join our fleet by operating from their homes to keep their living costs at bay.
Offering transportation for multiple people in a single vehicle who travel to their offices on a daily basis is another innovation in the offing, said Wanigasuriya.
Web based services are developing rapidly in other countries and Sri Lanka is now following suit. Sri Lankans are a breed of innovative people.
With necessary support they could grow from strength to strength. Using one vehicle for many people will solve the grave traffic problem in the metro. Pick N Go being an innovative cab service has it all, said Pradeep Jayawardene, reputed Formula One racing personality and a grandson of the late President J R Jayawardene.

President helped MR, son to re-enter politics- Devapriya
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday said it was President Maithripala Sirisena, a democratic leader who created the necessary environment for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son MP Namal Rajapaksa to re-enter politics after their defeat on January 8,2015.
However, they do not want to accept the fact that some of the problems faced by them were solved by the President.They think it is a matter of shame for them.
When the Rajapaksa family wants to get something done, they will not hesitate to directly call the President and seek his help, Devapriya alleged.
However, they are trying to show the people that the President had got together with the UNP to destroy the Rajapaksa family and the SLFP.But, the people have understood the dual policies of them,he said.
President Sirisena has categorically stated that he does not have any deal with the Prime Minster, but only an agreement for the betterment of the country. However, the truth is that those who have insulted him have deals with the Prime Minister.
President Sirisena wanted the two main parties to join for the countrys benefit. It was also the request wish of several genuine SLFPers in the Joint Opposition(JO). During the final discussion between the SLFP and SLPJP, Minister Susil Premajayantha had made all arrangements to register the SLPJP and jointly contest under the Chair symbol which was one of the SLPJPs conditions. But, they did not agree to that later, he said.
The JO is beset with many problems. Many minority parties have been divided into various groups and they are fighting each other. But, they are reluctant to admit this to the public, he added.

President to take up SriLakan issue at next NEC meeting
President Maithripala Sirisena is to take up the subject of SriLankan Airlines at the next meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC).
The decision comes in the wake of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratungas joint Cabinet Paper last month to establish a budget airline working closely with the Malaysian Air Asia group,said Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne yesterday.
Minister Dr.Senaratne having berated the Chairman and CEO of SriLankan Airlines at the weekly Cabinet media briefing stated that the government continued to pump in finances to the airline only in the hope that the management could turn things around.
These losses however were started when the previous regime kicked out Emirates and handed the airline over to the brother-in-law of the former the President. Now there needs to be complete restructuring from top to bottom to turn things around, Dr.Senarane said.
A decision on the airline would have to be made given the current losses, amounting to Rs.27.79 billion for the 2016-2017 financial year alone. The Minister noted that by the next financial year ending in March 2018, a decision on the national carrier would be made.

Price of 48 drugs up
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated that the price of 48 drugs had been raised only by five percent.
This is to prevent local importers from incurring losses due to the continuous rise in the price of medicine in the global market.
According to Minister Senaratne, the prices were raised in accordance with a request made by local pharmaceutical companies which import drugs. The importers are making a loss due to the price increase in drugs in the global market.
The price increase will be valid for a period of one year. Thereafter, there will be no price increase again even if the price of drugs in the global market increases again in the future within one year. The prices of 48 drugs reduced significantly on October 21, 2016, he said.
Earlier, the price of a paracetamol tablet was Rs. 1.30. Now it is only Rs. 1.37  increased by only seven cents. All pharmacies should sell drugs according to the prices stipulated in the Special Gazette Notification 2049/31 of December 14.
The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will conduct raids to nab pharmacies which sell drugs at higher prices than gazetted, he added.

Probe into clearing of archaeological ruins
Investigations have been launched from several fronts to nab the suspects involved in clearing the location in Sampur where an archaeological team discovered the ruins of an ancient Cetiya (Dagoba) recently.
The girth of the Cetiya belonging to the early Anuradhapura period had measured 15 feet. The ruins were discovered during archaeological excavations in the Eastern Province.
Archaeological authorities said the location had been cleared by certain unscrupulous persons using a bulldozer a few days after the finding. The clearing of the site was first discovered by police which conducted investigations following a tip-off given on the police hotline.
Viharadhipati, Seruwila Mangala Raja Maha Viharaya Ven. Munhene Mettarama Thera said he had complained to the Secretary to the President, the Eastern Province Governor and the Government Agent about this.

Protecting the tea industry
Most Sri Lankans and indeed many others, cannot begin the day without a hot cuppa which sets the tone for the hours ahead. And when you want a steaming cup of hot tea, there is only one option: Ceylon Tea.
Sri Lanka is known for its unique Pure Ceylon Tea which is exported worldwide. In fact, this year Sri Lanka is celebrating 150 years of producing high quality teas loved by connoisseurs all over the world. But a variety of factors have adversely affected tea production and exports, which can threaten the very survival of the industry if not resolved soon.
Sri Lanka once used to be the worlds biggest tea exporter, but these days are sadly gone. Sri Lankas share in world tea production has now come down to 6% from 10.5% in 2000, when local tea production hit the magical 300 million kg mark. The industry has not been able to achieve that number since then.
Exports for the period January  November 2017 reached 265 million kg, a figure even lower than last years drought restricted quantity of 266.1 million kg. The figure is also the lowest since 2000. Thankfully, export earnings are at a record high of Rs.213.8 billion or approximately US $ 1.4 billion due to higher tea prices in the global market place. Global tea production has increased steadily and recorded 5.4 million metric tons or 5.4 billion kg in 2016.
Though the decline in tea production last year and during the first quarter of this year is largely attributed to the adverse weather in the tea growing regions in the country, the overall downward trend in production was due to a number of other factors such as ageing tea bushes (on average over 80 years), non-availability of an alternative weedicide and the low application of fertilizer. The biggest problem seems to the lack of replanting as most smallholders and companies seem to be reluctant to wait 2-3 years for the harvest from a replanted plot. This unfortunately gives an advantage to competitors such as Kenya and Vietnam, which have relatively new plantations.
But all these problems become insignificant in the face of the biggest crisis to hit Ceylon Tea in recent memory. Russia, Sri Lankas second biggest tea customer, has placed temporary restrictions on imports of tea and all other agricultural products from Sri Lanka from December 18 after a beetle was found in a tea consignment. The insect, known as the Khapra beetle, was discovered in the packaging of the consignment of tea from Sri Lanka which prompted the Russian agriculture safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor to take this drastic and damaging step. Russia was the second largest buyer of Sri Lankas Ceylon tea after Iran in 2016 with US$ 143 million worth of purchases and Sri Lankan tea accounts for 23 percent of the Russian market.
If no immediate action is taken, this could turn out to be a crippling blow to the local tea industry. Our competitors must be delighted at this turn of events  it has already been reported that Kenya was exploring the possibility of stepping into the niche occupied by Sri Lanka vis-a-vis tea exports to Russia.
The Russian ban has galvanized our tea industry like never before. President Maithripala Sirisena has intervened personally, promising to take up the case with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rosselkhoznadzor seems to have sensed the urgency on Sri Lankas side and promised to talk with Sri Lankan tea experts before year end. The watchdog has already met a delegation led by Sri Lankas ambassador to Russia in Moscow on Tuesday and requested information about steps being taken in Sri Lanka to secure the safety of tea intended for export to Russia. Our officials in Russia have pointed out that it was an isolated case and that they would work with the Russian authorities to resolve the issue.
The issue highlights several shortcomings. Finding a beetle in a huge tea consignment may not be easy, but very strict quality control is a must, bearing in mind that most countries have stringent entry and quarantine standards for foreign agricultural products. We must also not depend too much on the traditional export markets (Russia, Iran, UAE, Libya, China, Japan, Syria) as this case illustrates. Finding new markets for our teas is essential and so is diversifying the product portfolio through further value addition and innovation. Last year, Sri Lanka exported 57 percent of all teas in value-added form. Contributing to the value-added segment, packet tea comprised 46 percent, tea bags 8 percent, instant tea 1 percent and green tea 2 percent.
There is a whole generation previously addicted to various carbonated drinks who are discovering the wonders and health benefits of tea anew. But we need to jazz up tea for this new generation that does not even want to wait five minutes until the tea brews. From bubble tea to tea tablets, they are looking for exciting new ways to consume tea. We too must keep pace to develop and protect the industry that gives us this Elixir of the Gods.

Rahul, Chahal give India big win in first Sri Lanka T20
Cuttack: Opener Lokesh Rahul's attacking half-century and four wickets by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal powered India to their biggest ever Twenty20 win, outplaying Sri Lanka by 93 runs in the first match on Wednesday.
Chahal returned impressive figures of 4-23 to help dismiss Sri Lanka for 87, in 16 overs, while chasing 181 as the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
India's previous biggest T20 triumph in terms of runs was their 90-run win over England in the 2012 World Cup group match in Colombo.
Rahul smashed 61 off 48 balls as India posted a challenging 180-3 after being invited to bat first.
But it was Dhoni (39) and Manish Pandey (32) who set up India's big win with their unbeaten 68-run stand for the fourth wicket that lifted the team from 112-3 to put up a challenging total.
Dhoni hit 4 fours and a six during his 22-ball blitz while Pandey also hit the bowlers to all parts of the ground during his 18-ball stay.
Earlier Rahul, who replaced Shikhar Dhawan in the XI, put on a crucial 63-run stand with Shreyas Iyer, who made 24, after India a lost an early wicket.
Angelo Mathews got skipper Rohit Sharma caught at mid-on for 17 to check India's surge after the openers gave the team a brisk start.
Rahul, who hit 7 fours and a six, carried on with his attacking play as he reached his second T20 fifty in 34 balls, prompting skipper Thisara Perera to rotate his bowling options.
The ploy worked as Sri Lanka took two quick wickets including that of Rahul and also managed to stem the flow of runs. Perera bowled Rahul on a well-disguised slower delivery. But Dhoni and Pandey finished off the innings with a flurry of fours and sixes as India got 66 runs in the last five overs.
In reply, the Sri Lankan batting faltered against the Indian wrist spinners as Upul Tharanga top-scored with 23.
Fast bowler Hardik Pandya claimed three wickets while left-arm unorthodox bowler Kuldeep Yadav picked two. The second match is scheduled for Friday in Indore. AFP

Raigam cuts SLs wheat imports with launch of rice flour noodles
The country can save Rs 925 million annually by reducing the import of wheat flour due to the introduction of rice flour noodles to the country.
This opinion was expressed by Dr Ravi Liyanage, Chairman, Raigam Group of Companies, at the launch of the Raigam Devini Batha Bundi Full instant rice noodles to the Sri Lankan market on Tuesday, in Colombo.He said to construct the manufacturing plant to make noodles out of 100% rice grown in Sri Lanka, the group had invested over Rs 300 million. Situated in Homagama, this facility has a capacity of 5,000 MT per annum.
The Kingdom of Raigam earlier had fired the first salvo to save the country from importing salt from overseas by taking the initiative to re-awaken the salt industry in Sri Lanka.
With Raigam taking steps to start saltern construction and table salt refineries in the country the country managed to reduce its salt import to less than 7,000 MT in 2011. Dr Liyanage said Sri Lanka will be able to export the excess salt in the near future.
It was also disclosed that the Wayamba Salterns PLC has recorded a revenue of Rs. 723.4 million in 2017.
Commenting on the unprecedented financial growth achieved during this financial year, Raigam Wayamba Salterns, Chairman, Liyanage said in comparision to the revenue of Rs. 414.6 million recorded in 2016, this was the highest ever financial performances recorded by the Group.
Dr. Liyanage also mention about the severe slat shortage in the country in 2016 and said although many salt businesses came to a standstill, Raigam managed to service the market due to prudent stock management practices of the company.
Earlier this year the company issued 80 million shares at an affordable price of Rs 2.50 per share for anyone like school teachers or university students to become shareholders of the company by investing Rs. 2,500 the minimum subscription.

Rejection of nominations; SLPP files writ petition
Five members of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal.
They are seeking an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Maharagama Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the SLPP for the election of members to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP were rejected on the ground that it did not contain the total number of women candidates in terms of subsection (2A) of section 28 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
Five petitioners who nominated themselves as candidates for election for the constituting wards of the Maharagama Urban Council are seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Maharagama Urban Council.
This petition was filed through senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana and counsel H.M. Tillekaratne.
The petitioners Nishantha Wimalachandra, Savithri Gunasekera, Angoda Liyanage Pradeep Chaminda, Wanniarachchige Don Amarapala and Inoka Anuradha Ranaweera had cited Damayanthi Wanigasinghe, Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo District), SLFP General Secretary Dumminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabeer Hasheem and JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva as respondents.
The petitioners maintained that the decision to reject the nomination paper had been arrived at by failing to properly and reasonably exercise and execute the statutory and legal duty vested in the first respondent, Damayanthi Wanigasinghe by failing to examine the nomination paper to ascertain the fact whether the nomination paper contained the required number of women candidates. They further alleged the she had failed to evaluate evidence before her and misdirected herself in fact and in law, which is also amounts to causing an error of material facts.
They further stated the first respondent failed to give a fair hearing to the authorised agent or consider and do further examination of the material before her, referred to in the submissions made by the authorised agent.

Royal Navys new 3 bn warship springs a leak
UK: Britains biggest ever warship, the new 3.1 billion pound ($4.2 billion) aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, has a leak and needs repairs, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Tuesday.
The 65,000-tonne ship, hailed as Britains most advanced military vessel and which was only officially commissioned by the queen two weeks ago, has an issue with a shaft seal which was identified during sea trials, the MoD said.
This is scheduled for repair while she is alongside at Portsmouth, a Royal Navy spokesman said. It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials programme will not be affected.
The Sun newspaper reported that the 280-metre (920-foot) warship, the nations future flagship vessel, was letting in 200 litres of water every hour and the fix would cost millions of pounds.
A defence source said the navy was aware the ship, which took eight years to build, had an issue when it was handed over by manufacturers and the Sun said the builders would have to foot the repair bill.
The Aircraft Carrier Alliance - a consortium including British engineering companies BAE Systems and Babcock, and the UK division of Frances Thales - built the Queen Elizabeth and its sister aircraft carrier, the HMS Prince of Wales, as apart of a 6.2 billion pound project.
Its normal practice for a volume of work and defect resolution to continue following vessel acceptance, BAE Systems said in a statement. This will be completed prior to the nations flagship re-commencing her programme at sea in 2018.
Chris Parry, a former senior Royal Navy officer, said all ships took on water.
Thats why you have pumps, he told Sky News. When you get a brand new car not everythings perfect, you have to send it back to the garage to get a few things tweaked. This is exactly in that bracket.
On Tuesday, parliaments defence committee raised questions about the procurement of the F-35 fighter jets from a consortium led by Lockheed Martin which will eventually operate from the Queen Elizabeth.
The committee said there had been an unacceptable lack of transparency about the programme and the MoD had failed to provide details of the full cost of each aircraft which one newspaper had estimated could be as much as 155 million pounds.
Our new aircraft carrier is the epitome of British design and dexterity, at the core of our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said at the Queen Elizabeths commissioning. - HINDUSTAN TIMES

Selections before elections
The much awaited official announcement regarding local government elections finally came this week with Elections Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya announcing that polls will be conducted on February 10, allowing for a little over seven weeks of campaigning from now on.
As the number of eligible voters in the country increases, this will be the election at which the most voters will be participating: an estimated 15,760,809 voters will be eligible to elect 8,293 members to 24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils and 276 pradeshiya sabhas.
Already, there have been controversies regarding the election with the rejection of some nomination lists. The newly established Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which represents the Joint Opposition (JO) at the election is worst affected, with six nomination lists being rejected.
The SLPP is known to be particularly perturbed at the rejection of its nomination list for the Maharagama Urban Council. Maharagama is the stronghold of JO stalwart and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardena and the party was hopeful of a strong presence there.
Nomination lists
However EC Chairman Deshapriya was unapologetic about the elimination of nomination lists, while expressing his regret over their rejection. Nomination lists had been rejected solely on legal grounds and the Commission endorses the decision of the returning officers who rejected the lists, he said.
We recognise the right of political parties or independent groups to seek legal redress. In the event of legal action we are prepared to explain how and why the nominations lists were rejected, Chairman Deshapriya said.
The mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had two of its nomination lists rejected, as did the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK). Several independent groups also had their lists rejected. The United National Party (UNP) has been unaffected thus far.
If the rejection of six nomination lists was an inauspicious start to their campaign, the SLPP was acting undeterred. Their first salvo came from none other than their de facto leader, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who issued a statement strongly critical of not only the mainstream SLFP and the UNP but also the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
In an attempt to explain why the SLPP is contesting separately from the SLFP, Rajapaksa has launched a thinly veiled attack on President Maithripala Sirisena, being critical of the President for not endorsing his candidature whole heartedly at the August 2015 general election.
This is in reference to President Sirisena taking the unprecedented step of addressing the nation and stating that even if the SLFP won the election, Rajapaksa would not be appointed Prime Minister. In his statement, Rajapaksa argues that this was detrimental to the SLFP and led to the UNP emerging as the single largest party in Parliament following the election.
If anything, Rajapaksas statement indicates that the gloves are off in the tussle between the two factions of the SLFP. This is after weeks of frenzied negotiating, right up until the eleventh hour. In fact, Rajapaksa was not keen on any accord when Minister Susil Premajayantha met him last week in a final attempt to reach an agreement.
Local government polls
For many observers, the most interesting aspect of Rajapaksas statement was a reference to the next presidential election. Rajapaksa notes, providing exact dates and relating them to timeframes listed in the Constitution, that in his view, the next presidential election is due in November or December 2019. Thus, there is only a one and half year period between the local government polls and the next presidential election, Rajapaksa contends.
In this context, it is worth recalling that it was Rajapaksa who engineered a petition in the Supreme Court through the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), arguing that former President Chandrikas Kumaratungas second term of office began in 1999 and ended in 2005, a year earlier than what Kumaratunga had envisaged.
The Supreme Court headed by then Chief Justice Sarath Silva held in Rajapaksas favour resulting in presidential elections being held in 2005 at which Rajapaksa emerged victorious. Thus, Rajapaksa is no stranger to interpreting nuances in the Constitution and exploiting them to his advantage.
Nevertheless, coming from a personality who is explicitly barred from contesting the next presidential election due to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution by virtue of having held that office twice, many find this to be an interesting argument, indicating that the SLPP has set its sights on the next presidential poll.
Opinion is already divided even within the SLFP on Rajapaksas assertion. Some say it is a moot point because an overhaul of the Constitution is currently in process and the fate of the Executive Presidency in its current form is hanging in the balance.
They point out that one of the options being considered by parliamentary steering committee of the Constitutional Assembly was for the President to be elected by Parliament. If these proposals materialise, there would not be another presidential election.
Besides, President Sirisena has pledged publicly more than once that he would not be running for President again. Some SLFP stalwarts have already proclaimed him as the SLFP candidate for the next presidential election, but the President has not endorsed such claims in any way.
Legal analysts also note that the preamble to the 19th Amendment contains a clause that may invalidate Rajapaksas argument. Article 1(2) of the 19th Amendment states that it would come into force on the date on which this Act comes into operation, with the exception of certain clauses which would come into force much later, following the general election.
SLFP and SLPP
Thus, whether the timeframes cited by Rajapaksa apply to the current tenure of office of President Sirisena would be an argument that could be canvassed in a court of law, if matters proceed to a legal dispute between the SLFP and SLPP factions. If indeed presidential elections need to be held, such an eventuality is now a distinct possibility. This sabre rattling between the SLFP and the SLPP is sure to ratchet up a notch or two in the weeks to come, the likely beneficiary of this dispute being the UNP. However, the UNP can ill-afford to rest on its laurels, because it has so few of them to boast of.
It does have liabilities, however. The most significant among them is the alleged involvement of former ministers and parliamentarians with those implicated in the Central Bank bond sale which is now the subject of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry. This has dented the partys image in the minds of the public, especially when the government has failed to prosecute those responsible for alleged acts of corruption in the previous regime.
It is perhaps with this in mind that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe indicated this week that arrangements have been made to hear twenty court cases dealing with corruption on a daily basis with a view of expediting the process of penalising wrongdoers.
Some are questioning the pledge the government gave during the last election to eradicate corruption and to punish those who have robbed public funds, the Prime Minister acknowledged but stated that any action to deal with this issue would be taken within the existing judicial system.
With provincial council elections a certainty after the local government elections, Sri Lankans will have a surfeit of elections in 2018. Then there will be a lull before the next general election which is not due until 2020- but then, that may well be the calm before the storm.

Skills within schools
It is not enough to only foster cognitive intelligence among the youth. A well-structured national policy for development of multiple intelligences is vital for making Sri Lanka a global power.
The world has come around to the view that democracy is essential for full human development and only education and skill development can make this possible. The International Youth Convention on Commerce and Economics (IYCC) was introduced with this idea in mind. Organised by the City Montessori School, Lucknow, IYCC celebrated its fourth chapter this year.
The event took place in Lucknow, India, from October 28 to 31. 72 teams of school children from India as well as form foreign nations like Nepal, Russia and Brazil took part in the event. The competition was based mostly on questions and activities related to Commerce and Economics. Participants competed under the seven categories: E Manage, Cultural Event, Ad-venture, Com.net, Bull vs Bear, Buiz Quiz and B Plan.
Ananda College, Colombo, took part and made a significant impact by managing to win a handful of accolades. The team comprised of Vinura Dulan, Pasindu Jayasekara, Devinda Siyambalagaspitiya, Ashan Kodituwakku, Keshan Gunasekara, Achira Induja, Disith Ravimal, Romesh de Silva and Ravishka Chandraratne. They clinched second place in both the cultural event as well as the E Manage event. They won a consolation prize in the Ad-venture and Com.net items. They were able to make it to the final round in the Buiz Quiz. Commerce Section Head S B B Yamuna Kumarihami and English teacher Asha Perera were the teachers who guided the boys towards success.
This is the second time that the school had taken part in the event. They had taken part in the competition in 2011. They had only gotten a prize for participation then. City Montessori School had sent applications inviting them to join this year as well.
Each item they had taken part in had tested and enhanced the skills of the students. The whole team took part in the cultural item and eight of them were also part of the Ad-venture item. Two boys each took part in the rest of the categories. Keshan faced the Bull vs Bear debate.
The boys had to stage an advertisement for the Ad-venture category. They chose to market a chocolate which they named Marvelo.
We chose to go for a chocolate because it is everyones favourite food item. Some of us dressed as female characters to present the advertisement. We even developed a wrapper for the chocolate, explained the team leader Vinura Dulan.
For the B-Plan the Anandians came up with a toffee named Vista which can be taken to get rid of wheezing. The most challenging event for many of the boys was the cultural event. They had a fusion dance item in which they did a variety of dances ranging from the Kandyan to the low country and Sabaragamuwa dance styles. Dance teacher Manjula Piyaratne trained them.
Though there were a few who had excelled in dancing and had even obtained the Ves status, many of us were new to the subject, Pasindu Jayasekara said.
They made an eco friendly video on energy conservation in hotel and trade for E-Manage. They used solar power to reduce energy consumption in the project. Mount Lavinia Hotel General Manager Navindra Wijesinghe, Director Karsim and Executive Manager Sanjeewa assisted them in this item. Harith Ratnayaka, Gangana Kisal Ganepola, Nipun Samarasinghe and Dinith Nirmal too helped make the video. They mostly engaged in the project work during the weekends and practiced the dance item after school.
Many of the boys were dazzled by the Nepalese cultural dance item.
That was very colourful and entertaining. It won first place, Ashan Kodituwakku said.
We met a lot of other youth at the event. They taught us new things. We still keep in touch with them and interact with them. We also got to know what it was like taking part in an international competition. You need to maintain your standards to be on par with the global economic sector. We learnt our shortcomings and how to amend them by watching the presentations from the other teams, Ravishka Chandraratne said.
We learnt many things by taking part in the event through experience. Rather than limiting yourself to books practical knowledge counts a lot. We also learnt to work as a team during the rounds. Since we were in a foreign land away from home we learnt to stand by each other and look after each others needs, Kehsan Gunasekara expressed.
Speaking about his experience taking part in the competition Romesh de Silva said that he believes that their team did well compared with the rest of the other teams. The questions were based on the Indian syllabus and though that was different from the Sri Lankan syllabus, they managed to overcome that trial with winning colours.
Our parents supported us all the way. We are also grateful to our principal S M Keerthirathna, the Mount Lavinia Hotel, our teachers and all those who helped us in various ways on our path to success, Achira Induja concluded.

SLIM dons double crowns with awards
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing competed in the 53rd Annual Report Awards conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and emerged with a silver award in the Not for Profit Organizations in the Non-Governmental Organizations category.
For the first time, SLIM clinched the Runner Up Award in the Associations and Societies Category at the 14th National Business Excellence Awards 2017 organised by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
Both awards signify SLIMs long strategies in building an entity that aims towards performance and operational excellence, where stringent adherence to compliance and standards lie paramount in its ethos.
SLIM has been producing comprehensive annual reports according to the accounting standards by CA Sri Lanka for many years now, which emphasize this focus. However, this is the first time that it submitted a report to be scrutinised and evaluated against those guidelines, resulting in the reward of silver at this prestigious event.
Over 140 organisations ranging from blue chip companies and conglomerates to small and medium businesses to community groups vie for laurels at the Annual Report competition, where an eminent panel of judges work on evaluation criteria that has best practices in governance and stringent appraisals of the entities transparency, accountability and social responsibility in financial reporting.
At the NBEA Awards, SLIM was among 92 award winners across 29 business sectors, which has become the symbol of excellence for the crme de la crme of business in Sri Lanka.
Assessing the unprecedented wins for SLIM, President Karthik Elangovan opines that these awards further augment the stability, strength and sustainability that the organization espouses in the way it conducts its business. For one, a credible annual report entails a great deal of clarity in the presentation of financial and non-financial information and that is what SLIM has striven to do by conforming to the highest reporting standards and we have been suitably rewarded for it too.
This years Annual Report Awards, which revolved on the theme Quintessence of Eminence highlighted entities that have gone beyond the norms of mere financial performance, which makes this win even more significant.
These awards, says CEO and Executive Director of SLIM, Sanath Senanayake, are a solid demonstration of our transparency and accountability, not only in delivering maximum financial stability, but also in being compliant with regulations and standards, striving for excellence and setting benchmarks for the corporate sector as a whole.

SLPP letterheads cause concern for SLFP organiser
Matale District SLFP organiser Susil Premaratne has lodged a complaint with the Elections Commission alleging that certain state officials with political rights contesting the forthcoming local elections have submitted leave applications in a misleading manner.
The letter heads of the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna depict the picture of SLFP patron, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is a former President of the SLFP.
In a letter addressed to the Elections Commission Chairman, Premaratne said this was improper and misleading because the correct procedure was for public officers in the State and Corporation service having political rights under chapter 32 of the Establishment Code contesting elections as a candidate of a party to submit a leave application bearing the letter head of the General Secretary of the respective party.
As such he has requested the Election's Commission Chairman to cancel or reject the leave applications which did not conform to this legal procedure.
The letter has been copied to the Matale District Assistant Elections Commissioner.

Spice up     your life with  tantalizing food
Jacqueline Fernandez is a combination of beauty from head to toe with excellent business acumen. Chef Dharshan Munidasa is a maestro in the kitchen. The two have come together to create Kaema Sutra, an exciting new age Sri Lanka Bar and Restaurant at Shangri La Hotel. Daily News attended the opening last week and experienced the delightful ambience and environment of Kaema Sutra in the company of Chef Dharshan Munidasa and Shangri La Vice President and General Manager, Timothy Wright.

Munidasa has a wealth of experience when it comes to food. He founded Nihonbashi and the Ministry of Crab. These two highly popular venues are actually two of Sri Lankas most successful restaurants. Both are on the list of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants. Munidasas current crowning achievement is Kaema Sutra at Shangri La. Shangri La has set benchmarks for the hospitality industry.
Shangri La is the only five star hotel that has actually reached out to an external restaurateur to open out a restaurant within its premises.
Vice President and General Manager Timothy Wright, expressed his sincere delight at the opening of Kaema Sutra saying that the creation of Kaema Sutra has been a most interesting journey.
chicken drumsticks
It has been a lot of hard work putting together this relationship. It has been an excellent idea to invite Munidasa to come in with his expertise and help us create a Sri Lankan restaurant here in Shangri La. We are obviously new to Sri Lanka, so it made sense to partner with the most acclaimed restaurateur here in Sri Lanka. We are very pleased and proud to work with Dharshan and his team, said Wright.
Wright said opening a Sri Lankan restaurant has always been on their minds. Shangri La is new to the country that is why they reached out to a Chef like Dharshan Munidasa, he said.
So we needed the expertise and the understanding. I love Sri Lankan food and I have been to his restaurants and had discussions with him. I appreciate his passion for quality. This has been very important for us in opening the restaurant so the spicier the better. The dish I like the most is the prawn curry and there is a Sri Lanka twist on the pizza. So that is very unusual and very interesting, stated Wright.
Chef Dharshan Munidasa
Jackie Fernandez is Chef Dharshan Munidasas celebrity collaborator in the venture. When it comes to Ministry of Crab his collaborators are cricketers, Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara.
Firstly they were all friends. That is how I met Kumar at Nihonbashi and the Ministry of Crab idea came up. I met Jackie at Ministry of Crab. The idea of Kaema Sutra came up and I asked her to be a part of it. So she got involved. Kaema Sutra was a name given to a TV show! And I wanted the rights for the restaurant after the TV show happened. But the TV show never happened. Kaema Sutra is the direct translation of the Malay art of cuisine. So it was a nice twist, said Munidasa
When it comes to his food, Munidasa lists ingredients as the most essential component in cooking.
We live on an island and the sea is right in front of Shangri La. But we still buy fish in cans and I dont understand why! First I think the access to great ingredients is now a privilege. If you have the patience to spend some time and money to get good ingredients that is where good food starts.
"When you have good ingredients you will want to use sharper knives. You need to have more finesse in the cuts. Sri Lankan food is about being functional and when you treat each dish individually they have wonderful flavours and that is what we are trying to celebrate, pointed out Munidasa.
Munidasa is of Japanese and Sri Lankan origin. He has brought some items in Japanese menus to Sri Lanka. He said a lot of Japanese cooking will also be incorporated. Of course the tools are the most important in Japanese cooking such as good knives. You need more talent and the correct equipment, he said.
There will be Japanese traditions in respect to ingredients and kitchen utensils. I think Sri Lankan food was cooked in clay pots that did not have a good lid, because they wanted to get the moisture out of the ingredients.
Savoury pastries
"When you get the moisture out of the ingredients you extend its shelf life like Ambul Thiyal. When you use stuff like fish, that you can eat raw, you realize you dont have to cook that long. It is soft and succulent. And then the equipment comes in. We are approaching cuisine in two different ways. The clay pots addressed a preservation issue and now I am addressing a flavour and texture issue. The tuna Ambul Thiyal is cooked at your table. We bring raw tuna, to the table and we cook it in a clay pot. Good fish does not smell. There is nothing to hide, said Munidasa.
Why not drop by at the Shangri La Kaema Sutra and enjoy a great meal while watching the sunset and sipping cocktails! The ambience is just right. Munidasas meals are terrific. They are mouthwatering and innovative. So bring the family over or come alone and you will be treated like royalty by the friendly staff ever willing to make your stay memorable! Kaema Sutra Shangri La is the destination!

Sri Lankas biggest tourism project starts in 2018 - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the construction work of the Dedduwa tourism zone  Sri Lankas biggest tourism construction project so far  will begin in March next year.
The Premier stated that the Dedduwa project will focus heavily on conservation of the natural eco-system, adding that new laws will be formulated to protect the environment in the area, during construction.
The Prime Minister, yesterday, visited the site along with Ministers Sagala Ratnayaka and Gayantha Karunathilake and held discussions with the politicians and state officials in the area. During the visit, the Divisional Secretary of Benthara handed over the final report on the land acquisition for the project, to the Prime Minister.
While accepting the report, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe commented the state officials for carrying out a speedy land acquisition programme.
We have a plan to convert this 1800-acre area into the best tourism destination in South Asia, the Prime Minister said, before concluding the visit. Lunuganga, an area that will be a key part of the Dedduwa project, is well-known because of the legendary architect Geoffery Bawa. The project will be very much in line with Bawas concepts and will further enhance the natural beauty of the area, he added.
The government will carry out this significant tourism development project in collaboration with the private sector, he said.
The true value of this project will depend on the way it contributes to the natural eco-system in the area, the Prime Minister said, adding that he had instructed the Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry to strengthen the legal framework to protect the environment in the area.
The Galle district, the Prime Minister said, is located between two international airports  Katunaike and Mattala. Although many concentrate on the coastal area of Galle in terms of tourism, its interior areas are blessed with natural beauty and have immense potential. That is why we have already made plans to start tourism projects in Akurala and Koggala. With all these projects, Galle, I am certain, will become a major tourism hub in the region
We have also developed a programme to promote tourism in and around the Sinharaja forest. Several areas including Deniyaya, Rakwana, Hinidums and Agalawatte will develop as a result of that programme.
We will also set up a tourism school in the Southern province.
This comprehensive programme will even reach the Badulla district. Tourism development and employment creation will be expanded to Southern and Uva provinces, the Prime Minister stated.

Strategic environment of South Asia/Indian Ocean region: Sri Lankan perspective
The Center for Global & Strategic Studies (CGSS) organized an interactive session on Strategic Environment of South Asia/Indian Ocean Region: Sri Lankan Perspective. Following is the text of the prsentaion made by Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director of the Center for Indo-Lanka Relations of the Pathfinder Foundation, at this session.
Today, I will focus on the strategic environment of South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region from a Sri Lankan perspective. The strategic environment in South Asia can be described or explained in six words: as strategic competition; strategic alliances; and strategic dilemma.
When considering strategic competition, it is a bygone conclusion that the Indian Ocean is geo-strategically, geo politically and geo economically important in the current global security landscape, with a contest for power and influence among major powers in the region and beyond. In this situation there are strategic convergences of some major powers against others. This has resulted in a strategic dilemma for smaller, less powerful countries as they are often forced to choose between major powers.
The most important occurrence in the Indian Ocean region at present is the rise of China as a major power. It is significant that China is the second strongest economy in the world in terms of GDP. The International Monetary Funds prediction for 2040 is for Chinas GDP to reach US$ 45 trillion, USA US$ 39 trillion, India US$16 trillion, South Korea, Germany, Japan and the UKs GDP between US$ 4-7 trillion and Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia to be within top 20.
Historically, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were the key oceans as world wars, the Industrial Revolution and Cold War took place in its waters. The Indian Ocean then played a background role whereas in the 21st century, it is fast becoming the key ocean together with the Pacific Ocean. The unipolar world led by the USA is changing and it is changing fast. We can see China rising as a major power as is India and these two will dominate the Indian Ocean. As their wealth and power expand, they increasingly come into contact with each other and this is happening in the Indian Ocean, more specifically in and around South Asia. Here we can draw reference to the Thucydides Trap, the possibility of war and conflict between an existing super power and an emerging one.
There have been several instances where strategic competition between China and India have been evident. The Sino-Indian war in 1962; the two border disputes to-date and the Doklam standoff between the Indian armed forces and the PLA army are few occasions this strategic competition came closer to a physical battle.
The entry of Chinas Navy into the Indian Ocean occurred around 2009, mainly to counter piracy. Piracy in the horn of Africa, which took the world merchant marine fleet to ransom is near zero at present but the navies are still present and so is Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).
China has two all-weather friends in South Asia for different reasons. They are Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Chinese involvement in Sri Lanka during the long drawn out violent conflict is noteworthy. Although India, Pakistan, USA, Israel, Russia, and Ukraine supported the government of Sri Lanka to battle the most ruthless terrorist organization - the LTTE, the major contribution came from China.
China provided weapons when many other nations shied away citing human right considerations. China even established a bonded warehouse for arms and ammunition that was required to fight the war in Sri Lanka. The post conflict period also witnessed the west and other powers staying away from Sri Lankas development programs. China became the number one development partner and biggest Foreign Direct Investor in Sri Lanka, mainly focusing on much needed infrastructure projects such as highways, ports, airports and power generation sectors.
China maintains that they do not have any strategic and military objectives in investing in these projects but that they are purely of an economic nature. Indias contribution, mainly due to the pressure from Tamil Nadu was of a non-lethal nature and the post conflict rebuilding assistance was also centered around Tamil majority areas.
The Chinese influence in Pakistan can be seen in the construction of the contested China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which controversially runs through the conflict-ridden region of Kashmir making it a concern of India.
Consequently, India, USA and Japan realized that the Chinese involvement and influence was seen everywhere in the Indian Ocean Region and especially in South Asia. Chinese maritime infrastructure projects were taking place not only in Sri Lanka but also in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives.
Thus, the major powers that are strategic partners of India preferred to see Sri Lanka move away from Chinese influence. When that did not occur, they considered the next option and supported a regime change in 2015. However, this resulted in a predicament as for nearly two years no nation came forward to help Sri Lankas economic development after the 2015 presidential and general elections.
Following this, Sri Lanka had to reconnect with China in a position of weakness. During this period our economy suffered and now it has fallen to the sixth place among SAARC countries. This is a result of major strategic competition in the Indian Ocean. It is important to note that this region is heavily militarized and nuclearized.
An example of this militarization is evident from the number of warships that belong to different countries visiting Sri Lankan ports. From 2009-2017 a total of 398 war ships have visited Sri Lankan ports. A breakdown of this is as follows: India - 82; Pakistan - 24; Japan - 67; Bangladesh - 23; China - 31; USA - 18; and Russia - 26.
Now we move to Strategic Alliances in the Indian Ocean Region. Here, I like to mention three key events/speeches which took place this October. Chinese President Xi Jinpings speech at the Chinese Communist partys 19th congress, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe winning a landslide election and the US Secretary of State Rex Tillersons speech in Washington DC.
The Chinese President clearly stated that China aspires to be a great power with a modernized military by 2035. However, President Xi stated that China does not have any hegemonic intentions. Prime Minister Abe in Japan has won a two-thirds majority in recent elections. This can be seen as strengthening Japans focus on a Free and Open Indo-Pacific Oceans policy and a more effective role for Japanese Maritime Self Defence Forces in the Indian ocean.
Tillersons speech clearly stated that China is now seen as the common adversary of USA and India. He argued that both India and USA are two great democracies and thus should have two great militaries. Tillerson also spoke of developing a hundred-year strategic partnership between India and USA. India also has its neighbourhood first and look east policy which is favouring the India Japan nexus.
India has also embarked on the ambitious multi-million-dollar Sagar Mala development project to develop its ports along the eastern and western coasts consistent with the name of the project which is Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).
India and Japan together have commenced the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), an economic cooperation agreement between the governments of India and Japan to connect Asia with Africa by using Japanese technology and Indian influence in that region.
The USA is also rebalancing its strategy in the Indo-AsiaPacific and envisions that soon it will be called the Indo-Pacific. These strategies could be seen as mainly to counter Chinas Belt and Road Initiative and the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Then there is the Afghanistan, India and Iran nexus as Pakistans uneasy relations with India, Iran and Afghanistan hold back military and economic cooperation which has led to obstacles in development of the region.
Meanwhile India is building two Advanced Off-shore Patrol Vessels (AOPV) to strengthen the Sri Lanka Navy and gifted an additional OPV. Japan has indicated that they too will gift two 30-meter patrol craft to the Sri Lanka Coast Guard and would build three 85-meter OPVs in collaboration with Colombo Dockyard Private limited in Colombo.
Meanwhile, USA also announced that it will gift another coast guard cutter to boost naval capabilities in Sri Lanka. Thus, all this attention on Sri Lanka is mainly due to Chinese influence in the country.
It is evident that regional cooperation in the form of SAARC is not moving forward as anticipated, mainly due to the rivalry between India and Pakistan. Even the 19th SAARC summit planned in Islamabad could not be held. A more recent development is the contest of SAARC versus BIMSTEC as regional organizations.
South Asia can be called the least integrated region due to rivalries among its nations. However, BIMSTEC has now been given a new lease of life. Its primary focus is on connectivity, economic development and even maritime security. It is significant that India and Japan are keen that BIMSTEC moves forward, focusing more on the Bay of Bengal Region as it is relatively peaceful and also as a connector between the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.
Meanwhile the Western Indian Ocean is a flash point region with many conflict-prone regions such as Afghanistan, India-Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iran and even Iraq and Syria.
Lastly, the above dynamics have resulted in a strategic dilemma in the region. Major power rivalry has led to an Undeclared Maritime Cold War in the Indian Ocean which is heavily militarized and nuclearized. The smaller, less powerful states are compelled to choose between major players and some states try to benefit from both sides or all players in the equation. Some even hedge one against the other which ends up by hampering economic progress and development in the region. As a result, the South Asian region rates low in Human Indexes. It is important to note that smaller, less-powerful states cannot make decisions based on economics and need to take into account strategic considerations of major powers.
In planning the way forward there have to be certain measures that need to be taken in order to create stability and security in the Indian Ocean region. Thus, there is a need to create trust between states and overcome the trust deficiency. In recent times, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka has spoken of a New Indian Ocean Order' where there is no hegemony but all are equal partners.
In this all-inclusive approach, there may be a code of conduct for a rule-based maritime order. There is also the question as to whether Indian Ocean Rim Association or Indian Ocean Naval Symposium can be the engine to foster cooperation and collaboration in the Indian Ocean. As to what rules should be followed, the most prudent would be to follow international rules that are established and work towards the common good of the region and its people.

US asks UN to ban 10 ships from world's ports over North Korea ties

The United States has asked the United Nations to ban 10 ships from entering the world's ports over alleged dealings with North Korea.
The move comes after the UN blacklisted four ships in October, including one that was caught smuggling 30,000 North Korean-made rocket-propelled grenades in 2016.
Giovanni Davoli, a spokesman for the Italian mission to the UN, confirmed the US request. Italy is currently serving as chair of the UN Security Council's North Korea Sanctions Committee, the body charged with measuring and enforcing the measures levied against the hermit nation in response to its missile and nuclear tests.
The US State Department and the US Mission to the United Nations didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Pyongyang has for years used deceptive shipping practices to help bring in revenue for the country's regime, analysts say, and the UShas called for more to be done to crack down on ships transporting goods to and from North Korea.
UN Security Council resolutions passed this year stipulate "all Member States shall prohibit the entry into their ports of such designated vessels," save for some circumstances, including in emergencies or if they are granted humanitarian exceptions by the UN. However, it's up to individual UN members to enforce the measures, which analysts say aren't always clear cut.
Banned ship at Chinese port An example of the nebulous nature of the sanctions arose this weekend.
The Hao Fan 6, one of the four vessels handed a global port ban in October, was moored beside a port in eastern China on Sunday, according to tracking data published on multiple maritime monitoring websites.
On Monday, a staffer who answered the phone at the Zhoushan Marine Affairs Bureau confirmed the Hao Fan 6's location near Lujiashi Island, one of the Zhoushan Islands. He declined to give his name and to answer further questions.
"If there were no emergency or no special UN approval then this would appear to be a sanctions violation by China irrespective of how brief the stay at port may have been," said Nicholas Tam, a lawyer at Ince & Co specializing in shipping and trade sanctions.
However, George Lopez, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, said that by mooring beside the dock rather than physically attaching to it, the Hao Fan 6 could be trying to adhere to the letter of the UN sanctions. "The fact that it's moored is probably a consciously chosen, ambiguous area (to comply with) strict application of the Security Council's intentions," Lopez told CNN.
When asked about the Hao Fan 6's location and whether it had violated sanctions, Hugh Griffiths, the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, which reports to the UN Security Council's North Korea Sanctions Committee, told CNN he could not comment as the matter is under Panel investigation.
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said she was not aware of the ship's location or mission when asked Monday about the Hao Fan 6. "I can tell you very responsibly that China carefully implements all UN Security Council resolutions related to North Korea," she said.
China accounts for nearly 90% of all trade with North Korea, a crucial economic lifeline for leader Kim Jong Un.
Critics have contend China does not use that financial leverage to its fullest extent. As the US tries to blacklist more vessels with North Korea ties, Lopez, the former UN panel member, says the Hao Fan's appearance off the Chinese coast will test the UN's willingness and ability to enforce maritime sanctions.
"In a world where the US especially keeps asking, is China our partner in enforcing sanctions, this particular ship's reappearance poses a good test."
"How does it appear and disappear, and now that it's found and it's on a list, what should happen"
