Beyond business bounds
To function as an ex-traordinary Leader you need to sense see and capture the invisibilities of your surroundingsTo be empowered with this visibility and possibility shifting your life and your work to a new dimension is a categorical imperative.
As the world evolves from one stage to another many facts that were established in the past seems obsolete. Even The Big Bang Theory is question-nable today.
As we move along with growing Business complexities and conquering Global challenges alongside we grow in consciousnesswe see and sense more and more of life and great business visions. If we are to guide and lead the world we need to be working with an adequate mental instrument sensing and conceiving the world with pre-cognitive abilities, not leaving our dependency on only known facts of life.
It is evident that we are at a threshold of a new age in consciousness. Dramatic changes in all spheres moves the world at an extraordinary pace compared to a few decades ago - so is the business world.
A few individuals will lead this new era, elevating themselves to a higher level of logics and understanding to face these new challenges. They will lead the world and its people to a new dimension in meaningful and purposeful living.
Humanistic values
Perhaps you head a large corporate, wealthy, powerful, famous or certainly in the right direction to be there
Engage your fortes to shift your life and your professions to a new dimension that empowers you to transform the planet to a better place and its people, to individuals of real humanistic values. Move the glory of your greatness beyond its mortal limitations.
I will not bore you filling this artifact with detailed citings and facts of some of the greatest Leaders in the planet who with their Innovative and Visionary Thinking, have thrust the world to what it is today with all its splendor and great living environmentsand some of the largest corporates who recorded astounding heights in overall growth and development with high emphasis on innovation and evolutionary centered thinking. Instead, I have tossed out a few important guidelines of what, ideally it means to move our work and life to a new dimension.
So whats a new dimension in life and in work Primarily lets take life.
Physical mind
Moving your life to a new dimension is a migration into a new state of consciousness and cognitionattired with a new cognitive instrument to perceive, comprehend and capture the world with a higher sense of logics and understanding and through a wider dynamical zone than our five sensory footprint . In the sense that we recognize and even engage our non-physical faculties for progressing with human potentials such as Intuition, precognition clairvoyance and other powers that are treasured beyond the powers of the physical mind.
These undiscovered new Cognitional Faculties empowers you to sense ,see and achieve astounding accomplishments beyond the reach of an ordinary Mind.
This is not a spiritual or paranormal transcendence, but an elevation to the highest state of consciousness within our organic scale.
In our professional engagements we are going beyond the accomplishments of power, wealth and fame. Our focus here is of a humanitarian and heroic nature. While holding on to our visions and missions in whatever is our profession we are moving our energies and efforts in contributing constructively toward the betterment of the whole human race along with positive changes in the economic social and political affairs of the Planet. Youll only see it as an obligatory and praiseworthy task when you have moved your life to these new levels of cognition.
In view of the present issues that the world is facingThe world is in need of ex-leaders Leaders who has the capacity to think not behind the boxbut beyond the rational mind, beyond pragmatic thinking skills.
We have seen many addressing these issues for many decades with not much success, perhaps perceiving worldly problems with an ordinary state of logics and understanding.
Moving your work to a new dimension means guiding and directing the world and its people to better living conditions with the integrated strengths of your extraordinary intellectual abilities and your rich material possessions and dignified recognition.
Higher intelligence
To transform to extraordinary levels in leadership and management you need a liberalized mind detached from the influence and interference of your existing knowledge and lifes experience, beliefs and convictions and your ego-driven attitude .You need to be a visionary with foresight, and engage certain promptings of a pre-cognition and premonition nature and to exercise your liberty to think abstract , illogical to hypnotize extrapolate, before you find out that they are imperceptible or elusive In simple terms you function from the zenith of your mind that enables you to be connected to your higher intelligence.

In this new dimension
* You will mentally advance yourself from a five sensory to a multi-sensory Individual in the sense that you will also encompass non-physical realities as part of your growth and development process.
* You will grow in mental-psychic clarity and will make personal and business decisions on the basis of intuition as well as rationality.
* Youll understand psychological growth as evolutionary and develop methods and institutions not just to cure emotional disease but foster the growth of consciousness.
* Youll see education, corporate education and personal growth and development as a discipline in moving to higher stages of consciousness, body, mind and soul to spirit and re-construct educational, cor-porate and personal growth theories and institutions accordingly, with special emphasis on hierarchic development.
* Youll use mass media, instant telecommunication and human/computer linkages as vehicles of bonding consciousness and unity.
* Youll re-define and re-write the principles of business management embracing the vertical growth of consciousness as a strategic constituent part of a Innovative Business mechanism powered to move business efficiencies and growth potentials to unimaginable heights.
* Youll lead and guide the world and its people to live a more meaningful and purposeful life
You need to be bold and daring in your thinking and have the courage to shoulder any type of criticism before you see and feel the glory and ecstasy of your innovations.
This could be achieved by moving your work and our life to a new dimensionWhere the glory and ecstasies of success transcends material limitations.
There are no social, financial standards, academic principles or disciplines that governs this migration and this quantum shift in leadership visions
Let me welcome you to a bold and daring journey in search of our undiscovered cognitive instruments that will thrust our lifes to a higher state of consciousness, logics and understanding Lets make a responsible choice to move our professions and our life to a new dimension empowering us to continue our prosperity and experiences beyond its material boundaries.
We dont intend transcending to a supernatural state but we do have what it takes, to bravely say!
Yes I intend to continue serving the planet and its people for many more centuries to come, in my own chosen way.

Blueprint for Western province waste management
Meethotamulla garbage dump to become urban forest:
Additional 1,300 MT of waste daily by 2030:
Cabinet approval has been granted for a long term waste management plan for the Western Province as the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry estimates that an additional 1,300 MT of waste would be added daily by 2030.
The Megapolis Plan which includes the Colombo Port City will have a greater catastrophe than the present if waste is not managed.
In the short term, the ministry has proposed to take initiatives to stabilise the disturbed landfill at Meethotamulla in the next five months and to eventually develop it into an urban forest.
The long term proposals include granting powers to the Central Environmental Authority to issue environmental approvals, encourage the public to dispose of segregated waste and to transport only segregated waste to designated centres, start waste disposal and processing centres in Local Government authorities where more than 50,000 families reside in, commence a project to generate electricity from waste, obtain project proposals from other countries through their foreign missions regarding waste disposal projects in Aruwakkaru, Puttalam, transfer the land required for the construction of a Transfer Station at Kelaniya from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.

Bolt fears belly, but rules out U-turn
London: Usain Bolts coaches have joked that he will develop a belly within two years of retirement, but he says he has no doubts about hanging up his running spikes.
Bolt, 30, will retire after the World Championships in London in August after a sensational career in which he has amassed eight Olympic gold medals, 11 world titles and three world records.
Everybody wants me to continue, but its not as simple as it is. Ive done what I wanted to do. Ive done great in the sport, Bolt told the BBC in a television interview to be broadcast on Saturday.
People just want to see more and more, but you as a person have to decide that this is it. I dont want to continue and then start losing, because I hate losing.
Though famously fond of the high life, Bolt says he does not intend to lose control of his waistline once he stops competing.
I have a bet with my managers. Theyve given me two years before I get a belly, he said with a chuckle.
I cant let that happen. AFP

Wildlife Photography Tips for Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest 2017
Chitral Jayatilake heads Cinnamon Nature Trails, the award-winning wildlife and adventure tourism division of Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts and one of Sri Lanka's leading eco-excursion providers. If you are getting ready to submit your entries for the Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest 2017, then make sure to go through the below tips, which Jayatilake has compiled after years of experience photographing wildlife whilst on safari.
Spoilt for choice:
If youre a photo buff with an eye for all that is wild and free, then Sri Lanka truly is an incredible destination to embark on an adventure with your camera at hand.
This island is home to 21 million people, over five thousand elephants (who gather in the north-central province each year), the highest density of leopards in the world and over 500 species of birds.
Think big - Choose a wide range of subjects:
Wildlife photography doesnt just have to feature larger more charismatic animals, also consider photographing birds, insects and lesser-known species.
You need to train your eye to capture an animals essence and behavior and always consider lighting, the combination of a timely capture with the use of correct lighting can lead to an award-winning shot.
Pay attention to the basics but break the rules:
Like children in a playground, photographers also have the opportunity to push rules and boundaries and simply have fun. Whilst its important to keep basic composition and lighting techniques in mind, dont be afraid to chase different types of lighting like the soft golden hue that falls before a sunset.
Different types of lighting and situations and creative approaches that are handled with some control can also lead to you capturing beautiful images.
Cropping counts:
Cropping your image well can really bring your subject to life. When taking your photos, keep the option of doing a tight crop in mind, when leaving space around your subject. Many moods can be captured when you zoom into the eyes of an animal  which are powerful windows into their world and can tell you the story of their constant struggle to survive and thrive in the wild.
Control what you can:
Wildlife photography isnt always about finding the perfect light, sometimes you have to learn how to control the light around you to simply capture the moods of your subject to the best of your ability. Also try your best to retain control of depth and shooting speeds, to create images with character.
Remember its a waiting game:
Waiting is a game that you need to master when it comes to wildlife photography. Great moments wont just pop up in front of you. You will have to patiently seek out your subjects, wait for the right conditions and hope for a little luck along the way that will enable you to capture an unforgettable moment.
Remember to always go on safari with an experienced guide and to never ever obstruct a wild animals path or interfere with their natural activity or behaviour. You will always have a rich variety of parks and destinations to explore in Sri Lanka, so make sure to immerse yourself in your natural surroundings and take a variety of pictures.
I truly believe that Sri Lanka has so much to offer and the island to me is one of the best wildlife photography destinations in the world, and one that can rival Africa.

THAI COURTESIES FOR ELDERS
A few days ago I was in Bangkok in connection with the annual Songkran celebrations which coincide with our Sinhala New Year celebrations.
During my visit I had to use the SKY TRAIN or BTS as the Thais usually refer it to.
At one of the stations I had to change the currency note I had into coins so as to purchase the ticket from the vending machine.
Once I got the change in coins I went to the vending machine and was checking the fare applicable to my journey and was about to insert the coins into the machine when a female security officer came up to me and indicated that the officer at the ticket counter wanted me to come.
I was surprised as I had done no wrong.
When I went up to her she requested for my passport.
I usually never carry my passport with me when travelling in Thailand but on this particular day since I was carrying my brief case with me I had my passport which I produced. She opened it and went through the personal details and saw her noting some thing down. A few minutes later she handed my passport back and also gave me a Green Colour Ticket and said I need not pay for the journey as I was a Senior Citizen even though not a Thai National. Usually this journey of about 12 kilometres would have cost about 40 to 50 Bhat or about US$ 1.50. I thanked her, and went on the journey.
On the return, about 2 hours later too I was given the same FREE Travel facility.
I dont know if this facility was just for that day only or its the usual practice in Thailand.
I know for subways they give a discount of 50% to Senior Citizens.
I hope our own transport authorities will follow their good example.
Thank you THAILAND for courtesies offered to Senior Citizens

Seneviratne said there has been a general understanding in the European Union (EU) that even though improvements could be made in the above sectors, the present achievements can justify Sri Lankas efforts to regain GSP Plus.

Contempt of Court action against Padeniya
Has condemned Court of Appeal judgement:
Filed by civil society activists:
Two civil society activists yesterday filed a Contempt of Court action in the Court of Appeal against Government Medical Officers Associations (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya seeking the Courts Constitutional jurisdiction against Dr. Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya as respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding to annulment or setting aside of the said judgement. The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following the Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised island wide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners further stated on the same day the GMOA had organised a protest march which ended up in a public rally and at the said public rally held opposite the Fort Railway Station the respondent Dr. Padeniya delivered a speech and in that speech he had deliberately, maliciously and contemptuously made statements in relation to the Court Process, the Judgement and the conduct of the Court and the Attorney General with regard to the issue of SAITM medical faculty.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several media channels and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under the topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged for the offence of Contempt of the Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case.
They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

Court orders Neymar to stand trial for fraud
Madrid: A Spanish court on Thursday ordered Barcelonas Brazilian star Neymar and his parents to stand trial over alleged fraud and corruption in the players transfer from Santos in 2013.
The National Court also ordered Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell, as well as the two clubs, Barcelona and Brazils Santos, to be sent to trial over the affair.
They will stand trial for business corruption and fraud, the court said in a statement. Neymars arrival from Brazils Santos has been a huge success for the Spanish champions on the pitch but a judicial nightmare off it.
The 25-year-old striker is being investigated in Brazil and Spain over his headline move to La Liga.
Barcelona originally published the transfer figure as 57.1 million euros ($62.3 million), with 40 million euros of that given to the players family.
But Spanish authorities believe the true transfer figure was at least 83 million euros. In November, prosecutors recommended that the striker be handed a two-year jail sentence and a fine of 10 million euros for alleged corrupt practices. AFP

Domestic electricity consumers to get time based optional tariff
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, approved a time based, optional tariff, for the single phase domestic consumers, which was earlier limited only for the consumers who have three phase connections and consuming 30A or above, PUCSL said issuing release yesterday.
The release adds: "The time of use (TOU) tariff was identified as it would benefit for the domestic users and aims to demote power usage during the peak time and promote power usage during the off peak time. "The decision came into light sighting the observation of an increasing fleet of electric vehicles (EV) in Sri Lanka and the increase of the peak demand on account of their charging load.
"Proposing the tariff change, Ceylon Electricity Board said, the studies undertaken by western utilities have found that uncontrolled natural consumer behaviour for vehicle charging invariably contributes to the evening peak.
The world is driving towards more clean and efficient use of energy and most of the countries are in the process of electrifying the transport sector encouraging the energy efficiency. Considering the facts of energy efficiency and environmentally friendliness, a big wave has been created by people in moving towards electric vehicles around the world.
The extension of ToU tariff to the single phase domestic users plans to encourage energy efficiency and will benefit by the EV users in Sri Lanka, where they can charge their vehicles at a lower cost, PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said."

New Delhi: Big-hitters like Chris Gayle have long hogged the Twenty20 limelight but this season's Indian Premier League has proved that elegant, old-school batting is just as important in cricket's shortest format.
South Africa's Hashim Amla has been delighting cricketing purists by racking up large totals with his conventional style of play while Kane Williamson of New Zealand is also showing there's more to T20 than power. T20 is not about sixes... T20 is about making sure that there are no dot balls [deliveries on which no run is scored] and both these batsmen have made sure that there are very few dot balls, Indian batting great Sunil Gavaskar told AFP.
Playing the ball according to its merit and keep the scoreboard ticking is the key. That's how they have been more successful this year.
You look at the entire T20 game and you will see that any time there will be more boundaries than sixes. And you can hit the boundaries along the ground, you can hit them one bounce into the fence, he added.
Amla has amassed 315 runs in eight matches for Kings XI Punjab, including a maiden T20 century -- one of four tons to have been hit so far in the tenth edition of the IPL.
The 34-year-old right-hander, famed for his classic stroke-playing, has also notched two half-centuries and has been instrumental in putting his team in contention for a play-off place. Amla has recorded 12 sixes and 32 fours while maintaining a strike-rate of 140. Williamson has accumulated 228 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad in just five matches, including a sublime match-winning knock of 89 against Delhi Daredevils. The 26-year-old New Zealander has hit just 17 fours and nine sixes and has kept his run-rate, which is above 160, topped up by his ability to sneak in quick singles and twos.
I think it's a big myth that T20 is just for power-hitters. Even players like (India legend) Rahul Dravid and Amla have a fairly impressive white-ball average, Dileep Premachandran, editor-in-chief of Wisden India, told AFP.
If you look at Amla's significant innings in this IPL, there have been big hits as well. Most of these batsmen have enhanced their repertoire significantly, Premachandran added.
The success of Amla and Williamson this season has overshadowed the performances West Indies' Gayle and Proteas ODI captain AB de Villiers, who usually dominate coverage of the IPL with their big-hitting antics. The pair have failed to fire for a struggling Royal Challengers Bangalore side this time around with Gayle picking up 152 runs in six matches and de Villiers 196 in seven.
Left-handed Australian David Warner is still flying the flag for the powerful hitters and leads the runs table with 489 but the exploits of Amla and Williamson show that the graceful shot-players can also thrive in T20.
Players like Amla and Williamson should not be branded and said that they can play 'X' form of cricket, former Indian women's captain and IPL commentator Anjum Chopra told AFP. It was only a matter of time before they established themselves as a force to reckon with in the IPL, she added.

Encroachers of Nuwarawewa reservation to face legal action
The Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Department is to take back reservation lands of the Nuwarawewa that were occupied by encroachers at present.
The Nuwarawewa is the main water source for over 3,000,000 people.
The zonal irrigation authorities have informed the Anuradhapura Government Agent that nearly 100-acre of lands of the tank reservation were occupied by the encroachers.
Many encroachers have built tourist hotels, holiday resorts, and houses on the tank bed harming the very tank's existence.
The irrigation officials said several government departments and agencies are among the encroachers.
Anuradhapura Chief Irrigation Engineer Jayantha Silva said legal steps were taken already to remove 100 encroachers.
"Recently we acquired two lands where the encroachers have built unauthorised building. We intend to demolish three other such buildings in the near future, the Chief Irrigation Engineer said. He said an attempt to get permission to put up a tourist hotel within the Tisawewa reservation was thwarted recently at the eleventh hour by the irrigation authorities.

Ensure being insured
Plight of Kolonnawa flood victims After one year:
Sitthy Aisha found her ideal home in a narrow lane in 100 Watte, Kolonnawa eight years ago. A single storey house is what she could afford with her meagre living as a dressmaker and a deadbeat husband. Over the eight years, she saved up enough money to add another floor to her house and as her house changed, so did her neighbourhood. She was also not the only new resident to the neighbourhood in 2009, this was the same year that the Meethotamulla garbage dump moved into their area and drove down further property values in the area.
In 2016, tragedy struck in the form of the May floods and her home was inundated with toxic water that had flown through the Meethotamulla dump. Kolonnawa was one of the worst hit areas due to the floods and residents had to not only deal with flood water but also disease and sanitation problems due to the dump.
I had to replace the electrical wiring, fix the cracks that had appeared and repaint the whole house. More importantly I had to spend a lot of money on cleaning up the dirty water, said Aisha disgruntled, with the government compensation she received to rebuild her house one year later.
Aisha was one of many 427,918 people who were affected by the floods and landslides which took place in May 2016. The Ministry of Disaster Management recorded 474 houses to be fully damaged, with 3,674 houses partially damaged due to floods and landslides.
The floods took place six weeks after the government had taken out a national natural disaster insurance policy for all citizens in the country and it is this that would provide all with the basic funds to get back on their feet.
National Natural Disaster Insurance
The natural disaster insurance scheme was introduced in April 2016. The Ministry of Finance took the policy from us with the intention of covering the uninsured public; especially those in the lower income groups who would not otherwise have access to insurance, said the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), Chairman Manjula de Silva.
The NITF was initially established in 2006 as a statutory body to offer Agrahara Insurance to the public sector employees. In addition they also offered insurance to cover strikes, riots, civil commotion and terrorism. They also offered re-insurance, which is compulsory, to all insurance companies in the country.
The 2016 natural disaster insurance scheme was far sighted at the time and made use of the NITFs reinsurance policy. The NITF guaranteed Rs 100,000 in compensation for a death and a maximum of Rs 2.5 million for property damage to houses and small and medium enterprises (turnover less than Rs 10 million).
There was no insurance scheme for natural disasters earlier. Whenever disaster struck, the government would have to cough up whatever compensation through the Treasury. This took a heavy toll on the Treasury and made budgeting for the year unpredictable. With us taking on the risk, it makes it easier on the Budget, explained de Silva.
The insurance scheme also ensured that all affected parties would at least get the minimum of compensation rather than having to wait for the government to dole out any amount they fancied. The scheme also meant that the amounts would not change with the changing of government.
The NITF has also re insured with other global re insurers such as Munich Re, Allianz and part of the Lloyds market, so that they would not have to take on all the risk and it also allowed them to claim compensation from these insurers, when the toll was too high.
The floods
When the floods struck, the NITF had to gear up for action.
Immediately after a disaster, the people have to be provided with immediate relief in terms of food and shelter. Hence we released Rs 131 million for immediate relief through the Ministry of Disaster Management. Thereafter, we found that 60,000 houses had been affected to different degrees. For this we gave Rs 10,000 as an advance to each household at a total cost of Rs 602 million, said De Silva.
Once the initial needs were met, the government started to conduct assessments of all property damages. The assessments conducted through Divisional Secretariats and other agencies has taken over a year to complete and this has left many complaining that the government has not provided many flood victims with compensation as of yet.
De Silva however assured that most claims have been settled by now,
We have received 56,000 claims for property damage and contents. Even contents were covered. Out of that, we have already paid 26,000 claims. Many came in recently; it took a long time for the assessment process to conclude. We have paid Rs 1.5 billion in claims. There are about 28,000 more claims which have reached the final stage and we will settle them soon.
We paid most of the claims from outstations already. It was only the ones from Kolonnawa and Kaduwela, the more affected areas which got late, they only came in March this year. We are processing claims worth Rs. 1.2 billion from Kolonnawa and Kaduwela. We also have another Rs 1.1 billion pending and they need to be checked more, explained de Silva.
Most of these claims however, are for smaller amounts. Though the numbers are large, the claims are very small as the worst affected are small houses but they can be re-built easily. Bigger houses can easily take it, they have minor repairs and the house would not collapse, he added. In total, the floods cost the NITF Rs 3.8 billion in claims, a colossal sum which would have taken a hit on both the NITF and the Treasury.
Because we have re-insurance, we dont have to pocket out the whole amount. We only have to bear the first Rs 500 million and 20 percent of the balance amount. Thus, we recovered around Rs 2.6 billion from our re insurers, he said.
Not sufficient
While the insurance scheme has worked well for the government, not all are satisfied with the compensation amount.
Aisha complained that she only received Rs 10,000 and was not given the rest as of yet. She explained that this was barely sufficient to cover all her expenses. While she waits for her balance payment, the NITF Chairman stressed that they could not raise the threshold for claims too much as it would cause protest among private insurance providers who would not be able to sell their own schemes to the public. In addition, the government would have to pay greater premiums for higher claims.
De Silva once again emphasized that the government insurance scheme was for the worst affected and not for those who could afford to take out private insurance schemes.
For the government however, the natural disaster insurance scheme has come in handy over the last year and it has come to the rescue many a time. With climate change increasing the frequency of natural disasters however, insurance premiums are likely to rise. Last year (April 1, 2016 - March 31, 2017), the government paid an initial premium of Rs 300 million, but after the series of disasters, the NITF requested that the premium be increased. This year they have approved Rs 500 million as the yearly premium payment,
It is still insufficient, I would be more comfortable with around Rs 700-800 million in premiums, said de Silva.
Other disasters
The call for higher premiums is not unjustified as last year was also a bad a year for natural disaster insurance payments. Apart from the floods, the NITF had to also pay for compensation to victims of the Aranayake landslide.
According to the chairman, they have thus far paid 86 claims worth Rs 3.7 million to compensate against partial damages to houses, damages to contents, etc. He added that claims have not been submitted as of yet by the Divisional Secretary in respect of 72 fully damaged houses. I believe, there is a delay in finding alternate land. We have made adequate provisions to pay these claims and are ready to pay them as soon as they are submitted, said de Silva.
The Salawa tragedy however was not covered by the NITF as it was neither a natural disaster nor was it an act of terrorism.
This year, we had the Meethotamulla disaster. We received a scientific opinion from the National Building and Research Organization (NBRO) and Meteorology Department which said that the proximate cause for the collapse on that day was heavy rain which increased the weight of the dump and caused it to collapse. On that understanding we agreed to pay compensation, said de Silva.
The NITF however can only cover the basic insurance and given the circumstances of the collapse, the President had made a decision to add to the basic cover to increase the compensation amount.
Apart from this, the continuing drought and the resulting crop failures have added to the burden of compensation. The Agrarian Insurance Board generally pays for crop damage but since last year, the claims have been too much for them to bare alone.
We collect the crop levy charged from all financial institutions and this year we have been asked to support the Agrarian Insurance Board, meet its claims. We have already released Rs 1 billion for crop insurance claims and an additional Rs 500 million is to be released soon. But we cannot go beyond that, said the NITF Chairman. Further drought claims would thus have to be met by the Treasury.
Making insurance sustainable
Unlike other countries, many of these insurance schemes are offered more or less free to the public with the general public paying little or nothing in return.
It is true that this is not exactly insurance, as insurance is a contributory scheme. For example, the farmers have not contributed to crop insurance but get the money anyway. There is a question of sustainability in the long term, said de Silva. But Sri Lankans are not likely to pay for natural disaster insurance anytime soon.
Despite the floods, Aisha is not interested in taking on a private insurance cover for her home. Her neighbours in the meantime, have considered taking on a policy but none of the private companies are willing to insure them, given that the area had already been flooded and was next to the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
Fathima Samad, who lives a few streets away from Aisha has better means, but her house too was not insured. We never thought our area would flood, she said.
Whether the people are too risky to be insured or are not interested in insurance, de Silva noted that natural disaster insurance would be as important as car insurance in future. People never think it will happen to them. Until they themselves experience it, they do not know the importance of it, he said.
The NITF
As insurance becomes more important, the NITF has turned into one of the few government agencies which are profitable.
Despite the risks, we have maintained our finances and AA minus rating from Fitch. In 2016, we contributed Rs 3.2 billion to the Treasury as profit. Some years it was Rs 4 billion, said de Silva.
Peace too has contributed extremely well to the NITFs profits which was earlier to doling out more money in claims for incidents of terrorism and riots.
Natural Disasters however are not all that bad for insurers, a report released by the Indian RnR Market research group in 2016 stated that while they expected the global catastrophe insurance market to grow at a CAGR of 5.49 percent from 2016-2020, climate change would be the main driver of the markets growth.
Recent extreme weather events have increased in frequency. As such, insurers must not rely only on historical data, but further refine their forward projections. Since the insurance industry is cyclical, insurance companies must learn to adapt and come up with strategies to bring in stable revenue to earn positive yields, said the report.
They also stated that America would be the foremost market in terms of catastrophe insurance, with revenues of over US$ 47 billion by 2020, or over 65 percent of the total market.
The greatest challenge to the NITF however, is that it has no technical expertise to prepare the needed projections. The Chairman stated that they had sought the assistance of the World Bank in developing modelling scenarios, but they also needed trained professionals in the field to work with.
At present Sri Lanka only has 4-5 qualified risk engineers and a total of 10 qualified actuaries. We often have to depend on international expertise, said de Silva.
The increase in natural disasters also makes it harder to find re-insurers willing to take on the risk. After our first year of claims, certain international insurers are reluctant when it comes to Sri Lanka.
When they pay such huge claims, it takes around 20-25 years to recover, he said, but given the profits in the last few years through the terrorism and riot insurance covers, the NITF has maintained a good record with the re-insurers.
The NITF has is also a more stable company given that it has a base of 1.3 million government servants who take on the compulsory Agrahara Insurance Scheme. The more people you have, the less riskier it is and more predictable it becomes, said de Silva.

Export earnings decline, trade deficit widens
Sri Lankas external sector demonstrated a modest performance in January with trade deficit widening as a result of increased import expenditure and a decline in export earnings, the Central Bank said.
Foreign currency receipts in terms of earnings from tourism recorded a relatively high growth in January 2017 while workers remittances grew at a moderate rate, year-on-year. The government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) witnessed net outflows during January 2017, the CBSL said yesterday.
Earnings from exports at US$ 865 million in January 2017 registered a 3.8 per cent decline, year-on-year, compared to US$ 899 million in January 2016, reflecting subdued performance mainly in earnings from industrial exports despite an increase recorded in agricultural exports.
Export earnings from industrial exports, which account for about 77 per cent of total exports, declined by 6.7 per cent, year-on-year, to US$ 668 million in January Economic Research Department 2017.
This was mainly due to the decline in earnings from textiles and garments, rubber products and gems, diamonds and jewellery. Earnings from textiles and garments exports, which account for around 49 per cent of total export earnings, contracted by 8.2 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 426 million in January 2017, reflecting lower demand for garments from both traditional and non-traditional markets. Export earnings from rubber products and gems, diamonds and jewellery declined by 18.7 per cent and 28.8 per cent, respectively, due to decreases in all sub categories related to both items. In addition, earnings from leather, travel goods and footwear also contributed substantially to the decline in industrial products during January 2017.
However, export earnings from machinery and mechanical appliances, base metals and articles, printing industry products and wood and paper products showed a growth in January 2017, when compared to the previous year. Earnings from agricultural exports grew by 7.9 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 194 million in January 2017 reflecting improved performances in all subsectors except minor agricultural products and unmanufactured tobacco.
The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka in January 2017 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy accounting for about 53 per cent of the total exports.
Expenditure on imports increased substantially by 13.2 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 1,798 million in January 2017 continuing the double digit growth in imports for the fourth consecutive month. Expenditure on intermediate goods was the main driver for this growth followed by consumer goods imports. However, expenditure on investment goods imports declined in January 2017 reversing the year-on-year growth trend started from January 2016.
Expenditure on import of intermediate goods increased in January 2017 by 18.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 950 million. This increase was mainly driven by higher expenditure on fuel led by refined petroleum imports. Import expenditure on refined petroleum increased by 101.6 per cent, year-on-year, due to higher volumes imported as a result of increased thermal power generation with prevailing drought conditions in the country as well as higher international oil prices. In addition, gold imports, valued at US dollars 64 million in January 2017, continued to record a high growth while import of iron and steel, categorised under base metals, increased substantially. Import of textiles and textile articles, the second major import item of Sri Lanka, increased marginally by 0.8 per cent in January 2017.
Expenditure on consumer goods imports increased by 4.4 per cent, year-on-year, in January 2017 to US dollars 359 million from US dollars 344 million in January 2016.
Import expenditure on investment goods declined in January 2017 by 2.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 432 million from US dollars 444 million a year ago.
The decline in expenditure on import of transport equipment led by auto trishaws and machinery and equipment led by textile industry machinery mainly contributed to this decline. However, import expenditure on building materials increased marginally in January 2017 with higher imports of goods such as iron and steel, wood and ceramic products.

Fighting fair..!
The beheading of two Indian soldiers by the Pakistan side has left the world gasping in horror! Most of us had been led to believe, quarreling methods had changed from medieval times to now. Centuries ago, a wife who dared speak against her husband found herself under the hangmans noose. But I was only telling you your horse was lame! she cries as the rope is adjusted round her neck. You should have whispered in my ear my dear, and not allowed the horse to hear! thunders her husband as he signals the hangman to go ahead.
Times have changed, and rules have been formulated to see petty marital skirmishes and serious ones too are fought fair, though sometimes it aint so and couples need to know where to draw the line. Here are some rules that could help:
Rule One: Never speak about some weakness of your spouse, anything, which she or he confided in you, in your intimate moments. Ho! Ho! Ho! laughs the wife in a fight, You did tell me you drank from a feeding bottle till you were fifteen, that explains your love for booze! You cant give up your love for the bottle!
Beware, the hangmans noose beckons if you say such a thing!
Ill tell your friends you snore worse than a bullhorn! sniggers hubby, and its just a matter of days before he finds himself beheaded in front of his friends!
Fight fair, though lately the rules or no rules of terrorism, will tell you that there is no fairness in a killing, but then we are not talking about terrorism, or are we
I wonder, when a couple fights unfair, if it is soft terrorism at work
He cant hold his drinks, nor can he hold anything up! quips the wife and there are shockwaves in the room and sniggers from his buddies.
Thats terrorism at work, and the only thing left when husbands and wives fight like this is to part ways, or go to a counsellor, who teaches them to fight fair.
And now we learn that unfair fighting has come back to regulars in the army!
Can those soldiers who fought unfair, imagine what the families of the beheaded felt when they saw their husbands, or fathers or sons dismembered, with heads detached
Just like counsellors and psychologists do, spending time with their clients, teaching husbands and wives to fight the right way, maybe its timefor Pak to send her soldiers for therapy.
Good morning soldier, so you have come here to Geneva to learn to fight fair
Sir, I am going skiing, just leave mycopy of the Geneva Convention onfair fighting at my desk, and I will take it back with me to Pakistan!
And maybe thats why those two Indian soldiers were beheaded; the manual on fair fighting, was never opened by the other side..!

Former stars want India to play in Champions Trophy
Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar are among a group of 12 former cricketers who want India to play the upcoming Champions Trophy in England.
All the players ESPNcricinfo contacted - Tendulkar, Dravid, Zaheer Khan, Gundappa Viswanath, Sandeep Patil, Sanjay Manjrekar, Aakash Chopra, Ajit Agarkar, Venkatesh Prasad, Saba Karim, Murali Kartik, and Deep Dasgupta - were unanimous in their opinion that India should attempt to defend the Champions Trophy title that they won in 2013.
The doubt over Indias participation in the Champions Trophy arose after the BCCI missed the April 25 deadline to send its squad for the tournament to the ICC. The board had said the delay was due to operational reasons.
The concerns over Indias participation have increased since then, after the BCCI was outvoted by a massive margin at the ICC Board meeting in April, when the ICCs members approved a new constitution, governance structure and finance model. The biggest sticking point for the BCCI was the finance model, in which it stands to get a reduced share of ICC revenue when compared to the existing Big Three model.
The BCCI is divided over the issue, with a faction strongly in favour of revoking the Members Participation Agreement with the ICC, which would rule India out of hosting and participating in all ICC tournaments until 2023, the end of the present rights cycle.
A final decision on Indias participation in the Champions Trophy is likely to be taken by the BCCI at its special general body meeting on May 7 in Delhi.

France elects new President Sunday
The Second round of French Presidential election will be held next Sunday, May 7th. Emanuel Macron, candidate of the En Marchais (Forward) Movement and Marie Le Pen, candidate of the National Front, who won the first two places in the First round which took place on April 23rd will face a straight fight in the Second round.
A significant feature of the current French election is the elimination of candidates of traditional parties, both Left and Right. Macron who topped the polls with 23.9 percent votes was a complete outsider. Though not a complete new comer to the Presidential race Le Pen who promoted policies opposed to both established Republican and Socialist parties received 21.4 percent. Republican and Socialist candidates could respectively get only 19.9 and 6.4 percent. Jean- Luc-Melanchon of the Far Left received 19.6 percent with the assistance of the French Communist Party.
European leaders had a sigh of relief as Nationalist Le Pen who openly opposed European integration, adhered to an Islam-phobic policy, called for a ban on Muslim religious symbols and customs including the wearing of the hijab is likely to be defeated at the Second round. In fact European Union President broke protocol to wish Macron success at the Second round. Leaders of Germany, Greece, Spain and several other member countries of the EU also joined in greeting Macron.
Muslim Leader and Rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, Pour Dalil Baubakeer has openly called upon Muslims to support Macron. Most important is the endorsement he received from both established parties. Already polls forecasts predict an easy victory for Macron. A poll on April 30th predicted 59.9 percent votes as against40.1 percent for Le Pen.
A Macron victory would strengthen the European Union and assert more independence from the influence of the United States. The foreign policy of US President Donald Trump which is aimed at consolidating US dominance throughout the globe is likely to meet with strong resistance from the EU members including Germany.
Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike
The struggle of the Palestinian people who are denied freedom, dignity and right to life in their own motherland continues to draw public attention and solidarity across the world, despite the virtual black-out of it in the international media under the control of the imperialist monopolies.
A people denied their right to the land of their birth and thrown to neighbouring countries in hundreds of thousands as refugees are fighting for the last 100 years for a state of their own. The borders of the state of Israel established by partitioning Palestine territory in 1947 have expanded as a result of wars and other means which has relegated the Palestinians into progressively shrinking enclaves in the West Bank, (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza strip.
Since 1967 an estimated 800,000 Palestinians have been detained in Israeli prisons. It amounts to 20 percent of the population in occupied Palestine and 40 percent of the male population. Even at this moment over 6,500 are in prison and are undergoing torture, ill-treatment, punitive measure, medical neglect, family visits and other human rights.
Since 2002 more than half the Palestinian Legislative Council has been imprisoned and 13 are still in prison. There are 300 children under the age of 18 among the prisoners besides hundreds of sick persons.
Palestinian prisoners have launched a hunger strike since April 17th for freedom and dignity, a fact hardly mentioned in our local media. It is a reflection of the worsening situation in prisons. Even the International Committee of the Red Cross is not allowed to visit Israel even for a fact-finding mission.
Election of President Trump has emboldened the Israel government which immediately passed a law to legitimize, consolidate and expand building Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory.
The not so well-thought comments of President Trump of moving the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and a possible dropping of the US stance on a two-state solution to the Palestinian problem caused much anxiety among the world public.
He has, however, retraced his steps and is currently engaged in an attempt to find a solution through negotiations. President Abbas of Palestine is to meet him shortly, Meanwhile, in a dramatic development Hamas, which controls the Gaza strip, has proclaimed a new policy which accepts the frontiers of the Palestinian state with 1967 borders though not recognizing Israel directly.
This is a more pragmatic move and it would facilitate unity among different Palestinian factions, which alone would strengthen their position at any negotiations.
It has also shown its independence from the Muslim Brotherhood by not referring to it in the new policy document, a step acknowledged as a conciliatory move to enlist the support of Egypt.
Tensions rise in the Korean peninsula
Tension is increasing in the Korean peninsula as North Korea continues to test nuclear weapons and South Korean armed forces are engaged in military drills with the United States Armed Forces. A US aircraft carrier has reached the Korean waters, a move treated as menacing and dangerous by North Korea and China.
North Korea faces the wrath of the United Nations and Western powers over its nuclear weapon programme. The irony of it is that those challenging the right of North Korea to have a nuclear deterrent capacity have themselves amassed hundreds and thousands of nuclear weapons and are still improving them.
Japan, showing its defence prowess also took the unprecedented step of escorting the US aircraft carrier to Seoul from Tokyo. China is naturally disturbed over these developments. While showing its displeasure at the North Korean moves it has called for restraint in finding a solution to the Korean issue. China has also objected to the positioning of the US missile defence system THAAD in South Korea. It is considering it also as a measure likely to sour Sino-US relations.
It should also be kept in mind that almost 30,000 US troops are in South Korea and that the United States has decided to consider the Pacific Ocean region as their priority number One, which replaced its previous priority given to the Atlantic Ocean.
An armed confrontation in the Korean peninsula is likely to spread far beyond the Korean peninsula and that is why a diffusion of the current tension is a priority. Much depends on the international community, especially the United States, China, Russia and Japan in seeking a solution to the problem through the revival of the Six-nation talks that includes the above countries together with the two Koreas.

## Title: Free OPD care at NFTH despite GMOA strike

Free OPD care at NFTH despite GMOA strike
The Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) in Malabe, operating under the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) will open its Out Patient Department (OPD) to the public, free of charge today in view of the island wide strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
The decision comes in the wake of the recent strike by the GMOA, which crippled the healthcare services of the country, particularly in the OPD units of state hospitals, a statement issued by SAITM said.
SAITM and the NFTH Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando said the GMOA strikes are launched against SAITM, supposedly in the interest of the publics health and wellbeing, which they claim are at risk because SAITM students do not have enough clinical exposure. Regrettably, their strikes are taking place at a time when the nation is facing grave health issues and the public is in need of all healthcare professionals in the country. Its nothing short of tragic that the GMOA is holding patients at ransom to pursue selfish personal agendas and political schemes.
Dr. Fernando reiterates that the NFTH was established in 2012 after SAITM MBBS students were refused access to state hospitals for clinical training by the GMOA. Then too, the GMOA threatened strike and halted SAITM MBBS students from undergoing clinical training at state hospitals, even after these students were officially directed to Homagama Base Hospital and Thalangama Hospital by the government.
He strongly condemns the GMOAs rejection of the governments stand on SAITM, which aims to standardize medical education in Sri Lanka, subject SATIM students to further clinical training and examinations as per the formalized standards of medical education in Sri Lanka and align the NFTH under the Ministry of Health.
The statement released by SAITM added: Operating a non-state medical university such as SAITM will save millions of rupees otherwise spent as outward remittances to overseas medical institutes, provide choice for qualified youth to pursue their education in medicine locally, offer scholarship opportunities for students that lose state university entry by a few points due to the district quota system and importantly fill the dire dearth of doctors in the country.
Dr. Fernando states, SAITM will extend its fullest support to the Government to maintain quality and standards in medical education of Sri Lanka and SAITM will continue to serve the general public of the country regardless of the various obstacles and allegations leveled at the institute by vested parties.
In view of the distress the public may face on May 5, the NFTH will open its OPD services and all NFTH medical practitioners and staff will be at hand for patients in need of treatment, the statement added.

Gampola gripped with tension following twin abductions
Two abductions reported in Gampola within a week have caused tension among residents in the area. A two-and a half-year-old boy and his uncle had been abducted by unidentified persons as they were walking towards a shop at circular road beside the Gampola Bus stand on May 3 afternoon, according to a complaint made to the Gampola Police.
The boy is named Mohamed Salman and his uncle Abdul Raheem Nizam. The complaint was made by the boys father Mohamed Rishaf following a telephone call received by him around 3.30 pm informing him about it.
Rishaf had stated in the complaint that Nizam was his nephew resident in Badulla and he had come to his house to attend a medical clinic at the Kandy hospital on May 4. When Nizam volunteered to take noon meals to their shop the boy too had wanted to accompany him. Another abduction of two persons was reported in Gampola one week ago and these abductions have caused tension among the people in Gampola.

GMOA led token strike today
Over 30 trade unions in the health, education and transport sectors will launch a token strike on May 5 (today) at 8.00 am in protest against SAITM. The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will make sure that no patient dies and all maternity and childrens hospitals will function as usual. The strike will not affect the functions of the Maharagama Cancer Hospital, all kidney treatment institutions, all accident wards countrywide, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday the GMOA Secretary said the safety of patients lives and the quality of medical education should be protected on behalf of the countrys innocent poor people who cannot afford to obtain medical treatment from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore. There is no problem for the persons who can afford to seek medical treatment from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the token strike will end on may 6th at 8.00 am but this will be the commencement of contentious strike to be launched countrywide in all sectors if an acceptable solution is not found to the SAITM crisis by May 9th. There is no use of unrealistic talks and proposals. The set of proposals presented to the Government one month ago by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (FMTAs) should be implemented.
Dr. Zoysa pointed out that the suppression of trade unions has already commenced. But nothing or no one will be able to stop the GMOA until the Government takes over SAITM. Three persons, one of them armed had come in search of the Convener of Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (FMTAs) Dr. M.C. Weerasinghe. A formal complaint in connection with the incident has already been lodged at the Borella Police station. It is hope that the police will solve it similarly to how they solved Sameera Senaratne shooting drama.
Railway drivers and guards will join the token strike launched by the GMOA over SAITM issue.
However, station masters and railway controllers will not join the trade union action.

GMOA now a JO tag
So the battle lines are drawn, and, what s more, the cat is out of the bag. The Joint Opposition has decided to support the doctors strike, called for today, over the SAITM issue plus ETCA and the Trincomalee oil tank matter. Anyway, the coming together of the GMOA and JO was always on the cards from the tone and tenor of the GMOA's attacks on the government and it was only a matter of time before the marriage was official. The GMOA is making no bones of the fact that it is now a fully fledged political entity by co-opting the JO in today's strike action. Nay, it has thrown away it's fig leaf that gave it cover as an apolitical entity and has plunged headlong into the lap of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
As stated, the development was not unexpected. The doctors had all along showed what their game was and where their loyalties lay. The GMOA President too only three weeks ago went on a harangue, virulently attacking government ministers at a meeting, opposite the Fort Railway Station.
The JO stalwarts, for their part, may be keen on sustaining the momentum of what they call the largest May Day crowd in history, by joining in the doctors strike. But they will only be exposing themselves as a bunch of hypocrites (not that they are already not). The SAITM issue did not originate with the Yahapalanaya government. It was set up with the blessings of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Ditto for the private medical facility at the Kotalawela Defence Academy. The mortal fear of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa muzzled the likes of Panadenia and Naveen De Zoysa at the time. By coming out only now, with all guns blazing at the present government, the GMOA has only exposed itself to ridicule.
Things are now laid in black and white. The doctors Trade Union has now come out into the open to shamelessly be part and parcel of the 'Bring Back Mahinda project. No amount of protestations by the doctors are going to now convince the public that members of the GMOA are the do-gooder medicos and champions of the cause of the patients, they portrayed themselves to be, but the palanquin bearers of a political leader to whom they are beholden for past favours. The doctors may have very good reasons for seeing the back of the Yahapalanaya government. The drastic reduction of the prices of essential drugs by the present government has hit the doctors badly. The cash strapped drug companies will not be able to fund the foreign junkets of the doctors as in the past. They (doctors) believe that a return of Rajapaksa would restore the status quo.
Doctors are highly regarded professionals, held in high esteem by society and looked upon by ordinary folk as gods for their life saving abilities and the healing touch. As such they should not mar this reputation by conduct that is unseemly of practitioners of a noble profession. The doctors are within their rights to fight for wrongs and injustices visited upon their profession and they can be assured the public will be behind them in their struggles. But members of the medical profession should not be seen to be getting themselves involved in political projects, especially attempts to bring defeated politicians back to power. This is exactly what the GMOA is doing today at the cost of suffering patients.
The doctors could not be unaware of the contempt in which the public at large hold our present day politicians, known for their corruption and sleaze. By supporting these politicians in the open the doctors too are bound to be held in contempt and run the risk of being painted with the same brush.
In any event the GMOA should not concern itself with issues outside the remit of medical practitioners. The doctors have now extended the scope of their demands beyond the SAITM issue to include matters such as ETCA and the Trincomalee oil tanks which are areas related to trade and economics and foreign relations. They cannot dictate what the government should do or not do and venture to teach it how the economy should be run. As educated professionals the doctors are well aware that today we live in a globalized set up with borders of nations blurred and economies integrated. Sri Lanka too is naturally drawn into this world order and we can live in isolation only at great cost to the country. Trade and economic agreements between the countries, particularly neighbours, are a natural outcome of this set up. Concerns about sovereignty or the adverse fall out to the country as a result of these agreements no doubt has to be considered and doubts cleared. But Sri Lanka cannot afford to fall behind the rest of the world as a result of parochial considerations.
The government, on its part, should not hesitate to face the strike called for today, squarely, and ensure essential services are not disrupted in anyway. If it has to take drastic measures towards this end, so be it.

Promise fulfilled within 28 days:
Public servants had been given an election pledge within 11 years to increase their salaries, but the good governance administration fulfilled it within 28 days.
The government expects further productivity from public workers, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister was speaking at the opening of a new office for the Management Service Department of the Finance Ministry on Wednesday.
The minister said the aim of the government is to set up a better environment for public workers to achieve 100 percent productivity in the service.
Minister Karunanayake said 1.4 million workers are employed in the public service. Rs. 600 billion is required to pay their salaries. Another Rs.182 billion is required to pay pension.
The money is paid by the public. Public servants should commit themselves to provide a better service to the people in return, he said.
The minister said: "We can remember how the previous regime pledged the public workers during their 11 year tenure that they would increase public sector salary. However, we granted a historic salary increment for the public servants, 28 days after our government assumed power. We expect the public sector to mete out justice in return."

A doubt arises whether the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is bribed by the Lanka Transformers Limited (LTL), Voice Against Corruption Movement Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe said.
He said the LTL could bribe the FCID to prevent the complaints lodged against the LTL about the large scale financial frauds from execution.
He was addressing the media after lodging a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat against the LTL over the alleged financial frauds.
Sixty three percent shares of the LTL is owned by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and dividends are yet to be received by the CEB from the profits earned by the LTL Samarasinghe said.

Her tiny kitchen on the world map
106-year-old Masthanamma lives in a small thatched hut in a village about 10 kilometres away from Tenali. She has been living independently since the time she lost her husband at the age of 22, and has worked in the paddy fields until the age of 105.
The people in the village associate her with a banyan tree - majestic, wise and authoritative. The woman who used to be known only to a handful of people as someone who cooks her own food, has lately become an international sensation in the culinary world, with over 43 million views on YouTube!
The channel that hosts Masthanamma, Country Foods, was started by her great grandson Laxman K., and his friend Srinath Reddy.
It shows the granny, as she is called in the videos, cook up exotic dishes in a traditional style, from an elaborate chicken feet curry to a simple egg omelette.
Srinath says, Both of us were video editors and we took a liking to cooking. We started the channel in August last year and put up around 40 videos of us cooking. They were doing okay, but once we got granny on board, the views shot up! Our channel now has over two lakh subscribers. Just within a day, a video gets one lakh views.
He adds, Laxman did not know much about his great grandmother. Once, we decided to go on a holiday to his village. There, when we told people about our channel, Laxmans mother told us that granny cooks well. The first recipe she cooked was an eggplant curry and it was great! Initially, she had no idea of the Internet. When we went back and showed her the videos, she understood what a celebrity she has become.
Recalling one of the most gratifying moments, Laxman says, We celebrated her birthday recently and she received a sari from a subscriber from Pakistan. Another Indian family from New Zealand invited her over to felicitate her. However, she is too attached to her hut in which she has been living for over 90 years, so even though her son stays next door and wants her to stay with him, she doesnt want to be dependent. She was married at the age of 11 and lost four of her five children to Cholera, so she has got used to living by herself. Deccan Chronicle

India to challenge Chinese monopoly on naval vessel
Amid increased Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean Region, India has expedited supplying naval vessels to its neighbours to sustain its hold in the region. Once the naval vessel is delivered to Mauritius, Indias Goa Shipyard is expected to transfer an offshore patrol vessel to Sri Lanka next month.
The Mauritius was given the second Fast Patrol Vessel and Sri Lanka is to get an advanced offshore patrol vessel (OPV). The ships to both the countries have been delivered months before schedule. Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) has also begun work on the second OPV destined for the Sri Lankan Navy on Tuesday which is scheduled to deliver next year.
India has the capability to build such vessels and give them to friendly countries. We are cooperating with all our neighboring countries, and wherever we have weapons, we can cooperate and be a partner in their security setup. From that perspective, Sri Lanka is an important partner in our bilateral relationship and this OPV is a major milestone in our bilateral relationship, A K Gupta, Secretary, Defense Production said after the launch of the advanced OPV for Sri Lanka.
The Indian government had sanctioned two OPVs for Sri Lanka in 2010 and the contract for the same was signed in April 2013. The 105.7-meter-long and 13.6-meter-wide vessels have a full-load displacement capacity of 2350 ton, with an overall beam of 13.6 meters, and a hull draught of 3.6 meters.

Indian EXIM Bank funds for KKS harbour rehabilitation
Ports Authority to handle the project:
The Indian EXIM Bank will provide a loan facility for the rehabilitation of the Kankesanthurai (KKS) harbour in Jaffna.
The Cabinet on Tuesday approved Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to enter into a loan agreement with the Indian EXIM Bank for USD 45.27 million to develop the harbour.
The project is to be handled by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The development of the KKS harbour will further enhance trade activities in the North.
The harbour, an important port in the country had not been used for many years due to the war. From 1994 to 1996, the LTTE sank six ships in the harbour and its channel making it unusable.
In July 2011, the previous regime entered into an MoU with the Indian government for the rehabilitation of the KKS harbour. At the time, the Indian government in a press release stated that India has made available Rs. 2.18 billion (US$19 million) as a fully grant-funded project for the wreck removal work in Kankasanthurai. India has also funded an initial hydrographic survey, completed in June-July 2010.
The project in six phases was due to be completed in two and a half years. By 2013, India had completed the first four phases with the removal of six sunken vessels via a grant of USD 19.5 million. Work was suspended. The fifth and sixth phases remained unfinished. When the government changed in 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again broached the subject of the harbour and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had given him a positive response over the programme. The harbour when functional will be the nearest port for eastern ports in India as well as for Myanmar and Bangladesh.

## Title: Learning the ways of the lake, parrot fashion

Learning the ways of the lake, parrot fashion
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight is an expression one might expect from a pirates parrot but not a cheeky green parakeet in the middle of an ancient lake reservoir, Siyabala Weva, surrounded until 1983 by Tamarind trees. The lake is the original training ground for the Kings soldiers and a water supply that fed the ancient paddy fields. Give me a kiss, chutemanike he cries out and I learn, over sweet tea, that the chatty parakeets name, Manike, is known to come from the olden days and literally means, when used by a husband referring to his wife, very lovely and special.
I am surprised, as I suck on fruit-dipped in chilli and a little bit of sugar, that it is a parrot talking and leaving little space for her owner to explain more about this enchanting jungle area. P.W Nimal, who lives on the best bit of the lake, helps with the water buffalo crossing in front of the hotel just before sunset, and lives an idyllic life off the produce of the surrounding area. He gets rice from the paddy fields, jungle fruits and more than 60 wild, as well as home grown, herbs and spices, which his wife uses in her cooking to create a symphony of tastes in their daily rice and curry.
A Singhalese lesson
The leftovers are eaten by Manike who is rather partial to rice and, between mouthfuls, is happy to give anyone a free Singhalese lesson as long as he gets lots of kisses from his owner, Nimal, at the end and, well, another handful of rice. This is one bird that has learnt that henpecking gets you pretty much everything you want including living next door to an exciting new five star nature resort, Jetwing Lake. When the bird is asleep which is rare, Nimal puts his head right up to the birds cheek when he wakes up for a kiss, with no fear of having it pecked. In fact, it is obvious that the bird adores his owner, being happy to trim his beard and give him a head massage with his well-manicured claws, used from time to time to steal his wifes safety pins and a Singhalese lesson to hotel guests wishing to brush up on the local lingo.
The parrot only got upset if his tail was tweaked or, like a small child, if he was ignored, which put his tail totally out of joint. As the parrot repeats itself it has plenty of repeat customers who love having a teacher that does not mind saying the same thing over and over until you can say it back word perfect. The bird praises you if you get it right and if wrong will be appeased with something tasty to eat.
Nimal the owner of this lovely creature explains that he came to live in the area in 1970, as he hated Colombo and the horror of urban living. At the time, there were only three village houses and the land owned by famous local artist, Laki Senanayake; his eyes light up as, at the time, there was still an abundance of wildlife including elephants that would trample past his house, deer that would come down to the lake and drink and even a wild cat from time to time.
Although they are gone, having moved further back into the wildlife conservation areas, one can still see herds of wild water buffalo, sixty at a time, that cross the lake at around 5pm, after being herded together with big sticks by him and a little bit of push from his fellow villagers, to stop them going walk about; even as far as popping over to have a look at the Jetwing Lake swimming pool open to the stars bar. I realise the challenges of herding when I had a go and the most important lesson was keeping my nerve to which I was rewarded by the parrot saying, Well done, well done! when I returned for an evening cup of tea with my kids and to learn more about this fascinating area with the gem of a hotel naturalist Bandara.

A new acting experince!
Drama at AIS encapsulates the vigor of youth and its exuberance. Dramatic Moves features Asian International School, a school that has proved its mettle turning out some quality productions over the years.
We dont have a drama club as such, but we do regular productions for public performances every two to three years. We function as the Senior English Literary Association. We do a big public production every two to three years. We also have inter-house drama competitions, whenever we dont have the big production, said Co teacher in charge, Sandra Gomes.
A resounding success
AIS students are highly skilled. They only need a good director to steer them in the right way and they have had the services of Jerome De Silva, a director second to none.
We usually do musicals for our school public performances with a big cast. The last public performance we did was The Wiz, last month, directed by Jerome De Silva. The one in 2014 was Annie, also directed by Jerome, stated Gomes.
Gomes was also quick to point out that when it comes to drama the talent at AIS is very big.
The kids are very enthusiastic and very capable. Wiz was a resounding success. The acting was superb. We had a good director. It all turned out to be exceptionally good. We had 90 students taking part in The Wiz. Our oldest student was 16 and the youngest was 9. One of our students, Joshua Weerasingham, who took part in the Wiz, also took part in the Tempest (April 1 & 2) and Macbeth (March 25 & 26) done by the Workshop Players. He was in last years, Midsummer Nights Dream as well, explained Gomes.
Gomes pointed out that they did another big production in 2007  Joseph and the amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.
It is important for a student to do drama. It teaches them confidence and public speaking skills and it teaches them how to get along with other children. It teaches them team work and to think creatively, pointed out Gomes.
Gomes also felt that because the children have other commitments and school activities, the biggest obstacle is to find a regular time that they can all attend. But the parents are all very supportive. Sometimes practices go till very late. The parents have to make a lot of sacrifices, but they do it, said Gomes.
The students do a lot on their own. The students help in everything. We get outside people to direct them but keeping in mind that it is not feasible unless it is fun. However we have done some pretty controversial things for our inter-house competitions, but not for public performances, where we have little kids taking part. Our inter-house competitions are very intense. The competition between the four houses is very intense. They dont spend a lot of time doing it. They spend about two to three weeks of intense practice and the come up with very good performances. We usually pick on playwright and do four plays from one playwright. It is very interesting working with these kids, pointed out Gomes.
A strong foundation
Shannon Wannakuwatte, the other co-teacher in charge emphasized that this experience in drama is unlike anything else.
They are all from a range of ages, and more than anything, it fosters a sense of friendship and a feeling of togetherness, because you are meeting in a way that is different to the usual school settings. Sandra and I have a very different relationship with these bunch of kids who have acted. We like to think we are a little closer to them because we have had three or four months together with them. In drama you have a safe place you can call home with a bunch of people, said Wannakuwatte.
Wannakuwatte mentioned that working with these kids is lovely. They always pull through and it is a very rewarding experience working with them because as a teacher it is always rewarding to see your hard work bearing fruition.
The Wiz was huge for us. It was the biggest cast we have worked with and it was massive. The kids worked together and gelled so well and it was lovely. We dont have a drama club per say, we are members of the Senior English Literary Association, which kind of branches out and organizes these things  sometimes drama and sometimes debating, pointed out Wannakuwatte.
Wannakuwatte spoke about how enthusiastic the cast is, being a young one at that. We have quite a bunch of enthusiastic kids who are talented. They just need some guidance. But I am quite sure that the ones who will be coming in for drama in the future will make fabulous casts for years to come.
Wannakuwatte reflected on the fact that AIS have a strong foundation for musicals. Ishan De Lanerolle is our choir director and musicals allow a big cast. When it comes to Inter-House, the competition is really high and the standard of the plays are really high. We do a lot of musicals because we have a lot of good singers.
Really fun
Shyalina Muthumudalige, a cast member of The Wiz, recalls that her role in that production was certainly memorable. Taking part in The Wiz was really great. I met a lot of people and it was a very fun experience. Because as we all know productions bring people together. Drama is a big part of my life. I have been acting for a long time and it is home.
Taking part in Annie, was really fun. It was the second production I had taken part in and my first with Jerome De Silva. It was a little scary but it was really fun to work with a large cast and people my own age. The production I took part in before had mainly adults
It is interesting to see the world through the eyes of different people and characters. I have always had a passion for drama, said Muthumudalige.
A really big impact
Joshua Weerasingham, is a junior workshop player in addition to being a student at AIS.
It was new [acting in Workshop player productions]. I met new people. But it is also very similar because they are like these people [AIS students]. Drama has had a really big impact upon my life. This is because I started when I was really small. Since then I have been really hooked on to it. Doing Shakespeare in the Park was a new experience since it was done outdoors and the audience is all around you.
When it comes to AIS, the talent is really big. We have small kids who are very good at dancing. And then you have the seniors and when you put them all together you get a really good result. I think from the moment I started, I realized I had a passion for it, stepping into the shoes of a character and bringing that character to life, said Weerasingham
Multi-tasking
Nethmi Gunasekara, another member of The Wizspoke about being able to develop new abilities through drama.
Doing The Wiz was a new acting experience, because I had not done acting much. It was new and exciting and it was also scary. I met a lot of people and we are now very much a family. Balancing school work and drama was hard and I was facing my O/Ls but I got through somehow and in doing so learnt multi-tasking in the process, said Gunasekara.
The group unanimously agreed that they had received a lot of good reviews and that a lot of people had very nice things to say about their productions. But there were also critiques on how they can improve which is ultimately all good, since it helps them to get better.

new company registrations  fee slashed by 73%
Heavy fees levied for registering a new company has been reduced by 73%.
New companies born in Sri Lanka last year surged by 7 percent while the key state institution in charge of such new company registrations itself reporting an enormous revenue flow to its coffers in 2016.
We have reduced the fee of registration of a Private Limited Company by Rs 11,000, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said yesterday.
He said the revised charges are effective from January 1, 2017.
I am pleased to inform the House that as part of changes in fees we have reduced the fee of registration of a Private Limited Company under Form 1 by as much as Rs 11000. In that we reduced this fee from Rs 15000.00 to 4000.00 to develop entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka.
All fee changes are effective from January 1, 2017 Minister Bathiudeen said and added.
In 2016, the income of the Department of Registrar of Companies has increased by 182% to Rs 1.78 billion from 2015s Rs 632 million. Also 8289 new companies were registered in Sri Lanka in 2016. Registration of foreign companies in Sri Lanka also increased by 17% to 41 in 2016. Even new Registrations of Associations under Section 34 increased by 140% to 367 in 2016.
The bulk of the new companies annually registered in Sri Lanka are such Private Limited Companies. For example, no less than 97% of 2016s new 8289 company registrations were in this Private Limited Company category.
Three types of changes are introduced by the Registrar of Companies which comes under the purview of Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in keeping with the proposal made in Sec. 419 of Budget 2016. The three (03) changes are the Fees for Societies, Fees Regulations to renewal and registration of Auditors and introducing a new qualification to be registered as a Company Secretary in Sri Lanka, Bathiudeen said.
Among the upward fee revisions were the fee for registration of a Public Limited Company under Form 1 increased from Rs. 15000 to Rs 20000, fee for registration of an unlimited company increased from Rs. 12500.00 to Rs 15,000.00, Fee for registration of a company limited by Guarantee under Form 5 increased from Rs. 25000.00 to Rs 30000 and fee for registration of mortgages charges and debentures has been increased from Rs. 5000.00 to Rs 7500.
The Amendment on Company Secretaries has been made by the Minister using Extra Ordinary Gazette Notices No. 1998/11 dated 20th December 2016 under the section 527 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.

Newborn falsehood
Reply to Dr G C Illangakkoon:
I have read in the Ceylon Daily News of March 14 and 23 on the subject of FORCED BIRTH - CONTROL - NGO CULTURE, written by Dr. C G Illangakoon, (International Law). It is a very long article.
As the oldest living Past President and Past Patron of the Sri Lanka College of Obstrictritions and Gynecologists, I was very much perturbed by the accusations and allegations made by the author that forced abortions and forced sterilizations are being done in this country by some foreign NGOs.
Post Partum IUD programmes
This is a blatant lie, as the SLCOG and its members, around 300 serving in various parts of the country are the sole custodians of the health and welfare of the women and the unborn fetus in this country. So, the Yahapalana Government, Mahanayake Theras, and the chief incumbents of other religious denominations, do not have to resort to protests and agitations, as requested by the author, as there is no such thing happening in this country.
The College is celebrating its Golden Jubilee this year with an international congress with the participation of the World Federation FIGO, South Asian Federation, Asia & Oceania Federation, RCOG, WHO and other world organisations, in August 2017. The Maternal Mortality rates which were in the region of over 100 per hundred thousand deliveries 50 years ago have been reduced to 32 per hundred thousand by 2015. Thus we are the best in the whole of South Asia. We hope to achieve one-digit figures like that of the developed world in the foreseeable future. The College has received large amount of funds from the FIGO through the efforts of Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, who had his undergraduate education in Sri Lanka, who was the President of the RCOG and later was the President of FIGO few years back. These funds were received three years ago to carry out Post Partum IUD programmes in various parts of the country by our members and their staff. For this we have received the approval from the Ministry of Health.
The main purpose of this programme, which is been carried out in several other developing countries, is in order to space out the pregnancies, and to prevent unnecessary unsafe abortions that are been carried out in our developing countries in parts of Asia and Africa. Most of the developed countries have no problems with unsafe abortions, as abortions have been legalized in those countries. The Idea of this programme is to prevent unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.
Unsafe abortions
We have around 1,000 births a day and an equal number of unsafe abortions a day done by quacks in this country. It is well known that 60 percent of the pregnancies are unplanned and more than half of them are unwanted and people resort to abortion to get rid of them.
Many of these abortions end up in our specialized institutions with severe hemorrhage and sepsis resulting in deaths from septicemia, and many of those who survive suffer from other complications.
Today abortions are the third most common cause of maternal deaths in our country. The use of contraceptives can prevent unwanted pregnancies which would often lead to abortions by quacks ending up in unwanted deaths of young mothers with two or three children - which I consider a much greater evil and a terrible tragedy.

As it was not handed in time: Speaker:
Adjournment Motion not included in Order Paper
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, observed that the Adjournment Motion had not been included in the Order Paper yesterday, as the Joint Opposition had handed it over to the Secretary General two hours after the scheduled time.
The Speaker observed that when the Joint Opposition had neglected the time frame, he could not urge the officials to deviate from decisions that had earlier been taken on the same matters.
He made these observations yesterday, when Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group leader Dinesh Gunawardena queried as to why the adjournment motion that was to be moved by the Joint Opposition was not included in the Order Paper.
The Speaker said the Adjournment Motion had been handed over to the Secretary General at 2.25 pm on Wednesday, whereas the deadline was 12 noon the same day.
He said that due to this reason, the same was not included in the Order Paper.
At this stage MP Gunawardena said that the motion was on the strikes that was to be staged today and it was of great importance. "At least give us a chance to move the motion," MP Gunawardena said.
"The government could answer the motion some other day." "But there was no such tradition," the Speaker said. "So it cannot be allowed."
PHU leader questions as to why a principal accused of fraud was appointed to Richmond College
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila, yesterday in Parliament questioned the rationale of appointing a principal accused of an alleged financial fraud to Richmond College, Galle.
Gammanpila pointed out that Sampath Weragoda, the Principal of Richmond College in Galle, was given a charge sheet over an alleged financial fraud during the period he functioned as the Principal of Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam responding to the question, said the appointment was made on a temporary basis as there was a shortage of principals in the country. He said the disciplinary inquiry and the inquiry conducted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against the Principal had not concluded yet.
He pointed out that three salary increments of the said Principal had been deducted and that he had been thoroughly reprimanded as per the recommendation of the Public Service Commission after finding him guilty of several charges.
Gammanpila observed that this appointment was unfair to other Principals and that it encouraged bribery and corruption.
Bandula raises arguments on validity of currency notes
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, raised fresh arguments on the validity of currency notes signed by former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran in the wake of a Court ruling on the Parliamentary seat of MP Geetha Kumarasinghe.
Arjun Mahendran is a Singaporean citizen. A Singaporean citizen could not obtain a dual citizenship. Despite that, Mahendran was appointed the CB Governor and currency notes were issued under his signature. If currency notes signed by a non-Sri Lankan citizen are valid, how can MP Kumarasinghe, who even withdrew her dual citizenship, be disqualified from holding a Parliamentary seat Mahendran had not even taken oaths as per the Constitution when he assumed duties, Gunawardena said.
The MP also tabled a Rs 100 currency note signed by the former CB Governor, observing that the recent Court ruling posed a serious challenge to the validity of those currency notes.

All Ceylon Transport Employees Association General Secretary Sepala Liyanage yesterday said they will not join the government doctors proposed strike today.
Meanwhile, transport sector trade unions said there will be no impact on public transport operations conducted by Sri Lanka Transport Board or private transport operators due to the strike.
Sepala Liyanage said they have decided not to participate in the strike called by Government Medical Officers Association, but they will join with them in the steps that will follow if the government did not address the issue related to the controversial South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
Liyanage said they are against the privatization of higher education and allowing an institute such as SAITM to award medical degrees is not acceptable.
He said they are prepared to go for a general strike with all other trade unions which are set to hit the streets against SAITM in support of the doctors.
GMOA doctors said over 160 trade unions belonging to transport, education, health and other sectors have pledged their support to their strike against SAITM.
It will be carried out as an ultimatum to push the government to abolish SAITM or nationalize it, they said.
Ceylon Teachers Union Secretary Joseph Stalin said they will join the doctors strike tomorrow against SAITM.
He said principals and teachers of government schools will apply for sick leave today to participate in the strike.
He said the government is trying to privatize the countrys education system by opening private institutions. However, it will have to close down SAITM instead, Stalin said.

Some female dragonflies fake death to avoid males
A researcher has observed female dragonflies doing something that many human women have probably considered when confronted with unwanted male attention: faking death.
The University of Zurichs Rassim Khelifa, who has studied dragonflies for the past decade, told New Scientist that he was collecting moorland hawker dragonfly larva in the Swiss Alps when he first saw the phenomenon. A male was pursuing a female, at which point she dove to the ground and lay motionless on her back until the male left.
Hed never seen this behavior before, he told New Scientist. But it turns out it wasnt an isolated incident.
Khelifas study on the behavior, titled Faking death to avoid male coercion extreme sexual conflict resolution in a dragonfly, was published in the science journal Ecology this week. He observed 27 out of 31 female dragonflies attempting to avoid males in this way, and in most cases playing dead appeared to be successful.
So why might a female dragonfly be so desperate to avoid males Khelifa told Gizmodo that sex can be hazardous for the female, and that sex with a male can remove the sperm left inside the female by a previous mate.
In fact, males have evolved a sophisticated penis structure that sweeps sperm out of the reproductive tract of the female, he said. Therefore, since one copulation is enough to fertilize all eggs, it is disadvantageous to carry out extra-copulations...given the potential survival costs.
While the situation for humans isnt quite the same, a lot of women have been inspired by the idea.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday observed that he would discuss the matter of security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and keep the House informed regarding the matter.
The Speaker made this observation in response to a privilege issue raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena on the alleged reduction of the strength of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Speaker also added that he would discuss the matter with Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.
MP Gunawardena said that the former Presidents security was cut down by 45 personnel on the following day of the May Day Rally.
Former President Rajapaksa said there are threats to his life and therefore removing his security was dangerous, MP Gunawardena said. . I have already had discussions on the matter with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesnghe and Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka . Therefore, it is important that the former the Presidents security is guaranteed.
Speaker Jayasuriya responding said he would inform Parliament about the matter after discussing same with the President and the Prime Minister.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma at this stage said the former President has a greater threat than TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran who has also received death threats. If Sumanthiran has threats from the LTTE, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have a thousand fold more threats from the LTTE remnants, the MP observed.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said increasing or withdrawing an MPs security is not a healthy trend.
If the decision has been taken based on politics it was not fair and could not be acceptable, he said.

SriLankan losses top Rs 6.49 bn despite Rs 136.68 bn revenue
SriLankan Airlines marked year of transformation in its recently ended financial year, carrying the highest number of passengers ever in the airlines history.
Based on draft unaudited accounts, the total operational revenue increased to Rs 136.68 bn from Rs 129.48 bn in the prior year.
However, difficult market conditions resulted the airline to record an unaudited net group loss (before finance and one-off charges) of Rs 6.49 billion (USD15.12 million) for the year. This is an increase from the Rs 2.90 billion (USD3.15 million) loss recorded in the prior year,but a significant improvement from the deficit that had been budgeted for the year.
The year was profoundly challenging for airlines worldwide, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating an 8% global decline in air fares in USD terms. Despite these challenging conditions, SriLankan managed to control the decline in its average fares to only 3% in USD terms year-over-year - a satisfactory performance in relation to many leading airlines in the world who have seen significantly higher fare declines.
The depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee against the US Dollar had a significant negative impact on the airline, as a majority of costs in the global airline business are USD denominated.
The impact of this was further exacerbated by the relatively high price of jet fuel in Colombo, where the largest share of the airlines fuel uplift takes place.
In the face of these challenges, the airline accelerated its cost reduction efforts, enabling a reduction of its Unit Cost (CASK) in USD terms.
During the last quarter of the financial year, the airlines financial performance was further significantly and adversely affected due to the runway re-surfacing project at Bandaranaike International Airport,which required the airline to cancel over 600 flights during the period.
A significant improvement in performance was recorded at the airlines Strategic Business Units - with key performing units such as SriLankan Catering and the ground handling entity recording profit improvements.
The airline successfully completed the integration of Mihin Lankas operations into the SriLankan network during the year. SriLankan serves 36 international destinations from its hub in Colombo, with an operating fleet of 24 aircraft.
It has already announced plans to add three new destinations in India from Summer 2017, thereby becoming the largest foreign airline into India by the number of cities served.

A Storybook Wedding
It was the kind of day found within the pages of a Danielle Steel novel. As the wedding ceremony concluded and the guests began milling around before dinner, a brilliant magenta sun began dipping beyond the Hudson River. The day had been one of sparkling clarity, bathed in golden sunshine, without a single cloud in the July sky.
The gorgeous summer evening of 31st July 2010 saw Chelsea Clinton, the former first daughter of Bill and Hilary Clinton marrying her longtime boyfriend Marc Mezvinsky. The venue was the Astor Courts, a 13,000-foot Beaux Arts pavilion in Rhinebeck and among the 500 A-list guests present were Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Babara Streisand and Madeleine Albright (but not the Obamas even though they had offered the White House for the wedding).
It was apparent that Chelsea, who arrived at the White House as a gawky 12-year-old with frizzy hair and braces, and grew up before the nations eyes had found in Marc, a partner whose life experiences bear a striking resemblance to her own - Both are from political families, Marc is the Philadelphia-raised son of former Iowa congressman Ed Mezvinsky (jailed in 2001 for five years after pleading guilty to 31 counts of fraud)and former Pennsylvania congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinksy, now divorced. Both know firsthand the price of political loss and scandal. (One difference: Chelsea is an only child, but Marc is one of 11, some adopted.)
The two first met as teenagers in Hilton Head, S.C. during a Renaissance Weekend. They became fast friends. When Chelsea was choosing colleges in 1997, Marc showed her around Stanford University, where he was a student. His tour worked: she enrolled. But their romance did not bloom then and there; Chelsea went on to date writer Ian Klaus and was with him for four years. In 2005, the affair with Ian ended and the same year she and Marc, by then both living in New York City, went public with their romance.
The story of Chelsea and Marc shows clearly, love can overcome many obstacles. Chelsea is Methodist, Mezvinsky is Jewish. Of the interfaith union, Hillary Clinton said, Over the years, so many of the barriers that prevented people from getting married, crossing lines of faith or color or ethnicity have just disappeared.
The Clintons who are extraordinarily close to their only child  as president, Bill Clinton once put off an overseas trip so he could be home to help Chelsea study for exams  were deeply moved by the union. I am going to try not to cry, Bill Clinton said a few weeks before the ceremony.
The billowing, floor-length Vera Wang gown Chelsea wore on her wedding day had silver beading around the waist. In her hand she carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her accessories included diamond drop earrings and a small diamond bracelet.
The groom wore a black tuxedo, white prayer shawl and yarmulke. A horseshoe of white roses decorated the gazebo where the couple exchanged vows.
The 500-pound four-foot Presidential Cake, had 1,000 edible sugar flowers, cost $10,000 and was gluten-free. Dinner was also gluten-free, veganincluding hors doeuvre  the cost of which was around $125,000 for the 500 guests.
The storybook wedding was conducted by a rabbi and a minister and included the reading of a poem titled The Life That I Have, by Leo Marks. No other poem could have captured so well the sentiments of two people, wishing to share the rest of their lives with each other.
The life that I have
Is all that I have
And the life that I have
Is yours.

TCK dance troupe marks 45th anniversary
One of Kandys cultural icons, the Trinity College National Drum and Dance Troupe celebrated its 45th anniversary today with a special performance of Rangavali, the troupes 90-minute show at the college hall.
Trinity was among the first schools in the country to form a troupe of this nature. The school has always wanted its students to be deeply rooted in their culture while being able to reach out and learn, and experience other cultures.
Learning Kandyan and Low Country dancing has been a tradition at Trinity but it was for the schools centenary celebrations in 1972 that a full troupe was formed and performed. It was the brainchild of the then Principal Lionel Fernando.
The Trinity troupe has participated in many historic events including the consecration of the Anglican Cathedral on Bauddhaloka Mawatha in Colombo.
This troupe has won the inter-school and youth drum and dance competitions many times. The troupe has also travelled to many countries and won several trophies in international competitions. For many years Karunadasa Rajapakse, a professional Ves dancer, was the teacher who trained the troupe and his work.
The work of the Manager late S J Madugalle is also remembered at this time.
Trinity is best known for the famous sportsmen and men of letters it has produced, but it has also succeeded in cultural aspects.

Three member committee appointed to investigate Kalutara bus shooting incident
The Three Member Commission appointed to investigate into the Prison bus shooting near the Kalutara Prison, has asked that the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement, Prison Reforms and Hindu Religious Affairs to look into the reasons as to why the bus which was recorded to have left Kalutara Prison at 7.20 am on February 27, was still close to the Prison at 8.20am, when it was fired at.
Where and what did the bus do for one hour close to the prison This is something the minister needs to ponder about, said Chairman of the Committee and former Commissioner General of Prisons, Rumy Marzook yesterday as the Committee handed over their report on the shooting to the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement, Prison Reforms and Hindu Religious Affairs, D.M. Swaminathan at the Ministry.
The Ministry had appointed a three member committee consisting of Marzook, former Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, S. Medawewa and former Deputy Inspector General of Police, Gamini Nawaratne to investigate into the shooting which targeted the killing of notorious underworld figure Aruna Udaya Shantha Pathirana alias Samayan, six other suspects and two Prison guards as they were on their way to courts.
We went into the length and breadth of this incident and also looked into the security, welfare and transport of prisoners. In addition, the system of communication between Prison officials and judicial officers as transport is very vital information, Marzook said.
Medawewa presenting the highlights of the report, explained that the Commission spoke to Prison officials, prisoners, one of the wives of Pathirana and the Police to garner information for their report.
The story seems like a fiction, but I assure you the report is not fictitious, he said.
Their recommendations have been categorized into immediate action the Department could take, action that needs to be taken in association with other agencies and long term measures.
We found that on that particular day, a few officials had gone on leave without prior notice, which needs to be investigated. At the same time, those who had gone on maternity leave were marked as those who had not given notice. In addition, Pathirana was not wearing handcuffs and had jewellery on him, Medawewa said.
He stressed that the committee was not to formally inquire into the matter, but to find facts and make recommendations to prevent such incidents happening in the future.
In their recommendations, they found lapses by the Prisons Department in terms of security provided to prisoners and that various illegal activities were continuing unabated within the Prison itself.
The prisoners are well connected to the outside world and used sophisticated devices. There were also cases of money transactions, prisoners forming groups inside the prisons and dealing with the underworld, he added.
Medawewa stressed that the Prison Security Unit had to be further strengthened along with intelligence and security assessments of suspects done. How did Pathiranas information leak The shooting was very well executed, done at a narrow point in the road and the Prison officials even thought it was the Police shooting at them, he said.
The Committee has thus recommended coordination of security and intelligence matters of the Police and Prisons and for the Prisons and Police to have a contingency plan in case of such emergencies.
It is important to have liaison of Police intelligence, Prisons intelligence and Military intelligence, along with a direct link with the CID, with coordination between the Department of Prisons, Police Department and their line ministries, Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Services Commission, he said.
They have also proposed amendments to the administrative procedures and legal provision with Section 39 (4) of the Ordinance amended to facilitate the District Judge or a Magistrate to be a visitor at any prison where a person remanded by him is in custody.
A special court system or a domestic court system should be established in the prisons to determine the cases of high profile characters, have also been proposed so that dangerous criminals need not be transported far away from Prison.
In addition, the Committee had asked that Prison officials be trained in combat similar to military training and the department be upgraded so that it meets the expectations of disciplined uniformed services.
They have also asked that a 100 personnel consisting of a sophisticated elite force be established to deal with such situations in future.
Minister Swaminathan in turn, said he hoped to implement the recommendations as soon as possible and questioned as to why Prison Commissioners had failed to curb illegal activities within prisons. He also said that strict action would be taken against any Prison official found guilty of colluding with criminals.

Singer A Division League second round:
The eagerly awaited Singer A Division League rugby tournament second round battle between the table leaders, Trinity College - Kandy and the giant killers St. Josephs College, Maradana will be played at the Havelock Park today, commencing at 4.15 p.m.
A mammoth crowd is expected to throng Havelock Park tomorrow to witness this grand game of the 2017 league rugby tournament.
Trinity have to force a win to have any chance of regaining the A Division League title, which they eluded since 1987. They last won the elite division title under brilliant leader Tyral Rajapaksha.
Tomorrows match should turn out to be a battle between Joes power-packed forwards and Trinitys speedy three quarters. St.Josephs forwards have given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and should maintain their supremacy in this game as well.
In the set scrums Joes hooker Sven Muller will have the upper hand against the Trinity hooker while the line outs should be shared between the two schools.
But the biggest threat to Trinity will be posed by Joes speedy winger Sachith Silva with his power-packed runs down the flank.
The Trinitians have been unable to make the maximum use of the good ball that comes their way as fly half Lashan Wijesuriya has either tried to go on his own or delayed his passes which resulted in him and the two centers being nailed by their opposite numbers.
Trinitys forte has been their speedy three quarters and the playing style of scrum half Anouka Boyagoda.
Centres Dilukshan Dange and strongly built Worren Weerakoon are hard runners who should punch holes in the Joesaphian defence with full back joining the line to form the overlap.
Their fly half Lashan Wijesuriya must come up with a much better display today if they are to pull this match through with a win.

Trump and Australias Turnbull mend ties

Donald Trump called his relationship with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull "fantastic" following a meeting in New York.
It is their first encounter since an acrimonious phone call in February.
"We get along great. We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, I always have," the AFP news agency quoted Trump as saying.
Protesters also gathered in Trump's home city, the first time he has returned there since his inauguration.
Trump said the two leaders had "reaffirmed ties" between their two countries, and discussed economic, trade, and national security co-operation, as well as migration issues.
They met on the USS Intrepid, a WW2-era aircraft carrier that was involved in the war against Japan in the Pacific.
Relations between the two leaders were strained over President Trump's reluctance to honour a deal to accept up to 1,200 refugees from Australian detention camps.
Trump had reportedly said his February call on the issue washis "worst"that day, and had previously tweeted that the refugee resettlement agreement was a "dumb deal".
But the US later said it would honour the agreement made by the Obama administration.
Travelling through New York in a limousine is nothing new to Donald Trump. But never before has he done so with the presidential seal on the side of the car. He had not set foot in New York for 107 days, the longest absence from his native city at any stage of his life.
Inevitably, in a city where fewer than one in five residents voted for him, there was a hostile reception from protesters. By Big Apple standards, however, the demonstrations were small-scale.
Nor were there any fireworks on the Hudson during his delayed meeting with Turnbull, another businessman turned politician.
In fact, both men seemed so determined to shrug off their famed testy phone conversation - Trump with a nonchalant air, Turnbull with a rictus grin - it ended up looking like strained and faux bonhomie.
As he met Turnbull, Trump said the refugee bill "has been worked out for a long time", and said media coverage of the phone call was "a little bit of fake news, as the expression goes."
"We got a little testy, but that's OK," he later added.
He also said he would visit Australia, which he called "one of the most beautiful places on earth", but did not set a date.
Australia is one of the United States' staunchest allies and troops from the two countries have fought together in all recent major conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan.
Speaking at the event on board the USS Intrepid, Turnbull said the "stability and prosperity of our region over so many decades has been secured - and is secured today - by the United States", a commitment he said was renewed by President Trump.
It is thought the two leaders may have discussed North Korea as part of their talks on national security.
Tensions have been rising around the Korean peninsula, with repeated threats from North Korea and the presence of a group of US warships and a submarine.
Observers also say Australia is also concerned about how the Trump administration's America-first trade policy might affect economic relations.
In one of his first actions after taking office, Trump pulled his countryout of the Trans-Pacific Partnershiptrade deal, a 12-nation trade agreement which would have included the US, Australia and much of the Asia-Pacific.

People in the area say wild animals destroy their cultivations day and night causing them many hardships.
Wild elephants invade nearby villagers from the Pallakadu jungle at Oluvil in the Addalaichenai DS division and the Lahugala forest in the Pottuvil division of the Ampara district.
They used to enter inner villages in search of food and water in the night, but now they invade even during the daytime, villagers lamented.
Troupes of monkeys break tiles and asbestos sheets by jumping and running on them.
They enter kitchens through roofs and windows and eat food items. Authorities were informed about the menace but the problems continue still, the villagers said.

Largest amount of money printing within last two years
The Central Bank (CB) has never printed such a large amount of money as in the last two years, Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said.
Such a large volume has not been printed before 2015 either and not even during CB history, Dr. Weerasinghe said.
Central Bank DG Nandalal Weerasinghe made this allegation at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue, yesterday. Dr. Weerasinghe said he believes that the change into an auction system when issuing Treasury Bonds had resulted in such a large amount of money being printed.
He said a hybrid system which incorporates both the auction and direct placement method is in the making under the guidance of present CBSL Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy. Dr. Weerasinghe also said technical assistance of the World Bank is sought in the process.
Dr. Weerasinghe said the decision taken by former Governor Arjun Mahendran to shock the market by raising the short and long term interest rates was an unnecessary decision. The decision to do so was a disaster, he said.
The decision to do away with the five percent penal rate and the issuance of a 30-year bond should have come as a Monetary Board decision, Dr. Weerasinghe said. We did not see why the Central Bank wanted to tighten the monetary policy at that time when former Governor Mahendran decided to raise the interest rate, he added.
When asked if it was necessary to give such a shock to the interest rates, Dr. Weerasinghe said he did not agree with the decision as the shock would send a wrong signal to the market and lessen the credibility of the Central Bank.
Even if the change of interest rate was necessary, it should have come as a gradual change and not as a sudden decision, Dr. Weerasinghe said.

Udeni Dissanayake of the All Island Management Assistants Association asked the GMOA members where they were when the SAITM was established by the previous government. He said this Association failed to utter a single world against the SAITM during the previous regime.
The GMOA is trying to take innocent patients hostage to achieve their petty political objectives, he said.
He said there are many degree-awarding institutions in the country but the GMOA members have not raised their objections against these institutions. Sri Lanka Postal and Telecommunications Services Association President Chinthaka Bandara said every citizen has a right to education.
He said 125,000 students pass GCE Advanced Level Examination, but only 26,000 people are entrolled to State universities. We should think of the rights of other students who have passed the GCE AL examination, he said.
He said the GMOA is using public servants to achieve their petty objectives. This is against the well-established norms and practices of trade unions.
Sri Lanka Estate Employees Association General Secretary Wadivel Suresh said plantation employees have less knowledge on SAITM and they do not have any issue over SAITM.
There are many hospitals in the estate sector and the estate employees including tea pluckers will face much inconvenience if GMOA launches a strike.
GMOAs attempt to achieve their narrow objectives at the expense of innocent lives cannot be condoned, he said.

Regrettable that some have resorted to trade union action despite solution on SAITM: President

President Maithripala Sirisena today said it was regrettable that some have resorted to trade union action despite a solution given to the SAITM issue.
Speaking at a function in Anuradhapura today he urged medical students not to be political pawns but to complete their medical education successfully for their benefit as well as for the sake of the nation.
He assured that no student would be subjected to injustice.
The President said that several steps have been taken to resolve issues with regard to SAITM  these include making clinical studies compulsory for SAITM students; SAITM students having to face examinations approved by the Medical Council and the University Grants Commission; announcing minimum qualifications for medical studies; taking over the private hospital; single ownership of the medical college to be expanded into a broad based ownership and appoint a professional council to administer it.
The President stated that it was those who are poor and marginalized that suffered from this kind of strike action.
He further said that if there is any issue, there is room for the any trade union to discuss those issues with the Government.
President Sirisena further said that it was regrettable that trade unions were holding the public hostage in an environment in which preparation are being made to hold the UN International Vesak festival.
The President recalled the requests made by Wimal Weerawansa to hoist the black flag when the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives in Sri Lanka to attend the International Vesak festival.
He also said that everyone must understand that strengthening the Indo-Lanka relationship established since introduction of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not mean that Sri Lanka is bowing down to India.
President Sirisena also emphasized that he will not sign any agreement with any country which is detrimental to Sri Lanka and said that he came into power not to hand over part of a country to another country or to annul the privileges and rights of the citizens by signing unfavorable agreements with other countries.
He attended the religious ceremony to unveil the newly built Buddha statue at the premises of the Local Government complex, Anuradhapura.

We urge them to read the history of the party, he said.
Although several factions were separated from the party previously, they all finally return to the SLFP. We want to get back even the people who are not helping us. We do not want them to join with the government, but with the SLFP, Bandara said.

ADB says Lanka can  still deliver on targets
Sri Lanka can still deliver the potential and promise foreseen by the Singaporean visionary Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in the early sixties where he wanted to make a Singapore like Sri Lanka, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said.
Addressing the historic ADB 50th Annual Meetings opening press conference in Yokohama Japan yesterday he said Sri Lanka was such a promising place and it is sill promising.
By opening up Sri Lanka further and taking opportunities of growing South Asia and integration of South Asia with East Asia, Sri Lanka can achieve a much greater development, Nakao said.
Nakao said he was encouraged by the strong reform efforts and the investment in the conflict affected areas and the strong social indicators like during his visit to Sri Lanka, but cautioned on the trade weight to the GDP which was not too encouraging and the element of inward looking policies adopted by the country.
However the ADB President expressed optimism over recently conducted IMF program report which was very positive for Sri Lanka. The IMF had a program recently and had reported that it was going well.I want to revisit Sri Lanka, which has great opportunities and many resources, Nakao reiterated.
He said with US$ 50 billion equity they can now expand their lending operations by 50 percent upto US$ 20 billion or more by 2020.We can increase our lending fo sustainable development goals and all other options, Nakao insisted.
A very important element in the 50 year history is over time many countries turned into inward looking and protectionist policies. But over time they gradually moved to more outward looking open trade and investment polities.ADB has promoted this transmission. The ADB has estimated that US$ 1.72 trillion is needed annually for infrastructure such as power transportation communication and water.
The ADB was now compiling its new 2020 strategy in consultation with stakeholders. ADBs role is financing with a knowledge,promoting good policies and regional cooperation. In this 50 years we have expanded our membership and promoted the idea of regional cooperation, he said. He also said protectionist policies were not affecting ADBs growth policies.
Box
The ADB projects a 5% growth in Sri Lanka in 2017.The growth will be constrained by tight fiscal and monetary policies under the IMF program. Because consumption will be subdued, private investment will again have to play a primary role in maintaining economic growth.The higher VAT introduced in 2016 and improved income tax collection in 2017 will depress consumption, outweighing the positive impact of a modest increase expected in worker remittance earnings. While the March maha rice harvest was expected to be affected by continuing drought, an assumed return to normal rainfall promises to allow agriculture production to rebound from the second quarter, an ADB Economist told Daily News Business.

Allies never apart
Australia and Sri Lanka  70 years of partnership:
Seventy years ago, Charles Frost arrived in Colombo as Australias first Commissioner to Ceylon. He became High Commissioner early the following year upon Ceylons independence. Since then, Ceylon has become Sri Lanka, and 22 Australian High Commissioners have called Colombo home. As I sit writing this  in a city far different to the one Frost would have known  it is striking to reflect on how far the relationship has come in those 70 years.
Its an increasingly warm and productive relationship of many growing parts.
Starting with the serious stuff  cricket. Its just a game, but is also a bond that means Sri Lankans and Australians anywhere in the world have a starting point for a friendly conversation. You cant put a value on that and the people-to-people links that come with it. We regularly see Australian teams visiting Colombo, including both our national mens and womens teams last year. A sports caf in Colombo, owned by an Aussie couple, shows memorabilia from many of the old tours.

Then theres migration. Name a sector of Australian society and therell be prominent Sri Lankan-Australians  academia, medicine, media, music, literature, business, politics, cooking, even stand-up comedy. We are proud of Australias large and vibrant Sri Lanka-origin community. They are Australians but also retain strong bonds with Sri Lanka. It means we know each other well and that is a vital asset.
Theres education, too. Through the Colombo Plan and Australia Awards weve funded over 1,000 students to study in Australia since the early 1950s. Many more now study in Australia privately  around 7,500 this year. There is huge potential to build these education ties, through local delivery, student exchanges and research linkages. Weve got a new alumni association that has got off to a great start. And were pleased about the growing number of New Colombo Plan students visiting.
Economic partnership
Our economic partnership is becoming more important. Two-way trade in goods and services could soon exceed AUD 1 billion. This is not huge, but the potential is there. At present, trade covers lentils, education, garments, IT services, milk powder, wine and tourism, among other items. Theres opportunity  including for investment  in areas such as energy, mining and smart infrastructure. Sri Lanka is embarking on an ambitious economic reform programme, and this  and growing business interest by the vibrant diaspora in Australia  offers the promise of increasingly close economic ties.
We are longstanding development partners. Over more than 65 years, Australia has provided around AUD1.35 billion in total aid to Sri Lanka. Our efforts helped Sri Lanka recover from the 2004 tsunami and, more recently, the aftermath of the devastating civil conflict. We have now shifted our focus from reconstruction and rehabilitation, to building skills and creating jobs in a more inclusive workforce  all priorities of the Sri Lankan Government as it seeks to deliver an economic peace dividend to all Sri Lankans. We have an active volunteer programme here. Sri Lankas economic development is squarely in our interests.
Our countries share an interest in a stable Indian Ocean region. Cemeteries in Sri Lanka hold the graves of Australians who died in the great wars and this week we marked their sacrifice  as we do every year  at our dawn ANZAC Day service. More recently, we have collaborated closely with Sri Lanka to combat transnational crime, including people smuggling and human trafficking.
We are bound irrevocably as Indian Ocean maritime neighbours. It isnt widely known, but Australia and Sri Lanka share a border  a search and rescue border out in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Our security interests are increasingly aligned, and  as a peaceful and more settled Sri Lanka increasingly looks outwards  there is much more of common strategic interest for us to talk about in our region.
PMs visit to Australia
As befits an anniversary year, 2017 has already been busy. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe paid a formal bilateral visit to Australia in February  the first such visit by a Sri Lankan leader in decades. Deputy Foreign Minister De Silva was in Australia in March to look at opportunities for cooperation in several areas of innovation and research. And Australias Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells visited earlier this month  very fitting given the significant contribution of our aid programme in Sri Lanka over the years.
Weve had musical performances, photo exhibitions, sporting engagements and lots of positive mainstream and social media coverage. Australias brand is known and liked in Sri Lanka.
Looking out over the next 70 years, to 2087, well have despatched another 20 or so High Commissioners each way. There will have been glorious wins and sorry losses on the cricket field. Two-way tourism will be booming with direct flights. Many more Sri Lankans will know Australia well through education and family connections.
Trade and investment will be flourishing. Sri Lanka will be a cosmopolitan prosperous hub, looking east as Australia looks west. In short, the relationship should be as bright as the sun that shines down on Sri Lanka at this time of year.
Charles Frost would be well pleased with what he kicked off 70 years ago today.(Bryce Hutchesson is Australias High Commissioner to Sri Lanka. He is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Hutchesson has served overseas as Deputy High Commissioner in New Delhi, with earlier postings in Bangkok and Tel Aviv. He has also served in Washington with the Office of National Assessments. In Canberra, he has led DFATs South Asia Branch, Executive, Planning and Evaluation Branch and several branches responsible for international security.)

Anuradhapura undergoes major water crisis
Many of the tanks in Anuradhapura district have dried up. The water level of 14 major tanks including the Kalawewa reservoir is rapidly decreasing.
Irrigation and Agrarian Services Development Officials said most areas of the district received rains during last week, but it was inadequate to fill tanks.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.W. Wanninayake said the people in the district would face major crisis without drinking water if the drought conditions prevailed further. He said the Disaster Management Ministry and the WSDB (NCP) are to provide drinking water via bowsers in such situations. Large crowds are expected in Anuradhapura during Vesak and Poson.
Even though drinking water is provided via the Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks, available water at present is inadequate for large crowds arriving during the season.
