How to tame your dragon
The Jungle Book set a new trend in Hollywood. More orphan in the wild tales began to make it to the screen following the international box office hit. Petes Dragon is the latest to join the list. It seems to have been inspired not only by The Jungle Book but by How to Train Your Dragon as well.
In Petes Dragon a young boy survives the car accident that kills his parents. He is almost eaten by wolves in the dark forest into which hes wandered after the crash, and then is inexplicably rescued by a giant, furry dragon who becomes, for the next six years at least, his best friend and protector.
Pete begins calling the dragon Elliot after the name of the dog in his favorite childrens book, and the pair live together in a cave while spending their days wandering around the forest, climbing trees and leaping off cliffs. But when loggers encroach on their lush paradise, Petes curiosity gets the best of him, and hes ultimately discovered, captured, and brought back to civilization, despite the best efforts of the dragon to keep him out of harms way.
Haunting and opaque
Housed temporarily by a forest ranger, Grace, her fianc, Jack, and his young daughter, Natalie, the scared and confused Pete learns what it means to be human. He discovers the meaning of belonging to a family as well. Then trouble follows when Gavin, Jacks brother and co-manager of the logging operation that upends Pete and Elliots happy existence, catches sight of the dragon during Petes retrieval from the forest. He is determined to sedate and capture the creature. Predictably this becomes Petes new challenge: to protect his friend from danger. The tables are turned now that humans are more in control than mythical creatures.
The films opening sequence is both haunting and opaque. Disney has made a name in barbarizing fairytales and Petes Dragon is no exception.
The opening sequence displays this when we too believe that Pete is about to be consumed by the dragon. However when the monster in the forest turns out to be a playful, fun-loving, and slightly dopey creature, fear leaves us and we develop a fondness for the beast.
Winning formula
Director David Lowery has certainly done his homework. He has presented us with a winning formula of a film.
His first feature movie, Aint Them Bodies Saints too was heartwarming. However Petes Dragon touches its audience in a different way than his maiden movie.
The music in Petes Dragon is light and comforting. You get a feel good nature when you watch this film. This feeling lasts throughout the film. It is in the storyline. It is in the actors the director has chosen. It is in the music that accompanies the action. It is in the enthralling visuals too.
Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Oakes Fegley, Oona Laurence, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. make up the cast.
On the surface, Petes Dragon is a childrens movie, but it has the wisdom of a tale with a morale message. Its a story about friendship, growing up and moving on. Friends come and go  but the memories they leave behind never will. This is another jewel that Disney can add to its crown.
Petes Dragon is screening at Savoy cinema, Wellawaththa.

Deepika calls Aishwarya the torchbearer
Deepika Padukones Hollywood debut is the much talked about topic in town. The actress is now finally back after wrapping up the shoot of the film and is now busy making appearances and promoting her brands.
When asked about her competitor Priyanka Chopra, Deepika said that it is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan who should get recognition first. She, for me, is the torchbearer for putting India on the global map. But everyone who has managed to break through into the western market  whether it is Anil, Irfan, Priyanka, or myself  I think we have all done a great job, she said.
She even added, We got this opportunity at a time when all of us are working towards breaking stereotypes. We are all focused on being part of good content, and to be cast in films based on our talent and not because of the colour of our skin.

Calvin Harris in talks for The X Factor Judges Houses
According to The Sun newspaper, superstar DJ Calvin is top of judge Nicole Scherzinger's list to help her whittle down the hopefuls ahead of the live shows.
If Calvin did agree to appear on the ITV show, it would mark the end of a seven-year ban from the programme. The 32-year-old Scotsman hit headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage as John and Edward Grimes, known as Jedward, performed Under Pressure by David Bowie and Queen. Mocking the twins' famous hairstyles, Calvin held a pineapple on top of his head as he ran onto the stage before security were called.
Following the incident, Jedward's mentor Louis Walsh branded Calvin an "idiot" while boss Simon Cowell, said to be furious at the musician's "shameless self promotion", banned him from appearing on The X Factor in the future.
However, sources told the publication that Simon and Calvin, who is officially the world's top earning DJ, have put their feud behind them.
"Calvin is rightly regarded as one of the biggest artists in music due to his phenomenal chart success," an insider said. "Simon wants A-listers on board and made a beeline for Calvin, ensuring him there would be no issues after the Jedward row.
"It was a long time ago and both have moved on so much since then."
Following the 2009 incident, Calvin defended himself by insisting his actions were an attempt to point out that Jedward were a novelty act competing on what was meant to be a "music show".
And in 2014 Calvin admitted he and Simon had a "mutual agreement to stay away from each other", adding: "As far as Im aware, in fact definitely, Im not allowed back on that show. Sadly thats it for me and The X Factor."
While Calvin is said to be joining Nicole for Judges' Houses, Sharon Osbourne will apparently be aided by Robbie Williams while Alesha Dixon and former X Factor contestant Fleur East are reportedly set to help out Louis Walsh.

Drake Congratulates Rihannas MTV VMAs Honor With Giant Billboard
Drake sure knows how to make a statement.
Ahead of 2016 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday (Aug. 28), where Rihanna was honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, the Toronto MC bought a large billboard in Los Angeles to congratulate the diva.
"Congratulations to Rihanna from Drake and Everyone at OVO," the billboard read.
The gesture didnt go unnoticed by Rihanna. "When he extra," she captioned an Instagram photo of the large sign, along with a heart and trophy emojis.
Rumors have been swirling that the two music stars are secretly dating, which would explain why Drake would go to so much effort to congratulate the singer. Or perhaps it was meant to drive awareness of Drake's song "Too Good," which features Rihanna and has been climbing the Hot 100. - ET

Aretha Franklin cancels more shows due to illness
Aretha Franklin pulled out of the Tony Bennett 90th birthday salute due to unspecified health issues earlier this week.
On Friday, Franklin went on to cancel more dates due to doctors orders. She said in a statement:
Regretfully, due to doctors orders I will have to cancel a few concerts for the next month or so. Im especially disappointed because two of them are among my favorite cities, Washington D.C. and New York. I dont want to miss any. I should continue the rest of my tour by November. I decided it was time to go home and take care of myself consistent with doctors orders.
The question at this point is which concerts are actually canceled. Aretha Franklin mentioned August 26 at the Filine Center in Washington, September 18 at the City Winery Open, Forest Hills, NY, and September 23 at Radio City Music Hall but that is where different sources diverge.
According to Arethas statement, she is taking off the next month or so and her website still lists an October 9 date in Grand Rapids, MI and October 22 in St. Louis, MO; however, tour industry source Pollstar does not show her next show until Friday, November 11 in Welch, MN.
Aretha Franklin has had many cancellations over the last few years for various medical problems. She famously does not fly, so all of her travel is by bus and she has complained about the exhaustion that comes from that type of travel.
Aretha Franklin in the 60sAretha Franklin has won 18 Grammy Awards and sold over 75 million records worldwide. She has been honored throughout her career including a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in which she became the first female performer to be inducted.
