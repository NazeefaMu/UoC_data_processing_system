Social icons, celebrities pivotal to tourism industry
Social icons and celebrities are pivotal to the travel and tourism industry because they inspire their followers or fans to visit destinations they travel to, said Brekke Fletcher, the Executive Editor of CNN Travel.
Speaking at the Cinnamon Future of Tourism [FOT] Summit held in Colombo to commemorate the World Tourism Day at Cinnamon Grand yesterday she said that this ultimately creates a sure flow of tourists for these destinations, she added.
Travel requires both passion and a professional approach. Sri Lanka must use Social media giants like Instagram and Snapchat to literally grab the attention of people to various destinations through the use of geo- location tags so that finding places, restaurants, reputed tourist sites are now at the users finger tips. Then the country can become a tech wise tourist destination., Brekke said.
Minister of Tourism and Christian Affairs John Amaratunga said that the government will soon launch a strategic tourism plan for 2017 to 2020.
The Tourism Vision until 2025 is also planned to ensure that the authentic and innovative side of Sri Lankas tourist industry comes out while also protecting the nations natural resources and heritage sites.
The market plan for the Tourism Vision 2025 has been finalized under the guidance of the Prime Minister and a 10 point action plan is being finalized to enhance the Tourism.

5 Tips for reading multiple books at the same time
Im often met with surprise when I mention that I have a few books going at once. Often followed by, how do you manage it and dont you get confused
The truth is, sometimes I do get confused. Though that doesnt happen very often anymore. Ive been juggling multiple books for so long now, that Ive kind of gotten the hang of it!
So here are a few tips to help you do the same.
1. Read different genres
This is probably the most important tip. Nothing will confuse you more than reading multiple books which have too many similarities.
It also kind of defeats the purpose of reading lots of different books at once. You want diversity in your reading. You want to not get stuck on just one book or genre. So have a few going at once.
Ill usually have at least three: One novel  any genre.
One non-fiction. And maybe a poetry collection, short story collection, or graphic novel.
Something thats a bit faster, or that you can dip in and out of without too much of a problem.
2. Read different books at different places
My favourite place to read is in bed. But I dont always get time to read in bed. If I do, its often for only a short amount of time before bed. Its not very conducive to the full reading life I want to have.
I do have a one hour commute every single day. So Ive gotten into the habit of reading during my tram journey.
But I often cant read the same books in these two different places. I can read serious and heavy books in bed, but when I try to read them at 7am while squashed into a tiny tram seat, my eyes glaze over.
So thats resulted in me usually picking a quick, breezy light-hearted read during my morning commute. Something that perks me up for the day ahead! So make sure you choose your books based on when and where youll be best able to read them.
3. Read through different mediums
As much as I love reading my paperbacks, its not exactly the best way to read when Im travelling. Or when Im going to meet my friends and they are super late as usual, and I need some way to pass the time. Which is why my various books come in various mediums. I have the paperback or hardback which I reserve for at home reading. Then Ill have a book on my Kindle for any commutes or general travelling. Maybe an audio book for when Im out for a walk and need something to listen to.
4. Read for your mood  not for your TBR list
I think there are times when we tend to have a fixed idea about the books were going to read. Which is great  sometimes! Other times, its just good to go with the flow. If I start a book that I really want to read, and I feel myself running out of steam, I usually start a new one. It proves a good distraction for a short while until Im ready to go back to the original book again. Just because were not in the mood for a book, doesnt mean abandon ship til who knows when. It can mean taking a short break. Or adding another list to your growing pile of currently readings.
5. Take all the time you need
Lastly, dont freak out if youre taking months and months to finish a book because youre reading too many books at the same time! Sometimes itll happen.
And sometimes youll find yourself reading too many books in the space of a really short time. It happens. The most important thing  always  is that youre having a good time reading!

About 80,000 in Kurunegala sans IDs
Out of the total population of 1.6 million in the Kurunegala district, 80,000 people are without National Identity Cards while 20,000 families do not have title deeds or permits to their lands. Also, 18,000 drivers do not posses valid driving licenses.
Due to these shortcomings, the Nila-Mehawara Janapathi Janatha Sevaya mobile service programme is intended to remedy such shortcomings, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said. He was addressing the gathering at a 'Nila-Mehewara Janapathi Janatha Sevaya' mobile service programme held at the Ibbagamuwa Madya Vidyalaya to resolve problems of the people in the Ibbagamuwa DS division, recently.
The minister said the Home Affairs Ministry was first set up in 1931 during the British period and as such, it was a ministry with a long history.
Today, the ministry had 25 Kachcheris and 352 DS divisions under its purview and it had a close link with the people. His ministry had organised such mobile service programs to resolve people's problems such as obtaining NICs, birth certificates and driving licenses at their doorsteps enabling them to save money and time involved in such exercises. All projects launched by the previous regime in the area would continue to a successful completion as his ministry had allocated the funds for them.

Altair links to the world with Dialog Broadband Fibre
Residents of Altair, the inimitable twin tower residential high-rise nearing completion, are to be provided 'fibre-to-home' - a state-of-the-art high-speed fibre connectivity solution by Dialog Broadband Networks, under an agreement ratified recently.
Encompassing high-speed data services of up to 100 Gbps for Broadband Internet, Wi-Fi and IPTV, the facility can also be used for home automation which enables residents to manage their AV, lighting, air-conditioning and selected appliances through their smartphones.
Additionally, a hosted PABX will support an intercom facility for residents, connecting apartments with the front desk and other common locations such as the gymnasium and recreation centre, spa, Building Manager and security.
"We have chosen Dialog Broadband as our connectivity solutions provider for the company's ability to be among the first to rollout the latest advancements in technology in the local market," Altair Director Pradeep Moraes said.
"This is another example of our continuing efforts to exceed customer expectations by offering more than is promised in our contracts with apartment owners."
Apartment owners would however have the freedom to choose any other internet solutions provider if they so wish, Moraes said.
Jeremy Huxtable, Group Chief Officer of Dialog Enterprise said: "We welcome the opportunity to provide our Broadband services to a game-changing residential development of the calibre of Altair.
The fibre optic internet we provide connects through Dialog Broadband Networks' owns Submarine Fibre Optic Cable - BBG (Bay of Bengal Gateway) - that delivers over 6.4 terabits per second of international bandwidth to Sri Lanka with direct access to the Google and FB servers. Altair will receive internet at a significant speed within this capacity."
Besides speed, the other primary benefits of Dialog Broadband Networks' fibre-to-home solution are convenience and safety. Unlike copper, fibre significantly increases reliability of connectivity and eliminates risks such as interference from electronic or radio signals, inclement weather and human or electrical interference. The signal strength of fibre-optic internet does not degrade as quickly over distance.
Fibre-optic internet also eliminates delays that occur while processing data over a cable internet connection - termed latency issues - especially when streaming video or high-definition content.
Scheduled for completion in July 2018, Altair comprises two tower blocks, a 63-storey sloping tower which leans in to a taller, 68-storey vertical tower. Acknowledged as a new paradigm in contemporary living in Sri Lanka, the Altair building has already brought a new dimension in aesthetics to Colombo's skyline.
A one-of-its-kind development in South Asia in terms of architectural design, structural engineering and living experience, Altair offers its 400 apartments spectacular views of the Beira Lake, the Indian Ocean and the city of Colombo.
The development's 1.5 million square feet of high-end eco-friendly living space will be supported by 40,000 square feet of up-market retail space.
The building was designed by the globally renowned celebrity architect Moshe Safdie.

Botanicoir steers Sri Lankas coconut substrate industry through innovation
Taking significant strides in promoting value added Sri Lankan export products, Botanicoir, is a premier Sri Lankan coco-peat manufacturer and supplier of high-quality and innovative coir products to the UK and global market.
Armed with ample expertise and consistent innovation, Botanicoir specializes in grow bags and other products for soft fruits, salads and flowers. The company currently supplies coir to growers in over 52 countries.
The latest in the companys line up of innovations is the 'Precision Plus Ultra' mix for soft fruit crops. Some of the leading growers around the globe are delighted with the results; in many cases the newly developed substrate mix has given growers an increased yield of 5%.
Such game changing results have created a buzz in the industry and sensational headlines in the international press. The product itself was launched this summer in the UK with editors of leading magazines and the UK Agriculture Minister George Eustice attending.
Sri Lankas coco peat exports have seen a surge in recent times with earnings amounting to US$ 47 million in the first half of 2015. Striving to increase Sri Lankas reputation and contribution to the growing coconut substrate industry, Botanicoir invests heavily in product innovation to manufacture value added products.
Catering to varied demand from its international clientele, Botanicoir develops crop specific coir blends that take into consideration rooting, moisture levels and nutrient requirements, among other factors.
Precision Plus Ultra was custom made to suit berry crops and combines the salient features of rapid hydration, optimum air-filled porosity, a superior structure, and excellent drainage capacity as well as ease of steering.
Given Sri Lankas significant coconut crop which leads to an abundance of coconut husks, the country has grown to become a leader in the coconut substrate export industry. However, innovation and maintaining consistently high quality value added products are important ingredients in leveraging the existing market opportunity, commented says Botanicoirs MD Kalum Balasuriya. This is especially true given the changes in global weather patterns and the resulting floods and droughts that we have had to face.
Coir grow bags are used for fruit and vegetable production across the globe. Compressed coco peat free of harmful micro-organisms is used to manufacture coir grow bags and these provide an ideal environment for a multitude of crops to thrive. In addition to being an eco-friendly solution to growing, coir provides a plethora of other benefits such as high water retention capability, root supporting structure and acting as a deterrent to a number of fungi and diseases. Aside from coir bags, there also exists an array of innovations in the coco peat based growing media including coir briquettes, coir blocks, coir disks, etc.
Over the last decade, the development of the coconut substrate industry has intensified as the worldwide demand for growing media continues to rise. Sri Lanka has the potential to compete with countries such as India, Indonesia, and Vietnam to benefit from this increase in demand if we take strategic steps to think out of the box and invent. At the moment we are fortunate to have an abundance of coconut plantations to source raw material for our products. However, to capitalize on this, all industry players should concentrate on research and development to manufacture value added products and improve production techniques, said Botanicoirs MD Kalum Balasuriya.

CB holds key interest rates steady
The Monetary Board which met on Monday for the sixth review of the monetary policy stance had decided to maintain the policy interest rates of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) at their current levels, said Dr C Amarasekara, Acting Director, Economic Research, presenting the Monetary Policy Review No 6-2017, yesterday in Colombo.
The Standing Deposit Facility Rate will be held s at 7.25%, Standing Lending Facility Rate at 8.75% and Statutory Reserve Ratio will remain at 7.5%, he said.
The Monetary Board also observed that several risks that were observed at the beginning of the monetary tightening cycle have subsided. However the Board noted that some risks still prevail, he said.
In the first half of 2017, there was an upward adjustment in all market interest rates. But after the first half, so far during the year, there has been a decline in short-term market interest rates, particularly in call money market rates.
With improvements in the government securities market, it was observed that the government securities interest rates were also declining in recent months, he said.
We have seen market interest rates, other than short-term interest rates stabilizing at higher levels.
Dr Amarasekara also said they were expecting the private credit growth to decline to 16% and in August credit growth has slowed to 18%, from 18.6% in June.
Rs 404 billion has been loaned to private borrowers in 2017 compared to Rs 456 billion last year. He said that export earnings on cumulative basis had increased by 6.5% YoY and import expenditure increased by 9.2% YoY during the first seven months of 2017.
Workers remittances in July increased 3.4% YoY to US$ 3.9 billion.
Dr Amarasekera said foreign reserves which stood at US$ 6 billion at the end of 2016, had reached US$ 7.36 billion by September 21.
Earnings from tourism from January to August were estimated at US$ 2,414 million.
Dr Amerasekera also said that the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated by 2.6% by the end of July 2017 and has showed some stability since then.

CCCs ICT Gateway Project a source to Norways multi-billion dollar ICT market
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) invites Sri Lankan ICT firms to join the Chambers ICT Gateway Project, an initiative by the countrys premier chamber to help local firms benefit from the thriving ICT industry in Norway.
The move, launched under the Sri Lanka Norway Matchmaking Program, which has already brought down 500 Norwegian firms, including 50 ICT firms to partner with Lankan firms, is looking to expand its reach and scope, to enable local ICT firms join the international value chain. The ICT Gateway Project was launched by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the Fair Deal AS Norway, who help find Norwegian ICT firms interested in partnering with Lankan counterparts to serve the increasing demand for ICT products from within Norway, EU and the US market. The Government of Norway is a steady and large-scale buyer of technologies and its spending on ICT development is estimated at just under US$ 2 billion per annum.
Better payment and e-commerce solutions are also in demand for omnichannel retail and other organizations, whilst B2B and B2C consumers in the Nordic market are moving their online shopping from their PC to their phone, thus creating opportunities for ICT firms.
US security vendors with niche products or unusual technologies or capabilities are also considering Norway and the Nordic region, which shows promise for the Norwegian ICT sector.
Sri Lankan firms who join the ICT Gateway Project of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will be able to meet with the Norwegian ICT firms, visit Norway and also be listed under a database of ICT firms, which the Chamber will develop for future reference. For more information email [emailprotected].

Changing the tourism landscape
The government is to bring in a new Tourism Promotions Law to boost tourism related sectors, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe declared on Sunday at the AGM of the Hotel School Graduates Association in Tangalle. There will be a new Tourism Promotions Law. The Tourism Authority will not run the industry alone, he said.
The Premier also spoke of the need to make tourism applicable for all seasons. We must make Sri Lanka a 365 day destination. If you land in Mattala and it is raining there you should be able to go in another direction. Why arent we making Sri Lanka 365 days, he queried.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could not be more accurate in this respect. The tourism industry, and its actors, have for too long depended on the winter season to attract the western traveller and have put all their eggs in the winter basket. Ask any tour operator, or travel agent, and one will be told that the good times are ahead (for the industry), now that winter is neigh. The industry should wriggle out of this mindset and be geared up to cater to all comers in all seasons.
Like the premier said, the world tourism market has changed as it was no longer Europeans who come in here with travel agents. Travel agents are no more. Travelling is controlled by others. We are living in another world. Big airlines, we once knew, are no longer there. Even budget airlines are having trouble. However people are travelling here. It is the Asian travellers we are going to have. Things have changed.
In essence, what the PM said is that the industry has to think out of the box, to get down travellers, round the year, from all destinations. For too long has the industry been operating in a strait jacket, merely content in marketing our beautiful beaches and focusing on the ancient ruins and historical monuments. Even the big tourist hotels are cited at these spots. But the face of tourism, the world over, has changed. Today it is not just the history, the beaches or the cultural aspects of a country that the traveller is interested in. Tourism has evolved to include novel aspects and features such as eco-tourism. Like the PM noted, we should think out of the box and get down world renowned performers in the fields of music and other entertainment as tourist draws. The game of cricket too has opened new vistas for tourism, with tour operators, from cricket playing nations, bringing in multitudes of supporters for the entire duration of a series, that could be a good advertisement for the tourism industry. Have we exploited these opportunities to earn the maximum revenue, for the industry, from these visits
The Prime Minister also made note of an important aspect of attracting tourists when he dwelt on leisure activities that offer much potential such the creation of world class golf courses in areas such as Galle, Kandy and Iranawila and cruise lines, luxury trains etc.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga hails from an electorate that offer much scope for the development of tourism. The beautiful canals and waterways stretching from Puttalam, that cut across his Wattala electorate, winding their way bordered by breathtaking scenery and exotic wildlife, no doubt, would be a big draw with tourists. Why cannot the Minister think of commencing luxury pleasure boat services, catering to the tourists, on these waterways that, no doubt, would attract foreigners in their numbers, reminiscent of the Gondolas operating in the network of canals in Venice
Be that as it may, the tourism industry which was dealt a body-blow during the war years, needs to be revamped and reorganised, to cater to the modern day demands. All measures must be taken to attract the big time spender, by paying attention to infrastructure development. We have been coasting along, quite satisfied with the traditional features of tourism development. The Prime Minister, himself, has spelt out what needs to be done, to get things on track, for the rapid development of this most vital sector of the countrys economy. It is hoped that all those involved in the industry would pay heed and do their utmost to turn things around.
Not done
The right royal spat that was witnessed between a very senior member of the UNP and a relatively new entrant to the party, the other day, in Ja-ela, was something that could have been avoided. Joseph Micheal Perera entered parliament as far back as 1976, winning the by-election for Ja-ela and is a UNP veteran, which should have been taken into consideration by the organisers of the meeting in question. If anyone deserved to address the meeting, which opportunity was denied to him, he did, as much as for the immense sacrifices he has made on behalf of the party, as for his loyalty to the party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, both in fair and foul weather. The UNPers, who have been having a running battle with the SLFP MPs in the Unity Government, it appears, have turned the guns on their own.

Schoolchildren put in their place
School students should not be allowed to participate in protests or agitation during school hours or after, the Education Ministry said recently.
The ministry said special approval should be obtained from Provincial Education Ministries, Provincial Directors of Education and the Zonal Directors to hold such protests.
It also advised schools not to allow any individual or groups to enter school premises to address students or to meet teachers.
The Ministry said in case of unauthorized entry to the school campus, a school should inform the Police to ensure the protection of students and the normal functioning of the school.
The Ministry learns that several student organisations are attempting to mislead schoolchildren by giving the wrong perspective of the ongoing programmes and their organised campaigned has caused obstruction to the academic activities of schools.
This is an excellent preventive action taken by the Ministry of Education.
We are very kindly appealing to the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education to extend the above precautions and orders to all universities.
See what has happened to our universities. There is no discipline. Many students are boycotting classes. Politicians are misleading university students. Trade unions are using university students to win their demands.
Student union leaders are harassing the university students.
They are not learning and do not allow others to learn. These thugs are controlling and running the show in the campus. These thugs have become heroes in the campus. University teachers have no control of the situation.
These students are attacking security forces also. This is a form of terrorism that has gone out of control.
We request University Grants Commission to follow Education Department and take some meaningful steps to manage the universities. It may be difficult. Remember we want leaders to do difficult things.

## Title: Creative wisdom of Ajahn Chah

Creative wisdom of Ajahn Chah
Most teachings of the great Buddhist monk, Ajahn Chah, who lived in Thailand, are found scattered in various places. As they were delivered as Dhamma talks in Thai language, they came to be translated into English later in the form of essays of much interest. They contain quite a number of literary and prophetic insights that broaden the social and spiritual vision and insights of the reader.
I had the chance of obtaining one such source indicated as Bodhinyana, a collection of Dhamma talks translated into English and published several times. In all there are eight short talks followed by questions and answers with a glossary of Dhamma terms.
Inner wisdom
Although the great priest passed away in 1992, the training which he gave and established is still carried on by his disciples at Wat Pah Pong and its branches in several countries. The reader of the book cited as Bodhinyana gets the chance of knowing the broad perspective of such concepts and letting off, self discipline via meditation, achieving an inner wisdom as versus the working knowledge via mere information, the practice of concentration training and the uncertain and shaky nature of material prospects.
As far as possible, the spiritual teacher gives the listener (in this case, the reader), the opportunity to think in terms of example from folk literature that is orally transmitted down the centuries in the Orient as well as the Occident. There are quite a number of creative insights.
Even some of the Abhidhamma or the higher forms of Dhamma concepts are simplified. One good example could be drawn from the talk titled as Dhamma Nature.
We should consider that our merit and good fortune are very valuable. All we need to do is look around to see how much other creatures are possessed of ill fortune; take dogs, pigs, snakes and other creatures for instance. They have no chance to study, Dhamma, no chance to know Dhamma, no chance to practise Dhamma. These are beings possessed of ill fortune who are receiving karmic retribution. When one has no chance to study, to know, to practise Dhamma, then one has no chance to be free from suffering.
Ill fortune
What does the great monk deliver to us the laymen In short, as human beings we should not allow ourselves to become victims of ill fortune deprived of manners and discipline. On further analysis we tend to ask what are the manners and discipline.
The discipline of ones body and mind culminates in the development of ones manners. This is denoted by the term Seela or restraint that needs perhaps guidance from those who have achieved that state. The development of god manners as Ajahn Chah states lead to a state of happiness.
The state of being happy in many ways is the only profitable way of life. The material riches may not bestow happiness. Humans have the habit of making more and more riches in order to bring about happiness. As Ajahn Chah points out in the Dhamma talk, titled as the two faces of reality, mental objects arise in the mind. They are born out of desire; desire for valuable possessions, desire to be rich and just restless seeking after things in general. This type of greed is not allt hat deep or strong, it is not enough to make you faint  or lose control. However, when sexual desire arises, you are thrown off balance and lose your control.
Hunters snareThen what happens
You would even forget those who raised and brought you up  your own parents!
Ajahn shows the reader as to how the Buddha taught the objects of our senses as a trap. This is compared to a trap laid down by Mara or the death. As such, it is a death trap. The trap is something which binds us, the same as a snare. Ajahn Chah says that its a trap of Maras, a hunters snare, and the hunter is no other than Mara. The discussion that ensues develops into a parable. As Ajahn Chah says if animals are caught in the hunters trap, it is a sorrowful predicament. They are caught fast and held waiting for the owner of the trap. Then a question is raised. Have you ever snared birds The snare springs and boop  caught by the neck. A good strong string now holds it fast whichever the bird flies it cannot escape.
It flies here and flies there, but its held tight waiting for the owner of the snare. When the hunter comes along, thats it  the bird is struck with fear, and there is no escape!
In this manner, the discourse is further developed by the extension of the snare and the hunter. As pointing to the humans, there is the trap of sights, there is the trap of sounds, smells, tastes, touch and other mind objects. They catch the humans, and bind them fast. The metaphor is further developed into a fish caught on a hook. When the fisherman comes, struggle you want, but you cannot get loose.
Ajahn says that actually you are not caught like a fish, but its like a frog. A frog gulps down the whole hook right to its guts it caught in his mouth.
Furthermore, a person thirsting out for sensory happiness is compared to a man who is thirsty for water. The simple example is laid down creatively as follows.
Overpowering desire
A man comes walking along a road. He is very thirsty from his journey and is craving for a drink of water. He stops at a place beside the road and asks for a drink. The owner of the water says: You can drink the water if you like, the colour is good. The smell is good. The taste is good. But if you drink, you will become ill. I must tell you before hand, it will make you sick enough to die or nearly die.
What happens to the thirsty man He does not pay any heed to what the owner says. He drinks the water. It is the same with a person thirsting after the senses. The death occurs to the thirsty man because of overpowering desire to drink and gets so sick that he cannot resist. These Dhamma talks of Ajahn Chah are creative, resourceful and intuitive. Perhaps a reader is inspired to observe that each talk is packed with creative wisdom in the expression as well as the contents I noted that Zen narrative plays a vital role int eh presentation of Dhamma interpretation. As such, the collection of talks is a compendium of Buddhist doctrines enveloped in a creative wisdom.

England spares Sri Lanka the blushes
So after all Sri Lanka had to be greatly indebted to England for securing them an automatic qualification for the 2019 Cricket World Cup which will be staged in England. That news alone must have been like manna from heaven to the current cricket administration that has been battered from all quarters following the disastrous performance of the national team.
West Indies who were eight points adrift of Sri Lanka in the ICC ODI rankings needed to win against Ireland in the one-off ODI and also beat England at least by a margin of 4-0 to oust Sri Lanka from eighth spot  only the top eight ranked teams qualified automatically.
However a washout by bad weather in their game against Ireland and a comprehensive seven-wicket defeat in the first ODI against England meant that West Indies lost their chance of overhauling Sri Lanka in the rankings. They will now have to come through a qualifying round that will take place in March 2018 at either Zimbabwe, UAE or jointly Ireland and Scotland. West Indies will compete with teams like Zimbabwe, and newly elected full members Ireland and Afghanistan and associate member countries Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Scotland, Hong Kong, Kenya and Nepal, where the top two teams will qualify for the ten-team World Cup.
Only once has Sri Lanka the 1996 World Cup winners and two-time World Cup finalists in 2007 and 2011 had to qualify for a place to play in the World Cup. That happened way back in 1979 when they were still an associate member of the ICC and fighting tooth and nail to be admitted as a full member.
In the inaugural World Cup in 1975 Sri Lanka along with East Africa were invited to participate but four years later to be fair by other associate nations as well the ICC hosted an ICC (International Cricket Conference) trophy tournament ahead of the 1979 World Cup where the two finalists would qualify for the World Cup. Both tournaments were held in England.
Sri Lanka not only came through that tournament with flying colours defeating Canada in the final but also became the first associate member country to defeat a full member when they beat India in a World Cup group match played at Old Trafford, Manchester.
The Sri Lanka team captained by Anura Tennekoon gave a good account of themselves in the ICC trophy tournament beating USA (by 6 wickets), Holland (by 45 runs), conceding a walkover to Israel and an abandoned match against Wales.
In the semi-finals they beat Denmark by 208 runs and in the finals played at Worcester, Canada by 60 runs to become the first holders of the ICC trophy. Both Sri Lanka and Canada qualified to play in the 1979 World Cup and the former distinguished themselves by going onto beat India in the World Cup as well. However in both those matches Tennekoon was injured and it was vice-captain Bandula Warnapura who led the team.
Although it was England and Australia  the founder members of the ICC who opposed Sri Lankas elevation to Test status for a number of years using their two-votes each to veto every attempt from the seventies it was these two countries that supported Sri Lanka after they finally became a full member.
England played the inaugural Test against Sri Lanka in February 1982 and it was largely the report filed by Cameron Battersby the Australian team manager of the 1981 tour to Sri Lanka that went a long way towards the country achieving Test status notwithstanding the outstanding speech made by the then president of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board the late Gamini Dissanayake at the ICC meeting at Lords in 1981.
In the initial stages of Test cricket Sri Lanka banked on England for support to sustain them in the coaching of coaches and to assist the national team that was trying to find its feet at the top level.
Australia more than England have helped Sri Lanka cricket in many ways by way of providing some outstanding cricket coaches and physios for the national team as well as from the biomechanics side of things.
Now that Sri Lanka has cleared a major hurdle and qualified for the 2019 World Cup it is upto the administration to ensure the players and the support staff gets every bit of support they need towards winning another World Cup. The national selectors too have a responsible role to play in picking the right combination so that no area is left unattended.

FR against Meetotamulla garbage dump fixed for argument

A fundamental rights petition filed against Meetotamulla garbage dump was today fixed for argument on February 14 next year by Supreme Court.
This petition was filed by seven residents of Meetotamulla area citing Colombo Municipal Council, Urban development authority, Western Province Waste Management Authority, Central Environment Authority, Kolonnawa Municipal Council and the Attorney General as Respondents.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) informed the Supreme Court that they have taken a decision to refrain from dumping garbage at Meetotamulla area in Kolonnawa.
The Supreme Court had also granted leave to proceed with this fundamental rights petition.
The petitioners are seeking a declaration from Court stating that the proposed expansion of the dumping site is an imminent infringement of their fundamental rights.
The Petitioner stated that the Kolonnawa city is a highly residential area, with high population density and laments in the middle of this highly residential area is a huge and growing garbage dumping site, with a huge mountain of garbage, which has now grown to over 18 acres in extent.
They stated that the garbage from the Colombo Municipal limit is brought and dumped into this mountain of garbage and that approximately 750 to 1200 tons of garbage come into the site on a daily basis.
They allege the stench is now becoming unbearable for the families and children and that there are tremendous and serious health hazard, with around 30 people of the area having died due to germs and dengue, rat flu, skin deceases, kidney diseases. Hundreds of other families are affected and their numbers are growing daily.
They say that there are other sustainable solutions (other than the dumping of garbage in the aforesaid manner), which could bring an end to this problem, but that these measures are not being taken by the respondents.
They alleged that the respondents are taking immediate measures to demolish another 100 houses to expand the site for a further 3 acres.
They stated that if the proposed expansion takes place there will be serious, immeasurable, irreparable and disastrous ramifications.
They added that there are people and companies who are interested in purchasing the garbage (for money) and who are willing to recycle the garbage at their own expense in an environment friendly manner.
Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva Appeared for the AG. President's Counsel Saliya Peiris with counsel Nuwan Bopage appeared for the petitioners.

As the Social Democrats (SPD) head for the opposition benches, an unlikely match-up between the FDP, Chancellor Angela Merkels conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Greens appears to be the only option for government.
The prospect of a Jamaica alliance, named after the parties colours of black (CDU), yellow (FDP) and green has thrown the gulfs between the parties political convictions into stark relief.
Bringing the three together on climate, economic and fiscal policy would be difficult enough, but the FDPs biggest spanner in the works could come on Europe.
Its youthful party leader Christian Lindner has rejected any reform of the euro single currency area -- pushed by French President Emmanuel Macron and cautiously welcomed by Merkel -- that would create a centralised budget to smooth out national economic crises, managed by a eurozone finance minister.
And the FDP would prefer to use Germanys bumper budget surpluses to offer voters and businesses 30 billion euros ($35.7 billion) in tax cuts, rather than investing the cash at home and shrinking the countrys trade surplus as its foreign partners have demanded.
Of course were ready to take on responsibility, Lindner told journalists in Berlin Monday, while warning there would be nothing worse than continuing the policies of the past four years with new colours.
We think its necessary for the law to encourage individual responsibility in European countries finances, Lindner declared. The FDP would be prepared to back some increased investments using existing mechanisms like the European Investment Bank, he said.
But we couldnt agree to a eurozone budget which would automatically lead to fiscal transfers in the EU, that wouldnt solve problems but make them worse, Lindner added.
The press conference saw the 39-year-old swipe at both prospective coalition partners, claiming that CDU, the SPD and the Greens were indistinguishable in the previous parliament.
He took on the Greens on their home turf, accusing them of being obsessed with banning fossil fuel power plants and cars rather than more easily reached low-hanging fruit of carbon dioxide emissions reduction.
The Greens will have to tread a very long road to reach discussions about Jamaica, Lindner insisted.
One Ukrainian journalist pinned the party leader down with a question on the annexation of Crimea by Russia.
Lindner had argued during the campaign that the issue should be compartmentalised in favour of normalising economic relations with Russia by gradually dismantling EU sanctions against Moscow. The annexation of Crimea (by Russia) is a breach of international law, he said. There would be no question for the FDP of lifting sanctions without getting something in return.
Lindner also took a moment during the press conference to slam the SPDs immediate ruling out of returning to government.
The Free Democrats caution about entering government dates back to 2013, when the party failed to clear the 5.0-percent hurdle to make it into parliament -- after four years of coalition with Merkel when they struggled to make an impact.
The party is back with 10.7 percent of the vote, enough for 80 seats -- but Lindner knows how quickly he could lose his 10 percent if he makes too many concessions, news weekly Der Spiegel commented. Nevertheless, there are common points with the Greens that could feed into a joint programme for modernising the German economy. - AFP

GDP growth of 4% for 2Q better than expected - FC Research
First Capital (FC) Researchs pre-policy analysis for September 2017 highlights that GDP growth for 2Q of 2017 was better than expected as the economy grew by 4.0% YoY in the 2Q of 2017 with industrial and services activities recording higher growth rates of 5.2% YoY and 4.5% YoY respectively.
FC Research upgrades private sector credit growth for 2017 E to 16% from 14% amidst a possible pickup towards year end. In spite of a high private sector credit figure in June 2017 we believe overall credit is likely to continue to remain under check.
We believe inflation will be upward towards October and beyond with the floods in May 2017 affecting the supply in the current growing season. As a result, there could be possible supply side shortages towards October and beyond but may continue to remain around the 6.0% mark throughout the year.
Sri Lankas forex reserves rose to US$ 7.7 billion in August 2017 from US$ 6.7 biilion in July, helped by US$ 550 million syndicated loan and dollar purchases by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).
The CBSL had net purchased US$ 975 million from currency markets so far this year. FC Research believes Foreign Reserves are now at comfortable levels. During the last two months, the CBSL brought down its holding in Government Securities from Rs 138 billion to below Rs 60 billion as at Septemebr 21.
Economists said the CBSL will still pencil in three hikes for 2018, but with the first of those not projected until June, versus March in the CBSLs previous set of forecasts. September 2017 survey shows the CBSL expects to raise policy rates in December 2017 and no further hikes are expected after December 2017 until after May 2018.
FC Research believes that considering the current economic conditions with better than expected GDP growth level and the considerable improvement in the economic health the current monetary policy is appropriate and no change is required.

Greatness thrust upon SWRD
SWRD Bandaranaike, the chairman of the party and Prime Minister, interrupted his speech to honour the monk who arrived late; then he walked up to him to pay his obeisance to the man who conspired and lured the assassination four and a half months later.
The troubled 7th annual conference was held on May 16 and 17, 1959, at Kurunegala 58 years ago, under the auspices of founder Bandaranaike. The factional struggles and ideological clashes within the coalition of SLFP/VLSSP [Philip]/ BP [Daha] that formed the ruling party Mahajana Eksath Peramuna [MEP] had by this time reached a climax.
Ven. Buddharakkita Thera, a powerful force behind the regime thought SWRD was drifting towards the left under the influence of Philip Gunawardena, father of Marxism in the island. The high priest was at the centre of chaos; he purposely arrived late to the sessions. The controversial monk walked right into the hall in a hostile way commanding attention. Chairman of the party and PM Bandaranaike was on his feet -- the entire audience stood up.
The charismatic and malicious monk who usually did not care about the opinions, rights, or feelings of others had a quick look at the audience with a flash of cheeky smile and focused pompously at the figures seated on the stage, but paid little attention on the Chair or the Speaker. SWRD Bandaranaike, the chairman of the party and Prime Minister interrupted his speech and walked up to pay his obeisance to the man who conspired to assassinate him four and a half months later.
The atmosphere was electrified as SWRD continued his address with a changed tone and emphasizing the fact that the SLFP and the government strictly followed the middle path. Receiving thunderous applause for his Kurunegala Doctrine, a coinage by scribes of the day, he said, We are opposed to both Communism and Fascism to Capitalism and Materialism. Our party stands against any attempt to impose any of these on the people of this country as he was under pressure by the monk and the right wing led by Stanley de Zoysa, W Dahanayake and R. G. Senanayake. They took control of affairs at the summit from the moment the monk walked in; the meeting tilted in favour of the right, while a disillusioned leader, the Prime Minister watched haplessly.
Parliamentary democracy
Both Bandaranaikes -- SWRD and Sirima -- came from the aristocratic property owning feudalistic class, who acted against their class interest. They nationalized bus companies, Colombo harbour, insurance, petroleum, plantations and introduced many more socialist measures such as the Paddy Lands Act. SWRDs exit from the UNP to break or challenge the domination of political supremacy held by an urban elite and create a situation that cemented a two party system which is a necessary ingredient for proper parliamentary democracy, where people could select an alternative party.
SWRD Bandaranaike, the young Oxonian returning from Britain, firmly believed in a Federal structure for the island nation; however, later entering competitive politics, he and the party blundered by choosing to propagate nationalism, language issues that ultimately led to decades long communal clashes, terrorism and civil war. With the formation of the coalition MEP, the SLFP gained a reputation as a socialist-oriented party. SWRD, though aligned with the Marxist parties -- the leader submitted to extremist nationalist forces that became unmanageable; the result was strict implementation of Sinhala Only Policy, creating ethnic disharmony and clashes that began in 1958. In Shakespearian drama, Malvolio remarks; In my stars, I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon em.Act 2 - Scene 5: Twelfth Night.
Was Solomon West Ridgway Dias Bandaranaike born great, achieved greatness or had greatness thrust upon him
SWRDs election campaign
Ven. Mapitigama Buddharakkita Thera, the chief incumbent of the historic Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara was also the leader of the influential United Bhikku Front (Eksath Bhikku Peramuna); his close association, political and personal with Health Minister Wimala Wijewardene was no secret. They played a crucial role in mobilizing support for the MEP during the 1956 elections. The party created in 1951 managed to form a coalition government within five years.
Ven. Buddharakkita had been a businessmen who prudently dipped in to import and export trade, and was a wealthy monk, who had little respect for vinaya rules. The powerful prelate had lavishly spent for SWRDs election campaign. He was responsible for staging a satyagraha with 500 monks at Prime Ministers Rosemead Place residence in 1957, compelling the PM to abrogate the pact he signed with the leader of the Tamil community aimed at devolving a reasonable power-sharing between Sinhala and Tamil speaking communities. The head prelates association with the fair minister had been the subject of gossip of news sheets and pamphlets. SWRD ignored ministers urge for taking action against perpetrators.
The crisis within the SLFP brewed over this plus governments left wings opposition to granting a shipping tender violating the procedures to Ven. Buddharakkita. Personal disputes and policy issues within members of the party had to be settled by the leader in many instances. An unparalleled Cabinet strike orchestrated by the right wing ministers was a tragedy he faced during his short rule of three and a half years.
The influential monk wanted to import rice from Burma (present Myanmar) through his shipping company, to which left wing senior Cabinet Ministers opposed. SWRD respected his ministers advice and refused to grant the money-spinning shipping contract to the prelates nominee. Next, tenders were called for purchasing two ships -- the monk made an effort to obtain the tender through his authority to which PM refrained from interfering.
Provoked by this step-motherly treatment the prelate decided on a course of action that led to the assassination of Prime Minister Bandaranaike on September 26, 1959, by a hired gunman, an Aryuvedic lecturer and an extremist Sinhala-Buddhist monk. Thalduwe Somarama was lured to believe SWRD was planning to divide the country.

GSP+ will boost economic growth to over 4%
With GSP+ beginning to kick in the fourth quarter, the countrys overall annual economic growth in 2017 will be somewhere between 4% and 4.5%, Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy said yesterday.
Addressing the monetary policy press briefing the Governor said the current account deficit will probably be 3% of the GDP and the trade deficit was running at 9% at the moment and the trade deficit at the end of this year will be about US$10 billion.
Sri Lanka has one of the very regressive tax systems in the world where by over 80% tax collection was through indirect tax.
The government is going in the right direction in terms of trying to collect more direct tax, Dr. Coomaraswamy said. The Governor envisaged that by year end, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP will be 16%.
He said the reason for inflation to reduce to 2% in the first quarter of 2016 was because they imported deflation because the prices of some imported goods came down. Now imported commodity prices have increased and that was one of the reasons apart from the increase of VAT rates that led to an increase in inflation. However, he said they expected the inflation to stabilize at 5% in the first quarter of 2018. The Governor said he would like the private sector credit growth to come down a little bit more. It is at 18% and we would like it to come down to about 15 % by the end of the year."
He said if there was unsustainable credit growth, then clearly action would be taken to tighten monetary policy. He predicted that the budget deficit this year would be 5% of GDP.
Dr. Coomaraswamy also said that the country has reached the borrowing ceiling now and would not go for foreign capital borrowings this year.According to the current provisions of the new Inland Revenue Act, there may not be any tax levied on foreign inflows into the government securities market, he said.
The Governor said that they see an absolute decline in foreign worker remittances into the country after the rate of growth slowed down for a while. That was disturbing at one level when considering that it has been financing 70-80% of the countrys trade deficit.
However, he said in the medium term it cant be a bad thing because the country had a very tight labour market and the ideal scenario was to see investments and FDI coming into the export sector or tradable goods sector and employing more labour. So a shift of labour from temporary migration to a growing export sector would be a positive development because it will also address some serious social problems. The Governor said the governments policy was also to change the composition of temporary migrants.
He said that his view on smuggling rupee notes overseas was that it was illegal.
Dr. Coomaraswamy said the decision to hand over shares of state banks does not come under the purview of the Central Bank and that was a decision to be taken by the Government and that he was not aware about such a decision being made.

It is considered as a divine instrument. Till today, the temples and religious bodies of south India and Tamil Hindu population all over the world provide full patronage and preserve this classical musical tradition.

This procession musical orchestra is often used in temple open air processions, welcoming processions, for weddings as auspicious music and in village folk festivals extra.
The origin and development of the Nagaswaram could be traced back from the period of 15th 16th and 17th centuries. According to South Indian musical history Nagaswaram originated from the village musical instrument Mugaveena. The Nagaswaram players blow the air inside the instrument and bring out the sound.
According to second century A.D, Sillapathikaram describes an ancient instrument named vangiyam which was in use during that period. This instrument was also called Ezhil. Even this instrument also had seven holes and played with fingers. From gathered research information Nagaswaram must have had close ties with this instrument.

Outstanding exponents
The cymbal balances the tempo and co-ordinates the Thavil and Nagaswaram together. Along with these instruments, Suriti box is also used to balance pitch level. For this instrument, mike is not at all used, because this sound is quite big.It is not at all necessary to amplifier the sound level. There are plenty of outstanding exponents in the field. Except a few, all are belong to one particular community. In earlier days for the temple dance Sadir, Nagaswaram was used as one of the accompaniment. Till today, this particular instrument is not learned or played by all, like other Carnatic musical instruments. Nagaswaram and Thavil are played and practised by a particular Hindu community. Size-wise Nagaswaram and Thavil are the biggest instruments in the Carnatic musical tradition. Because of the sizes of the instruments, this combined orchestra is often referred to as Perya Melam.

Very soon, the duo was out of sight and Wimala, his beloved wife was waiting impatiently for her husband and their children Suba, Maya, Rita and the three sons Vibhutha, Vidhusha and Kalingu were fast asleep.
The time was sharp one at night; Wimala fell asleep on the rickety couch in the small living room. It was dead at night. Wimala was in slumber when she heard some men or animals encircling their house. Their house was at the edge of the jungle and so she ignored the sounds for a while. She woke up with trembling limbs. A knock on the door; she took the knife to her hand and slowly approached the rear door. It was quite palpable to her that police had surrounded their house.
Mahesh had strictly told her not to open the door to anyone in his absence. She kept silent. She kept vigil for some time and the frightful sounds stopped. She went back to sleep and on her waking up she found a huge sack full of chicken meat. It was hidden in the backyard by Mahesh and their children were herded to their schools on two rides on his bicycle. Mahesh was waiting for about half an hour and a white van came. He put on his immaculately white long sleeved shirt and drove away with the last night theft in the boot.
A new couple had tied their nuptial knots on the altar of purity and their guests appeased their taste buds on the sacrifice of the poor chickens for the education of Maheshs children. The irony is dramatic.
Mahesh and Wimala left no stone unturned to make their lost hopes realized in childrens education. Mahesh was only two marks short of university admission. His father was a municipal worker and mother; a basket woman who carried vegetables on her head from door to door in the city of Galle. Wimala hails from a well to do family, but her insistence to marry Mahesh made her a family outcast. She inherited nothing from her parents and they turned a blind eye to her on the city streets. Her numerous requests to her parents to help them fell on deaf ears and they took to their hearts to make their six children shine on the horizon of education one day by hook or crook. Mahesh and Wimala were in the same class when they bid adieu to their alma mater.
The third of the family, Kalingu was a prodigal son and all the others played no second fiddle to anyone in studies. Mahesh and Wimala underwent many a hardship to educate their children and as a dutiful wife Wimala, under any circumstance didnt let their children know how money was earned for their education. They were provided with the best of education, uniforms, tuition and additional reading materials all the time because they were bound by a firm determination to live a contented life one day.
Their homestead was ideal for home gardening and Wimala spent most of her time in it to keep the home fires burning. Their children make it a habit to burn the midnight oil to come off with flying colours at their examinations. The garden became very greenish with Wimalas sweat and home expenses were no more a big burden to them. They had rented out the house and the plot from the village moneylender and he increased the monthly rent.
The only motivational factor for them was Wimalas parents Cinderella treatment to them as her sisters and brothers were well treated by them. Childrens potentials were high and their gumption to achieve their target knew no bounds. Both Wimala and Mahesh applied for government jobs and desperately failed at their attempts.
They genuinely wanted to give up stealing, yet they could not find anyway. During the election time, they filled a bundle of applications to be given jobs immediately after the election, but when they met the winning candidate they were told that they were not on the priority list. Many a night he spent climbing trees to hang cut-outs, but the real job applications had been given to the kith and kin.
One day their eldest son asked his mother about the way of income of their father. The mother told him their father was a supplier of fresh plantains and meat to the city hotels, wholesale, with the help of a friend who was one of his classmates. She slowly, yet steadily put into the ears of the other children the same notion with common sense.
Mahesh was caught red-handed by police while he was transporting fifty kilos of the fork, wild boar flesh.
The police prosecuted Mahesh and his accomplice who provided the white van and both were found guilty. Mahesh was sentenced to a prison term of three months, it was rigorous imprisonment while his friend was fined ten thousand rupees or in default of the fine three weeks imprisonment at an open prison camp. His parents paid the fine and took him to their custody.
One day Wimala visited the open prison camp in Hambanthota and to her dismay, Mahesh was wearing the prisoners jumper. Tears came down her cheeks, yet she managed to discuss what to do till he returns to support the family. Adding insult to injury, her father had unexpectedly visited Wimala and told her that it was poetic justice. Their eldest son Vibhutha had come of age by that time and asked her mother about fathers long stay.
They were in a common agreement not to divulge the happening to the children. She never breached the promise and the news went around the village that Mahesh was in prison. Wimala thought of the dignity of the growing children and left the area. A distant relation had come to give them a helping hand and Wimala started another minor business.
That was making string hoppers and hoppers for the nearby canteens of the large industrial area of Koggala. She could manage both home and childrens education independently. In the meanwhile, Mahesh was given presidential pardon on good behavior and came home. The eldest son Vibhutha was selected to the medical faculty and the others were doing their studies well.
Their family income was not enough for their growing demands and Mahesh embarked on a very precarious path. It was going with the way of life of the area and he was frequently travelling in luminous cars in good clothes with a tie. Children were very happy as his father was thought to be an executive. Within a very short spell of time, he had to appear before the court several times. When he appeared for the fifth time in two years the judge took up the matters seriously.
You have a very notorious history of criminal behavior. You have committed a number of thefts and caught red-handed in drug trafficking. Do you have anything to declare to the court The judge inquired perusing through the penalty code.
O your majesty, it is the society that made me a thief. Mahesh quipped without any hesitation as the court had become like his own compound to him now. His eldest son, now a promising medical student fainted in the court precincts as it was very palpable to him how his expenses had been made by his parents. His wife was summoned to the dock as the main accomplice of the case and she said to the court, My husband is a jailbird. All these time I managed to look after our children as a dutiful mother under trying conditions as all the attempts we made to live a righteous life failed. O my majesty we are innocent. It is the society that made us criminals.

Herds of elephants destroyed several houses on the last weekend and damaged fences around their gardens. They then invaded paddy mill and ransacked the paddy in the gunny bags. The villagers somehow escaped from the jumbo attack, a resident said.
UNP Sammanthurai Organiser M.A. Hassen Ali visited the Aalwakkarai villages and promised them that he would take actions to resolve the issue.
The villagers say elephants normally enter the villages. "But recently, they invade the villages more often and destroy crops and assets," they said.

Last days of the Kandyan Kingdom
The downfall of the Kandyan kingdom can be traced back to the ascendancy of the Nayakkar rulers also called Vaduga or vaduge belonged to the vaduge caste, Telagu speaking group, originally hailed form Madurai. When their territory was overrun by the Muslims they moved to the Coramandal coast which formed part of the Vijayanagar empire.
It was King Senerat (1604-1635) who wanted to enhance the prestige of the line descendants by getting his son Rajasinha II (1635-1687) married to a Nayakkar princess from Madurai in South India. This practice of marrying a Nayakkar princess was followed by his son Vimaladharmasuriya II (1687-1707). Before King Narendrasinha died without issue, he nominated his queens brother Sri Vijaya Rajasinha (1739-1747), a Nayakkar as his successor and thereafter in 1739 Nayakkar dynasty became the ruling dynasty in the Kandyan kingdom.
Thus Nayakkar queens arrived in Kandy with their parents, brothers, sisters and close relatives. During this period there were many Nayakkar families living in Kandy. The kings occupied the present Malabar Street which was earlier called Kumaruppe Veediya which was made a forbidden area for the Sinhalese including the Buddhist Sangha.
Royal villages
The relatives of the Nayakkar rulers were maintained at state expense. They were given posts of honour and revenues of specified royal villages  Gabadagam. Some of them had trade dealings with the Dutch East India Company.
They traded with the Dutch and amassed considerable riches and provided money for the Sinhalese Chieftains and obtained valuable property close to the capital. Thus the Nayakkar families of the kings were economically better off than the Sinhalese chieftains. Along with their economic power Nayakkars became superior and remained aloof from the Sinhalese people.
There were other differences like religion and language that brought a rift between the Sinhalese people and the Nayakkars. They were Hindus and followed South Indian customs. They rarely married into Sinhalese families and remained close to their king giving him advice on the affairs of government and accepted bribes for granting favours from their king.
Nayakkars also created rivalries between ministers. They observed Hindu rituals conducted by the Brahmin priests and encouraged dancing in the royal court like what the Indian rulers did in their royal courts and they had Kavikara Maduwa to eulogize the kings by the minstrels.
Nayakkar dynasty
The Sinhalese chieftains complained to the kings about these changes that were disadvantageous to their interests. But the Nayakkar relatives of the king conspired to keep their power with the Nayakkar dynasty.
The resentment of the Sinhalese chieftains was first manifested in 1709 when Yalegoda Adikaram attempted to install Pattige Bandara, son of Vimala Dharma Suriya II by a Sinhalese wife in place of Narendrasinha, son of the same king by a Nayakkar queen.
The second rebellion in 1732 was caused by King Narendrasinhas appointment of a Nayakkar to the important post of the Gabada Nilame in charge of the kings lands.
The third attempt against the Nayakkar rule was an unsuccessful attempt by the chieftains. It was led by Leuke to place Unambuve Bandara, son of Narendrasinha by a Sinhalese wife on the throne in 1739, in preference to the Kings brother-in-law Sri Vijaya Rajasinha (1739-1747) who was a Nayakkar.
The fourth attempt was in 1749 when the ministers of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinha (1747-1782) wanted to place on the throne a person who would safeguard the customs of the Sinhalese. The ministers planned to appoint a Siamese prince to the throne. This move was headed by an Adikaram name Samarakkodi and the chief prelates of the Malwatte Vihara  Welivita and Tibbotuwawe Theras.
The fifth attempt was to dispose Rajadhi Rajasinha (1782-1798) and place Mapitiye Bandara, son of Kirthi Sri Rajasinha, on the throne.
The Nayakkar rulers survived all these plots because there was disunity and rivalry among the Sinhala chieftains. They were unhappy over the Nayakkar rulers but would prefer to see a foreign ruler on the throne rather than one of their own.
Against this background the actions of Adikarams and Pilimatalawa and Ehelepola should be examined. Pilimatalawa Adikaram was a nationalist who wanted to oust the Nayakkar rulers from the throne of Kandy.
When King Rajadhi Rajasinha died without issue, the opportunity arose for Pilimatalawa Adikaram to achieve his task. According to the custom of succession to the throne of the Nayakkars, the queens brother Muthusamy should have been elected by the chieftains and he was also nominated by the late king before he died. But Pilimatalawa Adhikram ignored this accepted custom and rejected Muthusamys claim to the throne. Instead he imprisoned Muthusamy and selected an unknown youth of 18 Kannasamy, who was the son of a sister of one of the queens. He was made the king as Sri Vikrama Rajasinha (1798-1815), who was the last King of Kandy.

Addressing the last session of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, Herath said that he likes to be a provincial councillor than a parliamentarian.
The tenure of the sixth Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council expired yesterday.
The UPFA won the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council in 2012 gaining 28 seats. The United National Party gained 14 seats while Ceylon Workers Congress won two seats. We will not allow to bring any proposals that would undermine the powers of Provincial Councils.
We are in a quandary whether we can go with the elements who want to find out the assets of journalists, he said.

Mammoth affection
I think Tharindu was once an elephant (in another life). And now, hes been born again to save the elephants.
- Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera at the launch of Tharindu Muthukumaranas book The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants.
Dedicating his gigantic work to well-wishes and the conservationists, Tharindu raises concerns about an impending danger of total extinction of Asian elephants during the anthropogenic Holocene extinction.
The books authenticity, clarity of thought and complete production of established facts blended with original ideas makes it a very readable and moving text. The chapter under Mythology. makes it intermittently amusing but not overly exhaustive. Tharindu deserves acclaim, and should be congratulated on his presentation of the complex events of this category of giants on land. This is perhaps a very helpful volume from the point of view of understanding the world of pachyderms.
Animal kingdom
This book should be read not only for the minute of the details of the elephant population, but also for the alerts it provides. If historys lessons were not heeded, Mankind is surely destined to be consumed by them. Very occasionally a book comes along that change your life, in the sense that it alters your thinking and causes you to reevaluate the things that everyone knows.
On one level, Elephants is a book about animal kingdom, about human culture, which does not sound particularly promising. Study of pachyderms can be a niche subject, and it can be arid. The book starts from what may seem an innocuous topic: However, that includes both the entire history of life on earth and the history of Proboscideans itself, and the book is notable for both its breadth and depth. It focuses in immense detail on single events. It thus offers a comprehensive overview of the pachyderms history and existence. Tharindu challenges many of the universal beliefs about what we think we know about the in intricacies of nature at a point when the question of ELEPHANT HUMAN CONFLICT is a daily topic in media and the public sense of right and wrong. One of the books main strengths, and most perceptible features, is the way it constructs its overarching accounts from meticulously-researched facts. The text is straightforward, and full of well-expressed remarks or comments that reverberate long after the book is finished.
One of the most fascinating passages in the book is a discussion of elephant participation in religious rituals. The book is profusely illustrated, hundreds of photographs, sketches, and illustration are included to demonstrate or accompany the paragraphs in the text.
Absorbing chapter
He soaks up animal facts and explains eco systems; there are chapters formed around behaviors and defense systems, and an absorbing chapter on the history of life on earth. The book is divided up into several sections. His art is simple and amazing. I would say the length alone makes it better suited to upper elementary and middle school elephant lovers. There is ample white space around the illustrations and text making it less visually distracting. A great way to start senior school children on their reading journey as well as their journey of learning about environment and elephants. A couple of copies should be made available in every school library.
A reader would value the descriptions on elephants intelligence, the intricacy of their lives and families and their skill to endure famine and human brutality. One can discover the tenderness of the animal, how the trunks that reach out and gently stroke a nervous toddler and a fierce commitment to defend their kind in face of devastatingly superior force.
The book gathers almost one-and-a-half decades' worth of studying the elephants into a single volume. ".Elephants" is important for contravening decades-old hypothesis about elephant behavior and facilitate a much more conversant approach to saving the elephant and discovering better ways to support labors that would see humans living happily side by side with these wonderful non-humans.
There are still hunters and poachers who shoot the elephants for their ivory. The book enlightened me on many such cruel practices. Tharindus observations of courtship, birth, communication, death, and social structure of the species kept my interest to the end. The author is first and foremost a ground researcher with long hours of first hand observation of untamed and tamed elephants. The trouble with a lot of expert books of elephant conduct is that they almost have too much familiarity. Tharindu strikes a balance between talking scientifically relevant information and amusing the reader. It is both good science and good writing.
Trumpeting noises
Ever since I can commit to memory elephants have fascinated me. Their sheer dimension, their fluttering ears, the echoing and trumpeting noises they make, the unhurried and methodical way they stroll and their amazingly attractive tusks fascinated me. The author had relieved me of all my reservations, doubts and speculations.
Clashes between elephants and people arent new, but they are growing. As human populations grow, territory becomes disjointed, with elephants losing more of the space they need to live. But the solutions to human-elephant conflicts are often politically provoked and can lead to brutality to animals. Individual elephants and whole family groupings may be fenced in to insignificant areas or even culled. Managing such conflicts entails great care; Tharindu has a solution. Finally, I admire the author for the work he has done and his dedication to the species; the world needs a few more youngsters like Tharindu Muthukumarana. I would recommend that anyone pick up this book for pleasure reading as well as an interesting scientific study of the elephants.

Mangala condemns monk-led mob attack on Rohingya refugees [Video]

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera today condemned in the strongest terms, the Buddhist monk led mob attack on Rohingya refugees under UNHCR protection in Mount Lavina
In a statement the Minister said, I condemn these actions not only as the Minister in-charge of media, but also as a Buddhist who is proud of the fact that Buddhism is a religion of non violence and compassion.
In fact, this is not the first time Sri Lanka has given temporary shelter to such refugees, the Minister continued  way back in March 2008 the Sri Lanka Navy rescued the survivors and they were kept here until 2012, when they were resettled in the United States.
In 2013, the Sri Lanka Navy rescued two boatloads of Rohingya survivors in the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka  32 of them, and they too were kept under the care of the UNHCR until they were settled in Canada and the United States of America, the Minister said.
It is a shameful act and every right-minded citizen of this country, especially Buddhists must condemn this action by these so-called priests. And I also urge the police to take strongest possible action against the perpetrators of these crimes against these innocent refugees, Minister Samaraweera said.

Ministers, Officials caught in tense situation over expressway
A tense situation arose on Monday evening when government officials and ministers met to discuss issues regarding the Central Expressway at the Nailiya Viharasthanaya in Kurunegala. The officials and ministers had to be escorted out of the premises under police security as negotiations turned into a protest.
The discussion was with regard to the section being built from Pothuhera to Kurunegala. Around 200 residents from the areas of Amunawatte, Henmulla, Weherabanda, Gattuwana and Boyagana had come for the discussions and they complained that they would lose land to the Expressway.
On behalf of the Government, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi, Kurunegala Divisional Secretary Mahinda Ekanayake and officers were present.
Sooriyarachchi tried to explain matters regarding the Central Expressway, but the residents of the area kept interrupting him and protesting. The discussions heated up. The residents strongly insisted that the expressway be built on columns to avoid effects of flooding, to pay adequate compensation and to make transparent the system of compensation.
Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe tried to address the gathering, but due to the crowd shouting at the minister, a heated exchange took place. The residents having prepared a petition with their demands had handed it over to the Deputy Minister and asked that he in writing assure them that their demands would be met, but the Deputy Minister had pointed out that he did not have the authority to meet such demands.
As the situation worsened, police decreed that the government officials leave the meeting. As the officials left, the residents in the area booed at them in protest.
Those who participated in the discussions then proceeded to march towards the Boyagane-Malpitiya junction, a kilometer away from the temple and they blocked the Kurunegala-Colombo main road. This caused heavy traffic congestion in the area for over three hours.
The situation was resolved when the Kurunegala ASP, who came to the place, promised to get them a meeting with the Transport Minister and the Prime Minister to resolve the issue.

Nestl wins Presidential Export Award for coconut kernel products
Nestl has won Highest Value Added Exporter in the coconut kernel product category at the recent Presidential Export Awards.
This marks the sixth Presidential Export Award for the company, in recognition of its strong contribution to national exports and efforts to create sustainable livelihoods for local coconut growers and farm workers.
Nestl Lanka is one of the worlds largest exporters of coconut milk powder. The product is exported to over 50 countries and is sold locally under the Maggi brand.
It is manufactured in Nestls state-of-the-art factory in Kurunegala, where the company procures around 80 million Sri Lankan coconuts every year, providing a livelihood to close to 6,000 local coconut farming families.
Nestl Vice President - Supply Chain Jos Roldn said, We are honoured to accept this award in recognition of our success in exporting Sri Lankan coconut milk powder. We pioneered the manufacturing of coconut milk powder in the 1980s and have continued to invest in the local coconut industry since. Our efforts have made Sri Lankan coconut milk powder one of the most sought after in the world, offering the best taste, highest quality and minimal environmental impact.
Nestls coconut milk powder is used by culinary professionals globally for a variety of dishes, as well as by world leading manufacturers of confectionery products like chocolates and ice cream. With coconut waste a growing concern in the face of crop scarcity in the island, it also offers consumers a more efficient way of using coconut milk. Authorities estimate only 65% of the coconut kernel is extracted from the raw fruit when used in-home. Coconut milk powder, in contrast, utilises as much as 85% of the coconut kernel.
To help secure coconut cultivation and rural livelihoods, Nestl launched the Nestl Coconut Plan in late 2016, in collaboration with the Coconut Cultivation Board.
Two thousand coconut farming families received 10,000 high yield coconut plantlets, and benefit from comprehensive training programmes as well as model farms to help benchmark best practices.
The Plan encourages coconut cultivation by commercial farmers as well as home growers, both within the coconut triangle and outside, in areas identified as high potential for successful coconut cultivation.
More recently, Nestl initiated a significant investment to enhance its manufacturing capacity for coconut milk powder to support demand, in consideration of the high growth potential in both local and export markets.
Nestl Managing Director Shivani Hegde said, We believe our purpose as a company is enhancing quality of life and contributing to a healthier future.
We are honoured and most proud to be recognised for our strong export performance and for our work in investing in projects that make a difference to our farmers, their families and workers. By supporting them we build stronger communities, which in turn help to ensure the long term security of the industry.
The Presidential Export Awards is an annual event that recognises and awards companies that have made a significant contribution to the local exports sector. It is organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board.
Previous awards won by Nestl include Best Exporter of the Coconut and Coconut Based Product Sector in 2010 and 2013, Best Exporter of the Food and Other Beverages Product Sector in 2011 and Best Multinational Company (MNC) Engaged in Exports in 2014 and 2015.

Speaking to Daily News Business, Dr. Damian Fernando said that this initiative is a great milestone for the country in gaining much important recognition as one of the key MICE destinations in the world.
He said although Sri Lanka is also rated as a popular MICE destination, this is the first occasion top Indian tourism corporates and top global leading brands such as Colgate, Times Group, Uniliver and TATA Communications will come together to commence this new initiative.

No Misbah, Younis as Pakistan look to new Test era
Abu Dhabi: Pakistan will step into a new Test era without retired batting greats Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq when they take on Sri Lanka in the first Test in Abu Dhabi from Thursday.
Playing without Younis and Misbah is unaccustomed territory for Pakistan, who haven't had a Test featuring neither of the talismanic, prolific pair in seven years.
It comes as they prepare to welcome the return of full international cricket to their home country next month, when Sri Lanka visit for a Twenty20 game in Lahore.
Together, Younis and Misbah have appeared in 193 Tests, accumulating 15,331 runs, 44 centuries and 15 century stands between them, briefly lifting the team to the top of the Test rankings in August last year.
They have dominated the batting at Pakistan's venues in United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they have been forced to play home games since a deadly terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009.
The pair made Pakistan so invincible that they have not lost any of the nine series they have played in UAE, with new captain Sarfraz Ahmed admitting it will be tough to replace them.
"Obviously, it's not easy to fill the void they left as they were the backbone of our batting," said Ahmed.
"Their contributions were immense but now we have to move on."
Younis is not only Pakistan's highest Test runs scorer, with 10,099, but the slips fielding specialist also holds the national record of 139 catches in 118 Tests.
Misbah's calm influence as a batsman, as well as skipper, will also be tough to replace.
Fast-rising batsman Babar Azam at four and Haris Sohail, who is yet to play a Test, will attempt to fill the void, while Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq will also be expected to play a leading role.
Ali was in doubt for the first Test after suffering a knee injury but he has since responded well to treatment, while Yasir Shah will lead the spin attack in a squad with five fast bowlers.
Shah, who took 24 wickets in Pakistan's 2-1 series win in Sri Lanka two years ago, will be assisted by uncapped spinners Mohammad Asghar and Bilal Asif.
Sri Lanka, who lost 3-0 at home to India last month, will be looking to right the ship after a torrid run of results which has had the media and fans on their back.
But they will be without their key all-rounder and former captain Angelo Mathews, who has been ruled out of the first Test with a calf strain.
Skipper Dinesh Chandimal believes his team will have to be at their best to beat Pakistan, despite the lack of their two long serving players.
"Pakistan will definitely miss Misbah and Younis but we will not underestimate the youngsters they have and (we) have to be at our best to beat them," he said.
Sri Lanka will be buoyed by the return of their pace spearheads Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal, who suffered injuries last month.
But their main hope of winning the two-match series looks likely to hinge on veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who has 90 wickets in 19 Tests against Pakistan. AFP
Squads (from):
Pakistan: Sarfraz Ahmed (capt), Azhar Ali, Shan Masood, Sami Aslam, Babar Azam, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Usman Salahuddin, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Asghar, Bilal Asif, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Abbas, Wahab Riaz

No regrets over Trump 'bum' jibe - LeBron
Los Angeles: LeBron James said Monday he did not regret branding President Donald Trump a "bum", accusing the US leader of dividing the nation in his feud with the sports world.
NBA star James had taken aim at Trump on Twitter on Saturday after the president withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors and star player Stephen Curry.
"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!" James wrote.
Asked if he regretted his choice of words on Monday, the Cleveland Cavaliers star gave a blunt response: "No."
In a press conference at the Cavaliers' pre-season media day, James repeatedly referred to Trump as "that guy", saying he had failed to bring the country together.
"First of all, I salute the NFL, the coaches, the players, the owners, the fans. Everyone had any association with the NFL was unbelievable," James told reporters at NBA Media Day. "There was no divide. Even from that guy that continues to try to divide us as people. AFP

From one book to another
Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man and writing an exact man, said English philosopher Sir Francis Bacon and no truer words said than these. Reading nourishes the intellect and nurtures the imagination. Considering these facts about reading, October has been declared as a month of reading by the National Library and Documentation Services Board under an apt theme: Reading is the threshold of Knowledge.
A book fair is held every year in order to put more weight on reading. There are several other days also declared by the United Nations for education and scientific research. These days have been reserved to encourage and make awareness about reading among the mass. In this modern and sophisticated world, people cannot afford time for reading as the young generation are often distracted by the modern technological devices like the Internet, smartphones and instantaneous thought-sharing on social media. We rarely get to see people with a book on their hands or anyone with the habit of reading. Some people have commenced reading e-papers. All these modern devices cannot replace reading a book with its physical look. Reading on a computer screen comparatively has a less retention power than reading a manual book.
There are numerous benefits a reader can gain from reading. When someone reads, the very benefit is updating his knowledge and he will have exposure to multi-cultural view about the word community. The reading certainly paves the way to increase and extend our memory power. If we do not increase our memory power, we might lose our memory while our brain may become inactive. The reading keeps your brain active and thoughtful.
Reading, a worthy companion
The reading also expands ones word power. If someone is an avid reader, he will read various books on different fields that will enrich his vocabulary through which he will learn to use appropriate words in his daily communication. It also increases our power of understanding, empathy, the degree of tolerance to a greater extent and our self-esteem. It is a lifelong learning tool which satisfies our curiosity. It helps in achieving our goals and makes us complete. It makes us wiser, smarter and more powerful. Even the well-learned people used reading as a strategy to become experts in the respective fields. So reading is a worthy companion that will provide us with physical and mental relaxation.
The reading will also create a fresh opportunity to gain new knowledge and make us feel confident. Nobody can claim the sole right to knowledge. It is said that only the knowledgeable people can become the pillars of good governance and democracy. They are the foundation of the revolutionary knowledge society. Mahatma Gandhi said: Library is the storehouse of knowledge and is like a small window to the dark room. His verses encourage us to read more to gain knowledge.
In this fast-moving world, people cannot allocate time for reading or visiting the library. They also fail to realise that they can obtain real pleasure from reading and reading is the best way to release their stresses and relax their minds. The advancement of technology is also one of the vital contributory factors to make the reading habits extinct. A research carried out in the United States of America reveals that 50 percent of Americans do not read newspapers. So do Sri Lankans Of course, our situation is far more below this percentage.
Reading habits
The working class today start their day with the computer and finishing their days transaction with the computer. This is, of course, a monotonous machinery life which does not yield any pleasure or peace of mind for us. On the other hand, when we consider the students reading habits it is almost nil. We are not supposed to expect the intellectual and spiritual development from the students with the current educational curricula or the overall educational system in the country because the curriculum has been designed to memorize the subject matter for the sake of passing examinations.
As parents and teachers, we have a prominent duty to cultivate the reading habit in our childrens minds in order to build a healthy society or rather a healthy nation who will respect the countrys traditional values, virtues and norms.
A Tamil adage says: An immoral education is like a house without a roof and aimless life is like a ship without a rudder. Todays students are tomorrows leaders. Let us all determine ourselves to sow the seed of this useful habit of reading among our students from October which has been declared a month of reading to remind and encourage the reading habit across the island.
We are now living in the era of technology or information technology. Despite the technological development we just cannot ignore the precious reading habit. As far as reading is concerned, the books are given a prominent place in the realm of reading. Reading books shape our life and direct us along the right path. Thats why Plato said: Books give soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything. Thus we must always take an excess interest in reading because reading changes everything, for adopting this habit one should reserve time to absorb the verses of experts who have advised us according to their research findings. Those who do not have this habit get help from the experienced readers to recommend you some selective books for you to kick-start this habit.
Mini library at home
The best idea is to start a reading corner in the classroom or at home for you to extend your reading habits. The genius says it is better to establish a mini library at home so as to spread this rare habit among your immediate family members and friends. One should also take a resolution from this reading month of October that I am going to read a certain number of books this year.
While you read or make a visit to the libraries do not forget to bring a notebook and a pen with you to jot down important information, wise sayings, statistics and useful quotations that you come across in the libraries. Having noted down these important, useful, pieces of information, train yourself to look back at the verses at a regular interval in order to instill that information in your minds and use it in your daily practical life. Besides, always have a book list that is currently famous and dominated minds of readers all over the world and make frequent visits to bookshops book fair and old bookshops to those books.
Hence, let us all take a firm resolution to cultivate this rare reading habits in our nation especially in the minds of young people in order to foster and nurture the strong, healthy, intellectual and dynamic future Sri Lankans who will rule and lead the country towards prosperity and peace.

Party Leaders to meet BASL officials
Party Leaders will meet the officials of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) to discuss the process followed in passing the Provincial Council Election (Amendment) Bill recently, based on a statement made by them, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation in response to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene on a statement by the BASL that there had been a flaw in the process of passing the Provincial Council Election (Amendment) Bill. He said they had sought a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister responding to the query, assured that the BASL and the leaders of the political parties representing the Parliament would have a meeting with on the matter. He also said that he met the BASL officials on Sunday. "I asked them if there was an issue," the Premier said, adding that, "I promised them that party leaders would meet them shortly to discuss the matter."
The Prime Minister also said that the manner in which the passage of the bill was conducted was not decided only by the Government.
"It was decided by all the party leaders in Parliament. The procedures pertaining to enacting of Bills have to be decided by Parliament as per the Constitution," he added.
PM reminds of those who misused power
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that there had been persons who took the powers of the people into their hands.
He made this observation yesterday responding to Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa who said that the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill passed in Parliament recently was to allocate 25 percent seats for women members. He said the content was changed by introducing amendments.
"In the same manner, the government could bring a Bill titled Presidential Elections Act and bring about amendments changing the entire system," Weerawansa said. "It could bring an amendment such as only a person who has 40 years experience in Parliament could contest for the presidency." MP Weerawansa raised the point of order, while the Prime Minister was responding to MP Dinesh Gunawardena to the latter's query on the BASL's statement on the the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill which was passed in Parliament recently.
The Prime Minister said the matter was discussed last week. "The Bill was debated and passed with a two thirds majority," he said.
Country poised to industrial boost: Senasinghe
The country would be transformed into an industrial city and the government would set up a 400 acre industrial city in Kalutara by December, International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
He made this statement during the debate on the order under the Export Development Act, in Parliament yesterday. We intend to set up an industrial export zone of around 400 acres in Kalutara by December. This is a great asset to us. The industrial zone will manufacture electrical goods predominantly, he said.
He said they were looking into ways of using natural rubber in the tyre industry. Sri Lanka is in the second or third place with regard to industrial tyres. Due to the GSP concession, we will be able to increase garment production. We intend to bring in new technology and create new jobs and transform the country into an industrial hub, Minister Senasinghe said.
He said the government was in discussion with the UK. He said around Rs. 10 billion in investment is expected in the near future.
Most Policemen serve in war affected areas to get additional payments: Sagala
It was only compulsory for police officers to serve in the war affected areas for a minimum of three years, but most of them stayed back due to the additional payments they received and not because they were forced to, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in parliament yesterday.
He made this observation answering to a query by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under standing orders 23 (2).
But after the completion of three years, these officers could have requested for a transfer, and they were not forced to stay, he said.
In transfers and promotions of police officers, there should be a proper mechanism. The government admits that there are flaws in the process. The government is in the process of rectifying the flaws, said Minister Ratnayake adding that this is a matter to be discussed at length.
In the North and East, police officers are required to work for at least two years before requesting a transfer. In Colombo, it is three years.
However, we will reduce the period of Policemen serving in Colombo too to two years, he said.
Minister Ratnayake said applications were called from officers serving in one province for over 12 years. They are required to name preferred places of transfer even if they dont want to as it is required as per the circular, he said.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake said most police personnel in the North and East had to do so due to the need at the time of the war.
In response, Minister Ratnayake said the government was aware of the problems faced by these officers. Measures will be taken to address their grievances, he said.
Dissanayake raised concern over the issues faced by police officers being transferred a few years prior to their retirement having served in the East for long periods.
They have settled in these areas too and just a few years prior to their retirement, when they are transferred to distant districts, their lives are disrupted, he said.
Sri Lanka to cooperate with other countries on extradition law
Sri Lanka would work with the countries that have agreements to implement the extradition law, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
The minister made this statement in Parliament yesterday joining the debate on the order under the extradition law.
There are some criminals who commit a crime in one country and hide in another country. This has become a habit of criminals," he said.
Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa questioned the protection given to Rohingya refugees in Sri Lanka.
He said there are refugee centres in the Mirihana area close to the Police station. The danger is that these refugees have come out of the camps and are living in rented houses. Their children have been enrolled in schools. They live as Sri Lankans, he said.
Weerawansa said the government should focus their attention in this regard.
Minister Athukorale said if such details are available, the Defence Ministry should be notified for relevant action. With regard to the Rohingya refugees if Myanmar requests certain individuals are wanted in connection with a crime and wants them extradited, then we will consider it, she said.
Extradition Law aims to create peaceful world: Ruwan Wijewardena
The Extradition Law aims to create a peaceful country and peaceful world, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said during the debate on the order under extradition law in Parliament yesterday.
The extradition law can comprehensively enforce the law against those who have committed crimes in a particular country, and are evading the law in that country. "We could safeguard the rule of law more effectively through the extradition law," the State Minister said.
He said extradition treaties will help Sri Lanka and foreign countries exchange wanted criminals.
Sri Lanka has signed extradition agreements with several countries. Legal action can be initiated against any criminal of this country who has committed a crime, and is in hiding in those countries. Similarly, if any citizen of those countries who has committed a crime, and is evading arrest and hiding in this country, can also be brought before the law," the State Minister said.
Crimes can be curtailed through the mechanism through diplomatic means, he said. However, the State Minister said this will not have an effect on those seeking political asylum. He said it was important to increase the number of countries we have extradition agreements.
Wijewardena said Sri Lanka signed extradition treaties with several countries, including Ukraine. He said Sri Lanka will sign extradition treaties with European and Asian countries.
The State Defence Minister expressed these views after submitting the extradition treaties in Parliament yesterday, signed with Russia, Ukraine, China and Vietnam.
Dr. Jayampathy explains preconditions for extradition law application
There are two preconditions for the implementation of the extradition law, MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne said joining the debate on the extradition law in Parliament yesterday.
One is that the particular crime should be considered a criminal offence in both Sri Lanka and the country making the request. This is called dual criminality where a suspect can be extradited from one country to stand trial for breaking a second country's laws only if a similar law exists in the extraditing country. The second is that the requesting state should have judicial power over the matter on which they are seeking extradition. These two conditions are vital in implementing the extradition law, Wickramaratne said.
He said if a person to be extradited is facing the risk of political vengeance or discrimination, then under such circumstances, the person will not be extradited.
There are such safeguards in the extradition law. An example of such an extradition clause is section 7 of the Torture Act of 1994 which was passed during the Peoples Alliance government when Prof. G.L. Peiris was the Justice Minister.
The Enforced Disappearance Bill does not alter Sri Lankas extradition law; it reinforces what other laws such as the Torture Act. He said as exemplary members of the international community, we are bound to take such measures. Wickramaratne said if a person who is to be extradited can prove his innocence in a Sri Lankan Court, he cannot be extradited.
Kiriella promises to rectify printing mistakes in PC Amendment Bill
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella assured that the printing mistakes in the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill passed in Parliament recently, could be rectified.
He said the Party Leaders will look into as to how the printing mistakes could be rectified.
He made this observation when Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that there was a discrepancy in the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill passed in Parliament recently.
"The amendment which was approved in Parliament was that parties which poll less than 20 percent are exempted from the regulation of nominating of women to any Provincial Council when they are allocated three seats," MP Dissanayake said. "But what is printed in the final draft is that the exemption is imposed on parties if they are allocated three seats," he said.
"We assure that the printing mistakes will be corrected," Minister Kiriella said. "The Party Leaders will look into how the printing mistake could be rectified."
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha responding to MP Dissanayake, accepted that there had been a printing mistake. He said the mistake had been made during the printing of the final draft which contains all the amendments passed in the House. He assured that it would be corrected.
Govt will decide the fate of 20 A: Kiriella
The government would decide as to what it does with the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill on a future date, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by the Joint Opposition (JO) as to why the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill remained in the Order Book of Parliament.
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the government informed the House that it would withdraw the Bill. Minister Kiriella said let it remain in the Order Paper.
"We will decide what to do with it and act accordingly. You are not here to decide what the government should do, Minister Kiriella said.

Plans underway to supply new connections to areas lacking water: WSDB Engineer
Residents of Kataragama, Tissa, Lunungamvehera, Hungama, Beliatta and Ranna are highly inconvenienced as new water connections are not available to them.
The residents of these areas attribute this situation to low quality filters, inefficient water treatment plants and old water towers with a low capacity of water storage.
Residents of Kataragama told the media that several years back Austrian Engineers had installed a water filter called Dyna which was said to be purifying 5,000 litres of water per hour. But the Kataragama Water Board sources say that it could only purify only about 2,000 litres per hour, resulting in a shortage of water even during rainy days. When inquired by the media, Hambantota Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) area Engineer J.P.B.Jayasuriya said that new water connections were not provided as there was a shortage in the capacity of water.
Out of the applications for new water connections, only 50% could be provided in Ranna area from the waiting list.
Jayasuriya said that plans were underway to supply new connections.

Players face sending-off, umpires to get bat gauge
NEW DELHI, Tuesday - Players could be sent off for the first time in cricket, starting with Test matches in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates this week, as new regulations come into force.
Changes governing umpire referrals and bat sizes will also come into force Thursday when South Africa host Bangladesh and Sri Lanka play Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, said the sport's governing body the International Cricket Council.
The Decision Review System (DRS) -- in which a TV umpire reviews decisions made by umpires on the field -- will be allowed in Twenty20 internationals after its success in Test and one-day matches.
Under the new rules, a player can now be sent off for the rest of the match for serious misconduct.
This could include threatening to assault an umpire, making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire, assaulting a player or any other person and any other act of violence.
To maintain the balance between bat and ball, there are new restrictions on the size of bat edges and its thickness.
The permitted length and width of bats remains unchanged but the edges cannot be more than 40mm thick and the overall depth is limited to 67mm.
Umpires will use a new gauge to check legality.
The ICC said all changes will be applicable across all (three) formats.
Most of the changes to the ICC playing conditions are being made as a result of changes to the laws of cricket that have been announced by the MCC, ICC general manager Geoff Allardyce said in a statement.
We have just completed a workshop with the umpires to ensure they understand all of the changes and we are now ready to introduce the new playing conditions to international matches.
If a team refers an umpire's decision to the TV umpire and the on-field decision remains unchanged because the DRS shows umpire's call, the team will not lose that review. But teams will now have only two unsuccessful reviews for the entire innings of a Test. Previously the unsuccessful reviews were replenished after the first 80 overs.

Police move Myanmar refugees after mob violence
Police moved a group of Myanmar refugees from their temporary safe house after a mob led by a handful of Buddhist monks attacked the multi-storied compound at Mount Lavinia yesterday.
The 31 refugees, including 16 small children, were initially placed under police protection after a small group of people gathered outside their building demanding that they be expelled from the country.
A lawyer for the refugees said they had been allowed to remain under UN protection pending repatriation to a third country,
but an organisation calling itself the Sinhale Jathika Balamuluwa insisted on their immediate eviction. Rohingya refugee women were seen carrying small children and leaving the building and boarding a small police truck.
Shortly after the police brought them back to their temporary home, the monks and their supporters blocked the Galle Road and pelted stones, smashed windows and furniture inside the building.
There were no immediate reports of injury to the refugees who huddled in upstair rooms. A monk was seen shouting at his supporters to storm into the building and destroy it. His call was broadcast live on facebook by the Sinhale group on its official facebook page. The 31 Rohingya were rescued by Sri Lankas navy in April and brought to safety and cared for by the security forces till they were handed over to the civilian authorities. The refugees were said to have left their camp in India and were thought to be victims of people smugglers.

Montreal: Prince Harry and his girlfriend Meghan Markle made their first official public appearance together Monday, arriving hand in hand for a wheelchair tennis match at Toronto's Invictus Games.
Wearing a black "Invictus Games" polo shirt and jeans, the British royal and American actress Markle -- also dressed down in jeans and a white shirt -- enjoyed the sun together as they watched the action on court.
Since the 36-year-old "Suits" actress told Vanity Fair the couple are "in love," fans and the press have been eagerly awaiting an official appearance -- with onlookers scrabbling to take pictures as they were escorted into Monday's event.
"We're two people who are really happy and in love," Markle told the magazine in an interview published early this month. The couple both attended the opening ceremony of the third Invictus Games -- created by Prince Harry for disabled or wounded soldiers and veterans -- on Saturday.
Markle was pictured sitting a few rows behind the royal's seat next to US First Lady Melania Trump.
According to his schedule, Queen Elizabeth II's grandson will stay at Markle's Toronto home for all eight days of the Games. AFP

Priority for HR development to spur SLs tourism - PM
Priority has now been given for the development of human resources in order to meet the needs of the growing tourism sector, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was speaking at the second edition of the Cinnamon Future of Tourism Summit held yesterday at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo.
The Prime Minister said that the tourism industry has changed a lot throughout the world and Asia is going to drive strong growth in global tourism.
Asian economic development, which has taken place after 1970, as well as new information technology has resulted in tourism growth in the region. By about 2030, the Asia Pacific region will have 500 million tourists and 75 percent from the region, he said.
The Premier further said that per capita income is increasing in all Asian countries. People who engage in the tourism industry have to face various challenges. Traditional tourism companies have been disrupted and this is one of challenges. There are many online operators today. A large number of boutique hotels and small accommodation facilities too have come up. Asia is going to be a centre of tourism, Premier Wickremesinghe said. Sri lankas strategic location is very helpful to boost the countrys tourism industry.
We are in the middle of the Indian Ocean, next door to India and close to the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh and South East Asia. Just six hours away from China, Japan and East Asia. People would like to travel more to East Africa for the beaches and islands.
We have one advantage and what matters most is connectivity. We have to develop our airports, ports and internal transport system to work on that connectivity.
In 2015, we had taken so much of debt that our revenue was insufficient for debt servicing. Today, despite the drought and the floods, we are able to get sufficient revenue to service our debts. Economic restructuring and the stabilization of the macroeconomy have given us strength to go ahead. We know we can utilize the infrastructure that we need.
Infrastructure without economic development such as roads going nowhere, harbours without ships, airport without planes, is a dead loss, the Prime Minister said.
The economy is sufficiently stable today. We are able to build houses and give pay increases. Public and private sectors have created 400,000 income opportunities. We are driving economic growth.
This means we are also in a position to repay our debts taken for infrastructure.

Reckless garbage dumping at public places in the Kalmunai area has caused great inconvenience to the people. Residents in the area said they faced severe health hazard as a result.
The surrounding of Km/Km/Mahmood Ladies College, Kalmunai is increasingly polluted with garbage dumps. Over 3,000 students attend the school and they face danger of getting infected with diseases since the area is highly congested with mosquitoes, rats and other insects that thrive in garbage dumps.
More often, flies, rats and mosquitoes can be seen in classrooms and schoolchildren and teachers cannot concentrate on their subjects as a result.
Before long, another dengue outbreak will hit the region if the authorities do not take steps to clear the garbage dumps, residents said.
Many stray dogs are also seen in the area searching foods in the garbage dumps, they said.

Samurdhi beneficiaries to be employed to guard unprotected railway crossings

The government has proposed to employ members of Samurdhi beneficiary families to guard unprotected railway crossings.
The proposal approved by Cabinet this week is to be a short term measure until the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation completes the project of installing signal lights and alarms at all unprotected crossings. 
At present there are 687 unprotected crossings which have been entrusted to the police to provide security.
Each gate has in turn employed three gate keepers with an additional allowance of Rs 7500 being paid for them for the work. 
But more often than not, it was found that the gate keepers had abandoned their posts and vacated their positions citing the allowances to be too low of an incentive.
Thus it was proposed that chosen Samurdhi families assign a member of the family to protect the crossing throughout the day and a payment of Rs 22,500 per month would be paid to them.
The above proposal was submitted to the Cabinet by Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva.

Sangakkara dismissed for 14 in final match for Surrey
LONDON: Kumar Sangakkara made 14 in the first innings of his final first-class game as Surrey declared on 201-8 on day one against Lancashire at Old Trafford.
The Sri Lankan, 39, who will retire at the end of the season and has hit nine centuries in 14 innings this term, was removed by Saqib Mahmood (4-50).
Sam Curran hit an unbeaten 56 before Surrey declared having just claimed their first batting point.
The hosts closed on 17-0 after seeing out the final nine overs of the day.
Second-placed Surrey began the day three points ahead of Lancashire in third place and the winners of the match will finish as runners-up to champions Essex.
Middlesex spinner Ravi Patel returned figures of 7-81 before Somerset fought back late on day one at Taunton.
Somerset, who need to win to stand a chance of staying in Division One, started well through Ed Byrom (56) and Marcus Trescothick (37).
But on a spinning pitch, Patel triggered a collapse as the hosts took just one batting point from their 236.
Jack Leach then took 2-3 as Middlesex reached stumps on 18-3, needing a further 232 runs to guarantee safety.
The away side began the day on 143 points, needing nine points to avoid the drop - a target based on Somerset (127) gaining the maximum 24 points for a win. But after the hosts took one batting point their target was reduced to five points.
Having taken all three bonus bowling points, Middlesex need to reach 250 runs in their first innings to gain two batting bonus points and take their overall total to 148 - one point more than the 147 Somerset can potentially earn from a 20-point win.
Somerset went into this relegation decider in the most perilous position following their defeat by Surrey last week and prepared a green pitch in order to take the required 20 wickets to beat fifth-placed Middlesex.
But despite winning the toss and electing to bat, their efforts were undermined by Patel, who bowled well to exploit the conditions and take career-best figures, finding prodigious turn to trap Trescothick lbw and begin the collapse from 206-4 to 236 all out.
Joe Denly dominated the Kent innings with 152 out of his team's 302 all out on day one against Glamorgan, with the visitors battling to 18-1 in the evening gloom.
Denly's vital knock, off 204 balls with 23 fours and two sixes, held his side together after they slumped to 39-4.
Lukas Carey struck twice early on, but Denly mixed caution and blazing aggression through the rest of the innings as he dragged the home team up to a respectable total, also passing 10,000 first-class runs in his career.
Joe Clarke hit an unbeaten 46 to help promotion-chasing Worcestershire recover from a bad start on a weather-hit first day against Durham.
After overnight rain ruled out a start until after lunch at New Road, Durham's pace attack of Chris Rushworth, Graham Onions and Mark Wood caused problems.
But, from 13-2, Clarke and opener Brett D'Oliveira (22) shared a nerve-settling half-century stand of 56. The hosts closed on 90-3, Clarke having so far put on 21 with George Rhodes.
Division two leaders Worcestershire, who elected to bat when play finally got under way, still need six points from this game to be sure of going up. If they beat Durham, it will almost certainly be enough to pip second-placed Notts to the title.
Third-placed Northants' game was completely washed out for the day at Leicester.
Onions is playing his final match for Durham, having announced that he will leave at the end of the season after being unable to agree a new contract. - AFP

Second heart transplant surgery
The group of doctors who successfully performed the first heart transplant surgery at the Kandy General Hospital were to carry out the second heart transplant surgery at the hospital last night to save the life of Sachini Sewwandi.
A heart was to be harvested from a youth who was declared brain dead following an accident,with the consent of his relatives.
This transplant planned at the Kandy General Hospital was abandoned at the last minute on September 19 due to a tug-o-war between consultants not to remove the beneficiarys heart. This situation has arisen even after the heart was harvested from the donor and fixed to a machine pending the transplant. However, doctors have agreed to perform the transplant again after a discussion with Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.

The artistic impression of any creation is found through the eye of the beholder and he or she interprets it according to his/her own perceptions and experiences in life. The difficulty in creating such pieces, however, is only known to the artist who painstakingly spends hours perfecting her art. It is one such artist that we met in Galgamuwa.
In the village of Kallanchiya in Galgamuwa lives Adhikari Mudiyanselage Lakmini Adhikari. An Arts graduate from the University of Kelaniya, she works as a development officer at the Galgamuwa Base Hospital. Her passion, however, is to pursue her art and every free time she finds, she immerses herself in it. Her talent lies in bringing to life various birds through grains of paddy.
Self-taught skills
Adhikari Mudiyanselage Lakmini Adhikari
Adhikaris life hasnt been easy and despite having to struggle to make ends meet, she taught herself the skills needed from an early age. She uses paddy seeds to create intricate designs of birds.
I have been pasting various items together since I was a child. From the time I was studying in Grade 6 or 7, I used to use various varieties of seed to make such creations. It was after that I decided to create such drawings using seed paddy, said Adhikari.
In the beginning, she chose her favourite birds to turn into art. Today, she has turned 15 varieties of birds into picture with the use of seed paddy.
My biggest issue is finding the time to create these pieces. But every bit of time I get, I devote it to my art. Whether I find some free time at work or if I am at home, I start pasting seed onto paper, she said.
Many people think that pasting seed into a certain shape is not a big deal and that anyone could do it, but every picture takes a lot of patience to make and is very time-consuming. Each seed has to be pasted according to its own pattern. If you put one wrong seed with the wrong pattern in a place, you can ruin the whole picture. So we must choose every seed carefully, so that the pattern of the bird is exact; from its beak to its claw, Adhikari added.
A painstaking process
The pasting of seeds together is thus an excruciating task and she further explained the process it took to get all the seeds down in the right prior to pasting it onto cloth.
Firstly, I outline the picture I want on a piece of cloth. It is thereafter that I start to paste seeds on to it. There is a particular kind of glue I use for this purpose. The seeds naturally sourced from paddy which grows in the area. Certain types of seed, however, are hard to find as they have a unique colour attached to them. But when you use these different seeds, you can add great colour to the painting.
The other problem is that not all seeds can be pasted thus. I mostly use seeds of samba, nadu, suwadel, heenati for in my art. My biggest problem now however is that I am finding it very difficult to find certain types of seeds. But many people have now come forward to help me find these seeds.
When I start to paste birds, I use each variety of seed to get the exact features of the bird. The features and colours of the bird differ at its beak, head and neck. The feathers especially need an intricate design. All this have to be done with a calm mind.
Not all, however, have the mindset or talent to achieve such intricate designs. And it not easy to develop the discipline and patience needed to perfect them.
I have given most of my creations to my friends and they all now hang in various government offices. I have not sold any of them. Some have offered Rs. 50-60,000 for these paintings, but I dont want to sell my creations.
I cannot put a price tag on the happiness I gain through this work. I hope to have all my creations displayed in an exhibition soon. I am working towards that, she said.

Sharp-witted command : Richmond College
Head Prefect of Richmond Ishan Eriyagolla has an ability to win over people. Maybe it is because of his simple style of leadership or his thoroughness in the art of administration. Perfect Prefects features Eriyagolla, who shows potential due to his sensibility, discipline and practicality.
Being a Head Prefect at Richmond is a privilege and an honour. But with such power comes great responsibility. There is no specific time slot when it comes to his duties. Whenever he is called upon to perform his duties he must be available. With so many activities to attend to, he needs to manage his time and prioritise. In a leading school like Richmond, when it comes to management and shouldering your responsibilities you need to keep all your wits about you! You need to be very quick on the uptake, said Eriyagolla.
Good stead
The administration is the key word here. The administrative skills a Head Prefect learns at school level will hold him in good stead when he leaves the portals of Richmond.
A Head Prefect becomes accustomed to the structure. He becomes accustomed to hierarchy. He knows what it means to be in command. He can adjust to any position assigned to him. This is also where his intelligence comes into play. He needs to be sharp-witted. He needs to recognize opportunities that come to him. There is no time to be scared when things get rough! The opportunity is there for the taking! said Eriyagolla
The more steel the country produces the more efficient will be the administration of the country. If you start at the bottom then no one can hoodwink you. The Head Prefect is familiar with the trend of thought in any office at each level, having acquired insight at school. Because he knows how to get the results he wants.
As mentioned before, he possesses thoroughness when it comes to administration. This is a facet of life that he has refined over the years.
Good finesse
I have a group of dedicated prefects under me. I have been in their position. Because of this, I know their ways. So I feel that a good Head Prefect needs finesse. That is the most important quality I think anyone should have. Not only a Head Prefect. Also, he should have very good organizational skills, added Eriyagolla
When facing a problem you need to be a collected and poised. Being poised is the main thing. Because you cannot prevent problems coming to you. You may be a Head Prefect or anyone in society but you cannot prevent difficulties coming to you. You can only work on your response.
You need to understand the situation and then you need to look at it from all angles. You also need to reason Why has something like this happened You need to investigate. You need to comprehend the situation. Then you need to make the best possible decision considering all views. Then you will be fair to all parties involved. A Head Prefect is an arbitrator, said Eriyagolla
Never doubt yourself. Believe in the power of your judgment. A person who underestimates himself or herself is just wasting time. You need to believe in yourself. Self-doubt is the greatest hindrance. With doubt comes insecurity.
Remembered in history
A leader I feel should be charismatic, he needs to be a man of the people. This is not limited to politics. Even at the office level, he needs to be respected. And in this respect, history will be the final judge. Even I, one day want to be a leader who will be remembered through history. You need to be self-possessed because people can sense these things about you. If you are confident about yourself, it does not matter what language you speak, people will be confident around you, explained Eriyagolla.
Eriyagolla feels that we have been gifted with religion not to argue and quarrel amongst ourselves. We have been given religion not to divide ourselves and fight each other. We have been gifted by religion so we can learn from each other, discover more about the life that we live and realize what we have in common with each other. Discover more about the life that we live and unite.
Not everyone can become a leader. He needs to have some inborn capabilities. Before becoming a leader he needs to have trained under a leader. He needs to be able to interact with all people in all stations of society, but never forget who he is and what values he stands up for. He needs to understand the frailties in society. Not everyone can come up with correct solutions. That is something I need to stress on. If he cannot do that, then there is a problem, pointed out Eriyagolla
Pressure is a constant issue we have to deal with. Pressure can take its toll on a person. It is not easy to deal with. I think we need to be organized here. Then step by step we execute each and every part of the plan.
Again do not doubt yourself. You need to be 100 percent. 100 percent secure. Then you can really lead, said Eriyagolla.
He is a scholarship student and his parents have been a huge source of strength to him.
They have also guided me in a big way. So I want to enter university and concentrate on media. I have played Cricket and have learned teamwork. You learn to work as a team. This has helped me develop my leadership skills. You learn to be receptive to the opinions of others. It is a journey. You learn to back your teammates. In Swimming, I learned coordination and the importance of physical health. As a leader, it is so important that you encourage and inspire those under you. Otherwise, they may get discouraged, summed up Eriyagolla.

SLFP for introduction of new electoral system: Alagiyawanna
Finance and Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said that the SLFPs stance is to introduce an electoral system without a Preferential votes system not only for the Local Government election but also for the Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections.
He said so while addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
The SLFP is stands for the introduction of such an electoral system since it is a long felt need of the country and people, he said.
However,certain persons are trying to mislead the country by levelling baseless allegations about this new electoral system implemented through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
The Minister said the Government plans to request the Chairman of the Elections Commission to hold the Local Government elections by next January.
All the necessary measures in this regard will be taken by the Government by October 9, Alagiyawanna said.
With the new electoral system, there will have 5,092 electorates with 8,443 members elected to the Local Government institutions. Asked whether the increase the number of members will be a waste of money, the minister said it will not result in a wate of funds considering the increase in population.
He added that the Government is engaging in introducing a most appropriate electoral system to the country with the implementation of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
He added that there may be amendment to the Constitution aiming to have a proper electoral system which symbolises peoples mandate.

The Survey Department, on a request by the Central Programme Management Unit of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs of which Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is Minister, has taken initiatives to establish a comprehensive database that indicates all major reserves in one web-based map which allows investors to identify suitable available lands for their investments.Unavailability of a comprehensive map that indicated land reserves such as forest reserves, wildlife reserves, riverine reserves, coastal reserves etc. is one of the most unfavorable factors that affect the investor attraction of the country.
Hence, it is considered as a major responsibility of the government to provide a conducive environment that attracts more investors to establish in Sri Lanka while minimizing the hurdles that prevent investors to invest in Sri Lanka.
The map database includes the information provided by regulators of state-owned lands such as the Department of Wildlife, Department of Forest Department and Coast Conservation Department etc.
The web address www.survey.gov.lk/nsdi/lis/index_cad.php allows users to search locations visually based on the map, search locations by uploading known GPS location and input the name of a location to find it on the map. By providing this information on state owned lands, investors could find details of suitable lands before deciding on the location for investment projects in order to prevent unnecessary delays.

Yingluck trial: Thai ex-PM sentenced to five years in jail

Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been found guilty of negligence and sentenced in absentia to five years in prison.
The supreme court found her guilty of mishandling a rice scheme which led to at least $8bn (6bn) in losses.
Ousted in 2014, weeks before a military coup, and later impeached, Yingluck denies all charges and fled before the verdict, reportedly to Dubai.
Public opinion is divided. She remains popular with rural and poor voters.
During her trial, Yingluck had argued she was not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme and insisted she was a victim of political persecution.
Part of Yingluck's election campaign, it was launched after she took office in 2011.
To alleviate rural poverty, the government paid rural farmers nearly twice the market rate.
The scheme hit Thailand's rice exports, leading to an estimated loss of at least $8bn.
Though popular with her rural voter base, the scheme was too expensive and open to corruption, her opponents said.
Yingluck is now thought to be in Dubai where her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, lives in self-imposed exile avoiding a 2008 sentence for corruption.
Yingluck entered politics only after his sentence and was seen by critics as a proxy for her ousted brother.
Both siblings remain popular among Thailand's rural poor, but are opposed by an urban and middle-class elite.
She is unlikely to serve any of her sentence because she is out of the country.
The trail ran over two years, with a ruling initially scheduled for late August. When Yingluck surprisingly failed to show up in court, the verdict was postponed and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
