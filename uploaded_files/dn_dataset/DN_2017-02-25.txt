54th Battle of the Brothers: Charana and Navod rescue Thurstan
A fine sixth wicket stand of 98 runs between Charana Nanayakkara (58) and Navod Samarakoon (34) helped Thurstan College to recover and make a reasonable total of 228 runs in their first innings on the first day of the 54th Battle of the Brothers which began at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Thurstan who were put into bat by Isipathana could not cope with the pace attack of Niranjan Wanniarachchi and Lisura Vineth and were reeling at 56 for 5 wickets before Nanayakkara joined by Samarakoon and the pair with some sensible batting repaired the damage. Nanayakkara had nine hits to the ropes while Samarakoon had four boundaries.
Earlier skipper Kasun Abeyratne made a well compiled 43 with 6 fours. Wanniarachchi was the pick of the Isipathana bowlers with three wickets for 66 while spinner Lahiru Dilshan took three wickets for 53.
Isipathana going into bat after tea were given a good start by Kalana Perera and Harsha Ratnayake before the latter was run out for 16.
Two runs later Perera departed being caught by Kasun Abeyratne off the bowling of Nanayakkara for 20. At the close the lads from Havelock Town were 78 for 3 with Pathum Nissanka unbeaten on 17 and skipper Sanjula Abeywickrama not out on 1. Nissanka was given a life when Nimesh Lakshan dropped him when he was 16.

Allegations against Panadura Pradeseeya Sabaha Sec.: Minister raises concerns
Vocational Training Minister and Sri Lanka Freedom Party Panadura Electorate Chief Organiser Mahinda Samarasinghe raised concerns over the allegations levelled against the Panadura Pradeseeya Sabha Secretary that she has not carried out her duties regarding the development projects in the Panadura Pradeseeya Sabha area properly.
The minister was addressing the Panadura Electorate Co-coordinating Committee meeting at the Panadura Divisional Secretariat Auditorium on February 20.
The Secretary was not present at the meeting and a council clerk was present on her behalf.
Panadura Urban Council Former Chairman and Panadura Electorate Co-coordinating Committee Joint President Nandena Gunatilleke said the Secretary had issued letters to the traders at the Panadura public market building to vacate their stalls because it was decided to construct a new two-storey building at the location. The traders would not leave the building as they were not provided with alternative facilities by the Council, he said. He said hawkers have now invaded the pavements. The pedestrians have to use the roads instead of the pavements, he said.
The Secretary is not co-operating with the police to remove hawkers and prevent illegal sea sand mining under the pretext of mining sand from the Panadura river, he said. Coastal land had been forcibly taken over by hotel owners for their business purposes.
They have prepared forged deeds for these lands.
The coastal Conservation Department is silent in this regard, he added.
Panadura Urban Council Former Councillor Dulshan Fernando informed the Minister Samarasinghe that one and half acres of land in the Panadura Town opposite the private bus stand was acquired by the Urban Development Authority 30 years ago but it was not developed. Instead the UDA had produced false reports to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, he said.
None of the government departments in Panadura were present at the meeting.
They were represented by subject clerks.

Army support sought to fill vacuum created by striking Wildlife Guards
The support of the Army will be sought to carry out the work of Wildlife Guards who have commenced a trade union action, Wildlife Conservation Department Director General W.S.K. Pathirathne said.
He said the wildlife guards have withdrawn from work over a salary issue. He said Civil Security personnel are assisting the Department to carry out the work uninterruptedly, adding that the service of Army personnel would also be sought if the need arises.
He said the request of the field officers to place them in the salary category of MN III was declined by the National Salaries and Cadres Commission this week. He said the Department would have to re-negotiate it with the authorities.
Meanwhile, a Wildlife Department Trade Unionist told the Daily News that their salary grievances have not been addressed for the six years. This is a token strike and we will end it by Monday morning. Thereafter, we will conduct fresh talks with the authorities. Our request to change our grade from MN I to MN III was fair given that we work round the clock.
Ours is largely voluntary work as we love wildlife and are committed to protectin it, he explained.
The Department authorities claim the work is going on smoothly.
Yes, the ticketing at the counters of National Parks is going on, but the authorities must realize that tourism and wildlife conservation are two different things. Wildlife raids have stopped and animals are at stake. We are very sad about the situayion, he commented.
He said about 650 wildlife officers are involved in the trade union action.

In awe of Lord Shiva
Maha Sivaratri, the great night consecrated to Lord Siva is an important fast which falls on amavasai, the night of the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight in Maasi (mid February  mid March) Through the fast, vigilance, prayer and meditation man strives to free himself from the shackles of the world.
In Hindu tradition fasting means Upavasa, mentally sitting near the Lord and gaining bliss. The Sivaratri fast is austere and rigorous of all the fasts and observances of the Hindus. The devotee fasts the whole day and engages himself in worship of God.
The vigil at night is all important in this fast; the night is stressed because it signifies the darkness of the world of senses and through fast and prayer the devotee passes from darkness to light; from night to day. Such fasting becomes a self-imposed form of discipline where the senses are controlled and desires are greatly sublimated.
It was on this night that Siva revealed Himself as the lingam in a column of light in Tiruvanaamalai to dispel all doubts as to who is the Almighty God. Tradition has it that a dispute arose between the Creator, and the Preserver, of the universe as to who is the greater of the two - was it the one who created or the one who preserved.
Divine spirit
This argument was solved by the Almighty Siva, who manifested Himself as a huge column of Light rising from a bottomless base to limitless heights of this universe saying, Seek the beginning and the summit; who ever could find the one end would be the greater of the two.
One took the form of a swan and flew upwards to seek the summit, while the other took the form of a boar and burrowed downwards to seek the beginning. They were both seeking with pride and arrogance that great light which has neither a beginning nor an end and they failed. He appeared through this effulgence as the Sivalingam and granted them illumination.
This merely shows that the pride of learning and possessions, creating and preserving are inimical to the realisation of the absolute.
Saint Appar refers to this incident where Siva said, I am here, appeared in the form of the lingam between the two as,  ....Ingutren andru lingaththe thondrinaan.
And continues with deep devotion saying, I sought Him and I found Him in my very being.
The lingam from which Siva revealed Himself on Maha Sivaratri, is the Sivalingam - the perfect symbol of the formless all pervading divine spirit which is discernible in all the operations of the phenomenal universe. The lingam is a sign, an image of the rhythmic creation and destruction of the universe which expresses itself in forms and periodically returns to its primal preformal unity before being reborn, describes Eliade.
The concept of the lingam as known to us, came down from the Indus Valley culture and during the Vedic age this concept was beautifully incorporated as the symbolic expression of transcendentalism, the infinite being rendered in the formless symbol.
To the Vedic rishi, the formless is the lingam and tradition has it that they used the smooth egg shaped stones untouched by human craftsmen as the symbol of worship and placed them under trees supported by the form of a serpent.
God in reality is formless, but yet all forms are His forms. The Lingotbhava form is symbolic of both His formlessness and form, explaining the transcendental essence of God. It is symbolic of form, because it has the oval shape, and it is formless because it has neither head no limbs.
The very conception of a lingam denotes something which has neither a beginning nor an end.
The all-pervading formless Siva as seen in the lingam is the ever pure undying Soul, residing in the chamber of the heart.
He is the Indweller, the Atmalingam deep within each one. He is omnipresent and all-pervasive. By the very nature of these qualities, He cannot have any form. Hence He is formless, but takes a form in order to bless us mortals. The lingam is the symbol of worship on Sivaraatri and all the observances are connected to it.
The Sivaratri puja
The Maha Sivaratri pujas consist of abhishekams or anointing, archanais or offerings and naamasmaranam singing the name of the Lord, performed in the four watches or yaamas of the night from dusk to dawn.
Abhishekam consists of anointing the deity with materials such as milk, curd, ghee for the first yaama, five varieties of fruits, the panchaamirtam for the second yaama, honey for the third yaama and perfumed water for the last yaama. Milk, honey, fruit, curd and ghee are symbolic of the five internal faculties which sustain the Jiva and through the five faculties observe internal abhishekam. Water, milk, curd, ghee, sandal-paste, honey, fruits, perfumed water used for abhishekam of the lingam or any deity, have been tested and found to produce a rich negative ion concentration after abhishekam. Repeated abhishekams create an electrical charge in the lingam or deity and this energy plus the negative ions are inhaled by the devotees during arati with camphor when the air within the sanctum sanctorum is dispelled into the hall.
Abhishekams are followed by archanai, the floral offerings of lotus, thulasi, vilva and nandiyavatta at each yaama. Of these the sacred vilva is the most important and most effective of the offerings on Maha Sivaratri. The words, eka vilvam sivaarpanam, tell us that even a single vilva leaf is sufficient for this Siva puja and if offered with a full heart and a devoted mind is sufficient to ward off trijanma paapam, the sins of three births.
Of the abhishekams and pujas, the Lingotbhava abhishekam and puja are the most important aspect of the Sivaratri puja. The Lingotbhava murti which is installed in the niche in the outer wall of the sanctum sanctorum in a Sivan Temple, is the object of veneration at the midnight yaama.
The Lingotbhava murti is depicted as emerging out of the lingam with the top half of the head and the bottom half of the legs cut off.
The axe and the deer are seen carved while a swan in flight at the top of the lingam and a boar burrowing the earth at the bottom, are also depicted. This depicts the story where Brahma and Vishnu took the forms of swan and boar, to look for the summit and the base of the column of Light.
The doctrine of the Holy Trinity in the Lingotbhava murti is the rare combination of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, the conception of the creator, preserver and destroyer all in one; this clearly shows the tatvam that God is one, Full and All-pervading. Ekam sat vipra bahuda vadanti, Truth is one but forms are many, is the Upanishadic saying.
As one watches these ceremonies, the Lingotbhava murti appears to grow upward and downward - a strange experience which could be attributed to the skill of the artist who sculptured this effect through subtle mouldings.
The Lingotbhava puja is followed by the last yaama puja.
At this last yaama, the slender streak of the first moon in its last phase disappears from darkness by joining the resplendent rising Sun.
This is symbolic of the illumination, the Moksha one achieves - where the Jivaatman the moon, merges with the Paramaatman the Sun, on this Amaavaasai thithi.
Thus when one analyses the arduous fast, one could say that the observance of Sivaratri is a fore-runner of ones intense and constant saadhana for God realisation. Mans whole life on this earth could be likened to the raatri. By observing vigil during this raatri of the worldly life in which one tends to get enmeshed, man is made to realise the dangers of getting unduly involved and thereby forgets the real purpose of his life in this world.
Instead of looking for happiness in external objects, these fasts help to look inward. Repeating Gods name, and the Panchaakshara mantram, performing abhishekams and archanais with the vision of His beautiful form in the mind, is indeed a mighty purifying effect on any devotee. May all the aspiring souls in the world be divinely inspired that they may understand the spiritual lesson and the significance of this grand Sivaraatri fast thereby enabling them to reach their ultimate goal!

Bradford Doctor takes pioneering kidney stone treatment in Sri Lanka
A Bradford consultant has been using his expertise to introduce a new medical procedure in Sri Lanka's hospitals.
Dr. Harry Bardgett, a consultant radiologist at Bradford Royal Infirmary, learned of the plight of people suffering from kidney problems on the island during a chance meeting with consultant urologist, Graham Watson, who runs his own charity.
The Medi Tech Trust is dedicated to the promotion of urological surgery and donation of medical equipment and surgical goods in the UK and the developing world.
Last June, it donated new equipment to the BRI called an 'Ultra Mini PCNL' (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) - which brings huge benefits as doctors could use much smaller equipment than what was traditionally used to carry out kidney stone surgery in the past.
This innovative technique enables his fellow doctors to glean better pictures of the kidneys, allowing them to shatter and extract stones using an endoscope, instead of the need to revert to open surgery with all its risks to the patient.
PCNL is a minimally-invasive procedure to remove stones from the kidney by inserting a small incision through the skin. It is used to remove stones of more than 2cm in size which are present near the pelvic region. Impressed by what he saw, Watson asked Dr. Bardgett to accompany him to show this new technique to doctors in Sri Lanka, which aids PCNL which is less damaging to patients and helps them recover more quickly, compared with more conventional open surgery which was used in the country.
Dr. Bardgett said: "PCNL ultrasound has huge benefits for surgeons as it helps identify which part of the kidney to puncture into. Doctors can then see the renal stones and glean important information on the structures around the kidney.
"It also makes the procedure easier to perform as with PCNL the patient lies on their back, rather than their front.
"Other vital PCNL benefits for patients include reduced blood loss, less damage to the kidney and a shorter hospital stay - for some, the stay can be as little as 24 hours, as opposed to around four to five days."

Centre must have power to dissolve PCs
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly has agreed that the Centre must have the power to dissolve the Provincial Councils or take over their powers, Constitutional Lawyer and UNP MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne said.
He was speaking at the Adjournment Debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
We have now proposed to include a Clause in the new Constitution to enable the Centre to dissolve or take over the powers of any Provincial Council if it acts against the unity, territorial integrity and independence of the country, Dr. Wickramaratne said.
He said this provision is not there in the existing Constitution. He pointed out even the TNA has reacted positively to the proposal. They said they have no problem with it as far as safeguards are taken to prevent the misuse of this provision, he said.
Dr.Wickramaratne pointed out the problem of arbitrary use of power by the President would not arise as any of his actions could be challenged before the Supreme Court as of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
The topic of devolution was discussed at length at the Steering Committee meeting last Tuesday. The MP said Chief Ministers of seven provinces in the southern polity have proposed in the light of their experience that power sharing must be genuine and that Governors powers must be pruned. They want the Governors public administrative powers to be given to an independent Commission appointed by the Centre. They want clear cut division of subjects between the Centre and Provincial Councils, he said.
Reportedly, there has been general consensus in the Steering Committee meeting that the concurrent list (the list of shared powers between the Central Government and Provinces), should be a short list. Joint Opposition members had also attended the meeting.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United dominating digitally in China
He is one of the greatest players in history and now Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo reigns supreme not only on the football pitch but in the digital world too. The 32-year-old Ronaldo has been named the most influential footballer online in China, beating rivals such as teammate Gareth Bale and England captain Wayne Rooney to the top spot.
With around 806 million monthly active users on social media and a government edict to make the country a worldwide force in football, China is increasingly regarded as an important economic market for European clubs.Shanghai-based consultancy Mailman's sixth annual Red Cardreport found Ronaldo's online engagement in China to be 10 times higher than any other footballer, while he is also among the top five most dominant world sports stars in the country.
The report analyzes the influence of 53 European clubs and their players in the country using eight different metrics, such as followers,engagement and digital presence.
The report also concluded that English Premier League side Manchester United has this year toppled Bayern Munich as the most influential team, while Germany's Bundesliga -- the only league to launch a live stream in China -- is deemed to have the best digital presence of all the Europeanleagues.
'Ronaldo has the X-Factor'
Despite being on Twitter since 2010 and accumulating 50 million followers during that period, Ronaldo only launched online in China last May.
The Portugal captain's popularity can be attributed to having played for two of the most popular European clubs -- Real and United --and his character resonates strongly with supporters.
Not forgetting the unmarried star is also much sought-after by female fans, according to the report. His attractiveness to female supporters is particularly significant given the sport's popularity with women in China.He is also, of course, one of the most successful players in history, winning the Champions League with Real and leading Portugal to Euro2016 success. and his exploits on the pitch in 2016 brought more recognition off it.Ronaldo won the prestigious Ballon dOr award for a fourth time in December, while in January he was named The Best FIFA Men's Player of 2016.
It also helps that Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, is extremely well connected in China. Last year, Chinese conglomerate Fosun formeda strategic partnership with Mendes player representation agency, Gestifute.
With increased access to the sports industry out here,we expect to see more sponsorship and activation in China for Cristiano, which will strengthen his position as number one, said Tom Elsden, Mailman's senior client manager.
Messi missing
Barcelona's Lionel Messi -- Ronaldo's great rival in the battle to be recognized as the world's best player -- was not among the report's top five most influential stars.
The 29-year-old, who has no official Twitter account, does not have an active social media presence in China.
In 2013, the Argentine signed as an ambassador for WeChat(an app which started as China's equivalent of WhatsApp but has developed into an ecosystem for multiple services and platforms), but the partnership endedwithout much success.
Despite having won the Ballon d'Or a record five times, the four-time Champions League winner's absence on social media has seemed to stifle his online popularity.Social media is the first port of call for fans to interact and grow their relationship with a player or club, explained Elsden.
By not being online, he's falling at the first hurdle.But the difference between Ronaldo and Messi's social media approach in China reflects the differing paths they have followed throughout their careers.
Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sports Enterprise at the UK'sUniversity of Salford, tells CNN: Messi has long positioned himselfprincipally as a football player. Ronaldo, on the other hand, has always actively sought to take advantage of market opportunity, with a view to generating revenues.
Real & Man Utd players dominate
The only man to break the Manchester United and Real Madrid's player hegemony online is Germany and Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil,who is second on the list.
Other players occupying the top five are Wales Bale in third, followed by Manchester United duo Anthony Martial and Rooney.
Many of the most followed footballers on Twitter did not have an official presence on Weibo (a platform similar to Twitter which has around 300 million monthly active users) when Red Card's last survey was published in January 2016.
But football fans in China select their teams based on players, often switching teams and supporting multiple sides, and, according to the authors of the report, clubs now understand the online value of theirstars. The players have become digital savvy in this market and have actively targeted Chinese fans, Elsden says.
Man Utd beat Bayern and Liverpool
Despite having not won the English Premier League since 2013, Manchester United has usurped last year's leader Bayern as the most influential football team.
The Bundesliga champion slipped to second, while PremierLeague sides Liverpool and Arsenal jointly occupy third place.
United is the most followed club on Weibo, although Bayern engages followers the most and has the largest active fan base on WeChat. Spanish side Barcelona -- the most successful European team in recent times -- is ninth, trailing the likes of Manchester City, AC Milan and Tottenham.
The Catalans have yet to reach their potential in China,while their rivals have been more innovative online, Elsden says.
Bundesliga is No. 1
The Bundesliga remains the most popular league in China,with the German league's decision to sell its rights to a number of free-to-air broadcasters, as opposed to a more lucrative pay-TV deal, a significant reason for its dominance. Bundesliga games are widely available and the league's partnership with CCTV5, one of the world's most powerful sports networks, overthe last two decades has strengthened the league's position..Live streaming has been the biggest digital trend in China over the last 12 months. Germany's Borussia Dortmund was the first club to successfully live stream in the country, with over 500,000 people watching a single stream during its preseason tour.
The Bundesliga has also, the report says, developed a comprehensive strategy to promote all of its 18 clubs online.
The Voice of Bundesliga campaign, which featured each team's stadium experience, reached over 16 million social followers.
Why is football a hot topic in China
The Chinese government has said it wants the country to be a world football superpower by 2050.
In the national league's drive to achieve this, a record $451.3 million was spent by Super League clubs on overseas players in 2016. Foreign players -- such as former Manchester United strikerCarlos Tevez of Argentina and ex-Chelsea midfielder Oscar of Brazil -- are helping to increase interest in the sport across the country.
In December, Ronaldo's agent Mendes said his client had rejected a deal from an un-named Chinese club that wouild have involved a world record 300 million ($316 million) transfer.
China offers an opportunity for clubs and players in Europe to not only build their profile, ultimately leading to increased revenues, butalso gives Chinese fans a chance to express themselves.
They can freely express their opinions, which they can't in everyday life, Chadwick says.And they like to garner peer attention by posting content that is new, different or concerns a particular status on them.
Posting messages about globally successful footballclubs and players is one of the ways in which people can do these three thing
Hence European clubs, which are among the world's most successful, are often animportant topic of conversation.

Defence Ministry refutes disabled soldiers' demands as unreasonable
A disabled war hero was receiving up to Rs. 70,000 monthly as a pension where a Government labourer was only receiving around 20,000 monthly as wages, Defence Ministry Additional Secretary, Sarath Kumara said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Defence Ministry yesterday, he said it was not clear what more the disabled soldiers wanted, as the government had fulfilled their demands.
Sarath Kumara requested the disabled war heroes to refrain from conducting protests that inconvenience the general public. "The disabled war heroes are invited to negotiate with the responsible authorities regarding their grievances," he added.
He said there were several disabled war heroes enjoying their full pension rights despite not having completed their minimum service period of 10 years.
The Additional Secretary said, A total of Rs. 3,500 million was allocated for the expenditure of soldiers for the year 2017. By February, Rs. 250 Million of the allocated funds had already been paid to disabled war heroes. Therefore, allegations by war heroes about discrimination is unjustified, as they have been given priority.
Sri Lanka Army Director Pay and Records, Brigadier Sanath Perera said the disabled soldiers receive a comprehensive monthly salary, disability pension and service pension for each month and it adds up to around Rs. 70,000.
He said, Disabled soldiers will be remunerated each month similar to other tri force soldiers. Their salaries will also be increased gradually according to promotions they will be receiving if they were in active service despite not being eligible for promotion by designation.

Del Potro books quarter-final clash with Querrey
MIAMI: Juan Martin Del Potro turned back a challenge by Damir Dzumhur Thursday to book a quarter-final clash with defending champion Sam Querrey at the ATP Delray Beach Open.
Argentina's Del Potro, the 2011 Delray Beach champion playing just his second match of 2017, held on to beat the 24-year-old Bosnian 7-6 (7/5), 4-6, 6-3.
Del Potro fired a backhand return wide to miss his first chance to seal the match, Dzumhur holding to make it 5-3 in the third.
Del Potro gained another chance with a forehand crosscourt winner and secured the win when Dzumhur, scrambling back to defend a lob, missed a desperation between-the-legs attempt.
Del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion now ranked 42nd in the world, is making his 2017 debut this week, and the rust was evident in six double-faults -- five of them in the first set.
That included two in the eighth game, in which he gave back a service break.
Del Potro fought off a set point to force the tiebreaker and after securing the first set seized a 3-1 lead in the second only to again give back a service break.
A double fault on break point at four-all cost the Argentine a second break of serve and, one game later, the set.
But once he'd broken to seize a 4-2 lead in the third, Del Potro wouldn't again surrender the advantage.
On Friday, he'll face 35th-ranked Querrey, the fourth-seeded wildcard who blasted 13 aces without a double fault in dispatching fellow American Jared Donaldson 6-2, 6-3 in a second-round match at the outdoor hardcourt event.
Also reaching the final eight was 57th-ranked Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis, who ousted Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 7-5. Darcis next faces 69th-ranked American Donald Young, who rallied to defeat compatriot Taylor Fritz 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Dialog powers 138th Royal-Thomian Battle of the Blues
Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, Dialog Axiata PLC, is once again the official sponsor of Sri Lankas blue riband cricket encounter, the Battle of the Blues between Royal College, Colombo, and S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia, for the prestigious D S Senanayake Memorial Shield, from 9, 10 and 11 of March at the SSC grounds.
In 2015, Dialog Axiata rekindled old ties with Sri Lankas oldest and grandest schools big match by stepping in yet again as the official sponsor of the Battle of the Blues.
In this years encounter, the boys from Mt. Lavinia will be led by Romesh Nallapperuma, whilst the lads from Reid Avenue will be under the captaincy of Helitha Vithanage.
The Royal-Thomian has a rich and colourful history of 138 years, and is also the second longest uninterrupted cricket series played in the world; second only to the annual encounter played between St. Peters College, Adelaide and Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, Australia, begun just a year earlier. In 1880, the first match in which only the boys took part was played on the Galle Face Green, the present-day location of the Taj Samudra Hotel. This was the start to the Centenary series.
The playing fields of the RoyTho has the distinction of producing cricketers who later became eminent heads of state, with S. Thomas producing the father of the nation D. S. Senanayake MP and his son, Dudley Senanayake MP as Prime Ministers of Ceylon, while Royal produced General Sir John Kotelawala MP as Prime Minister and the first Executive President of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayawardena.
The tally between the two schools at present stands at 35 for Royal and 34 for S. Thomas, with the highly debated famous match in 1885, where Royal College was all out for 9 runs with no play on the second day is considered a win by S. Thomas and considered a draw by Royal. After last years heroics by the Royal XI, the shield at present sits as the crown jewel amongst the silverware in the trophy cabinet at Royal College, which will be challenged for possession by the Thomian outfit this year.
In the 136th edition of the Royal-Thomian Dialog Axiata PLC rekindled a long and successful partnership with Sri Lankas Blue Riband Big Match, the Battle of the Blues. Dialog has also pledged to contribute Rs. 1,000 for every run scored and Rs. 10,000 for every wicket that falls for the development of cricket in a resource deficit school. Last years exciting encounter contributed Rs. 1,255,000 to the Play for a Cause pledge.

Indian Premier League: Ben Stokes smashes record for overseas player
Explosive with the bat, aggressive with the ball and sharp as a tack in the field -- no wonder England cricket star Ben Stokes was a wanted man at the 2017 Indian Premier League (IPL) auction on Monday.
The 25-year-old attracted a record $2.16 million fee for an overseas player from the Rising Pune Supergiants -- one of eight teams that take part in the annual Twenty20 limited-overs league. Stokes was one 130 foreign stars out of a total of 359 players going under the hammer in Bangalore for the six-week tournament, which starts April 5. He will be taking part for the first time.
The all-rounder wasn't the only English player breaking records. Paceman Tymal Mills became the most expensive specialist bowler in IPL history-- snapped up for $1.8 million by Royal Challengers Bangalore. Left-armer Mills is one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket today with deliveries routinely clocking in excess of 90 mph (145 kph). His speed, combined with his economy rate (7.28) in the last five overs of an innings -- when teams are looking to accelerate the scoring rate -- made him an attractive proposition.
He only competes in limited-overs competitions due to chronic back problems which prevent him playing in longer formats of the game. Mills and Stokes both overtook the previous records for overseas players in the IPL held by former England stars Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff, who were bought for $1.55 million in 2014 and 2009 respectively.
Debutant Stokes is the fourth most expensive player in IPL history behind Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Ghambir. Veteran India all-rounder Singh was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for $2.7 million in 2015 and $2.3 million by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2014, while his former international teammate Ghambir -- an opening batsman -- attracted a fee of $2.4 million from the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2011. The IPL has an estimated value of $4.2 billion according to a financial report published in June 2016, with Bangalore rated the most valuable franchise at $67 million. - CNN

Justice and fair play guaranteed
Bonapartism is the political ideology that arose from politics of Napoleon Bonaparte and his followers and successors. The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or authoritarian centralized state, with a strongman charismatic leader based on anti-elitist rhetoric, army support, and conservative religious support.
Marx used Bonapartism to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary elements seize power in an uprising undermining revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular masses.
Traditional dictatorships
Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class. Marx believed that such leaders in the end had corrupted revolutions in Europe. More generally, Bonapartism may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by pro military leadership within revolutionary movements. Recently -Bonapartism is used to refer to political movements focusing around a strong leader, who is often a hero to the people, and upholds the ideals of the people.
Thus Neo-Bonapartist philosophy is characterized by the leader. It is believed that a strong and capable leader is necessary for the ideals the Bonapartists support. The leader is usually a great hero of the people - in most historical cases being military in nature - who brings about reforms in their name. This philosophy by itself has never been popular, and thus is almost always used in conjunction with others. Neo-Bonapartists are often similar to enlightened despots who use their absolute power to advance liberalism, freedoms, and social welfare, though in many cases of supposed Bonapartism, the exact opposite is achieved; giving rise to regimes, more like traditional dictatorships.
Nationalism is also often a component of Bonapartism, though not a necessary one. In spite of theory, as Marx explained, Bonapartist leaders emerge to balance contending social pressures. Popular actions draw support from politically conscious middle class. Is that happening in our society too Our democratic revolution has come to a crisis point with some conservative forces demanding not to change the executive presidency. They want Maithripala Sirisena to continue as an executive president to stand above corruption and injustice to become a spiritual leader.
Suffering masses
These people blindly believe that Mahinda Rajapaksa was dislodged, after a decade in power without serious challenge, by President Maithripala Sirisena because of latters ability to penetrate the suffering masses. They forget though, the result evoked surprise and only reluctantly accepted by Mahinda, the writing on the wall became evident in the course of the campaign. Desperate ruling alliance supporters became increasingly violent towards the end of the campaign. At the end, the common opposition comprising all sections of Lankan nationality groups won over the ruling Mahinda gang by a margin of more than 300,000 votes.
Actually, Mahinda decided to go for snap elections to avoid the risk of facing a much stronger anti-incumbency sentiment two years later. Mahinda observed the powerful growth of the Protest of the Opposition and the decline in his governments popularity in the provincial council polls. To secure his position among the Sinhala masses, his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa allegedly cultivated radical Buddhist groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) which ran a fascistic anti-Muslim campaign in the garb of protecting the Sinhala people. Orchestrated violence against Muslims was unchecked by security forces lending credence to the allegations.
On the other hand, Mahinda regime neglected the Tamil national problem. They hardly took any sincere step to devolve power. Not that people expected after savage destruction of the Tamil civilization, any devolution of power from the Mahinda regime; yet he repeatedly promised substantial devolution power to the Tamil people but did nothing. Besides alienating the minorities, the governments economic policies were unpopular. More than half the population felt they were worse off.
Many Chinese funded infrastructure projects were seen as white elephants, enriching the coffers of the ruling elite. In any case these did not result in tangible economic benefits. The ruling family was increasingly seen as corrupt and worse, autocratic. Journalistic freedom was restricted and there were attacks on media leading to killings and disappearances. Thus a powerful social and political power was developing to oust Mahinda.
Mahinda group
Now all these have gone and the defeat of the Mahinda group is obvious. People are expecting a new era with a new constitution that can create a powerful democratic society. The executive presidency, immensely strengthened by the 18th amendment, was expected to be diluted to restore parliamentary control. If that happened quickly, the prime minister, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, would have been the effective head of government with the possibility of President Sirisena getting reduced to a titular head. 19th amendment gave a half way situation creating a dynamic equilibrium between Maithri and Ranil.
However the President and Prime Minister, at the beginning, have collectively worked to satisfy the hopeful masses. They issued the necessary instructions on the political stage to implement the law to the letter with regard to everyone alike and have openly canvassed that action be taken irrespective of individual position or party affiliation. But now citizens that supported the democratic change feel that corruption cases must proceed without discrimination.
President Sirisena revealed recently, that the first action he took using his executive powers was to remove former chief justice Mohan Peiris, when he came and begged him not to remove him from his post and expressed his willingness to do anything he wanted. This action and several such actions show that President Maithripala Sirisena is strongly committed to justice and fair play. Though not backed by the constitution such a style of work could build a tradition and power to the post of presidency which may lead to Bonapartism.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP: Daily News exposure helps Viper tour Japan
The Daily News report last Saturday that Nihal Viper Gunaratne, 1976 captain, needed help to make the tour to Tokyo for a coaching course has paid rich dividends. Antonians around the world were extremely proud to read about the invitation extended to their prominent past ruggerite Nihal Viper Gunaratne to attend the World Rugby & ARFU Performance Development Workshop in Tokyo, Japan, and a group of die-hard loyal Antonians around the globe, known as the Global Antonian News Network (GANN) has stepped forward to sponsor Vipers air ticket to Japan. GANN was formed as an informal whatsapp group to share news of Antonian sport.
This is run by volunteers who share all news which are of interest to Old Antonians. Its members are spread worldwide from Canada to New Zealand with some active members from the Middle East. Maufer Usoof, and Riyaz Usoof, a live wire in GANN had this to say about Viper, Viper was an excellent rugby player from St. Anthonys College. I had the pleasure of watching him play for school and for the Kandy Sports Club.
He is one player who had rugby always in his heart. We are very proud of Vipers achievements on the rugby field and happy to sponsor him. Thaiyar Mohamed, the Antonian cricket captain of 1977 who incidentally went on to captain the Singapore national team, now domiciled in Perth, Australia and a member of GANN said,

OKeefe, Smith flatten India in 1st Test
PUNE, Friday  Left-arm spinner Steve Keefe grabbed a career-best haul of 6-35 to put Australia on top before skipper Steve Smith compounded Indias misery with an unbeaten fifty in the first Test in Pune Friday.
The visitors reached 143-4 at stumps on day two, which saw a total of 15 wickets fall at Punes Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.
OKeefe, whose six wickets came off just 24 balls, helped Australia bundle India out for 105 in the afternoon session before the visiting batsmen rammed home their advantage against the worlds top Test team.
Smith on 59 and Mitchell Marsh on 21 were at the crease as Australia stretched their lead to 298 runs on a turning track at Indias newest Test venue.
Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin claimed three wickets, including the early scalps of openers David Warner and Shaun Marsh.
Smith, who was dropped three times, went on to register his 21st Test half-century in his 51st match.
First innings top-scorer Matt Renshaw, who did not open the batting after staying off the field with nausea during most of Indias innings, hung on with Smith for a 52-run partnership.
Renshaw (31), who also had to temporarily retire ill with a stomach upset during his first innings knock on Thursday, once again found it hard to cope with the heat as he suffered from bouts of dehydration.
But the Indian fielders were also left feeling the heat as they dropped four catches.
Ishant Sharma finally clung on to a skier at long-off after Renshaw mistimed a hit off Jayant Yadav.
Smith then steadied the innings with Mitchell Marsh as the duo tackled the spinners with aplomb.
But it was OKeefe who stole the show earlier in the day with a blitz of wickets after lunch that saw Indias middle and lower order crumble as the hosts conceded a 155-run first innings lead.
OKeefe went well past his previous best of 3-53 against Pakistan at Sydney in just the fifth match of his Test career.
The 32-year-olds stunning exploits put Australia in charge of the first match of the four-Test series but it was a day to forget for Indian captain Virat Kohli, who was dismissed for a rare duck.
Kohli, who has hit four double centuries since July last year, walked after just two deliveries for his first duck in a Test since playing against England in August 2014.
Paceman Mitchell Starc, who had already made an impact with his gritty 61 in Australias first innings score of 260, took two wickets including the prized scalp of Kohli.
Indian opener Lokesh Rahul top-scored for the home side with a gritty 64 but hurt his shoulder while going for a mistimed heave at long-off and did not take field.

ONeill calls for flawed Super series to dump teams
SYDNEY: Former Australian rugby chief John O'Neill has called for Argentina and Japan to be dumped from the troubled Super Rugby competition, along with a South African side.
As the SANZAAR organisers grapple with a way forward for the confusing 18-team, five-nation championship, former Australian Rugby Union chairman O'Neill says they must return to a 15-team format.
O'Neill said he fears the far-flung competition, beset with problems over its unwieldy conference structure and exhausting travel schedules, is losing its tribalism.
He has accused the organisers of trying to please everyone, including World Rugby.
It will take some very bold decision-making, O'Neill told the Daily Telegraph on Friday, imploring Australian administrators to stand strong against calls to axe one of their own five teams. Am I suggesting it's an easy solution No, it's not. But you cannot continue with an 18-team competition, which isn't even a genuine competition. O'Neill was referring to the competition's convoluted four-conference structure and fixture schedule that means the Golden Lions and the Southern Kings of South Africa will not play against any team from New Zealand during this regular season O'Neill said it was time for a serious rethink.
What is the best competition structure that is ultimately and unambiguously in the best interests of Australian rugby he asked.
Personally, I would not have agreed with South Africa going to six teams. That's a domestic issue that they should have been told to sort out. And he was vehemently against the suggestion that Australia should lose a franchise.
I can't possibly agree with that. It is not the fault of the five Australian franchises that this Super 18 competition is a disaster.
You can ask questions how the hell this 18-team competition came into existence but the hard cold question now is 'what's the solution'. He said the current formatacross five countries and 17 times zones with matches being played from Thursday to Sunday was flawed.
Latitudinal competitions - east/west competitions - do not work, he said, suggesting Australia should even look at a better trans-Tasman option while including Pacific and Asian teams.
The new season kicked off on Thursday with the Auckland Blues thrashing the Melbourne Rebels 56-18 in Melbourne.

Over 15,000 children in Apura district malnourished
Anuradhapura District Additional Secretary Saman Bandulasena at a recent District Agriculture Committee Meeting said a survey revealed that over 15,000 children in the Anuradhapura district had been affected by malnutrition. The District Agriculture Committee has decided to give priority to programmes of anti-alcoholism, anti malnutrition and prevention of kidney diseases as they influence the rural economy in the district. He said there are a minimum of 700 - 800 children affected by malnutrition in 22 Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
Bandulasena said it is necessary to take remedial measures to address the health hazard. A permanent dieting and feeding methodology will be implemented to enhance their weight and height, he said. "It was our target to decrease the malnutrition rate by 50 percent in 2017, the District Additional Secretary said. He said family health employees could play a significant role to reduce the number of malnutrition affected children".
Bandulasena said it has been decided to give priority to the families of the malnourished children in granting life supporting allowances and gratuities, milk cows and chicks.
He said the majority of kidney patients represent the rural farmer community belonging to low income group.
The District Agriculture Committee and all divisional level agriculture committees must be in close touch with the government and provincial council sponsored kidney prevention programmes.

People who rode to power on the back of SLFP now trying to defeat it: Former Moratuwa Deputy Mayor
People who rode to power on the back of the SLFP and amassed massive amounts of wealth through political deals are now trying to defeat the SLFP. These people have turned former President Mahinda Rajapaksa into a puppet and made him dance to their tune, former Moratuwa Municipal Council Deputy Mayor Sujith Pushpakumara said.
Pushpakumara said that President Maithripala Sirisena has given unprecedented freedom to SLFP members to engage in the type of politics that they prefer. Therefore, they should not misuse this generosity, but, rather use it to strengthen the party.
Addressing the media in Katubedda, Moratuwa yesterday, he said the President is keen to get all factions of the SLFP together in order to win the next election.
We urge former President Rajapaksa not to destroy the SLFP which is getting stronger by the day and instead focus his energies on strengthening the party. MP Wimal Weerawansa has said that his party, the National Freedom Front (NFF) wants to get away from the UPFA and work as an independent party. We urge him to vacate the MP post that they got through the SLFP votes and leave the UPFA gracefully. We can recall how the NFF went it alone at the last Uva Provincial Council election and lost very badly, he said.
President Sirisena who addressed the SLFP electoral organisers recently said that the SLFP is in a position of winning any future election. When he was SLFP General Secretary, the party never suffered a defeat. Therefore, we are ready to vouch with our own blood that the SLFP will emerge victorious at the next Local Government election, Pushpakumara added. Former Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman A.D. Kumarasiri said the very people who tried to defeat former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2005 Presidential election are now backing his comeback campaign. But,we know all those who left the party have become political destitutes.
Colombo District SLFP Organiser M.H. Mansil said that former President Rajapaksa who came to power with the SLFP votes later neglected their voices and opted to go for an election two years prior to the scheduled date which left most party supporters destitute. It was former President who destroyed the party by getting together with various UNP factions. He chased out our own organisers and appointed organisers who parachuted from the UNP. But, President Sirisena entered into a formal agreement with the UNP without affecting the rights of the true SLFP members.
Former Kalutara Municipal Council Mayor Nalin Mahesh Perera said both Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila are responsible for turning the SLFP into a communal minded political party.

Rice makes major re-entry to political debate
The proper response to public interest is to keep the people informed of reality, especially on matters that can impact on public thinking and the politics of governance. There have been many instances when the present government has failed to make the best use of timely contact and communication with the public on matters of importance, that have added to its problems in governance. Just now the price of rice stands out as an issue of increasing economic and political importance, which seems to have been forgotten or ignored by those handling the subject.
There is no escape possible from the unprecedented drought conditions faced by the country. This was known to the authorities for many months back, with little hope of things improving by the occasional huge shower, even though thinking those rains came as a response for prayers to the deities. The fact today is that those in governance appear to be wholly ignorant of the role of rice in the politics of this country. Rice has changed governments. The price of rice has been the core subject of national elections. We have had political leaders who promised to bring rice from the moon in election campaigns, and we have had political parties that gave free rice to the people.
The response by the government to the growing criticism on the price of rice in the market, despite all the publicity given to the Gazette notifications on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the most consumed varieties of rice, seems a complete failure to understand the reality of both the social and political impacts of the price of rice. It took some time after the criticism began to spread for the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen to visit rice traders with the media, and make statements as to how the MRP on rice was being implemented. It took even more time after that for the people to be told about the raids carried out  more than a thousand we are told - on traders who were not observing the MRP.
The reality is that in any area of the country, whether urban or rural, the MRP is largely non-effective, except in the CWE and other cooperative outlets. The larger public has neither the time nor money to travel distances to the CWE and cooperative outlets to benefit from the MRP on rice. They go to traders in their areas of residence, and find that the price has not come down, and the traders tell them the rice they sell has been purchased at the older higher prices, and cannot be brought down. This is the stark reality of the everyday market, as faced by the people.
Becoming a farce
The public is not helped by the statistics published by any ministry about raids carried out. They are not encouraged by such statistics to take the trouble to make phone complaints about their nearby traders selling at higher prices, who they have to deal with every day. They lack confidence in the privacy assurances of the officialdom about such phone complaints, and on the entire system of the MRP on rice, which is becoming a farce and leading to a steady increasing in the cost of rice, and as a result the daily cost of living of the people.
If there are raids on traders who sell rice at higher prices, why is the media not used to give publicity to such raids Why is the public not told of the fines imposed on the traders so charged What is preventing the use prominent news items, and good advertisements in the media to give publicity to such raids and fines, just as huge advertisements are used to give a boost to Ministers and various programmes launched by ministries This is the lack of contact and communication, on an issue as important socially and politically as the price of rice, and which certainly has an important impact on the image of the government and its popularity with the people.
The allegations made that those who break the MRP on rice are engaged in a conspiracy to bring down the government, makes no sense whatever, when considering the reality of how this lack of contact and communication with the people, and actual publicized raids on wrongful traders, are causing much more damage to the government; giving an impression that it is threatened from within. Speedy changes are called for on dealing with the price of rice, as well as the wider increased cost of living that is faced by the people.
Constitutional doldrums
If the crisis on the economic front is shown by the inability to effectively handle the price of rice, another aspect of political importance that has moved in the doldrums is Constitutional Reform. There is no question that this government was elected  both in the sea change on January 8, 2015 and the later affirmation of that change in the General Election in August that year  on a pledge to bring in a new constitution, which will abolish the Executive Presidency. The talk from the SLFP, especially those of the SLFP in the government, points to a total negation of that pledge given by Common Candidate of January 2015  none other than President Maithripala Sirisena.
After many twists and turns in the past few months, this section of the SLFP is now coming out in the open as being wholly rejective of the pledges given to the people by the Common Candidate and the political movement  the combination of political parties and organisations of civil society  that campaigned to elect the Common Candidate, defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa, to bring about major constitutional changes in the country.
This emerging trend by SLFP sections within the government is not a big surprise, because most of them remained supportive of the corrupt Rajapaksa Regime even after January 8, 2015, and also campaigned for a Rajapaksa victory in the General Election that followed. What one hears from them is their echoing of the Rajapaksa thinking on the politics of the country, which is totally against any constitutional change, on the basis of any new constitution, brought in with emphasis on the principle of devolution and power sharing, which they say would bring federalism and, therefore, separatism in the country.
The question remains as to how these persons were in the Mahinda Rajapaksa governments, both of them, with the policy manifesto of Mahinda Rajapaksa, in both elections, stating the need for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. The answer would be that they knew that it was a false promise that would never be implemented, and they liked all the corruption that flowed in many directions of governance under the power of the Executive Presidency.
Referendum fears
Apart from that support for Rajapaksa thinking, what is emerging now in their opposition to the abolition of the Executive Presidency, and any constitutional changes that would require a referendum, show that they do wholly fear the possibility of a referendum, which could lead to a defeat of the government on this issue. What is being displayed by these members of government is that they do not want any new constitution. The constitutional changes that can come without a referendum can only be further amendments to the present constitution, and cannot be major issues such as the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
What these forces that are opposed to a referendum conceal, apart from their fear of the results of a referendum, is that they do not look at the possibility of winning at a referendum. Going by the examples of Brexit in the UK, and the recent Italian referendum on constitutional change, a referendum could certainly pose a danger to a government in office. Yet the situation here is certainly different. The dangers the government could face could certainly be wholly removed if the government lives up to the other major promise to fight and eradicate corruption in the country, beginning with the Rajapaksa Regime.
The issue of popularity faced by the government today, apart from the lack of good communication with the people, lies in what people see as its failure to fight the forces of corruption. Pushing behind many investigations launched by the FCID and the Bribery Commission, and moves to appease forces who are against the law being applied on War Heroes, even when involved in crimes against the people, are certainly taking their toll on the governments popularity. The major issue here is that those of the SLFP making the biggest noises against the abolition of the Executive Presidency and the possibility of a referendum could also be having links to the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime, apart from the corruption of today.
The government clearly has to deal swiftly with the issue of the lack of proper communication with the people, and keep to its pledge for constitutional reform, if the pledge to the people to bring major political change is to be lived up to.

SMSC celebrates 20th anniversary in style : Over 200 automobiles for the Eliyakanda Hill Climb 2017
Southern Motor Sports Club (SMSC) proudly celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2017 with a magnificent record of entries for the Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb 2017. Over 200 entries were received including nearly 100 motor car entries.
The history of SMSC dates back to 1997, when it was established by a group of motor sportsmen from the South, with the aim of taking motor sports to the South and to elevate standards of motor sports in Sri Lanka.
These founder members included Suranjith Premadasa, Preethi Palliyaguru, Ashhar Hameem, Andrew Silva and Lalin De Silva.
Suranjith Premadasa was elected as the founder president of the Club with Preethi Palliyaguru as the secretary.
Among the events organized by the SMSC, the Southern Rally and the Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb are the two annual events that stand high as two premier events in the motor sports calendar of Sri Lanka.
Recently, after completion of the first speed rally run to FIA standards - Rally Sri Lanka 2016 which carried the tagline Rumbling Wonder of Digamadulla and was run in the Hingurana Sugar Plantation premises in Gal Oya, in the Ampara district with the concurrence of the Governing Body for Motor Sports in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS), the Southern Motor Sports Club got ready for their next big event Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb'.
The hilly slopes of Browns Hill, Matara will be deafened by the incessant cry of motor vehicles on Sunday (Feb.26) with the flagging off of the 21st annual Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb'.
Known as the only outstation club, unremittingly affiliated to the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS) since its inception in 1997, the SMSC plans to organize this event to perfection. The track preparation, safety standards, time keeping, vehicle recovery processes, competitor relations etc. are expected to be met best standards available in Sri Lanka.
The Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb track is a unique track, with four extremely tricky and challenging corners; the Single Tree Corner, Southern Corner, Residency Corner and Tower Corner, which the conquering requires high driving skills and perfect man-machine combination.
This is the very reason for all well-known drivers in the country taking part in this event with a large scale public interest.
This year's event will have a practice day on Saturday (Feb.25) and will consist of 10 motor cycle events and 24 motor car events. Scrutinizing of competition vehicles will commence at 7.30 a.m. on the race day and the event will start at 9.00 a.m. The prize giving will be held at the Pearl Cliff Hotel, Browns Hill, Matara at 4.00 p.m.

Sri Lanka to eliminate measles by 2018
Sri Lanka is targeting the elimination of measles as a public health problem by 2018 in line with the WHO global target to eliminate the disease by 2020, WHO Colombo Office sources said.
Morbidity and mortality of measles have reduced after measles vaccine was introduced to the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), Sri Lanka in 1984.
According to the sources, measles is a contagious, serious disease caused by a virus. The disease remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
Meanwhile, WHO Regional Director Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh said in a statement that measles is a virus that could be transmitted through airdrops, personal contact and infected surfaces.
It affects the young, old and the immune-compromised and malnourished. It can inflict deadly complications, including pneumonia, diarrhea, encephalitis and malnutrition. Singh said action should be scaled up against the disease which is a major childhood killer, claiming an estimated 54,500 lives in 2015. Up to 5.5 million infants are deprived of even the first dose of the measles vaccine each year, many of whom are the most at risk of death if complications arise. Region-wide coverage of the vaccines second dose is 71 percent, signifying the need for further gains, she said.

Time for stern action
Every time a boat overturns in rough seas and deaths occur, there is a public outcry for tighter regulations. The authorities too promise to do the same but over a period of time, everything is forgotten until the next tragedy occurs. But the latest incident, in which at least 15 people perished when their boat capsized while going on a pilgrimage in Katukurunda, has galvanized the public, the authorities and the media like never before.
The simple fact is that this was a tragedy waiting to happen due to the lackadaisical attitude towards existing maritime safety regulations. And it was an easily preventable one. An accident of this nature happens due to the cumulative effect of several mistakes that pile up on one another.
The first mistake was using a fishing boat for a pilgrimage. That should have been a strict no-no. As the name implies, fishing boats are built for one purpose and one purpose only  fishing - and can carry only around six persons. They do not have the facilities required of a normal passenger boat, such as seats and safety equipment, although even fishing boats are now mandated by law to carry lifejackets and flotation devices.
There is a ground-based analogy  normal private buses are theoretically not supposed to operate special tours on hire, because they lack the creature comforts and sometimes the passenger insurance. There are a number of companies that provide licensed tour buses for such trips, but they are more expensive. Most people thus opt for the former which is arguably cheaper, without knowing the advantages of hiring a tour bus.
The same goes for boat trips. There are leisure tour boat operators who generally fulfill all safety requirements, but fishing boats are cheaper and easier to get. This is where the analogy ends - unlike the road, the sea is terribly unforgiving if you do not know how to swim. Even if you know how to swim, the sea conditions at the time of capsizing could make you drown.
The second mistake was overloading. This boat had more than 40 passengers, whereas it could accommodate only around six. To get back to our first analogy, most buses are terribly overcrowded but the bus can somehow go on without a major accident if the driver is careful enough. But on the high seas, in a fishing boat, that equation literally goes out of the water. Overloading affects the very stability of the boat and is a recipe for disaster.
The third, is the apparent lack of safety gear on board the ill-fated boat. EVERY boat, fishing or leisure, must have lifejackets and bigger vessels must have at least one lifeboat. The regulation is already in place, but implementation seems to be a problem. Other safety devices must also be carried, including flotation devices, rescue ropes and communications equipment.
Lifejackets save lives, period. How many more tragedies should happen before we realise this Again, coming back to a road analogy, motorists now buckle up almost automatically because they know that seat belts save lives. In the same way, people should be wise enough to don a life jacket as soon as they board a boat. If any boat operator says no lifejackets, just do not patronize his business and walk away. The Government should strictly enforce the lifejacket regulations at least now.
The authorities should also insist on the installation of stabilizers on every new large fishing or leisure vessel. They literally help boats to be on an even keel and survive formidable waves. It is a somewhat expensive solution, but it can make a boat ride much more stable.
Safety gear can only do so much, if the human element fails. There was an emotional angle to this boat ride, being a pilgrimage. But that is no reason to abandon safety precautions. Every traveller must know about safety precautions that should be followed in a boat ride. The media should also play a bigger role in raising awareness on maritime safety. The licences of all operators who fail to adhere to safety guidelines must be cancelled, as the Government has done in this particular case.
There are several places of worship around the coast that have to be reached by boat, including the famous St. Anthonys Church in Kachchatheevu Island. The authorities should draw up plans to ensure the safety of pilgrims in consultation with the religious leaders, boat operators and the Police. The seaworthiness of these boats and their safety features must be inspected beforehand. If they come up short in terms of safety equipment, they should not be allowed on the highs seas. We can learn a few lessons from other countries that have similar events on how they ensure the passengers safety.
Accidents do happen despite the best of precautionary measures. It is vital to have a more organised search and rescue system around our coast to ensure that help is available fast if a maritime accident occurs. A holistic approach is needed to the whole issue, from regulations to rescue.

UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said the UPFA headed by the SLFP would no longer contest with communal or racist political parties.
Amaraweera observed that due to certain racist parties joining the UPFA in the recent past, great harm was caused to the SLFP principles and thus it was a timely opportunity to have Wimal Weerawansa leave their fold.
He said that many parties have expressed their interest in joining the UPFA and that they had held several rounds of discussions with them. They hoped to emerge with a stronger alliance in the future.
Minister Amaraweera also pointed out that the UPFA supporters would no longer vote for parties or individuals who use their vote to grab power and thereafter abandon the Alliance.
He said that the next election would be a good opportunity for those who left to test their own vote base.
