She also said that all women should be trained well to become future leaders. All the girl guides selected for this program will be able to plan and implement projects.
The Colombo Plan Gender Affairs Program (CPGAP) was implemented in 2014 to expand the gender knowledge and programs in member countries. It supports them in conducting research, to increase the awareness on gender equality, gender development, womens legal rights and gender issues among the developing member through workshops and trainings.
This initiative is not limited to urbanize areas but also to rural areas, Director, Gender Affairs Program, Tooba Mayel said.

It aims at empowering 45 girl guides, five from each province through a 16 month time period. The Colombo Plan will be investing 11.6 million rupees on the program. The selections of the girls are not based on their awards and ranks but on their skills.

English broadcasters of Sri Lankan Radio
As a teenager in the 1950s, I discovered the existence of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. Since we were then studying in the English medium and studying in St Michaels College, Maddakkalappu (Batticaloa) run by the American Jesuits then, we were all interested in Western Music, Literature, Cowboy Comics, Chewing Gum, western roll high jump, athletic running shoes etcetera. In fact, we liked everything western. However, we were rooted in our mother tongue (Thamil for me) as a second language. So, we liked the commercial service best. There was then a Home Service too, which was later known as National Service.
I used to listen to the Teenage Leisure presented by the friendly presenter Priya Samarajeeva (later she was known as Priya Kodipilly) on the Home Service. Listening to Mark Antony Fernando and Priya Samaraweera and Myrle Swan reading the news bulletins was a real treat. The announcers did not have a borrowed accent, but we learned the correct pronunciation of English words. BBCs Received Pronunciation was the order of the day then.
Turning our attention to the Commercial Service, we enjoyed the Sunday Choice presented ad lib by the internationally known Russo-Japanese announcer Greg Rozkowski, Tim Horshington, Livy Wijemanne, Mil Sansoni, Jimmy Bharucha, Bob Harvey, Karl Goonasena ,Norton Pereira, Eardley Pieris, Ronald Campbell, Percy Bathelomeuz, Dan Durairaj, Mike Wilson, Myrl Walpola,(later Myrl Williams), Rohana Candappa, Sita Parakrama, Shirly Perera Vernon Corea, Geoff Fruitgneath, Perin Rustomjee and a host of entertainers made us happy.
Parallel to the commercial service, there was the All Asia Beam where some of the announcers mentioned came over. There were the Sahani Brothers from Mumbai presented a variety of programmers. The Hindi announcers are the Ganjwal sisters.
The Hit Parade, Amateur Hour, Quiz Kids (where the late Athulathmudali was a star performer), Radio Journal, Take it or Leave It was some of the programmes I enjoyed.
By end of 1953, I move to Colombo with my parents.
Here not only the Commercial Service, the National and School Service too provided educational value programmes coupled with of course entertaining.
On the National Service, we had Tommy Perera, Mahes Perera, David Joseph, Joseph Mather, Dudley Weeraratne, Joe Sothinathan, Charmaine Fernando, Lalith Blok, Michele Berenger and others.
Foreign Affairs Review by Mervyn de Silva, Arts Magazine presented by Vernon Abeysekera, Deloraine Brohiers programmes were some of the other programs I enjoyed listening to on the National Service,
Later on, new announcers came on the air. Errol Fernando, Vijaya Corea, Leon Belleth, Nihal Bharathi Rajendra, Kumar Samuel, Caryl Sella, Indranee Senanayake, Eric Fernando, Harold Fernando, Rajan Vairavanathan, Krishna Vairavanathan, Fathima Cader, Niranjan Abeysundare, Dudley Jansz, Bevil Pallihawdane, Sounthi Thavam, Chris Jayamaha and a host of others. I may have missed some names because of forgetfulness.
Although I have participated in many programmes and even presented some programs over Radio Ceylon, only after trying more than 10 times that I got an opportunity to become a Relief Announcer in Thamil on the commercial service in 1966. But in this article, I shall confine myself only to my association with the English services.
When Neville Jayaweera was the Director General of Broadcasting, I was selected as a trainee relief announcer for the National English Service. But that was short-lived. But when I joined the newsroom, I sometimes edited the Asia Beam news bulletin in English and read it over the air.
When the Asian Broadcasting Institute in Kuala Lumpur had an in-service training and workshop in Colombo, I was also selected as a participant. The trainers were Melville de Melo, the famous newsreader and broadcaster from All India Radio in New Delhi and Pran Chopra, the veteran Editor
of major Indian newspapers. It was a fruitful experience.
It was only later that I was selected as an English relief announcer for both the City FM and the commercial service. Apart from being an announcer, I also presented a weekly programme called Rhythms Thamil.
I continued to be an announcer until lately and stopped the Disc Jockey style-automation- system came operative. With the fast-spreading TV stations in the island radio broadcasts lost its listenership. I thank the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in shaping me as a broadcaster. A wealth of learning and experience I gained.

Focus on girls teams
The Mobitel Observer Cricketer of the Year awards this year moves into a new chapter with the interest shifting to looking at ways to award the girls who perform well this season. This will also encourage them to commit themselves wholeheartedly to the game.
A total of 36 girls schools are fielding teams in the under-19 tournament divided into seven groups. The knock-out final round enabled 18 teams to qualify.
Last year Devapathiraja College Ratgama emerged champions for the third consecutive time with Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda finishing as runners-up. Ratnawali Balika Vidyalaya Gampaha finished in third place with St. Anthonys Girls College Kandy taking fourth place.
Sathya Sandeepani of Devapathiraja was adjudged as the best batter and player of the final, an achievement that will never be forgotten by her.
There are some schools that have arranged to play their annual big matches too that will enhance their morale.
Such encounters will also boost the images of individual players who will strive to further improve their skills and enhance their standards to higher levels. Once these cricketers know that there is a reward waiting for them they will certainly be motivated to improve in their game.
Not only the girl who will be looking forward to engage in more games, the school heads that field these teams will also be eager to conduct games against more teams. There will be schools in other provinces too that will be fielding girls cricket teams.
This will give them the opportunity to visit these provinces as well. Certainly, schools in the North and East are also having girls teams that will be looking forward to play against one another other in other Provinces.
This will only be a stepping stone for these female players to move to the next level. That is to represent a club and showcase their talent that will lead them to play big time for the national team some day.
Already, the Forces are looking out to absorb them so that they can continue to play the game at a higher level. The ultimate goal should be to represent the country at international level.
There is no doubt that the Sri Lanka womens team has reached a certain standard. They have won a few important encounters against teams that play at a higher level. But this trend has not been consistent.
Chamara Atapattu and former captain Sashikala Siriwardane have been top performers for the country but not consistent. Talented players must be spotted and groomed to take over from the older players.
CEO of Mobitel Nalin Perera had stated last week that they were looking at a way to conduct a regional one-day tournament among female teams.
At least two teams will represent a region and they will come into the limelight by displaying their talent. This will only encourage the girls to display their talent and perform well to gain recognition. It is not to win that counts but an opportunity to excel and be recognized.
Once they are recognized they will be noted when it is time for selection to representative sides. It could be for the national schools team or the national team.

Mathivanan speaking to the media said the last time he contested with Sumathipalas team but had to switch camps because there was so much of corruptions which he did not want to get involved.
I fought out on several incidents but everyone tried to corner me. I have a good reputation with all the affiliated clubs so I decided to quit them, Mathivanan said. Nishantha Ranatunga said that he has taken legal action against Sumathipala and the case was still proceeding in court and because of that Sumathipala was unable to contest.

Google joins tech  move east, to invest  $1 bn in New York campus
Google became the latest US tech giant to announce a major expansion plan, unveiling a $1 billion investment Monday to create a new campus that could double its New York City workforce to 14,000.
The move by Google comes following Amazons announcement of new headquarters sites in New York and suburban Washington DC worth some $5 billion, and Apples $1 billion expansion to Texas and other areas.
Google parent Alphabets chief financial officer Ruth Porat said it would lease large office buildings in lower Manhattan, which will become the centerpiece of a campus of more than 1.7 million square feet (160,000 square meters).
The new campus, which should be operational starting in 2020, will be known as Google Hudson Square and will be the primary location for our New York-based Global Business Organization, Porat wrote in a blog post.
New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talentthats what brought Google to the city in 2000 and thats what keeps us here, she said.
Alphabet earlier this year said it was buying the Manhattan Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion, and planned to lease space at Pier 57 on the Hudson river. The company currently employs some 7,000 people in New York.
With these most recent investments in Google Chelsea and Google Hudson Square, we will have the capacity to more than double the number of Googlers in New York over the next 10 years, Porat said.
She said the companys investment in New York is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in US facilities, offices and jobs. (PHYS.ORG)

Govt agitated over Opposition Leaders post
Questions were raised in Parliament yesterday over the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader.
The Speaker, listening to arguments of both sides of the House, said he will give his ruling on the Opposition Leaders post on Friday.
At the commencement of the House, Speaker Jayasuriya announced that former President Rajapaksa will be given the Opposition Leaders post according to Parliamentary traditions. He observed that the UPFA MPs have withdrawn from the national government and assumed their seats in the Opposition.
The Speaker also announced that UPFA MP Mahinda Amaraweera has been appointed as Chief Opposition Whip and UNP MPs Lakshman Kiriella and Gayantha Karunathilake have been re-appointed as Leader of the House and Chief Government Whip respectively.
TNA Leader R.Sampanthan was seen seated on the chair allocated to the Opposition Leader of Parliament since the commencement of sittings.
Former President Rajapaksa, who entered the Chamber after the sittings commenced, took the seat next to Sampanthan.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella, taking the floor, contended that former President Rajapaksa and his fellow MPs ceased to be Members of Parliament as one month has lapsed since they vacated the SLFP and obtained membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
He quoted Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution in support of his argument which said, Where a Member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a member of a recognized political party or independent group on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his becoming such Member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such a member.
He pointed out the Constitution is clear on this provision, adding that no strangers, who are not MPs, must be allowed in the Chamber.
TNA MP M.A Sumanthiran, explaining the TNA stance on the Opposition Leader post, requested the Speaker to keep the Opposition Leader post unchanged till a Parliament Select Committee ascertain the suitability of Rajapaksa to hold that position.
He also questioned as to whether it is correct to give the Opposition Leader post to a Member of Parliament belonging to the same party of the President, who is the Head of Government, Head of Executive and Head of Cabinet and currently holding three Cabinet portfolios.
Secondly, a question has arisen as to whether those who resigned from the SLFP have also ceased to be members of the UPFA. I am of the view that there are strangers in the House today and they must be asked to vacate the Chamber he added.
The above issues must be sorted out as they matter to determine the composition of Parliament. We hope to make these submissions to the Speaker in writing.This is a matter of principles. It is not because any individual wants to hang on to any position.We dont want the Constitution be violated again, he noted.
UNP MPs Ajith P. Perera and Rauff Hakeem supported Sumanthirans proposal to appoint a PSC. Hakeem also asked to summon the Election Commission members before that committee and inquire on the UPFA Constitution, which is lodged at the Commission, to clear the matters before the House.
Only when a member is expelled from a party that he can go to Court, otherwise he ceases to be a member of the party once that member obtained the membership of another party and ipso facto (by the fact itself) his parliamentary seat also ceases, Hakeem contended.
UPFA MPs Susil Premajayantha, Udaya Gammanpila, Chamdima Weerakkody and Dinesh Gunawardena argued in support of appointing former President Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader. MP Gammanpila pointed out that there had been three previous instances where the Opposition Leader was appointed from the same party of the President. In 1994, Gamini Dissanayake was the Opposition Leader when D B Wijetunga was the President. In 2001, Rathnasiri Wickramanayake was the Opposition Leader when Chandrika Bandaranaike was the President, and most recently Nimal Siripala de Silva was the Opposition Leader while Maithripala Sirisena was the President, he remarked.
MP Kiriella replied that former President Chandrika Bandaranaike did not hold any Cabinet portfolios in 2001.
UPFA MP Premajantha pointed out that no member has been elected to Parliament from the SLFP ticket. There is no SLFP representation, but UPFA representation.The UPFA is the largest party in the Opposition.Therefore there is no hindrance for the UPFA to get the Opposition Leaders post, he argued.
UPFA MPs Duminda Dissanayake, Faiszer Musthapha and Dr. Sarath Amunugama were notable absentees in Parliament yesterday.

UPFA MP Mahinda Rajapaksa had been appointed as the Opposition Leader replacing Tamil National Alliance Leader R Sampanthan a while ago.Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has informed the Parliament that,The United National Front MP Lakshman Kiriella to the post of Leader of the House while MP Gayantha Karunathilaka was appointed the Chief Government Whip.UPFA General Secretary MP Mahinda Amaraweera was appointed as the Chief Opposition Whip replacing JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake.

A handful of sand
Sand art means moulding the sand in different forms to make sand sculptures. The material used for sand sculptures is only sand and water. Among the different varieties of sand art forms, the sand sculptural art form is considered the most popular, and its history dates back to the prehistoric era of human civilization. It is said that Egyptians created some sand sculptures and later an Indian artist produced a sand sculpture in the 14th century, but it is regarded as one of the excellent art creations of the word.
Sand painting is also considered as another form of sand art. When compared to the sand sculptural art form, sand painting has not gained much popularity in the world.
Carving sculptures
The sand sculptural art form has gained more popularity among the masses all over the world. Presently, the sand sculpturing competitions are taking place all over the world. Actually, carving sculptures with the sand are felt like one of the most difficult carving art forms of the world. Yet it is said carving on sand is quite easier than carving on the solid crude variety of stones. For sand sculptures, only plain and clean sand is used with the correct quantity of water for moulding this attractive art form. Yet it is considered that the type and nature of the sand selected for carving and moulding play a vital role in this art form.
All types of sand are not suitable for sand art moulding. It is one of the most attractive creativity art forms which gained much popularity in the art world in the recent past. It is said that one can easily pick up the techniques of carving in the sand if one has a clear-cut idea about the art. As compared to other types of sculptures, this type of sculptures could be destroyed easily. The lasting nature of the sculptures is less as compared to stone, metal and wooden sculptures. Further, it is said that nowadays this art is promoted in certain countries at a national level for tourist attraction. In Puri India, this art originated and developed and later it spread to other parts of the country.
To create sculptures you need a huge amount of sand. As a result, it is practised in the coastal areas. It is said that sand artists did not earn much out of their creative art form, but today many of the top-level sand artists earn their livelihood during tourist seasons. They exhibit their sand sculptures in the open air. A huge landscape is needed to exhibit their exceptional skills.
Record-breaking achievements
Annual competitions are held all over the world at a national and international level. Some of the record-breaking achievements are noted and recorded in the Guinness World Records.
Most of the sand sculptural artists come from numerous other professional disciplines. Practically, sand sculptural artists do not treat this as a permanent profession. However, in recent times some countries have established beautiful sand sculptural museums. Such attempts might provide a permanent position to some of the creative artists. Even some of the universities have recognized the value of this art form in their visual art faculties.
The International Sand Sculptural Festival takes place annually since 2003 in Portugal. More than 60 artists participate in the festival and nearly 15,000 square metres are allocated for it. More or less 35,000 tons of sand is used for the art festival.

Immense market potential for cut flowers
The market potential for cut flowers is excellent both in Sri Lanka and abroad, but to tap this market, Sri Lanka needs to step up production.
Despite the fact that Anthurium is known as an excellent floriculture crop for commercial projects in Sri Lanka due to its tropical climate, at present, the growers are not able to meet even the local demand.
For an amateur, cultivation of Anthurium could be done with an initial investment of Rs. 9,000. From a few square yards, one can expand the project to have 1,000 plants in 5.8 perch. The starter program will cost Rs 9,000, for 20 plants and material. The starter program will yield a return between Rs.15, 000-Rs.18, 000 per month and the demand is ever increasing, said Mahima Group of Companies Chairperson Yamika Gunawardena.
Mahima Group, which commenced operations in Sri Lanka in 2000, has come a long way since its inception in Sri Lanka whilst creating close to 100 direct and 100,000 indirect employment opportunities for Sri Lankans across the country.
In addition, Mahima Group has currently propagated over 100 types of Anthuriums. Furthermore, the company currently exports cut flowers mainly to Middle East countries and is currently looking to export flowers to Netherlands and Japan in the near future.
In order to popularize the cultivation of Anthuriums among Sri Lankans, particularly to empower rural women, Mahima Group has currently undertaken various initiatives to lend a helping hand to those who are interested in cultivating Anthuriums as a business venture. To this end, training programs are also conducted by Mahima Group with recommendations for bank loans when growers reach a certain level of proficiency.
More importantly, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides loan facilities at a concessionary rate for those who are willing to cultivate Anthuriums as a business venture. Furthermore, advice, training and materials will be made available by the Mahima Group of Companies.
Anthurium flowers are among the best selling tropical flowers across the world mainly due to its heart- shaped flowers. But the shape of Anthurium flowers can be vary; they can be tulip shaped, ribbon shaped, cup shaped and so on, Gunawardena said.
Anthurium flowers are long-lasting, and plants will take around six months to throw shoots and about nine months to flower. Also some varieties have various colors that are pink, orange or white, purple, black and so on. Anthuriums are mainly grown in two districts. Yet, the supply falls far short of the demand.

JVP moves to abolish Presidency
JVP member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa moved a motion calling for the abolition of the Executive Presidency yesterday. The motion was debated yesterday and is to be taken up for debate in the House today as well.
Dr. Jayatissa moving the motion said the majority of people want the Executive Presidency abolished. People have understood the disadvantages of this position during the last 50 days, he added. It is our responsibility not to miss this opportunity. he said.
Jayatissa also said that it has taken 40 years for all to understand what Dr.N.M. Perera said when the Executive Presidency was introduced.
He said the late Dr. N.M. Perera questioned what would happen if this executive presidency falls into the hands of a mad man, and now after 40 years we understand what he said, Jayatissa told Parliament.
Dr.Jayatissa said people should be allowed to take a decision on the Executive Presidency at a referendum. He also pointed out the 1978 Constitution, which has undergone 19 amendments, have never been brought before the people.
Jayatissa also said that almost all post-1978 election manifestos promised to abolish the Executive Presidency.
Seconding the motion, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said that this is a good time to abolish the Executive Presidency. He also pointed out that the President at present is acting as if he had unlimited powers.
MP Herath also pointed out that there are two myths entertained by the citizens of the country with regards to the Executive Presidency. One of the myths, he said, is the assumption that the Executive Presidency defends the minority of the country. The second, Herath said, is the belief that Executive Presidency stops the country from being divided. Now, has the executive presidency protected the Tamil, Muslim and other minorities For over years it has been proved that the post does not. Which post destabilised the country in the last 50 days It was the executive presidency. Some opportunist politicians have misled our Maha Sangha about this Executive Presidency as well. We kindly urge our Maha Sangha not to be misled by such opportunists.
MP Herath continued.
Herath also pointed out that the country needs to strengthen national unity and ensure equality for all communities. We should strengthen democracy and with centering power on an individual shall not take us there, Herath added.
Herath said that examples are available from J.R. Jayewardene to R. Premadasa, Chandrika Bandaranaike, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena that the Executive Presidency has failed the people.
The JVP presented to Parliament a bill titled 20th Amendment to the Constitution to abolish the executive presidency last September.

Soon after completing my London O/Ls I decided to join IDM College of Legal Studies to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer. I chose IDM college of legal studies because after considering other equivalent institutes, for me personally this institution stood out from the rest. Ive been studying here as a full-time student under the 2nd year of LLB (Hons) Degree programme and I can honestly say that it has always been up to the expectations and more.
The lecturers are very friendly and well qualified industry specialists. Everything is taught in a way that keeps us engaged and active and they also give their best individual attention to everyone and never makes anyone feel left out.
They organise many events and activities to help us interact and introduce us to people from different fields to give us a better overall learning experience.
The environment is very tidy and has all the required facilities. Based on my personal experience the main reason I absolutely love and adore IDM college of legal studies is because they always put the students first and never fail to live up our expectations.

Lahiru Kumara fined for use  of an audible obscenity
Lahiru Kumara has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee and has also received one demerit point after being found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel during the third days play in the first Test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on Monday.
The Sri Lanka bowler was found to have violated Article 2.3 of the code, which relates to use of an audible obscenity during an international match.
Kumara used an audible obscenity after an outside edge off Tom Lathams bat in the 96th over went for a boundary. These comments were heard by the on-field umpires and also picked by the stump mic.
After the days play, Kumara admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Richie Richardson of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Rod Tucker and Michael Gough, third umpire Richard Illingworth, all from the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Umpires, as well as fourth umpire Tim Brown.
Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

## Title: Last secret of the 1971 India-Pakistan War
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Last secret of the 1971 India-Pakistan War
Does Pakistan continue to detain POWs from the war The families think so.
In the weak December sunlight, the Indian Air Force Hawker Hunter began a second run to strike the heavily defended radar complex set atop the Sakesar Mountain in West Pakistan. Its pilot, Flight Lieutenant Gurdev Singh Rai, knew the terrain well. He had conducted the same bombing run the previous day, dodging the wall of anti-aircraft fire that rose like a curtain from the Pakistani ground forces deployed to protect the base.
The 1971 war was only two days old and Rai was part of the enormous air offensive that would decimate its Pakistan Air Force opponents and cripple Pakistans navy. That would allow Indian forces in the east of the country to strike deep into East Pakistan and force the capitulation of its forces, resulting in the creation of the new state of Bangladesh.
Unfortunately, Flight Lieutenants Rais short war was over. The hail of anti-aircraft fire from the ground batteries fatally wounded his aircraft. Rai crashed, and he was declared missing in action by his squadron later that day.
Two days later and 4,000 miles away, his younger sister Rajwant Kaur was sitting anxiously in the front room of her modest home in North London. She was watching the BBCs evening news coverage of the war and alongside her was her husband and their landlord.
Suddenly she bolted from her chair and went to the television pointing at the screen. There, she said excitedly. Thank goodness, there is Gurdev. There on the grainy screen was her brother, dirty and battered but safe, standing in a line of prisoners of war (POWs) guarded by Pakistani troops. Relief washed over her. He would be safe now; however the war went he would come home.
International law
But Gurdev Rai never did come home. Rajwant waited days, then weeks, months, years, and finally decades for news, but she has never seen him or had official news of him since that grainy television picture.
How could this be Gurdev was a POW and protected by international law. In theory when the conflict ended just a few days later with a decisive Indian victory, completed lists of prisoners should have been exchanged via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). As POWs they would have been entitled to mail and fair treatment, and should have been repatriated as soon as possible under internationally monitored arrangements. The 90,000 Pakistani POWs were rapidly returned but the unknown fate of Flight Lieutenant Rai is not an isolated case. When Pakistan produced its list of 635 POWs, 51 suspected Indian POWs from 1971 were not accounted for  leaving their families grieving confused and over time to a large extent forgotten. The earlier conflict between the two countries in 1965 had left three other personnel still unaccounted for, bringing the total missing to 54 men who served in all branches of the Indian Armed Services.
Suspicion that the men may still be alive and held captive by Pakistan continues. Over the years, reports of sightings of the men have emerged. Dr R.S. Suri, father of Major Ashok Suri, at first believed the army when they declared Major Suri as Killed in action in the 1971 war. Then in early December 1974 he received a smuggled note apparently from his son saying that he was well. The note had been carried by a released prisoner in Pakistan who claimed Major Suri was still being held in jail. To raise hope further, a second note from Major Suri arrived and was declared sufficiently authentic by the Indian Defence Ministry to have the officers official status changed from killed in action to missing in action.
Various other sightings of the missing men have taken place.
Major A.K. Ghosh was caught on camera by a Time newspaper reporter in late December 1971. A Pakistan radio broadcast in early December 1971 reported that Flight Lieutenant L.M. Sasoon, shot down while on a bombing mission, had survived the wreckage of his Canberra aircraft and was in captivity. The young wife of Flight Lieutenant Ashok Balwant Dhavale received his wallet, which included her photograph, and his scarf intact, but despite these personal belongings there was no apparent sign of his body near his wrecked aircraft.
Wing Commander Hersern Singh Gill was by reports befriended by two imprisoned Pakistani officers jailed in Attock military prison in 1973-1974 for their role in plotting a military coup. Other reports suggest that up to 40 unaccounted for Indian prisoners were held in Attock Jail at that time.
A Sikh prisoner repatriated to India reported a meeting in 1983 with a Captain Kamal Bakshi, whom he had met while serving time in Multan Jail. Captain Bakshis sister is British and still lives in London.
Indian POWs
As late as 2003, a Canadian human rights representative visiting Lahore Jail was called out to by prisoners claiming to be held from the 1971 conflict but was denied contact with them by his minders. Even more recently, in 2012, an Indian carpenter working in Oman reported he had been approached by a fellow Sikh who claimed to be Sepoy Jaspal Singh and said that he and four other Indian POWs had been held in Oman since 1975, in what would be one of the earliest cases of rendition.
Pakistan has always denied any knowledge of the men. In 1982, Zia-ul-Haq, the military dictator of Pakistan, visited India. In a surprise move, he agreed to allow some of the families to have consular access to prisons where it was suspected the majority of the 54 POWs were being held. Six of the families travelled to Pakistan, although the heavily controlled visit yielded no sign of their loved ones nor clues as to where they might be.
As the years have passed, the families faith in their own governments actions in attempting to recover the men have been shaken. The Indian government seems unwilling to internationalize the issue.
In 2015 human rights lawyer Jas Uppal, who runs the U.K. charity Justice Upheld, petitioned the Indian Supreme Court wanting the matter raised with the International Court of Justice as a matter concerning international law. As a result of her petition, the Court received an affidavit from the Indian Ministry of Defence in which it declared that it had no details regarding 54 missing defense personnel believed to be held captive as prisoners of wars (POWs) in Pakistan jails after the 1965 and 1971 wars.
Uppal has had the question of the missing POWs raised in the U.K. Parliament, bringing the attention of the U.K. government to the fact that two of the missing POWs have sisters who are British citizens. However, the Foreign Office declined to become involved, referring to the matter as a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. Uppal does not consider that good enough.
Two of the kin of the Indian POWs are British nationals who urgently need the support of their government to ascertain the fate of their kin, she says. The British authorities have good diplomatic ties to both India and Pakistan therefore Britain is the best placed to mediate in this situation.
So far, her calls to elevate the case of the men has gone unheeded.
So, what happened to the missing 54 POWs There is much evidence that these men survived the combat phase of operations and Pakistan has a history (which continues today) of conducting extrajudicial detention. Its jails hold detainees who fall into special categories of prisoner, determined by the nations powerful security apparatus rather than the courts. Many believe that the fear of prosecution by the new nation of Bangladesh for war crimes committed by members of the former Pakistan military meant Indian POWs were held for use as bargaining chips against such prosecution. Over time the prisoners became an embarrassment  possibly to both sides  as the turbulent diplomatic relationship between the two countries never produced the right time to reveal their existence.- The Diplomat

Assessing Economic Development:
LEVERAGE OF FOREIGN TRADE
The countrys performance on the global value chain is assessed through the volume and nature of transactions on the BOP. All receipts and payments on transactions with foreign countries are compiled in the BOP. Foreign currencies underlying those transactions are traded in the foreign exchange market against Rupees. The BOP could be a surplus or a deficit. The surplus increases the supply of foreign exchange in demand for Rupees. The deficit results in the opposite. Accordingly, key indicators reflecting the BOP to assess the leverage of foreign trade for the economys development are the current account balance, exchange rate and foreign reserve of the country
Last three articles in this series covered key macroeconomic indicators relating to national production, labour market and fiscal sector and what they reflect on economic development of the country since 1950s. This article outlines key indicators relating to the foreign sector of the economy.
In modern globalized world, no country can escape from foreign transactions and governs the economy. Trade in goods, services and capital/investments is the foreign sector which has been existent from ancient times in different modes, volumes and magnitudes. Foreign trade facilitates countries to import resources, produce, generate employment and export for more income.
Old economics believed countries to be endowed with natural resources to produce and export. However, new technology and global financial system facilitate countries to produce and export beyond their resource base through imports and invention of resources that were never thought of. Therefore, countries which can improve the competitiveness/comparative advantages can achieve economic development from the globalization that provides the global value chain for countries to produce and trade. Real world experiences in development of countries through the global value chain are abundant.
The economic ideology and policy before 1977 in Sri Lanka were the closure of the economy to foreign countries through control of imports and foreign exchange and import substitution. In contrast, since 1978, the economic policy has been the trade liberalization in different magnitudes to tap the global value chain. There is no dispute over economic opportunities and improved living standards that the country enjoys from new policy initiatives although Sri Lanka is way behind the most of peer countries.
International Balance of Payments (BOP)
The countrys performance on the global value chain is assessed through the volume and nature of transactions on the BOP. All receipts and payments on transactions with foreign countries are compiled in the BOP. Foreign currencies underlying those transactions are traded in the foreign exchange market against Rupees. The BOP could be a surplus or a deficit. The surplus increases the supply of foreign exchange in demand for Rupees. The deficit results in the opposite. Accordingly, key indicators reflecting the BOP to assess the leverage of foreign trade for the economys development are the current account balance, exchange rate and foreign reserve of the country.
BOP Current Account Balance
The sum of net positions in trade of goods and services, factor income and remittances is the current account balance. Factor income comprises wages, interest and profit/dividend involved in utilization of cross-border labour, land and capital. Remittances are the cross-border grants.
In old economics, trade balance, i.e., exports less imports of goods, is considered as the core that reflects the strength of production and competitiveness of the country. In modern economics, all goods, services and factor income are equally important for development. For example, tourism, IT services, financial and professional services and migrant labour are good sources of generation of foreign income. A country dependent on foreign capital has to pay interest and dividend in return for their contribution to local economy.
The current account deficit means that the country imports foreign resources in goods and services for its production activities more than it exports. Any deficit has to be financed by inflow of foreign capital (borrowing and direct investments). Countries like the US can run deficits by paying out from own currencies such as US dollar being global reserve currencies. Therefore, such countries have to run deficits to enable other countries to earn reserve currencies to be used for international payments and reserves.
In contrast, a surplus in current account means real resources/foreign exchange earned from exporting resources and invested back in foreign countries, for example, China, Europe and East Asian Countries. Such investments confront various risks. Both high deficits and surpluses are the sources of macroeconomic risks emanating from foreign economic shocks to individual countries. Therefore, it is prudent to run a low rate of surplus or deficit in order to maintain a sustainable level of development of the economy.
Deficit is favourable at developing stage of a country to import foreign resources required for the development. However, if the country is unable to develop to earn a sustainable surplus within a decade or two, the deficit will be a structural problem that will end up in a foreign debt problem. As borrowing finances businesses, a country does not have to worry of current account deficits per se if it maintains the investor confidence with routine flow of foreign capital and competitiveness.
In macroeconomics, high and protracted current account deficits are attributed to high budget/fiscal deficits that have to be financed from import of foreign resources. Accordingly, economists recommend governments to cut-down fiscal deficits to fix the problem of current account deficits. The Monetary Board also has specific powers to implement monetary and exchange policies to promote the BOP in the national economic interest.
The level of current account is assessed as a percentage of GDP as it is one component in the domestic expenditure or the total value of domestic production (GDP).
Exchange Rate
Exchange rate is the price between two currencies, i.e., foreign currency and local currency. In Sri Lanka, US dollar (US$) is the major foreign currency used for international transactions and, therefore, exchange rate for US, Rs/US$ (Rs. Per US$), is reflective of the BOP outcome. In mostly liberalized countries, surplus or deficit in the BOP determines the exchange rate. The deficit is the excess of demand for foreign currency than its supply and appreciates or raises the value of the foreign currency (local currency depreciates). The surplus causes the opposite.
In macroeconomics of globalization, the exchange rate shows the international economic competitiveness of countries. The local currency appreciation is an indication of the economic strength and competitiveness of a country in global trade that generates surpluses in the BOP. In countries like Sri Lanka, the local currency always tends to depreciate as the current account is a big deficit. Therefore, foreign capital inflow is necessary to keep the currency stable in value. Foreign capital (such as investments in government securities and stocks) being mostly short-term and volatile is the major source of exchange rate fluctuations as well.
Many countries use policy interventions to keep the local currency low-valued/depreciated in order to encourage exports and foreign receipts as it raises the amount of local currency on receipts of foreign currency. Even China being the country with worlds largest foreign reserve of nearly US$ 3.1 trillion attempts this policy, despite the protest of the US and Europe which run trade deficits with China. However, such exchange rate policies alone do not support the development and competitiveness unless the macroeconomic policy framework is supportive for improvement in international competitiveness of the country.
Academic economists use calculations of effective exchange rate indices (nominal and real) to assess the country-competitiveness. However, these indices have limited use due to problems involved in underlying statistics and calculations and, therefore, no policymakers take economic policies based on interpretations of these indices.
The Monetary Board is responsible for maintaining the exchange rates of Rupees consistent with the underlying trends in the country to assure free use of Rupees for current international transactions.
Foreign Reserve
Foreign reserve is the official foreign reserve held by central banks as a cushion to protect the currency and to finance BOP deficits. The reserve is built from purchase of foreign exchange from the market as and when the BOP runs surpluses. Therefore, the foreign reserve of competitive and growing economies should increase over the period, for example, China and East Asian Countries.
Almost all countries use their foreign reserves to intervene in or control the exchange rate in order to avoid unhealthy fluctuations. For this purpose, central banks buy foreign exchange from the market to avoid unhealthy currency appreciation while sell foreign exchange out of reserve to minimize currency depreciation. Such intervention is a price control system based on a buffer at a cost. However, since the foreign reserve of many countries is limited due to current account deficits, currency protection requires reserve buffers maintained on regular foreign borrowings.
In general, the strength of the foreign reserves is measured by the number of months of imports if financed by only use of the reserve. This is an old trade-based indicator used during controlled economies. Nowadays, foreign reserves are required to cushion against short-term capital outflows and current account deficits. This is intended to prevent default on foreign payments and to protect the stability of the currency/exchange rate. Therefore, the adequacy of reserves relative to current account deficit plus short-term foreign capital liabilities is the most appropriate measure. Accordingly, the foreign reserve should be held in safest foreign assets as the reserve is not meant for risk-taking trades/dealings or portfolio management to seek profit.
The Monetary Board is responsible for holding a foreign reserve adequate to meet any foreseeable deficits in the BOP. For this purpose, it can adopt monetary, banking and exchange policies to enable it to purchase more foreign exchange from the market.
Economic Story from Numbers
Official numbers of all three indicators show poor competitiveness in international trade and high vulnerability of the country to foreign sector and debt. However, there is no dispute over the expansion of economic activities, employment and living standards due to liberalized foreign trade and investments.
l Current Account
The current account has mostly been a deficit which has considerably increased after 2005. With the commencement of trade liberalization in 1977/78, current account deficit increased to over 10% of GDP in early 1980s due to imports and fast-tracked development projects. Although the deficit declined to around 2%-4% of GDP in later decades, the countrys growth and BOP have not improved due to poor international competitiveness.
* Exchange Rate
Exchange rate was under a price control system up to the end of 1977. Although it was allowed to be largely determined in the market since 1978, the Central Bank (CB) has been aggressively intervening in the exchange rate through various monetary and exchange regulations and buying and selling of foreign exchange. Therefore, exchange rate does not reflect the performance or competitiveness of the economy. Even with the CB intervention, Rupee has been highly volatile with annual depreciation in the range of 2% and 15% after 1978 and around 17% this year alone.
* Foreign Reserve
Foreign reserve has been at around 3-5 months of imports of goods whereas imports have been 2-8 times greater the foreign reserve. However, the reserve has been 2-5 times greater than the current account deficit that shows a comfortable level to finance deficits. There is no consistent series of information to assess the reserve adequacy to finance short-term foreign capital liabilities (in addition to current account deficit).
Foreign reserve is maintained through capital inflow, primarily short-term foreign borrowing of the government and the CB, as current account has been mostly a deficit. Since 1950, total BOP during the past 67 years is a surplus around US$ 7 bn through capital inflow which has helped accumulation of a foreign reserve of around US$ US$ 8 bn (with valuation effects) as at end of 2017. New official foreign borrowings are raised to repay such foreign capital as the economy/private sector is unable to generate a BOP surplus.
As both current account and capital flows are highly volatile, foreign reserve also is highly volatile. The major threat to the reserve is the capital outflow/repayment as the reserve is built from such capital. Therefore, the current level and quality of the foreign reserve shows considerable vulnerabilities of the economy. In this background, if the CB agitates not to use the reserve during times of high capital outflows, it calls for the country to default on foreign payments. This is a gross violation of the CBs public duties.
Policy Framework
In the present globalized world, no economics argues for an economy to develop and live within its domestic resources if its population wishes to live at globally comparable living standards. There is no dispute that many countries and billions of people have come out of the poverty through global value chain that has provided immense opportunities to countries for their development. Further, there is no dispute that Sri Lanka is far behind its peer countries in development through the global value chain.
Therefore, it will be good economic democracy if those who seek public votes to govern the country propose a framework of fiscal, monetary and exchange policies to improve the countrys competitiveness in international business with time-based targets on economic growth, current account, foreign reserve and exchange rate during next 5-10 years. Travels by policymakers around the world to see developed/developing countries and to invite multinational investors will not have done any good. Otherwise, the countrys future generation will not have any hope for living on motherland.

Mathews does a Misbah and scorns at coach, ex-chief selector
Angelo Mathews had a sore point to prove after he was unceremoniously dropped from the Sri Lanka ODI squad for the five-match series against England in November and he displayed it in no uncertain manner soon after reaching his ninth Test hundred on the fourth day of the first cricket Test against New Zealand at Basin Reserve, Wellington yesterday.
Soon after Sri Lankas disastrous Asia Cup campaign where they lost both matches to Bangladesh and Afghanistan and was knocked out of the tournament in the first round, the selection committee headed by Graeme Labrooy that also comprised the head coach Chandika Hathurusingha as one of the selectors made Mathews the sacrificial lamb for the poor team performance and not only removed him from the ODI and T20I captaincy but also dropped him from the ODI and T20I teams against England on the grounds of fitness and accusing him of being a poor runner between the wickets.
Mathews challenged the decision by demanding a fitness test from the cricket authorities but it was denied to him.
Being a senior member of the team it was a bitter pill to swallow and Mathews took this rough blow on the chin and waited for the opportune moment to prove his point.
Yesterday at the Basin Reserve with Sri Lanka fighting to save the first Test against New Zealand, he came up with a spirited batting performance in the second innings with a century.
What followed soon after he had completed his hundred was eventful. Mathews removed his helmet and then got down to the business of doing several push-ups and then flexed his biceps at the dressing room to prove a point just how fit he is. Indeed the innings was not only about fitness but one of mental strength as well. Mathews and Kusal Mendis battled throughout the fourth day in a wonderful double century partnership denying the Black Caps of any success for the entire day and has given their team a chance to bail out of jail in the first Test.
Mathews reaction is reminiscent of former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq who at the age of 42 hit a hundred in his first Test at Lords in 2016 and having being under pressure to quit was so pumped up that he took off his helmet, went towards the visitors balcony, saluted the dressing room and did as many as ten pushups to celebrate his tenth Test ton for Pakistan.
Cricket is a game full of characters, thats what makes it so fascinating.

Mathews,  Mendis special  show
Wellington, Tuesday: Angelo Mathews celebrated with push-ups on the pitch after joining Kusal Mendis in passing 100 Tuesday as Sri Lanka batted the whole day without losing a wicket to give themselves hope of an unlikely first Test draw in Wellington.
Mendis was 116 not out at stumps on day four and Mathews 117, with their record-breaking unbroken 246-run partnership setting a Sri Lankan record against New Zealand.
It was also the first time in New Zealand that a full days play has been completed without a Test wicket falling and the first time anywhere since South Africa achieved the feat against Bangladesh in Chittagong in 2008.
The pairs epic vigil meant the tourists ended the day at 259 for three after starting in a seemingly hopeless position with three wickets down for just 20 in their second innings after conceding a first-innings deficit of 296 to New Zealand.
Sri Lanka still need a further 37 to avoid an innings defeat but with a flat pitch offering nothing to New Zealands seam attack and rain threatening on the final day, a draw is now a real prospect.
Even tough its a belter of a wicket, the concentration and commitment they had was unbelievable, bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake said.
We couldnt have asked for anything more.
New Zealand had hoped to wrap up the match early on the fourth day after posting an imposing 578 in the first innings, anchored by Tom Lathams unbeaten 264 -- which eclipsed former England captain Alastair Cooks 244 as the highest score by an opener carrying their bat in Test history.
But the home bowlers grew increasingly frustrated by the stubborn rearguard action, resorting to a barrage of bouncers that failed to rattle the batsmen.
Spinner Ajaz Patel said the Black Caps had not played poorly and were still upbeat about claiming victory on the final day.
The positive thing for us is that we are the only team in a position to win the game. Thats great position for us to be in, he said.
Mathews sent the New Zealanders a defiant message with his push-up celebration late in the final session that he still has plenty in the tank and is ready to bat on.
Mendis, who made only two in the first innings, was also pumped up, saying he would bat for another entire day if his team required it.
The 23-year-old initially took a positive approach and went after short-ball specialist Neil Wagner.
He blasted four boundaries off Wagner in an entertaining period that saw the paceman concede 35 runs in four overs before captain Kane Williamson ended his spell.
After the brief flourish with the bat, Mendis was content to put up the shutters and slow the scoring to a crawl.
The plan was to bat out a lot of balls, rather than focus on run-scoring, he said through an interpreter.
Mathews, 31, who top-scored for Sri Lanka with 83 in the first innings, eked out his ninth Test century off 248 balls, while Mendis brought up his sixth Test ton off 215 deliveries.
The partnership will be a huge boost for Sri Lanka, who are ranked sixth in the world and have won only one Test in Wellington in five attempts. They have also lost their last five Tests against New Zealand and suffered a 3-0 Test series whitewash against England last month. AFP

Mumbai hospital blaze: 8 dead
INDIA: The overnight toll in a Mumbai government hospital blaze rose to eight with two more victims succumbing to their injuries, said a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Disaster Control official here on Tuesday.
Of the 176 rescued injured, at least another 25 admitted to various hospitals remain critical from the devastating fire broke out in the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital in MIDC, Andheri East on Monday evening.
While 142 continue their treatment in over half a dozen public and private hospitals, 26 have been discharged so far, said the official.
Of the eight fatalities, a majority died due to suffocation, and at least one panicked and jumped from the third floor to his death.
The death toll in Mumbais hospital fire shot up to eight, while another 147, mostly patients and staff, were rescued from a massive blaze that engulfed the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital in Andheri (East) here on Monday, BMC Disaster Control said.
The number of fatalities is likely to increase further as several injured persons have been admitted to various hospitals in serious condition even as the firemen battled the conflagration to bring it under control after three hours.
The fire, caused by a suspected short-circuit, was first noticed in the upper floors of the five-storeyed building with a glass facade in the MIDC area  the industrial hub in the north-western suburb  around 4.15 pm.
At least 12 fire tenders, 15 water tankers and other specialised equipment were rushed to battle the blaze and those trapped were taken out via ladders from the third and fourth floors as the flames quickly spread horizontally and vertically.

No wish to heap taxes on people  Colombo Mayor
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) does not have any intention of increasing the revenue of the CMC by increasing the burden on the public, CMC Mayor Rosy Senanayake said.
The Mayor made this statement while delivering the Budget speech at the CMC yesterday.
The Budget for 2019 was presented by the Mayor seeking approval from members to spend Rs. 16,983,730,000 in developing the city, while forecasting a revenue estimate of Rs. 16,984,327,000.
According to the Mayor, one of the main challenges faced by the Council is the collection of rates in arrears. We plan to lay down a mechanism to collect these arrears in a fair manner through compromise and negotiation, she said.
The Mayor said the Budget for 2019 targets an additional revenue generation of Rs. 1,303 million compared to 2018, while the expenditure has also increased by a similar proportion.
She said the Budget 2019 should be a key driver to create a political and social environment of co-existence, irrespective of party politics, race, religion and caste, which will pave way for the environment to be developed and maintained so as to create a green environment.
Though the Budget is a statutory requirement which shall be fulfilled under the Section 211 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, it is more appropriate to introduce it as the future vision and the management plan of the CMC for 2019, she said.
She said the preparation of the Budget of the CMC is an exercise which is both of national and international importance since the development of Colombo city can be applied as a criterion for determining the development of the whole county, and it can be applied as an index through which favourable attitudes regarding Sri Lanka are showcased before the global community.
The Mayor said she plans to provide iPads for the members as a special computer app has been introduced for the purpose of obtaining documents and minutes relevant to the meetings of the Council.
According to the Mayor, Korea has agreed to finance the computerisation of the system of rates and taxes in the CMC utilising the information of the present GIS, for the furtherance of transparency.
It has become necessary to strengthen the five major categories of taxes including Assessment Tax, Stamp Duty, Trade Tax, Trade Licences and Entertainment Tax which represent the bulk of the annual revenue of the CMC.

Changes to Constitution could not be decided on a whim: Hakeem
Changes to the Constitution could not be decided on the whims and fancies of individual political leaders, SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem said.
Participating in the Adjournment debate moved by the JVP on abolishing the Executive Presidency, the SLMC Leader pointed out that the three leaders, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are looking at their own political future.
The Constitution is not a property of any of them. It is a sacred document upon which this entire countrys governance is conducted on. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa wishes to abolish the Executive Presidency because he is unable to contest once again for that position, which is an issue to him. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe is a leader who does not believe in emotional sentimental propaganda or irrational campaigns to mislead the masses. He feels that he is a political leader who appeals to the intelligentsia of the country. Therefore, he himself did not contest the last two Presidential Elections and let others contest. He has an interest in restoring Parliamentary democracy so that he could get himself re-elected to Parliament and control executive powers through Parliament. President Sirisena, having promised the country to abolish the Executive Presidency, now wants to try and contest for a second term. This was despite his promise that he would not seek re-election, Hakeem remarked. The SLMC Leader, advocating for comprehensive reforms to the Constitution, said that they have come to some understanding with the TNA to put forth the draft new Constitution to Parliament by February, to attempt to see whether it could be endorsed with a two thirds majority in the House.
Commenting on President Sirisenas actions during the last 50 days, Hakeem said those could be best explained with the Sinhala idiom Natapu netumakuth ne, bere paluwakuth ne. He also pointed out that the ill-advice of some MPs had pushed former President Rajapaksa into a serious political debacle.
The man who was riding the high wave of popularity, has compromised his popularity unnecessarily, trying to grab power through the backdoor to satisfy a few of his fellow MPs who had misled him. That is his fate. I hope he will see some saner counsel soon, he added.
Sumanthiran on abolition of Executive Presidency
Speaking on the Adjournment Motion to abolish the Executive Presidency, TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran said that the abolition of the Executive Presidency should be brought in as an integral part of the new Constitution.
This issue of the abolition of the Executive Presidency has been there for quite sometime. It has not just been there but it does had the endorsement of our people at every Presidential election and so the mandate of the people to abolish the Executive Presidency has been with us for quite sometime, Sumanthiran said.
In fact when the Presidential election was held in 2015, we thought the Executive Presidency as a system of government will be abolished very soon. But, unfortunately through the 19th Amendment we were able to do only part of what we wanted to do. If one remembers the day the 19th amendment was passed, repeatedly this House was assured that through a new Constitution whatever that could not be accomplished with the 19th Amendment would be addressed. The abolition of the Executive Presidency is one important fact, he pointed out.
This has dragged on for some time. We have in the Interim Report concerning the new Constitution pointed out that the Executive Presidency be abolished. In arriving at the Interim Report, in the Committee discussions all parties agreed for the abolition, Sumanthiran said.
However, subsequently some of the political parties made certain reservations with regards to the abolition of the Executive Presidency. The very recent incidents that have come to take place, these parties have also reconsider their decisions. We should now without any further delay abolish the Executive Presidency, he continued. The new Constitution must also be drafted as promised to the people and as an integral part of that should be the abolition of the Executive Presidency, Sumanthiran pointed out.
While the process to enact a new Constitution was delayed, we saw some other incidents over taking us.
The acts of the President himself are an important part of that. We are here today after almost two months of the Constitutional crisis that was triggered by the Executive President who purported to exercise powers which he did not have. Perhaps labouring under misconceptions or wrong advice,he purported to remove the sitting PM and appointed a new one which was clearly against the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Sumanthiran said.
UNP calls on MPs to support abolishing of Executive Presidency
The UNP yesterday, called upon all Members of Parliament to extend their support to abolish the Executive Presidency.
UNP MP Malik Samarawickrama taking the floor in Parliament during the Adjournment debate in support of abolishing the Executive Presidency, pointed out that the events of the last 51 days in the country showed that the concentration of power in one office is a recipe for disaster.
The debate on the Adjournment motion moved by the JVP would also be continued today.
Abolishing the Executive Presidency was a cornerstone of the Yahapalana Governments plan, guided by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and it is now time to re-commit to that goal. After having witnessed the ill-effects of the system of Executive Presidency, we are unable turn a build eye to it. We have to act now, he urged.
We need to double up and commit to abolish the Executive Presidency. We commenced on this path through the 19th Amendment and during the last 51 days one could see how vital this Amendment was. Now it is time to complete the job. We should not let go of this renewed opportunity, this renewed rationale. I call upon all members of the House to vote for this motion and campaign when a referendum is brought in, he added.
MP Samarawickrama also pointed out that the Executive Presidency did not lead to a stronger State, a more stable Government or strengthen the Unitary Status of the country, as often claimed by those who argue in favour of the Executive Presidency.
The Executive President must go. An argument that had been put forward for a while, is that a strong State required a strong Executive President. But look at the last 51 days.
What kept this State strong was only the strong Legislature, Speaker and a strong and independent judiciary.
In fact, actions of the President weakened our State economically and in the International Community.
We need to bust some myths today. We must bring in primacy to this Parliament, the elected representatives of the people from all corners, ethni cities and religions of our country, he noted.

Katina Maha Pinkama of Keysborough Dhamma Sarana Temple, Melbourne, Australia
In the path to spiritual wisdom
Among many countries, Australia stands prominent noted for good governance, working for the betterment of the multicultural society recognising their religious interests. Over the years Buddhism has taken root firmly as a sacred doctrine flourishing today preserving the Buddhist cultural heritage where temples play a vital role. What a dream come true to have witnessed the Katina Maha Pinkama of Keysborough Dhamma Sarana temple in Melbourne on 11th November 2018. Sri Lankans should have been proud to see a serene gracious ceremony of such magnitude taking place in an alien country. As the name suggests this magnificent seat of sacred value owes its name to the tranquil location and the great service it performs.
Enjoying a picturesque backdrop with a brilliant blend of all features and all requisites of a temple, a solidly constructed cone-shaped top helps to identify it from afar. This is a perfect religious venue reflecting the proud culture and tradition inspired by Buddhist ideals enjoyed by many a Buddhist in Melbourne. Here they seek the blessings of the Triple Gem in all activities of life. The recent Katina ceremony held was quite a successful mission, the reasons for which are many.
Model Buddhist Centre
The honour of preserving it to date should be attributed to the vision, foresight and religious enthusiasm of Ven.NaotunneVijithaThero, the Chief Adhikarana Sangha Nayaka of Australia who performs an endless service to the spiritual progress of the Buddhist community along with the other learned resident bhikkhus. Under his guidance this has become a model Buddhist Centre providing writing opportunities giving meaning to their skills and talents in the religious sphere.
There are young bhikkhus engaged in writing dhamma books. To name a few, they are Ven.AthurugiriyePiyaratana and EmbuldeniyePagnasara. A distinctive feature of the Katina ceremony was the novel idea of publishing a book to mark the occasion, taking into consideration the younger generation, their knowledge of the language and religion. This was fulfilled by the above mentioned scholarly bhikkhu, Venerable Piyaratana Thera. The inspirational message conveyed by his compilation, Great Amity was a dhamma dana, a very important milestone of the event.
Dayaka Sabha
Then there is the Dayaka Sabha deserving special mention, giving much support and strength to all activities of the temple. They were totally committed to the task devoting their time and energy giving of their best. Working as a team was the key to their success. The preparation for the sacred event had taken place long before the date. The chain of activities prior to the traditional Katina Pooja was carried out in perfect order giving a very good message to the Buddhists around. The entire premises was gaily decorated with Buddhist flags and illuminations. There were thousands of mini bulbs in and around the temple building adding to its glamour. The elaborate programme included Katina Maha Perahera, almsgiving and dhammanusasana to invoke the blessings on the devotees at large.
Perahara
The most admirable arousing festive spirit in relevance to the sacred ceremony was the Perahera conducted on a grand scale. It was great to see the Buddhist devotees in full white attire to suit the occasion carrying flags, flowers and numerous decorative items, giving prominence to conventional and traditional culture. Gorgeously dressed drummers, trumpeters and dancers added glory to the event. The dancing items presented by the children were the most eye-catching. The other paraphernalia of the procession included many decorative scenes out of which the most venerated was the Katina Cheevara. The atmosphere was of genuine excitement. The grandeur and beauty of this unique cultural pageant are beyond expression. The organisers were amply rewarded in their efforts towards the success of this holy event.
Alms Giving
After the Perahera, they went right ahead with their plans for the almsgiving. They undertook the task with enthusiasm and will. There was a good turnout for the dana. Spacious dhamma shala was fully packed. It had been organised perfectly fine. An important and exciting attraction of the Katina ceremony was the participation of the laity in the stitching of the Katina robe, where there was a long queue waiting for the purpose prior to the almsgiving. It was performed with overflowing shraddha. Nearly fifteen members of the Sangha had been invited among whom there were reputed erudite bhikkus from Sri Lanka, including Ven KotapolaAmarakiththiThero. In their anusasana sermons, they emphasized the significance of this sacred event.
Nayaka Thera
Venerable Naotunne Vijitha Thera who is proficient in several languages, after his welcome speech mentioning the names of the bhikkhu invitees in his anusasana made mention of the names of forty families in the Katina group who played a dominant role in making the event a success. The Venerable Thera went to the extent of breaking rest till midnight the previous day, attending to the details of the ceremony.
After offering alms to the venerable Sangha, there was provision for the laity. Lunch had been organised seeing to the comfort of the devotees present, providing all the facilities. Katina Pooja came to a close with the Katinanusansa sermon held towards the evening. All these enhance the temples reputation as a stronghold of Buddhism in a foreign land.

President directs Mahaweli officials
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed Mahaweli authorities to step up an extended programme to promote auxiliary crop cultivation side by side with paddy cultivation in Mahaweli zones during the next Yala season.
He said auxiliary crop cultivation including chilli cultivation in the Mahaweli zones has been destroyed in the present day and such products have to be imported at a very high cost.
Therefore, the President has instructed officials to implement new agricultural programmes to empower Mahaweli areas to provide a vibrant contribution to the countrys national food production process.
The president instructed Mahaweli Authority officials at the Presidents Office yesterday at a ceremony held to present internal promotions.
He stated that cultivating food crops that could be cultivated internally thereby limiting imports can save foreign exchange which could be used for agriculture. It is very important to strengthen the countrys economy, the President said.
He also instructed the officials that the agricultural projects throughout the country should be implemented with a fresh inspiration and a new strength at a time where rains have begun after a drought that lasted for a long period.
They were also instructed to expedite the granting of the deeds for Mahaweli settlers. Providing a solution for a long-awaited issue with Mahaweli settlers, granting of the land deeds for all commenced in 2016 under the direction of the President. Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayaka and Mahaweli DG Dr. D.M.S. Dissanayake were present.

Quotes well quoted
Quite a number of sayings of the Buddha could be found in the great Pali work known to the world as Dhammapada. Apart from Dhammapada, the works in the Tripitaka named as Itivuttaka, Udana and a number of suttas has been written in the form of poetic visions from the original works into English. The Pali Text Society (PTS) has done a yeoman service to the world by translations of the three canons or Tripitaka as it is known in the Buddhist literary spiritual missions.
The creative artistes all over the world have gained inspiration and expression via these works. They include creative, reconstruction works such as Jataka stories as retold and Light of Asia by Edwin Arnold. The list of creative works is too long and quite a number of works have appeared in the form of the spiritual and religious treasury. One such work is titled as Buddhas Little Instruction Book as written by the English Buddhist scholar Jack Kornfield. The name Kornfield is remembered as a scholar who had come all the way from England to countries such as Vietnam, China, Thailand, Burma, India and Sri Lanka.
Forest monasteries
Having cultivated the intimacies with Theravada sect of Buddhist monasteries, Kornfield had the chance of studying Buddhism under the tutelage of scholarly monks dwelling in forest monasteries, inclusive of the well-known abode in the UK known as Amaravati. The Little Instruction Book is now translated into Sinhala Nayana Shamali Rajapaksa giving a title that goes as Senasillata Budu Vadanak (A word of the Buddha for consolation).
The well-designed book contains 124 sayings of the Buddha culled from various texts by Kornfield. The Sinhala translation looks a bilingual work beneficial for the reader in order to gauge the extent to which the words of the Buddha stand as wisecracks and dictums suited for the world that is changing by way of the advent of new technology and globalization. The original writer, as well as the translator Rajapaksa, utilises a simple diction in their respective poetic expressions.
The work triggers off from a dictum that goes as: Live every act fully as if it were your last.
From here onwards the reader is taken to various subject areas in the very existence of mankind. They revolve around the aspect of birth, death, marriage, love, work, sharing, caring, kindness, non-violence, peace and coexistence. The second dictum goes as
Love in the past is only a memory
Love in the future is a fantasy
Only here and now
Can we truly love.
The expressions in the work are aimed to give more thought to simple experiences and mannerisms. One such expression goes as:
Most of the sorrows
Of the earth,
Humans cause
For themselves.
Worst enemy
The Buddha, in many an instance, pointed out that the worst enemy of a human being is oneself. The sense is heightened thus:
Our worst enemy cannot harm us
As much as our unwise thoughts,
No one can help us our unwise thoughts,
No one can help us as much as our own compassionate thoughts.
Understanding oneself has been a vision brought down the centuries of philosophies from Greece to the modern day. The Buddha declared the same on this varying form that goes as:
Do not blindly believe
What others say,
Even the Buddha.
See for yourself
What brings
Clarity and peace
That is the path for you to follow
Clarity of thoughts or clearer thinking had been taught over the centuries by great and noble teachers all over the world. The Buddha, as Kornfield and his translator, Rajapaksa state, lays down the vision in these lines.
Inner freedom is
Not guided by our efforts
It comes from seeing
What is true.
And
When you walk
Just walk
When you eat
Just eat.
In these pages, quite a number of expressions are observable on the subject of meditation and mindfulness.
The subject of meditation and mindfulness are shown as interlinked.
To meditate is
To listen with a receptive heart.
Learn to let go
That is the key to happiness.
Do not seek perfection in a changing world.
Instead, perfect your love.
Some of the visions as laid down in their text could be if someone is interested to go into the making of lofty interpretations or topics for longer discourses.
One step ahead
As a reader, I felt that the lines as read in the body of the work too rest on the aspects of creative communication lessons that could be used to teach social science subject areas both at the school level of teaching and at the university level. The classroom could be designed spell out some of the lines in the text, thus converting it into a dialogue and a group discourse. A commendable effort is made to enrich the spirited content of the work by way of the page illustrations as created in the Sinhala text by the translator. In this direction, the Senasillata Buduvadanak goes one step ahead of the original English work of Kornfield in the book design process. This is an ideal present for children of all ages and the adult on their various social occasions.
As such, the contents, as well as the work as a present, transcend the mere barriers of readership. Teachings of the Buddha presented and expressed in simple poetic form is an achievement in wish fulfilment.
As the lines in segment 59 go in the work, as you travel through life, offer good wishes to each being you meet.

Rare comet lights up Christmas skies
Sri Lankan astronomy enthusiasts will have a rare opportunity to observe a comet in the eastern sky soon after sunset in the constellation of Taurus these days.

The murky history of moderation, and how its shaping the future of free speech
The secret rules of the internet
Julie Mora-Blanco remembers the day, in the summer of 2006, when the reality of her new job sunk in. A recent grad of California State University, Chico, Mora-Blanco had majored in art, minored in womens studies, and spent much of her free time making sculptures from found objects and blown-glass. Struggling to make rent and working a post-production job at Current TV, shed jumped at the chance to work at an internet startup called YouTube. Maybe, she figured, she could pull in enough money to pursue her lifelong dream: to become a hair stylist.
It was a warm, sunny morning, and she was sitting at her desk in the companys office, located above a pizza shop in San Mateo, an idyllic and affluent suburb of San Francisco. Mora-Blanco was one of 60-odd twenty-somethings whod come to work at the still-unprofitable website.
Mora-Blancos team  10 people in total  was dubbed The SQUAD (Safety, Quality, and User Advocacy Department). They worked in teams of four to six, some doing day shifts and some night, reviewing videos around the clock. Their job To protect YouTubes fledgling brand by scrubbing the site of offensive or malicious content that had been flagged by users, or, as Mora-Blanco puts it, to keep us from becoming a shock site. The founders wanted YouTube to be something new, something better  a place for everyone  and not another eBaums World, which had already become a repository for explicit pornography and gratuitous violence.
Mora-Blanco sat next to Misty Ewing-Davis, who, having been on the job a few months, counted as an old hand. On the table before them was a single piece of paper, folded in half to show a bullet-point list of instructions: Remove videos of animal abuse. Remove videos showing blood. Remove visible nudity. Remove pornography. Mora-Blanco recalls her teammates were a mish-mash of men and women; gay and straight; slightly tipped toward white, but also Indian, African-American, and Filipino. Most of them were friends, friends of friends, or family. They talked and made jokes, trying to make sense of the rules. You have to find humor, she remembers. Otherwise its just painful.
Videos arrived on their screens in a never-ending queue. After watching a couple seconds apiece, SQUAD members clicked one of four buttons that appeared in the upper right hand corner of their screens: Approve  let the video stand; Racy  mark video as 18-plus; Reject  remove video without penalty; Strike  remove video with a penalty to the account. Click, click, click. But that day Mora-Blanco came across something that stopped her in her tracks.
Oh, God, she said.
That day Mora-Blanco came across something that stopped her in her tracks
Mora-Blanco wont describe what she saw that morning. For everyones sake, she says, she wont conjure the staggeringly violent images which, she recalls, involved a toddler and a dimly lit hotel room.
Ewing-Davis calmly walked Mora-Blanco through her next steps: hit Strike, suspend the user, and forward the persons account details and the video to the SQUAD teams supervisor.
From there, the information would travel to the CyberTipline, a reporting system launched by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in 1998. Footage of child exploitation was the only black-and-white zone of the job, with protocols outlined and explicitly enforced by law since the late 1990s.
The video disappeared from Mora-Blancos screen. The next one appeared.
Ewing-Davis said, Lets go for a walk.
Okay. This is what youre doing, Mora-Blanco remembers thinking as they paced up and down the street. Youre going to be seeing bad stuff.
Almost a decade later, the video and the child in it still haunt her. In the back of my head, of all the images, I still see that one, she said when we spoke recently. I really didnt have a job description to review or a full understanding of what Id be doing. I was a young 25-year-old and just excited to be getting paid more money. I got to bring a computer home! Mora-Blancos voice caught as she paused to collect herself. I havent talked about this in a long time.
Mora-Blanco is one of more than a dozen current and former employees and contractors of major internet platforms from YouTube to Facebook who spoke to us candidly about the dawn of content moderation. Many of these individuals are going public with their experiences for the first time. Their stories reveal how the boundaries of free speech were drawn during a period of explosive growth for a high-stakes public domain, one that did not exist for most of human history.
As law professor Jeffrey Rosen first said many years ago of Facebook, these platforms have more power in determining who can speak and who can be heard around the globe than any Supreme Court justice, any king or any president.
Launched in 2005, YouTube was the brainchild of Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karimthree men in their 20s who were frustrated because technically there was no easy way for them to share two particularly compelling videos: clips of the 2004 tsunami that had devastated southeast Asia, and Janet Jacksons Superbowl wardrobe malfunction. In April of 2005, they tested their first upload. By October, they had posted their first one million-view hit: Brazilian soccer phenom Ronaldinho trying out a pair of gold cleats.
A year later, Google paid an unprecedented $1.65 billion to buy the site. Mora-Blanco got a title: content policy strategist, or in her words, middle man. Sitting between the front lines and content policy, she handled all escalations from the front-line moderators, coordinating with YouTubes policy analyst. By mid-2006, YouTube viewers were watching more than 100 million videos a day. - The Verge

Sleep like a baby...
We all crave a good nights sleep every once in a while. If you find yourself envying a baby sleeping soundly with not a worry in the world then fret not, that could be you.
Thats because a bunch of architect experts have got together to create a hotel room that looks like a womb, complete with muted lighting, soft pink walls and high-tech mattresses, all to create the coziness of your mothers interiors.
The Zed Rooms have been purpose-built over, fittingly, nine months and feature bedrooms with a cocoon-like bed, inspired by the safety and snugness of the womb, to encourage positivity, relaxation and REM-rich sleep.
The rooms come as part of a collaboration between sleep technology company, Simba and serviced apartments Cuckooz.
They took inspiration from a womb as, during the last weeks of pregnancy, a baby increases its REM sleep, hitting a lifetime high of twelve hours a day in the final week before birth.
Theres no other moment during a persons life when they will get such a huge volume of REM sleep.
Resident sleep psychologist at Simba, Hope Bastine, said, If youve ever noticed that you dont sleep as well in a hotel, youre not alone. Scientists recognised the first night effect over a decade ago, where one half of the brain unconsciously acts as a night watchman staying more alert when in unfamiliar surroundings.
With this in mind, tapping into the emotional and physical, no stone has been left unturned trying to soothe the effects of this in the design architecture of our new cutting-edge sleep retreat.
Theres plenty in the room to ensure a delicious night of snoozing too, including restorative scents and colours to relax muscles, air cleansing soporific plants to eliminate toxins and healing background harmonies to unwind.
And dont worry about stubbing your toe in the middle of the night when you get up to pee as the room is equipped with rounded edges and softened corners.
Steve Reid, co-founder of Simba, added, The Zed Rooms arent a traditional getaway. They are geared entirely to honing quality sleep away from home. Fine tuning you overnight to navigate at whatever life throws at you the following day.
The Zed Rooms, located in Shoreditch, East London, are available for 190 per night.

The auto components industry is crucial to the South Korean economy, making up 7 per cent of its gross domestic product. It employs 235,000 people, about 7 per cent of the manufacturing sector, according to the ministry.
Creating and protecting jobs is a key pledge of President Moon Jae-ins administration.
According to government data, the number of loss-making listed auto suppliers has risen to 31 by the third quarter of this year from six in 2015. And the average operating margin of suppliers has halved over the same period to 1.8 per cent, the data shows.
General Motors South Korean subsidiary shuttered one of its plants in the country earlier this year and top South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co has seen its profits slump in 2018. Channel NewsAsia

Speaker lauds SLs eye donation effort
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said two people see the world because of the eye donations made by his late parents.
I too have signed up with the eye donation campaign to donate my eyes after my death, he said.
Despite various shortcomings in our country, the level of interest shown by Sri Lankans to donate their eyes showcases us as a great nation to the world, he said.
The Speaker was speaking as chief guest at the National Eye Donation Day celebrations organised by the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society yesterday.
Apart from eyes, blood, kidney and donation of other body parts, the Speaker said he had also started a hair donation campaign for cancer patients, in the name of his late daughter who died of cancer, and given the response to that, he said he was able to experience first-hand the generous nature of fellow Sri Lankans.
Though we are a small country, today I am speaking at the eye donation campaign which holds the largest eye donor bank in the world. That is a great honour which our country has won, he said.
Today, I am deeply honoured to be the son of parents who have donated their eyes. It was a dream of theirs to do so and today, we do not know who sees the world through them  their race, religion or caste is not known to us, except that it has benefited them, the Speaker said.
But we have the feeling that their eyes are still alive and one day I hope that someone else too will see the world again through my eyes.

Stock market to pick up during  first two months of 2019
Stock market activities are likely to pick up during the first two months of 2019, senior investment advisor at Sampath Securities said.
Speaking on current lackluster market activities, he stressed the need to maintain political stability, stable business environment to encourage more foreign investment in the stock market and to sustain the market growth.
It is important that we also drive the local investor; so that we can cushion the impact of foreign investors when they exit the market.
Unfortunately, our local institutions are not that active, he said. At present, the market is subsided due to the lack of local investor participation, it is the foreigners who have been active over the last couple of years, he said.
It is very important that our local institutes, the private sector, high net worth investors and retailers get active in the market now, to sustain the market growth.
However, the market has witnessed an upward trend in terms of local retail investor participation following the recent political changes which took place in the latter part of October, this year.

## Title: Sun setting on Japans nuclear export sector

Sun setting on Japans nuclear export sector
Japans nuclear export industry could be dealt a fatal blow if Mitsubishi Heavy Industries pulls out of a massive project to build four large power plants on Turkeys Black Sea coast, as reports have suggested.
The Sinop plant project in Turkey was seen as Japans best chance for an industry  battered and bruised after the 2011 tsunami and triple meltdown at Fukushima  to put together a workable export strategy that did not break the bank of potential international customers.
Aside from Sinop, the Japanese industry has only one viable export project still upcoming: Hitachis bid to build two reactors on the island of Anglesey in Britain. And even that deal is looking shaky.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) has not pulled the plug yet on its stake in the four-reactor project on Turkeys Black Sea coast, but a slew of domestic media reports and talk in Tokyo suggests that in the face of seemingly ever-rising construction costs to meet new safety standards that have been put in place since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the company will bail.
Fukushima legacy
When the deal was signed with Ankara in 2013, the ownership profile was: 65 percent awarded to a consortium made up of MHI, Itochu, Frances Areva, and GDF Suez. The other 35 percent was covered by Turkeys electric power utility, ElektrikUretim.
However, in April, Itochu pulled out of the consortium, citing cost overruns. That left the consortium with 51 percent, and the remaining 49 percent owned by the Turkish utility.
Without Mitsubishi, the viability of the project is in question, sources say, unless Turkey can find a new partner or is willing to take on the project without its largest foreign partner. The Russians, who are building a nuclear complex on Turkeys southern Mediterranean coast, might be interested.
According to Kyodo, a thorough cost evaluation was to be completed by the end of this year. Itochu waited for the report to be released before bailing out of the deal. MHI is apparently waiting for the study to be completed before deciding its next move.
When the deal with Mitsubishi was signed in 2013, the estimated cost was US$18 billion for four 1,100-megawatt nuclear power plants. But overall costs have soared, passing $42 billion in April  when Itochu withdrew, and is now put at about US$44 billion.
Cost increases are nothing new in the nuclear power industry, but have been exacerbated in recent years by expensive adjustments phased in to meet more stringent safety concerns following the earthquake and tsunami that destroyed four units of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The Sinop cost rises, however, also encompass other problems encountered in construction.
Fukushima, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in history, turned most of Japan against nuclear power. Before March 11, 2011, Japan had 54 nuclear plants. All were shut down after the accident and some are slowly returning to service having passed scrutiny by the regulator. Five are expected to restart within the next five years, and eight will likely be decommissioned. But prospects for the remaining plants are unclear.
Aware that no new nuclear plant may ever be built at home amid the anti-atomic public mood, Japans nuclear vendors have turned to overseas exports as the Fukushima accident does not appear to have destroyed the Japanese industry brand in other countries.
Endgame for nuclear exports
If Mitsubishi does pull out of the huge project in Turkey, it will be a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who sees international exports of nuclear technology as an important way to boost the economy. On his many trips abroad, he often acts as a salesman for nuclear exports. For example, it was a topic of discussion with Turkish President Recep Erdogan on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting in Argentina.
Details of the conversation were not revealed, but it would be a good bet that they discussed the Sinop project with the threat of Mitsubishi hanging over them, and that Abe sought ways to keep the project viable.
Meanwhile, it is not just MHI that may have doubts about the sector. Japans nuclear export industry has suffered plenty of setbacks in the seven years since Fukushima. Questions about the future of the sector hang over all three main players in the sector.
Toshiba, one of Japans big-three nuclear constructors, recently pulled out of the nuclear power business overseas after incurring huge losses in the United States.
Toshiba has also suffered something of an administrative meltdown in its quest to win construction contracts in the US. In February it finally unloaded it money-losing American subsidiary, Westinghouse, for $1 billion less than it paid to acquire the company 10 years ago.
If the export programme is to remain viable, it may be in Wales, where the British government is seeking to build a two-reactor nuclear power plant on the island of Anglesey. Among those bidding for the project is Japans third nuclear constructor, Hitachi, through a subsidiary called Horizon Nuclear.
In the nuclear world, there are constructors  like MHI, Toshiba and Hitachi  and operators, who run the plant after it is completed, and they are not always the same. Japan learned from Koreas successful bid to build six nuclear plants in the United Arab Emirates that offering to build and also run them  a one-stop service  is key to making sales.
Hitachi is teaming up with the Japan Atomic Power Company, which operates two plants in Japan (although both are currently shut down pending the review by regulators). The plan is to present the British with a package deal.
Now, there are worries that Hitachi might pull out of the British project. Chairman Hiroaka Nakanishi was quoted in the Times of London saying his company was facing an extreme situation, and that a final decision on whether to stay with the project or leave it will be made next year.
If Mitsubishi does, as is widely expected, pull out of the huge project in Turkey, the only egg left in Japans overseas nuclear export basket will be Wales.

UNF HAS 113 SEATS TO FORM CABINET - RAJITHA
United National Front MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, claimed that they have in hand the required majority of members to appoint the Cabinet.
Responding to our question whether the United National Front was endowed with 113 members to appoint a new Cabinet, Senaratne replied: Sure, we have that number.
Asked when the new Cabinet will be appointed, he said the MPs of the United National Front was to meet last evening (18) at Temple Trees to decide who will be ministers in the new Cabinet.
Once that is decided we will prepare a list of names of the members to be appointed to the UNF governments Cabinet, he said.
We will hand over that list to the President, he said.
Dr. Senaratne added that there will be more crossovers to the UNF government from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Contrariwise, UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said last evening that UNF still does not have in their possession 113 seats in Parliament.
They have brought about a fate that the country is now endowed with a Parliament of MPs without a government, which has but a Prime Minister. Now, Parliament will meet without a government on UNFs account, he said. Asked if there would be crossovers from their side (UPFA) to UNF, Gunawardena said there would also be crossovers from UNF to their side (UPFA)
It is very much expected under the current political climate, he said.

WEEKLY TEA REVIEW  ENDING 12TH DEC. 2018
WIDE-SPREAD DEMAND FROM GULF, SUSTAINED DEMAND FROM IRAN, CIS
There was good demand for teas on offer with fairly wide-spread demand from Saudi-Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Iraq and the U.A.E. There was also sustained demand from buyers for Turkey and the C.I.S whilst demand from Iran, was once again subdued.
The stronger demand that prevailed at the commencement of the Ex Estate sale lost steam halfway through the brokers order of sale, perhaps due to the news that the stoppage of work on high grown estates will cease from last week, Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd Director Jehan Algama told Daily News Business.
There was added interest for the best available teas as buyers possibly wanted to cover their orders fearing a short fall which was likely in the wake of last weeks plantations strike, he said.
Meanwhile, Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake said that last weeks auctions comprised 7 Million kilos. Low Grown Leafy teas accounted for 1.8 Million kilos whilst Tippy/Small Leaf catalogue had 1.1 Million kilos.
Low Growns met with fair demand. BOP1 / OP1s appreciated in value substantially. OPs were firm to dearer, whilst select best and best OPAs sold at lower rates all-round; poorer varieties substantially lower, he said.
Well-made shotty Pekoes sold at lower rates, whilst bold varieties were discounted. Pekoe1s declined in value all-round. In the Tippy Small leaf catalogues FBOP1s gained in value. FBOPs appreciated in value too. Select best FBOPF1s gained in value. Below best varieties held firm; poorer varieties appreciated in value. FBOPFs sold at dearer rates. BOPF / BOPFs were firm to dearer. In the Premium Flowery catalogues long leaf and small leaf tippy teas appreciated in value.
In the Ex-Estate catalogues better made Western BOPs gained Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 with select best moving up a further Rs. 20; others were irregularly dearer Rs. 20 following leaf style. Select best BOPFs Rs. 30 to Rs. 60 dearer. BOPFs better made below best moved up Rs. 20 to Rs. 30; bottom was irregularly dearer Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 following leaf style. Nuwara Eliya BOPs were neglected. BOPFs were about firm.
Udapussellawa BOPs declined Rs. 10 to Rs. 20. BOPFs gained Rs. 20 to Rs. 30. Select best Uva BOPs were firm. BOPFs dearer Rs. 30 to Rs. 40; poorest were irregular.

IRAQ KEEN ON RESUMING TEA IMPORTS FROM INDIA
KOLKATA: Iraq is keen to resume import of orthodox teas from India, eight years after the trade came to an abrupt halt owing to the geopolitical tension in the West Asian country.
A delegation from the Trade Promotion Council of India found this out on a recent trip to Iraq. We had gone to four places  Baghdad, Karbala, Najaf and Erbil. Buyer-seller meetings were organised and we found that importers were keen to know about Indian tea, SujitPatra, Secretary, Indian Tea Association, who was part of the delegation, said.
There has been a shift in purchasing pattern in Iraq, he said. Earlier, the government used to buy teas, but now private parties are involved in the purchase.
After India stopped tea exports to Iraq, Sri Lanka and Vietnam filled the void. Iraq imports around 40 million kg of teas a year and Sri Lanka dominates the market with 80 per cent share. India will, therefore, have to compete with Sri Lanka which is exporting orthodox teas at an average price of $2 per kg. Patra, however said that during his interaction with importers in Iraq he felt that they were willing to pay a bit more for good quality teas. India exports orthodox teas to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Germany, US and Japan, among other countries. Indian tea industry is looking to increase exports of orthodox teas as the returns are better on this variety. India produces 110-120 million kg a year and it has the capability of producing more orthodox teas.
Exports have remained flat in 2018 because of uncertainty in Iran in the aftermath of US sanctions. Orthodox tea exports slowed down, though, and the average price of orthodox teas fell to Rs 210.87 per kg this year from Rs 221.29 per kg in 2017 largely because of the decline in shipments to Iran. In the first nine months of 2018, India exported 173.80 million kg of tea, slightly higher than 173.52 million kg exported in the year-ago period. (Economic Times of India)

Three SLFP MPs join UNF Government :
Will work for people in Wellassa - MP Zoysa

Parliament convened yesterday for the first time since UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister on Sunday.
MPs Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, Lakshman Seneviratne and Indika Bandaranayake crossed over and joined the UNF Government as SLFP members.
Giving reasons which prompted him to cross over, MP Wijith Wijayamuni de Soysa said Lakshman Seneviratne, Indika Bandaranayake and himself had taken the decision to pledge their support to the UNF government. There were many reasons that led us to take this decision.
The people of this country are aware of the recent incidents where Parliament was made dysfunctional and the executive, legislative and judiciary were acting against each other.
The political instability was felt throughout the country from the man living in a mansion to those living in huts. They will all have to pay the price for this crisis.
He said everyone in the country felt the political crisis and the consequences of this crisis will inevitably fall on the shoulders of the people by way of taxes. He noted that as members of parliament all MPs have a huge responsibility.
Commending the smaller parties for the manner in which they acted during the crisis he said, We need to give credit to the smaller parties for the way they acted. I have no issue in working with the Chairman of the party President Maithripala Sirisena or advisor Mahinda Rajapaksa. As the SLFP we have a big responsibility.
Soysa said SLFPers had fallen into a pathetic plight. I am a SLFper by birth and in 1979, I contested the Avissawella Municipal Council election at a time when there were no contenders. No leader came and asked us to vote for them. I even worked tirelessly during the period Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike lost her civic rights and also worked to appoint Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge as the President. I was in the SLFP youth front. At the time Ranjith Maddumabandara and I were arch rivals, but today fate has made both of us to sit on one side. But none of these disputes were for personal reasons.They were solely based on our political rivalry.
However, he said that he had no disagreement with Mahinda Rajapaksa as he had even given Soysa a ministerial post. I can work with him and I respect him, but its the wolves around him that I cant work with. I was not allowed to work during our government but during the good governance government I was allowed to work for the people in Wellassa. We planned to construct 200 irrigation tanks and we have done 100 under the directions of the President, he added.
However, he noted that his decision to cross over was not a move expecting positions and it is in no way a move to join the UNP.

Puppy love
How do you propose to a dog lover If you thought about putting a leash on them instead of a ring, you were wrong and have serious problems. Good thing Maurice Goldstein doesnt have a twisted mind like you do and has found the perfect way to ask his girlfriend Laura Stamper to marry him.
Maurice got Lauras friend Rebecca Yale to meet her for lunch on a trip to Los Angeles. Yale, a wedding photographer, later excused herself, explaining she had to meet a client. Little did Laura know, she was the client. Laura and Maurice have been dating for over four years. The couple live in New York City but were in LA for Thanksgiving. Maurice suggested to Laura that they go on a hike, and when they came to the lookout point, everything started unfolding.
Maurice also had a friend bring along some therapy dogs called Pack of Hearts. Moreover, he made sure the gang were standing nearby to make sure the moment was straight out of a fairytale.
It was all incredibly meaningful, Stampler told Elite Daily. You see, she loves dogs so much, theyve even influenced a book she wrote, Little Black Dresses, Little White Lies. [In the book,] theres an assortment of dogs and weird dog-related events. Like a pug prom. And a Bark-Mitzvah.
As you can probably guess, Laura said Yes. And it was then when the dogs were unleashed. Cause thats way better than releasing doves!
Although some wondered if there were too many elements during the proposal (a capella, hike, rose petals, loose dogs) Maurice executed it perfectly. (He even hired Task Rabbits to park in front of the hiking trail to save spots for people who were involved.) It was all incredibly meaningful and we then celebrated with both of our families at a restaurant after.
By the way, remember Lauras friend Rebecca She was also there to capture it all.
Laura and Maurice met in the summer of 2011 when they were both seeing other people. We would randomly run into each other (walking to work on Broadway, on the way to brunch with friends in Chelsea) over the years. I always felt drawn to him  in the back of my head, I knew that we could be really compatible  but knew I wasnt ready yet. I honestly felt like if we got together, it could be the real deal.
Then, like any good millennial, we reconnected over dating apps, she continued. Although the storys slightly more interesting than that. So, I was covering the intersection of tech and culture at Time magazine, and in 2014 that meant dating apps! Id written a mag feature on my own personal experiences and then would do a bunch of web write-ups on every new study/update/etc.
Tinder had just launched a new feature, so I went on my work phone to check it out, Laura added, I must have seen Maurice and swiped right to say hello  but then un-downloaded the app on my phone once my story was done because I was in a (not-so-great) relationship at the time with someone who treated me not-so-great-ly. Suffice it to say, we didnt work out.
Months later, when I was ready to date again, I re-downloaded the app and up came a really old message from Maurice. I sent a very delayed response, he texted to ask me to drinks, and the rest is history. I havent gone on a date with another person since.

We will not allow UNP to bring new Constitution
SLPP MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday they will not allow the present UNP government to bring a new Constitution or make any Amendments to the Constitution at the behest of the TNA or any other political party.
However, we will consider giving our support if the government brings the proposed 20th Amendment as they promised during the previous elections, he said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the SLPP party head office at Nelum Mawatha, Jayanthipura, Battaramulla, yesterday, he said the 20th Amendment is necessary to hold the election on a first-past-the-post system to create a stable and strong Parliament.
However, they brought the 19th Amendment to strengthen the powers of the Prime Minister instead of bringing the proposed 20th Amendment as promised. The 19th Amendment had created an unnecessary crisis between the Judiciary, Parliament and the Executive today, Abeywardena said.
He also said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised to bring a new alliance to help those helped him come out of the crisis. However, we will not allow the UNP government to implement promises given to various parties in and outside Sri Lanka, he said.
We will only allow the passing of Amendments and Bills that will help to create a stable Parliament and country, accepted by the majority of the people, he said. The next Presidential Election will be called by next September. President Maithripala Sirisena said we should stay together to create a new government in the future.
We will face the forthcoming election as a powerful alliance, Abeywardena said.
Hereafter we will reveal all the Cabinet decisions that betray the country by announcing them through press conferences and organising public demonstrations, he said.

Ball in UNPs Court
It appears that the three and half year long vigil of the UNP component of the Yahapalanaya regime to have a Government of their own has been realized with the exit of the UPFA/SLFP half of that alliance and the reins falling into the hands of the UNP led United National Front, following the October 26 constitutional coup. Although the UNP and UPFA/SLFP Unity Government went about like a house on fire in the immediate aftermath of the General Election victory, things began to unravel with the passage of time.
The main reason for this was the yawning gap between the partners in terms of policy and ideology. The Blues always complained that they were kept off the loop by their partner who for all intents and purposes played an assertive role in the Government. President Maithripala Sirisena who was the leader of the SLFP often openly complained that he was being by-passed in decision making which he gave as one of the reasons for their pull out from the Unity Government and the sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 26. For their part, the UNP ministers and MPs, particularly the backbenchers, too were perennially complaining that the President and his party threw a spanner in the works, blocking their endeavours, particularly on the economic front.
Now with the dust settled on the tumultuous events of the past few weeks, Ranil Wickremesinghe back in the saddle as Prime Minister of a single UNP led UNF Government with his hands strengthened and the main obstacle blocking UNP policies being implemented removed, the Greens now have a clear field.
Addressing the Victory for Democracy rally at the Galle Face Green on Monday, Premier Wickremesinghe said they have embarked on a mission to abolish the Executive Presidency and towards this end will form a new UNP-led alliance to win a two thirds majority in Parliament. He said the new alliance, which will be shortly christened as the National Democratic Front, will go for a two thirds majority at a future General Election and they would not seek support from anyone else. We don't want to go begging anyone for support to abolish the Executive Presidency, he told the mammoth rally.
Many would see this remark as a definite No to a future alliance with the Blues. However this does not mean that SLFP MPs individually would not be accommodated in the new Government. Already UNP firebrand MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha has hinted that they may have to provide for additional portfolios beyond the stipulated 30 (19 A permits 40 plus ministers in a National Government but this shrinks to 30 in the event of a one party Government).
We will try our utmost to limit the number of Cabinet Ministers to 30 but we might have to increase it if the need arises. He also added; We in the UNP have decided that certain SLFPers should not be invited to the Government and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has assured the UNP Parliamentary Group that he would accept SLFPers only with their approval.
However, it would be prudent for Wickremesinghe to limit the Cabinet to 30. We say this because although the mass support he gained was principally for the protection of democracy and Government by constitutional rule, where not only UNPers but outside forces such as civil society groups, civic organisations, professionals, intellectuals and artistes etc. too threw in their lot with him, it was also a call for course correction reminiscent of the January 8 revolution.
Hence, Premier Wickremesinghe should capitalize on this massive fund of goodwill and unprecedented mass support to undo past mistakes, particularly that relating to waste and corruption in Governance, and open a new chapter for clean administration that would gain wide acceptance among the larger populace. One way of eliminating waste is to downsize the Cabinet and do away with extravagance. He could start by limiting the Cabinet to 30. After all India, with a population of 1.2 billion, and more than 50 times our land mass has only around 25 Cabinet Ministers.
True, there will be much heartburn among those MPs who stoutly resisted attempts to lure them with astronomical amounts and it is only natural that these souls are full of expectations (Rs. 500 million was the going rate according to the President himself). However MP Nalin Bandara said UNPers are willing to sacrifice ministerial portfolios and work for the people.
If true, these are noble sentiments indeed. The MP also pointed out that President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga governed with a minority Government during her entire 11 year tenure. CBK in fact had only 105 members from the Peoples Alliance which she led to victory in 1994 and relied heavily on the SLMC, Thondaman's CWC and the TULF- the forerunner to the present day TNA-, which voted with her alliance even to pass the Emergency, despite the LTTE spectre. The current situation is similar to 1994, only difference being that the SLMC is an integral component of the UNF. What matters is the determination to serve the people, not numbers per se.

Also the hero of the day was the nippy national sevens scrum half Sudam Sooriarachchi who ran circles around the Navy three quarters with his dazzling runs scoring two tries in the end.
Number eight Radeesha Seneviratne, prop forward Charith Silva, two wingers Saliya Handapangoda and Chathura Seneviratne played a tremendous game for the Sailors.
CR lucky to beat Airmen
CR & FC who got their act together finally managed to edges out a fighting Air Force sports club outfit, by 36- 27 at CR grounds in Longden Place.
CR got their momentum going from the very first minute of play where their forwards together with their three quarters combined effectively to score this superb victory. Mithila Perera, Charana Chamikara, Omalka Gunaratne, Panduka Angammana, Wajid Fawmy, Harith Bandara, Kevin Dixon, Sumudu Rankothge, Randitha Warnapura and Reeza Rafaideen excelled for the red shirts while playmaker and fly half Tharinda Ratwatte brought the win for CR contributing 11 points out of a total of 36 . The kicking of ex Trinity College skipper Ratwatte was exceptional where he had a 90% record putting over four conversions and the solitary penalty that came his way.
For the AirMen Thilina Bandara, Gayantha Iddamalgoda , Jero Dhananjaya and Charith Seneviratna played a good game.
Kandy lucky to win over Havies
Defending champs Kandy SC were really lucky to beat a fighting Havelock sports club by 31-21 in their league rugby clash that took place at Nittawela in kandy.
Kandy who played really well in the first half to lead 21-7 at the breather but could not play their normal game there by got everything wrong and in the end they won the game by a close margin.
Hero for Kandy outfit was none other than their national number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa who scored a hat trick of tries.
Havies flanker Sithum Peiris, young centre Dinuk Amarasighe and veteran prop forward Dushmantha Priyadarshana once again stood out from the rest by creating the opportunities for Havies where they punched holes at the Kandy defence many a times, but lacked support from their other team mates.
Police thrash Army
Police Sports Club showed their dominance with a smashing 41-19 win over Army at Police Park in Colombo. It was a mixture of their forwards and three quarters that enabled Cops to create this win. They virtually grounded the Soldiers with a 27 nil score at the half time
The men responsible for Polices win was their prop forward Rasith Silva leading the way by scoring two tries while Nisal Samadhi, Sachith Silva,Sujan Koditthuwakku and Mummar Deen also chipped in by scoring try apiece.
Sachith Silva, Yohan Peiris and Janith Chandimal (Penalties and Conversions) was on target with their boot giving some very important points. Aravinda Karunarathna, Gayan Salinda and Rizvi Mohamed played well for the soldiers scoring their three tries.

Cheeky cockatoo
A mischievous parrot who was booted from an animal sanctuary for his foul mouth has found a friend in Amazons Alexa device.
Rocco, an African grey, was caught using the virtual assistant to play his favorite music, tell jokes and even order snacks, The Times of London reports. Thankfully the devices parental lock system prevented the clever boy from actually purchasing any items which included strawberries, ice cream and even a kettle.
Owner Marion Wischnewski told The Times she took the parrot in after he was removed from a sanctuary operated by the UKs National Animal Welfare Trust for swearing too much.
Rocco, who was taught to curse by a previous owner, is evidently loving his new home, interacting with Alexa up to 40 times a day and mastering countless household sounds.
He knows the telephone and can make different mobile ringtones, Wischnewski said. He can do the microwave or the squeaking door on my fridge. He can do the ice cream van in the summer, and a truck reversing so loud you think its in your living room.

Chinas loans to Lanka far below  market rate - Chinese scholar
The interest on 61.5% of Chinas loans to Sri Lanka is far below the international market rate, according to Prof. Huang Yunsong, Associate Dean at the China Center for South Asian Studies in Sichuan University.
Huang told the Colombo Shangri-La Colloquium 2018 on Sunday, that as of December 2017, Sri Lanka owed China US$ 5.5 billion which was about 10.6% of the island nations total foreign debt of US$ 51.8 billion.
Of the US$ 5.5 billion, US$ 3.8 billion (61.5 % of the total loan) was provided at a rate far below the international market rate. Thus, the major part of Chinas loan was taken at a concessionary rate, Huang emphasized.
More importantly, US$ 1 billion had been taken at a concessionary rate of 2% which means that the interest on the major part of the loan was not excessive at all, he added.
On the issues of Sri Lankas taking US$ 307 million at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.75% pushing up the interest rate to 6.3%, Huang said that the commercial loan interest rate was based on a mutual agreement between Sri Lanka and China as per established principles of the international market. Referring to the description of Chinas taking over the Sri Lankan port at Hambantota as neo-colonialism, Huang said that if one were to Google port 99 year lease, the first result one would get is a 99-year lease on the Port of Darwin in Australias Northern Territory, a deal worth Australian Dollar 506 million with a Chinese company.
Besides, port terminals in New York and Long Beach are managed by Chinese companies. The China Merchant Holdings now holds a 70% stake in Hambantota port for 99 years, with the remaining shares in the hands of Sri Lanka. But the lease agreement provides for the purchase of shares held by China if Sri Lanka so decides at a future date, the Chinese scholar pointed out.
Huang described the charge that China is trying militarize Sri Lankas ports, as a baseless speculation.
He pointed out that between 2009 and May 2018, 422 warships had arrived in Lankas ports for operational, training and formal visits. These ships belonged to 27 navies in the world.
Being a neighbour and having close ties with Sri Lanka, India tops the list with 83 visits . Japanese naval ships undertook 69 visits. China is at the distant third place with 33 visits followed by Bangladesh with 29 visits. Russia and Pakistan come next with 27 and 24 visits respectively. All these naval vessels have followed the same procedure of applying for logistic and operational requirements, which proves that Chinas dual-use of ports for both military and economic purposes is baseless speculation, the Chinese scholar said. He pointed out that according to the latest paper of a prominent US think tank, it is unlikely that the Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar and the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka will become dual use ports. This is due to political and legal restrictions in Myanmar and Indian pressure on Sri Lanka, the think tank had said. Furthermore, the agreement between China and Sri Lanka on Hambantota port contains a clause that strictly prohibits, the Chinese from using the port for military purposes.
It also states that the security of the port shall be with the Sri Lankan navy, Huang pointed out. newsin.asia

Christmas with have-nots
In the end, its not the years in your life that count. Its the life in your years, said Abraham Lincoln.
As I entered the kingdom of old people, I felt odd sensations in my stomach because I was anticipating a lot of things in advance. In the beginning, I said nothing to anybody as I was just scanning the whole environment with my naked eyes. Life is too short to anticipate things. We frame different outputs without understanding the whole scenario.
Love doesnt recognize any language. It is not bounded by any external powers. We only restrict ourselves. Stop wasting your time in criticizing or feeling jealous about someone elses life.
Understand the power of attraction. So, spread love and attract more love in return.
The evening of December 15 was a great day of joy to the occupants of the Home for the Aged. Their lifestyle was monotonous, staying away from their loved ones, in a concrete square.
The Christmas party made them gain back the lost spirit. Sarvodaya Suwasetha Director Neetha Ariyaratne graced the occasion as the chief guest. She was welcomed by Ralf de Almeida, President of the Social and Welfare Committee.
After lighting of the Christmas candles in traditional style and hoisting the National Flag, the event kicked off. The Christmas messages were delivered by Rev Fr Adriean of the Holy Emmanuel Church and a Chief Pastor of the Salvation Army and Farms Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Managing Director Clarance Mendis.
The programme was held in two segments. The President and the Board Members conduct a Nursery for children.
The children performed many skits for entertainment while the seeyas and Achchis performed a lovely Carol singing. Though they were old, their voices were young.
After their performances gifts were distributed by the Chief Guest later the Board Members and Teachers followed up for the inmates and the little ones.
Shock, pity and thankfulness- the three main emotions I felt after the visit to Old Age Home. The trip was a great overall experience, and I gained a lot from it.
Though I am not ignorant of the less fortunate or the elderly at all, sitting with, and talking to them, was a whole new experience! I had never visited an old age home before, but what I had seen on T.V back home was totally different. I didnt expect it to be at all the same, but nevertheless, the cold reality of it struck me hard.
Listening to their stories of losing wife and child during delivery, being widowed, consecutive heart attacks, losing children in accidents, being abandoned by their families, or never getting married to start with, astonished and moved me. Though they all said they were happy, I couldnt help but think it was because that was the best they had seen, or they had no option left.

Cottrell, Hope guide West Indies to crushing T20 win
Sylhet, Monday: Left-arm pacer Sheldon Cottrell delivered a career best 4-28 before Shai Hope struck a half-century as West Indies crushed Bangladesh by eight wickets in their Twenty20 series opener Monday.
West Indies raced to 130-2 in just 10.5 overs after Cottrell and his fellow pacers bowled out Bangladesh for 129 runs in Sylhet.
Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan scored 61 off 43 balls for the home side but could not stave off a thumping defeat.
Hope accelerated the West Indies' run chase with 55 off 23 balls that included six sixes and three fours.
Victory never looked in doubt as he struck spinner Mehidy Hasan for three sixes and a four in just the second over of the innings, yielding 23 runs.
Spinner Mahmudullah Riyad dismissed Hope after medium pacer Mohammad Saifuddin broke a 51-run opening stand with Evin Lewis, who fell for 18.
But Nicholas Pooran and Keemo Paul ensured West Indies cruised to their target, with quickfire innings of 23 and 28 respectively.
Cottrell and fellow pacer Oshane Thomas earlier choked Bangladesh, who opted to bat first, at the start of their innings.
Openers Tamim Iqbal and Liton Das, as well as Soumya Sarkar, all fell for single-figure scores to short-pitch deliveries.
In-form Mushfiqur Rahim was run out for five, leaving Bangladesh on 48-4 before six overs of batting power play had elapsed.
Shakib put on two small partnerships of 25 and 30 respectively with Mahmudullah Riyad and Ariful Haque to lift the side briefly.
"Everything (fell) apart from the toss. Batting failed and then the bowling also obviously went wrong," Shakib said after the match.
"Was a good pitch, should have probably got about 180 on the board."
He hit eight fours and two sixes before being dismissed by Cottrell.
Paul wrapped up Bangladesh's innings with 2-23.
The West Indies are hoping a series win will end their Bangladesh tour on a positive note after losing their Test and one-day international series 2-0 and 2-1 respectively.
"Very good win but it's only one game," skipper Carlos Brathwaite said.
"We have started with a win before and then gone on to lose the series in recent times. So, it's important to be respectful of the opposition." Bangladesh and West Indies play the remaining two T20 internationals of the series in Dhaka this week. AFP

Critical Infrastructure: Starting the Journey from  Protection to Resilience
The pace and impact of digital transformation is no doubt accelerating and some would say, the catalyst of change. This is no different around the world including the island nation of Sri Lanka. I had the good fortune of participating in the recent 11th National Cyber Security Week 2019 organised by SL-CERT and ICTA at the Hilton Colombo.
What is readily apparent is the Nations progressive approach to cyber security with many achievementsthe envy of other nations - including being the first Nation in South Asia to be admitted to the Budapest Convention.
The event was timely, following the recent release of Sri Lankas first National Information and Cyber Security Strategy and it certainly looks to be a solid attempt for paving the way towards a robust national framework on enhancing cyber security. As a Nation, Sri Lanka is embracing a digital future and the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changes how you operate and deliver value to citizens.
As such, the singling out of the importance of critical infrastructure protection is evident throughout the document. The establishment of a new centralise authority for cyber security  the National Information and Cyber Security Agency (NICSA) and the structures under it seem well placed to develop and execute on the program in the quest to build critical infrastructure resilience. A Key component to this success is the ability to understand how to merge technology with strategy and the document articulates a well thought out approach.
For myself, the emphasis on critical infrastructure security was the focus of my delivery. Of particular importance was the opportunity to learn from the events of recent past, that is the previous notable attacks on critical infrastructure.
Firstly, one must be clear on what exactly we are talking about when it comes to critical infrastructure as this terms is easily thrown about. The reality is that what we in the cyber security industry are really focused on are the critical Information Infrastructures within the critical infrastructure sector. However we also have to include the public critical information and communications infrastructures such as the satellites, mobile communications and of course, the Internet itself in this conglomerate. Together, they make up the area of concern for cyber security practitioners.
We also have to note that within the critical infrastructure sectors there are some with unique elements that cause them to stand out  I am referring of course to the control systems networks of energy generation, power distribution and the like.
There has been much said about the doom-and-gloom of critical infrastructure attacks but analysis of these previous attacks yield some sobering results:
1. Pretty much all of these attacks traverse the corporate IT network to get to the industrial control systems network;
2. The methods of attack are consistent to what we have been experiencing in traditional attacks on corporate systems and environments.
3. Poor cyber hygiene plays a large part in the success of these attacks.
An important point to note is that such attacks are NOT about stealing credit card information, personal information or other such data elements. Instead such compromise is very much on owning the asset. As such a successful attack on a critical infrastructure can transcend the cyber-physical realm and lead to a loss of human life. A fundamental difference to traditional cyber-attacks.
However, understanding the techniques, tactics and procedures (TTP) allows you to develop a plan of resilience based on layered defensive techniques and good cyber hygiene practices.
Some suggestions for the critical infrastructure sector of Sri Lanka are:
1. Employ network segmentation. Network segmentation allows you to employ zone based controls such as restricting protocolsto only those needed for specific functions within a zone.
2. You can go further with the introduction of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) which adds an additional layer of protection and acts as a proxy between the corporate network and the control systems network. Ensure that this is properly configured and managed.
3. The adding of Multi-factor Authentication is long overdue. For a long time now there is been a question around the security of password/passphrases from theft and the abuse of remote access for infiltration, data exfiltration, and persistence. The strategy is emphasised for remote access and for performing privileged task and actions. In particular Admin accounts should be restricted  governed by the duties, and not allowed to browse the web!
4. Lastly, visibility through monitoring and deep inspection. Visibility is truly the best weapon a cyber-defender has. Being able to see into the network allows you to better understand what is happening and therefore act on the traffic in the network. Not only can you address your preventive program through identification and managing behaviours but you also utilised the same technology in your investigations and remediation. Critical infrastructure network security is predicated on visibility.

Sri Lanka at Crossroads: Geopolitical Challenges and National Interests by Professor Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, the Director General of Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSL), will be launched at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute on December 21 at 4 pm.
The launch will be followed by a panel discussion with the Participation of Sarath Amunugama, who is also the chief guest of the event, Emeritus Professor. Vini Vitharana, Professor Tissa Vitharana, Professor Swaran Singh (JNU, India) and Professor Eugene de Silva (Virginia Research Institute, USA.)
The book focuses on geopolitics, political landscape, foreign relations, peacebuilding and reconciliation, democracy and institution building and cyber security and foresight. The book discusses Sri Lanka's attempts to look outwards, as a strategically-positioned island nation with the potential to be a super connector in fast-developing Asia and carving out a place for itself in the international arena, while looking inwards, to recover and rebuild its potential, bruised by an era of colonial rule and nearly 30 years of a civil war, with two youth insurrections, simultaneously.
'This book examines these twin dimensions. First, how Sri Lanka is negotiating its international reach and the spheres of influence that extend from other Asian and world powers, and second, how the country is engaging in nation-building, from days of racial riots to ones of peace-building, reconciliation, more robust governance, and the development of cybersecurity. Written from the perspective of a Sri Lankan academic and the head of the national security think tank, this book offers insights into how the country has addressed its post-conflict as well as geopolitical challenges, navigated through domestic politics, and ramped up peace-building efforts, to now reach a junction where it can put its foot firmly on the road to prosperity in a new Asian world order,' a description of the book issued by the publisher said.

Daraz tp expand logistical hubs
Launching yet another initiative in the online retail industry, Daraz.lk was responsible in introducing the biggest online sale in the world to Sri Lanka as they brought 11.11 or Singles Day for the very first time to Sri Lanka in November. With the successful end to the sale, Bart Van Dijk  Country Manager of Daraz Sri Lanka shares their experience in bringing this mega sale and how it impacted online retail.
Q: You introduced the worlds biggest sale to Sri Lanka this year. How was the response for 11.11
A: The numbers were records in every way we could think of. We recorded approximately 60,000 orders and LKR 160+ million worth in value during the sale period, which is a significant amount for a market the size of Sri Lanka. Daraz has been growing 300% YoY and this has had an impact on the success of 11.11. It also indicates how the market is growing, and that there is much interest towards online retail.
Another exciting response was that 11.11 was driven by many individuals and teams. Apart from working with large media houses, we also had Instagram and YouTube influencers coming up with their own content for 11.11 and sharing it with their followers. The technology that we currently have was an advantage in the success of 11.11. The personalized Daraz Mobile App made sure that our customers were actually buying what they wanted, because it creates recommendations based on individual search patterns.
Q: What were the trends you saw in terms of shopping behavior and purchases during the sale
A: An interesting observation came from the mobile phone category where we saw the Chinese, mid to high range mobile phone sellers like One Plus coming up and doing much better. This is generally a Huawei and Samsung market but we noticed more traction coming for Chinese brands. This is also something we can expect to happen in the next few years.
Q: This was the very first time 11.11 was done in Sri Lanka. What were your expectations before the sale
A: Having done Black Friday, we had the experience of handling large campaigns. However, the projection for 11.11 was larger and it was a gamble to us since Singles Day was quite a new concept to Sri Lanka. Yet the excitement and response was high. In addition, many people see Jack Ma as an inspiration and that transcends across the world. The fact that Alibaba initiated 11.11 had a lot to do with the acceptance.
Q: How did Daraz fare in the other countries on 11.11 And how was it globally
A: Globally too it broke records, and for Daraz as a group, it was something we had never experienced before. 11.11 is also used as a Stress Test for ourselves; to evaluate ourselves in terms of operations. We have been building our operations for 4 to 5 months before 11.11 to ensure that we are ready for the day of the sale.
Q: Does this mean Daraz will discontinue Black Friday
A: Daraz will continue to host Black Friday but our main focus will be on 11.11. We plan to make it big in Sri Lanka as it is in the rest of the world. We see that most retailers have taken up the Black Friday concept now, and the 2 campaigns are just 2 weeks apart and well placed right before the shopping season.
Q: What is the next big thing from Daraz
A: We are building our plans for next year. One aspect we would further expand is our logistical hubs, and increase it from 14 to over 20 across the country. We will also introduce a swipe-on-delivery option, apart from the existing cash-on-delivery facility, which will be exclusive to our DEX (Daraz Express) rider base. We will focus on bringing in a global collection.
Q: Daraz has been the catalyst in introducing online trends to Sri Lanka. How receptive have your customers been, and how has this influenced the overall online retail industry in Sri Lanka
A: We are introducing international standards to Sri Lanka in terms of selling online, which makes it easier for other e-commerce platforms as well as start-ups. The Daraz University brings knowledge not only to our sellers, but also to the whole industry and as a result the online retail market is growing.

Deliciously artsy cookies
Sometimes when youre creative, it can be hard to limit yourself to just one path. After all, theres inspiration everywhere, and there are so many interesting ways to create art!
Thats what happened to Holly Fox of Los Angeles. When faced with the decision to become a graphic designer or a baker, she found it too hard to pick just one. So she picked both!
It might seem like baking and graphic design have nothing in common, but if youve ever drooled over a perfectly beautiful pastry or cake, then you know that a great deal of baking is about the final presentation. And with a little cleverness and attention to detail, you can, of course, turn anything into art, like the artist who turns plain old drywall into sculptures.
Check out some of Foxs cookie creations and youll see just how beautiful design and great baking go hand in hand. Her cookies are so cute, it almost seems like a shame to eat them! Almost

Discipline, keyword to accomplishment
Fiercely upholding ones integrity in the face of challenges and performing ones duty to country and society are values instilled in Head Boy Mustafa Qaidjohar and Head Girl Zenab Zoeb of Burhani Serendib School, Bambalapitiya. Perfect Prefects features these two leaders who are being moulded to achieve that very purpose.
Head Girl Zenab Zoeb feels that the troubles and distress in society are mostly of our own making, stating that a lot of our problems stem from our mindset.
Issues like racism, terrorism, intolerance towards those who are different can be attributed to this. Even Global warming and War can be solved if we just change our mindset. We need to work for the betterment and good of mankind. At my age, I do not have abundant resources to do much about this. The goal right now is to focus on what I am doing right now so that when I grow up I can turn into a responsible citizen. When we are well informed and well moulded, when we grow up, we can take up these issues and solve them. Todays issues may not be tomorrows issues because we live in fast-changing times with technology changing so fast, explained Zoeb.
Vital strength
Zoeb stated that achieving certain goals is no easy matter and knowing what you want at the very beginning before you start something definitely helps. She says that while you are working towards what you want, you need to keep in mind that you should not give up. Knowing your strengths is vital. Often there are multiple ways of achieving your goals, but if you want to succeed, your chances are better if you play to your strengths which will help in achieving your goals.
Right now I am still not 100 per cent sure about my ambition, because I am interested in the science field as well as the commerce field. So right now I am keeping my options open. So my end goal is to do what I enjoy doing. And I think when you have control over what is going on in your life, then that is when you enjoy life the most. I envision a future where I will be working for myself like an entrepreneur in whatever field I choose, and hopefully doing something that will be something new. I may go abroad or stay in Sri Lanka. So right now I am trying to gain an all-round education which will prepare me and equip me to face the future, said Zenab.
Zoeb enthusiastically says that her school, Burhani Serendib has given her ample opportunities to showcase her talents and hone her skills. She proudly says that her school has always placed a lot of trust in her and she is truly grateful for that. For this she thanks the Principal, the academic staff and the non-academic staff.
I am very much into community service projects. I was the President of the Interact Club and now am a member of the Interact District Council. I love putting a smile on someone elses face and actually making a difference. I enjoy socializing and public speaking. I took part in Sri Lanka Model United Nations which I have been taking part consecutively from 2015- 2018. MUN has been an awesome experience. The most important thing you learn is diplomacy which is very important when you enter the outside world. You learn problem-solving and how to deal with people. People may disagree with you but you learn how to reach a common consensus which works out for the greater good, pointed out Zoeb.
Moral responsibility
Zenab states that being honest and true to yourself is as important as being a responsible citizen. She again stressed on the keywords  moral sense of responsibility, humility and sense of duty.
For the betterment of the country we need to be responsible citizens and look inwards and then outwards so that the change we aspire to create, starts within us. For example, as a student in school or even as a citizen in the country, you need to make sure you are honest and true to yourself while preserving our roots and traditions. You need to have a sense of integrity. As human beings, we should have this moral sense of responsibility within ourselves. Everything we do should be channelled towards the betterment of humankind. We should be able to give back to country, society and school through what we are doing and stay humble, added Zoeb.
She placed much emphasis on remaining true to your roots and origins while expanding your horizons at the same time, saying that it is all about finding that balance.
If you want to bring some change to the world, in order for it to be accepted you need to follow the accepted social norms to get to where you want to be in the end. So you need to strike that balance between tradition and progress. I find solace in the things that are close to heart like family and religion, said Zoeb.
Happy performance
Head Boy Mustafa Qaidjohar asserted that you need not follow Stereotypes. At the end of the day, you need to be happy while performing your duty to society. Ultimately you are not running a race against others.
I think to succeed one thing you need is self- awareness. One place where I feel we go wrong is when we try to be overly ambitious where we feel we have to excel in everything. For some people, it works, but for me what is important is that you are more aware of yourself and focus on what you are good at. Also, the work you put in makes all the difference because the more work you put in the better the results are, said Qaidjohar.
He says that right now he has not decided on what to do in the future but wants to pursue a path that will give him mental satisfaction and happiness. Entrepreneurship is an area that he finds enticing but repeats that it boils down to what makes him happy. Satisfaction, financial stability and being good at what he is doing will all fall in place when he figures out what he likes.
Studying in the Commerce field right now, what I do will be related to that stream. I too enjoy Social Service a lot, because I find genuine happiness in helping others. Anything that exposes me to the world like even public speaking is something that I value because I love networking with people. I have been part of Interact and I am in the district council now.
I am the Assistant DIR (District Interact Representative). I am the President of my Leo Club and I have been doing MUN for the past four years consecutively, explained Qaidjohar.
MUN transformed his life. He states that you get to know about global issues that you didnt even know existed. The solutions can be amazingly complex he says. He points out that during the first year you sit on the bench and learn the procedures of the UN and you learn about global issues. Then during the second and third years, you do some research and focus on finding solutions. He enthusiastically says that MUN has really improved his general knowledge. He points out that at the end of the day after all the debates and arguments when it comes to changing mindsets there is so much to learn. On one hand, you have ideas but then you have to implement those solutions in the real world. So it is a totally different challenge.
Easy competitions
The opportunities our school gives our students are endless. It can be from speech competitions, essay competitions, MUN and Interact. Our school has always placed trust in us. Our school always puts our interests first in every aspect. At our school you are always free to talk with the principal or anyone because the door is always open, pointed out Qaidjohar.
Like Zoeb he mentioned some keywords when it comes to the role we play in society. Those keywords are discipline, responsibility and attitude.
You need to think Global and act Local. As the youth, we need to have that sense of integrity. It can be the smallest thing. For example being mindful about keeping your water running in the bathroom. If everyone does this it can make a huge difference. The attitude is the important thing. So if every individual does their part there can be a huge difference. It boils down to integrity. You need to have the discipline to follow the rules. As a citizen can you keep yourself from breaking the traffic rule If everyone does that think how it could radically cut down on accidents.
Even though there is no one watching, can you keep yourself from littering the road added Qaidjohar.
Mental Health is a subject that makes him passionate and he points out that with all the chaos in society a lot of love needs to go around.
I am very passionate about mental health. Again it all boils down to mindset. I feel there is a lot of chaos in society today because people are so worried about what others think of them and they are so worried about other peoples judgements. Everyone is caught up in a rat race to prove themselves.
You need to be satisfied with yourself and what you are doing. I want to be stable on my own so I can help others, said Qaidjohar.
