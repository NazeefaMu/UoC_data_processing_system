116th Battle of the Blues starts at Matara today
The preamble to the laws of cricket states that 'Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its Laws but also within the Spirit of the Game and any action which is seen to abuse this spirit causes injury to the game itself' and hence it is hoped that both teams would uphold the spirit of the game when St Servatius College host St Thomas College at the Uyanwatta Stadium for
the 116th edition of Matara's Battle of the Blues on the 25th, 26th and 27th of March!
This call is made as the game was shamed by a few players in the final few minutes of the 114th encounter in 2014 and the one day encounter last year (2015) between these two prestigious colleges in Matara !
The Servatians led by Ashen Deemantha this season play in division one of the schools cricket tournament and have an edge in this three day encounter, but the gritty Thomians led by Nimantha Kavishwara who play in division two of the schools cricket tournament are capable of holding their fort.

They won on first innings against Dharmasoka, Gurukula and Lumbini while conceeding the first innings to Isipathana and Richmond. No decission was reached in the match with Moratu Vidyalaya. St Servatius reached the semi final stage of the division one tournament.

Govt cannot be toppled by dashing coconuts: Mangala

Referring to the coconut dashing rituals practiced by the joint opposition, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that this only shows the bankruptcy and lack of political foresight by those loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Samaraweera in a lighter vein said if former President Rajapaksa wants to learn about how to topple governments he should consult him instead of engaging in futile exercises such as coconut dashing.
He said that acts like coconut dashing goes on to show the desperation and the lack of political stability within the Rajapaksa group.
Samaraweera noted the above replying to queries by the media after opening a private business enterprise in the Kurunegala.

No stocks at bars if people were supplied liquor at March 17 rally: Keheliya

If everyone participated in the Joint Opposition rally on March 17 at the Hyde Park Grounds, Colombo had bottles sticking out of their armpits, it would have apparently caused all bars and spirit outlets in the Colombo district to go out of stock, Joint Opposition Leader and former minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
"All bottles would have gone out of display from every bar shelve in the province if that had been the case," he said.
He was speaking at the weekly press briefing of the Joint Opposition.
Rambukwella was reacting to a speech by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made at the Gampaha Balamandala meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) three days ago, where she said that people came to March 17 rally of the Joint Opposition because they were supplied with bottles of liquor.
Ranbukwella said: "I must say that the act she put on to display how a drunk person would wander, waver and stagger with a bottle under his armpit, appeared so real, as in real life."
"On the contrary, I think that sometimes it is necessary to put some act to pacify oneself when one is in shock and in fear," he said.
"However I wish that they do not display such behaviour to underestimate the people or to mock them," he added.

Govt taxing the ordinary to please IMF - Dinesh

MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said in Parliament that the government was imposing more taxes on the ordinary people while curtailing their relief measures to satisfy the IMF.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayaka on the economic situation of the country.
Gunawardena said the government was planning to bring in a Contingency Bill to manage the EPF and ETF as of a condition laid by the IMF and added that the Bill would affect the people negatively. He said the IMF had also asked to privatize the three state banks. The parliamentarian asked whether the government agrees to these conditions.
MP Gunawardena said the first grant of the IMF loan of USD 1.1billion would not be facilitated if the government does not agree to the conditions laid by the IMF. He said the government is preparing to present a mini-budget to cater to the IMF conditions.
Commenting on the Colombo Port City Project, the MP demanded that the ministers who were vociferous critics of the project should resign from their portfolios, as the Prime Minister is to sign the agreements for the project in his upcoming Chinese tour. Criticising the economic management of the government, the MP asked what had the government done with the USD 2 billion saved from the drop in oil prices in the world market.

Toppling government, a myth - Gayantha
The toppling of this government by the joint opposition is a myth as the people voted the government to stop the "commission game" in the name of development, Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that the previous Rajapaksa government only needed to remain in power by commencing massive scale development projects which did not benefit the public and added that due to this reason the country entangled in a debt trap.
"Due to this reason this government has had to take loans to settle those debts and the interest," Minister Karunathilake said. "But we would settle the loans taken by the previous regime and also develop the economy of the country as we promised during the elections," the minister said.
The minister made these observations during the adjournment debate moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday on the economic situation of the country.
He said the Mahinda Rajapaksa government missed a golden opportunity to develop the country and they acted in a manner that paved way for them to leave two years before the expiration of their term.
"When JR Jayewardene was elected in 1977, he implemented the Mahaweli Project to increase the electricity generation by two-fold," Minister Karunathilake said. "But Mahinda Rajapaksa government built ports that ships do not come, airports where planes don't land and stadiums where games are not played."
Karunathilake said the previous government implemented all these projects to boast and to earn commissions and added that the previous government had reduced the exports by 50 percent compared with the exports when the UNP handed over the government in 2005.
The minister also said that the in 2005 the amount of the commercial loans was 4 percent but it had been very high when the UNP took over the government. He said the World Bank and the IMF refused to grant loans to Sri Lanka as it spent money on unnecessary projects, which led the previous government to take commercial loans.
"They had put a number of government institutions in the debt trap during their regime. For example the CEB had to settle a loan of Rs. 10 billion in 2005 but it had been increased to Rs. 200 billion by now," Minister Karunathilake said. "The SriLankan Airlines earned a profit when it was under Emirates. But now it is Rs. 134 billion indebted."
"They asked to hand over the government and they would show as to how the government would be run."
He said that the government had to settle Rs. 44 billion the previous government had taken as loans to construct roads and added that there is a global economic draw back that the government has had to face.
Karunathilake said it was obvious that the government has the international support just by the fact that the Indian government gave a loan to Sri Lanka.
"However as we promised to build a new country within 60 months the Cabinet would do it under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," Minister Karunathilake said. "This government would remain at least for 10 years.
"The government would not be able to be toppled until its term would complete," Karunathilake said.

Unsuccessful Chinese projects will turn into profitable ventures - Sajith
Housing and Construction Minister, Sajith Premadasa told Parliament yesterday that unsuccessful projects funded by the Chinese government during the previous regime will be turned into successful and profitable ventures by the government following a study tour in China.
"The Opposition is asking us whether we are shameless to go to China. But the real question is why the previous government bought a malfunctioning coal power plant for Norochcholai.
They should be shameful for that. Former Power and Energy Minister Pravithra Wanniarachchi herself admitted that the machines of the Norochcholai power plant stopped functioning at least on 30 occasions. "You did not listen to anyone and not allowed any opponent to speak during your regime.
The truth is that we inherited a ruined economy.
The economy was directed for the benefit of the rulers during the previous regime. Our government, the people, even the unborn have to bear the debt burden and the economic misadventures of the previous government," he said.

SriLankan, Air Bus MoU resulted in US$ 1.5 b loss
The MOU signed between the SriLankan Airlines and Air Bus Ltd to obtain wide body aircraft during the previous regime had resulted in losses amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion, Highways and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the adjournment motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday on the current economic situation of the country.
Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said the agreement was signed in March 2013 and added that the agreement was signed at the then Speaker's Residence.
He said that any agreement that SriLankan Airlines signs should be signed at its head office. He questioned as to why the same agreement was signed at the Speaker's Residence.
He also said the then Speaker had nothing to do with the high ranking politician who was behind the deal present at the occasion. Wickramaratne said it was a financial crime and should be probed.
He said the total loss of the SriLankan Airlines is expected to reach Rs. 150 million at the end of this month.
"Some promote that any state institution should remain with the government, no matter the heavy losses it incurs to the government," Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said. "But actual issue is not the ownership but its probability".

Bringing people to Hyde Park cannot cover up corruption, waste - Ravi
The corruption and waste committed during the previous regime cannot be covered up by bringing people to Hyde Park, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said the details of those corruptions would be divulged to the parliament one at a time and added that there is a disparity between the genuine expenditures of the previous government and what is noted in the accounts. Karunanayake said the missing amounts in the documents have been put into the pockets of the rulers of the previous regime.
The minister made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday and continued until yesterday evening.
This government had to take over a country which was indebted Rs. 1,774 billion. The income of the government was not adequate even to pay the recurrent expenditure.
Karunanayake said during the previous regime 1,800 cars were bought for Presidential Secretariat. The incumbent President even today does not know as to what had happened to them. The loss of this is around Rs. 35 billion.
"The loan that has to be settled on Hambantota Port is Rs 18,800 million," Minister Karunanayake said. "The previous government said the Hambantota Port earned a profit of Rs. 15 billion in 2014. But genuinely it is Rs 1.5 billion".
He said it was impossible to cover up these corruptions by bringing people to the Hyde Park.
The approval was given to spend Rs. 41 billion in 2004 but Rs. 95 billion has been spent. The building of the Finance Ministry is 75,000 square metres. Even the estimate of a square foot of a five star hotel is around Rs 12,000. But a Rs 31,000 has been spent on one square foot of this building.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa government has granted two-fold amount to construct the Norochchole Coal Power Plant that former President Chandrika Kumarathunga agreed.
Karunanayake said the UNP government agreed to construct the Southern Expressway at a cost of Rs. 42 billion in 2004 but the Mahinda Rajapaksa government constructed it at a cost of Rs 95 billion and added that it was an increase of 100 percent.
"Sarath N Silva who said he freed Mahinda Rajapaksa from counts against him when he was CJ is working with him now," Minister Karunanayake said and added that "These people who have double standards are questing the purity of this government".
The minister said that Mahinda Rajapaksa during his speech at the Hyde Park criticised the Courts. It was contempt of Court.
He said that a lead story of a Sinhala language newspaper had said that 100 MPs had liquor permits. But it was misleading and they had been granted since 2004 and none of the members of this government are among those MPs.

'Government working on number of projects to rescue country'
The government is working on a number of projects to rescue the country and the people from a parlous situation where there are a port without ships, an airport without planes and a conference centre without conferences, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said in Parliament yesterday.
The projects we are pursuing include a 1,000-acre industrial zone near the Hambantota port, an aviation hub for Mattala Airport as well as trade and logistics centres in the surrounding area, Minister Samarawickrama said.
The port will also be further developed. These plans are designed to reduce the massive debt burden imposed upon the people by the previous regime. The previous government pursued a policy which was inappropriate for a country like Sri Lanka. The quality of these investments was so poor that they are not earning or saving foreign exchange. Instead they have merely resulted in building up of an unsustainable debt burden. About US$ 8 billion was incurred as external debt, which contributed to financing white elephant projects like the port, airport, conference centre and the cricket stadium in Hambantota.
The minister made these observations during the adjournment debate moved by the Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday on the current economic situation of the country.
"Our government is hopeful that it can transform these projects which have already imposed an onerous burden on the people into viable businesses earning valuable foreign exchange through increased taxes and or a diversion of resources from high priority public expenditure, such as hospitals and schools.
"We are determined to restore the growth momentum in the economy to create high value employment rather than merely increase the size of an already over-sized public service in an unsustainable manner and to invigorate our export performances with the support of increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In this connection, it is extremely counter-productive that our efforts to create the conditions to attract investment and generate employment for our youth are being attacked for no good reason. The Partnership Agreements we are negotiating with China and India have the potential to be the corner stones of our development process.
"These agreements can give us access to capital, markets, technology, training and know-how to transform the economy for the benefit of our people. Those who are leading the campaign to attack our efforts should be aware that they are, in fact, undermining the path to prosperity of our people for narrow and self interested political gain. He said, over the last five years, the previous government substituted foreign commercial borrowing for the declining ODA. As this money was much more expensive, a high premium had to be attached to the prudent use of these borrowed resources. However, the opposite happened. Much of this expensive borrowings, which have to be paid back by the people, was wasted in the pursuit of a highly personalized family agenda.

JVP Leader questions transparency of tender procedure
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday questioned in Parliament the transparency of tender procedure on the project to construct 65,000 houses to resettle the displaced in the North and East.
He charged that a massive financial fraud had occurred during this tender procedure. Dissanayake pointed out the cost of a housing unit, which was earlier estimated at Rs 1.2 million, had been increased up to Rs 2.1 million.
The JVP Leader said this amount was questionable as the cost of a housing unit constructed under the housing project undertaken by India stands at Rs. 550,000 and the cost of a housing unit constructed with the EU funds stands at Rs. 650,000.
Dissanayake questioned whether the lowest bidder had been selected during the tender procedure. He said separate tenders should have been called for the construction of houses and supply of housing equipment to those houses and added that it was wrong to merge the two into one tender.
The MP also queried on an alleged financial irregularity on renting of a building by the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry. He stated the initial government valuation which was Rs. 3 million per month for this building had been revised following a request of the ministry secretary to Rs. 4.2 million. He said the amount misappropriated in this way for the renting period of three years would be Rs. 43.2 million.

'No-Confidence Motion against Amaratunga'
Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage yesterday said in Parliament that a No-Confidence Motion would be presented against Land Minister John Amaratunga shortly.
He said the minister presented a false and distorted response to a question posed by him in Parliament on Wednesday, adding that the House lost the confidence on him due to this act.
Aluthgamage said the minister's reply to the House was contrary to the actual answer provided by the ministry secretary for the question posed by him. He also tabled the answer prepared by the ministry secretary with regard to the question.
The parliamentarian pointed out the Minister Amaratunga was deliberately trying to mislead the House. The MP asked in Parliament on Wednesday whether the government is attempting to take over a land known as Imbulpitiya Watta situated in Pasbage Divisional Secretariat Division in Nawalapitiya Electorate in which a Teachers' Village had been constructed.
The minister in response to the question said that he personally visited this location and found out that this particular land belonging to a Maha Vidyalaya had been divided into pieces and distributed among a group of selected people with the involvement of MP Aluthgamage.
He said the school had been deprived of a playground due to this act, adding that 21 land plots had been given to the friends of the MP, while the Principal and the OIC had also received land plots. He said the Land Reforms Commission had not given approval for this move.
However, at this point the MP argued that the LRC approval was given for the purpose.
The minister said the matter would be forwarded to the Attorney General as there are doubts on the legality of the activity.

'Considerable growth in economy'
Special Projects Minister, Dr. Sarath Amunugama told Parliament yesterday that there has been a considerable growth in the economy in 2015 with 4.8 percent growth of GDP.
As for the sub sectors, an agricultural sector recorded a growth of 5.5 percent and 3 percent growth was recorded in the industrial sector.
The service sector too had a growth of 5.3 percent. Sri Lanka has become self-sufficient in rice production. The paddy production is 4.8 million metric tones last year while it was only 4.2 million metric tones in 2014. Paddy has been cultivated in more than one million hectares across the country. Most of the government institutions have obtained huge loans from the state banks during the former regime.
The actual amount has not even been reported in documents. The loss of SriLankan Airlines is more than the amount allocated for education and health.

This was the first time that CEB officials were summoned before the COPE in connection with a power failure.
It was revealed that the COPE was not contended with the CEB's stance that the interruptionsoccurred not due to their inefficiency. The Parliamentary sources revealed that the CEB officials were of the stance that power had to be cut due to the coal power plant's security measure of turning itself off when a transformer bursts.

Aussie Watson says will retire after World T20
Mohali, Thursday: Veteran Australian all-rounder Shane Watson announced Thursday that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the ongoing World Twenty20 tournament in India.
Watson, 34, shared his decision to call it quits with teammates in Mohali, where Australia take on Pakistan in a World T20 group match on Friday, Cricket Australia said.
"It's been over the last week that it's really become clear that now really is the right time to retire from all international cricket," Watson said in a statement issued by the national cricket body.
Watson had retired from Test cricket at the end of last year's Ashes tour of England and has not played one-day internationals since September last year.
An opening batsman and a reliable pacer, Watson scored 5,757 runs from 190 ODIs.
He also took 168 ODI wickets and holds the Australian record for the highest ODI score, an unbeaten 185 against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2011.
Always a dangerous player in the shortest format, he has belted out 1,400 runs from 56 T20 internationals so far while taking 46 wickets.
Watson was the last surviving player of the Australian golden era, having played along the likes of Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist.
"I really enjoyed my time being back in the Australian squad but, it is quite different," Watson, a father of two, said.
"None of the other guys that I played with growing up are here anymore." - AFP

In 1911 Lady Elizabeth Clifford (the wife of the acting Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hugh Clifford) was interested in the annual rugby football fixture, Colombo versus Up Country, and expressed a wish that a match takes place in Colombo on her birthday, 26 August, between teams representing the Kandy United Services and All Ceylon.
Due to unforeseen circumstances the scheduled date was put off by a week and the first Lady Clifford Cup match (as it was originally called) was played on 2 September 1911, with the Kandy United Services team defeating All Ceylon 25 points to 0. The All Ceylon team was composed entirely of European expatriates and the United Services team of members of the army and police force.
1926-1938
The competition was suspended until 1926 due to the war. In 1925 Sir Hugh Clifford returned to Ceylon as the Governor of Ceylon and Lady Clifford, who was keen to revive the Clifford Cup tournament, donated another trophy for the competition in 1926. This time the Clifford Cup was awarded to the winner of a quadrangular tournament between four teams; Up- Country, Low Country Ceylonese and the Kandy United Services. The competition pitted the Low Country against UP Country and Ceylonese against Kandy United Services, with the respective winners competing for the cup. The first tournament in 1926 featured, Ceylonese a team composed entirely of locally born players. lost their match against the Kandy United Services team, 3-6. The cup was eventually won by Low Country, 14-3. The following year Ceylonese defeated Kandy United Services 16-8, before losing to the cup winners, Up Country, 11-8.
1950- Introduced to club championship
The competition then continued until 1938, when it was disrupted by the advent of the Second World War. In 1950 the Ceylon Rugby Football Union now (SLRFU) decided to grant official status to the league rugby tournament and the Clifford Cup was converted to an inter-club competition played among eight clubs, Kandy Sports Club, Dimbulla Athletic & Cricket Club, Dickoya Maskeliya Cricket Club, Uva Gymkhana Club, Kelani Valley Club, Havelock Sports Club, CR and FC and CH and FC The Havelocks Sports Club won the inaugural cup in that year, and also in the following year. In 1953 Dimbulla became the first club from Up-Country to win the Clifford Cup by defeating the previous year's cup holders CR and FC .
The Kandy Sports Club made their first appearance in a Clifford Cup final in 1954, where they lost 21-5 against CR & FC. The cup was shared for the first time in 1959 when Dimbulla and Ceylonese R & FC competed in an 11-all draw.
In the early 1960's the "B" division clubs, Army, Air Force, Kandy Lake Club Police, Peradeniya University and Navy ' were invited to join the tournament and play against the 'constituent clubs', forming a thirteen team competition. The format of the competition was also changed, whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the league season the best eight teams competed in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
In 1992 the Clifford Cup final was held in Kandy at Nittawella Stadium, the first time the cup final to be played outside of Colombo since 1957, at which Kandy SC defeated Police SC, by 22-9. On that occasion both CR & FC and CH and FC boycotted the competition. The Cup final, since 1992, has been held in Kandy with the exception being in 2006 when it was switched back to Colombo, Kandy Sports Club have won the Clifford Cup on 19 occasion first being in 1992 , 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015. CR and FC first won in 1952 have pocketed on 14 occasions 1952, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1965, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1987, 1988, 1989, 2006.

Gallant Afghans give England a fright

DELHI: The lack of inexperience showed in the Afghanistan line up as they threw away a golden opportunity of beating a full-fledged ICC member team when they went down to England by 15 runs in a ICC World T20 Group 2 match played at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Wednesday.
Afghanistan had England down on their knees at the end of the 18th over at 107-7 but the final two overs they leaked a massive 35 runs to give their opponents some breathing space. England who won the toss and batted first eventually reached a respectable 142-7 courtesy an unbroken stand of 57 off 5.3 overs between Moeen Ali and David Willey for the eighth wicket.
Moeen slammed four fours and a six for his unbeaten 41 off 33 balls and Willeys 20 not out off 17 balls comprised two sixes.
That total was enough for the England bowlers to defend as both Willey and Chris Jordan made early inroads into the Afghan batting by reducing them to 13-3 by the third over a position from which they failed to recover from and were restricted to 127-9 thanks to some lusty hitting by tailender Shafiqullah who finished on 35 not out off 20 balls (2 sixes, 4 fours).
Following their magnificent win against South Africa where they chased down 231 runs, England did not do themselves any justice when they put up a spineless display of batting on a pitch that had pace and bounce on it which the Afghan spinners exploited to the full. Skipper Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shinwari and Rashid Khan had the England batting in a muddle as they tossed the ball up without any fear and found appreciable turn and bounce. England were also responsible for playing too many loose shots that cost them their wickets.
Their best batsman Joe Root was run out for 12 when Ben Stokes didnt respond to a call and Root trudged back to the dugout livid with rage. The England batting was a comedy of errors and they had to thank Moeen and Willey for preventing them from total disgrace.
Not surprisingly Moeen Ali was named man of the match.
This was the first World T20 match of the current tournament hosted at this troubled venue which during the match it was announced that the Delhi Municipility has given the Delhi District Cricket Association all the rights to host the remaining World T20 matches including the semi-final.
Englands next game is against Sri Lanka at the same venue on Saturday.

India scrape to one-run win over Bangladesh

Bangalore, Wednesday: India scraped to a one-run win against a tenacious Bangladesh in Bangalore in a thrilling match on Wednesday, keeping their hopes of World Twenty20 glory alive.
India were restricted to 146 for seven after being sent in to bat at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, thanks to some spirited Bangladesh bowling.
Bangladesh came tantalisingly close to chasing down the total, but poor shots and three critical dismissals by skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni eventually saw the home side scramble home by the slimmest of margins.
India's group stage victory bolsters their chances of reaching the semi-finals, but they must now defeat Australia on Sunday to secure a place in the final four.
But defeat means that Bangladesh, who have lost all three of their Super 10 games so far, have no chance of progressing further.
Opener Tamim Iqbal top-scored for Bangladesh with 35 off 32 balls, before he was stumped by the Indian skipper just as he was looking dangerous. The aggressive batsman put on 44 runs with Sabbir Rahman for the second wicket, but Rahman was also stumped for 26 as he looked to carry on the momentum.
Shakib Al Hasan made a quick-fire 22 off 15 before he was caught by Suresh Raina at slip off Ravichandran Ashwin.
Soumya Sarkar managed 21 as the required runs were gradually ticked off, but Indian spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin kept their cool under pressure and continued to take wickets.
With Bangladesh needing 10 runs off five balls in a gripping final over sent down by Hardik Pandya, Mushfiqur Rahim (11) smashed two consecutive fours, before holing out to Shikhar Dhawan on the mid-wicket boundary.
With two runs needed from two balls, Mahmudullah was inexplicably also caught in the deep for 18. Incoming batsman Mustafizur Rahman had no choice but to race down the wicket, after Shuvagata Hom stabbed and missed the final ball, and was run out by Dhoni.
Confirmation of the dismissal by the TV umpire sent the crowd and the Indian team into wild celebrations. India, with one loss and one win heading into Wednesday's match, couldn't afford to lose if they were to keep their dream alive of becoming the first country to win the World T20 title twice. - AFP

Pakistani greats call for overhaul
Islamabad,Thursday: Pakistani cricketing greats called for an overhaul of the national team and the country's domestic infrastructure following back-to-back defeats in the World Twenty20 that have ensured a likely early exit for the former champions.
After triumphing against Bangladesh, the 2009 winners suffered sound beatings at the hands of arch-rivals India and then New Zealand that have left their campaign teetering on the brink.
Fast-bowling legend Wasim Akram said the team had been exposed in all departments and were miles behind their competitors. Speaking to Pakistan's The News on Thursday, he said: "I mean we have not been doing anything right.
"In (the New Zealand) game Sharjeel's knock was the only silver lining and to some extent Sami's bowling. Otherwise we were really bad in all areas.
"What we have here is the best lot that was available in Pakistan. They are the cream. The problem is that most of them aren't world class and for that I blame our system, which is extremely faulty," he said.
"Our cricket is 10 years behind the modern game. We are lagging behind teams like New Zealand because we haven't updated or upgraded our system. You can't keep repeating your mistakes and then expect different results."
Ageing captain Shahid Afridi has also come under fire for his declining form and lack of tactical nous. The 36-year-old, who is widely expected to retire when Pakistan conclude their campaign, began the tournament with a match-winning 49 but was blasted for failing to pick a specialist spinner on a turning Eden Gardens track against India.
His darting leg-spin, which was crucial to Pakistan's success in years gone by, has also looked unthreatening.
"The man who is unpredictable and no one knows how he will perform is playing as a team captain," said batting legend Javed Miandad on Pakistan's Aaj TV channel.
Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar meanwhile said on Wednesday that the team had thrown away a match-winning position against New Zealand by failing to promote wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed up the order after openers Sharjeel Khan and Ahmed Shehzad had laid the foundation for a successful chase. - AFP

Record partnership fails to stop Australia from winning
DELHI: A record second wicket partnership of 75 for Sri Lanka between skipper Chamari Atapattu and Dilani Manodara who both made identical scores of 38 apiece failed to stop defending champs Australia from winning by nine wickets in a crucial World Twenty20 Women's cricket match played at Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Thursday.
Three-time champions Australia cruised to their target of 124 through their second wicket pair Elyse Villani and captain Meg Lanning who put on 98 runs off 13.1 overs without being separated after losing Alyssa Healy for 12 in the fifth over.
On a placid pitch the Lankan bowlers had to come up with something special to stop Australia, but it was not forthcoming and Villani who was named Player of the Match and Lanning batted without any difficulty to remain unbeaten on 53 off 39 balls (9 fours) and 52 off 52 balls (7 fours) respectively when victory was achieved with 14 balls to spare.
Sri Lanka failed to build on the start given by Atapattu and Manodara and from 89-3 from 13 overs, lost their way and eventually ended disappointingly on 123-8. They managed only 34 off the last seven overs and lost four wickets.
What was impressive about the Lankan Women's batting during the record breaking partnership was the running between the wickets of Atapattu (38 off 32 balls, 4 fours) and Manodara (38 off 35 balls, 5 fours) that had the Australians rattled for a while.
They batted with a positive intent constantly stealing singles and putting the Australian fielders under pressure. Even the bowlers struggled to maintain a consistent line and length against the right-left hand combination.
But once the pair was separated, Australia tightened the screws on the rest of the batting and did not concede a single boundary in the last 26 balls. It was the first time the two countries had met in a T20 International and it ended on a disappointing note for Sri Lanka.
Atapattu said she was proud of her batting performance and that they tried to score more runs in the first 10 overs but was disappointed they lost too many wickets towards the end.
Lanning paid tribute to Sri Lanka's top order batting and said that they got off to an excellent start and it looked like they would be chasing something like 140-150, but her bowlers managed to pull it back towards the end which left them with a chase able target.
Sri Lanka who has one win over Ireland under their belt will play South Africa in their final group match at Bangalore on March 28.

Sandaruwani - one of the best hockey players produced by Sangamitta BV
Sandaruwani Jayaratne, an 18 year old lass from Sangamitta Balika Vidyalaya, Matale is an enormously talented hockey player and one of the best to come out of the portals of that school.
A very persevering type and a good fighter against odds and does not accept defeat lying down. She fights all the way to come out victorious.
Just look at this. A little girl still in her teens was left out of the Central Province ladies hockey team for the National Sports Festival. She attended the trials and did well in the selection match playing a key role in the only goal scored by her team. But still could not gain the nod of the Central Province selectors. Others would have thrown in the towel but not her. She had confidence in herself and she can make it to the top and she did reach the top.
A month after her dropping from the Central Province team she gave her detractors a slap across their faces when she attended the Sri Lanka hockey selections trials and found a place in the national team at the 12th South Asian Games 2016 held in Guwahati, India. This was also the first time that a hockey championship for ladies was conducted in the history of South Asian Games.
The talent of this teenage girl has to be seen to be believed. A very aggressive centre forward who has been playing for her school's senior team from the age of 13. In addition to this she also played for the under 13, under 15 and under 17 teams simultaneously. Another record which is hard to equal or break in this hockey town which is oozing with talent.
Her friends call her affectionately 'chocolate' because of her fondness for chocolates which she always carries in her pocket. She has no hockey in the blood as her two sisters Sachintha and Achini never played the game. It was with courage and self-determination she took to this with curved stick.
She first played hockey at the age of 10 and she was so good at it she was blooded into the senior team. It was not only hockey she played for the school as she excelled at elle, athletics and a little cricket.
Having successfully played for her school in all age group levels she played for the Sri Lanka Schools in 2012 and won Sri Lanka School colours for hockey in 2012 and 2014. She also represented the Sri Lanka Schools at the Junior National sin 2011 and also for the Junior Asia Cup in 2012 and scored two goals in one of the matches which Sri Lanka won 3-0.
At the Central Province schools under 19 hockey championship in 2014 she was adjudged the Best Player of the tournament. She captained the Matale District schools in 2014 and 2015 and also represented the country at junior level on many tours.
In the year 2015 her School Sangamitta Balika Vidyalaya won the Nationals hockey championship for girls schools, almost in the first minute of play she was injured with a torn ligament and if it was anybody else would have limped off the field. But she played on and along with Nawanjana Ekanayake played a key role in her school winning the championship title. When 'No side' was blown she lay prostrate in the ground in pain. She had continued to play in pain and lifted the morale of the team to beat Visakha Vidyalaya 2-0.
She took treatment and the doctor's orders were that her legs should be in plaster for two weeks. When the school had the felicitation ceremony for the hockey players she had to be carried to this venue as she could not walk because of the injury. But she had played the final match in full but in pain.
That is Sandaruwani the dedicated and brilliant hockey player. Her parents could hardly afford the expenses incurred in playing hockey and they dig deep into their pockets so that the home town Matale produces another top hockey player.

SLFP no one's cat's paw - CM

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said the genuine Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members are never ready to be a cat's paw of anyone to split the party.
He said around 35 Western Provincial Council members, who supported former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have already expressed their support to President Maithripala Sirisena.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP Head Quarters yesterday.
Asked whether the Joint Opposition is a threat to the SLFP, he said there is no need to panic about the Joint Opposition. Many SLFP Parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition are with the party leadership now.
He said that whatever said, SLFP Parliamentarians hold all key portfolios in the government. The President also represents the SLFP.
"Therefore, it is baseless to say that this is a UNP government when all key ministries are headed by SLFP members," he said.
Chief Minister Dewapriya added that all honest SLFPers including Local Government members are with the party leadership, while a few who committed various acts of misconduct are still supporting former President Rajapaksa.
"President Sirisena never protects persons involved in malpractices including financial frauds. The SLFP could win the hearts of the minorities under President Siisena's leadership" he said.
Parliamentarian Manusha Nanayakkara said the last government was defeated by the people for its misrule and malpractices including assassinations of journalists, monetary fraud, financial misconduct etc.
However, the SLFP is on a forward march to win the next Local Government election spearheaded by party leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
"Under the guidance of President Sirisena, moves are under way to create a broader alliance aiming to secure victory at the forthcoming elections. There is only one SLFP and one UPFA," he said. Resettlement Minister M.L.A.M.Hizbullah said around 11,000 families have to be resettled in the North and East. A committee has been appointed to look into the resettlement programme and furnish suggestions in this regards.
Asked whether the Sinhala people residing in the North and East are discriminated under the government's resettlement programme, the minister noted that no one is discriminated against.If there is any injustice, it is the duty of those persons to complain to the Ministry.
When he was questioned whether tender procedures are being violated by his Ministry, the minister said that a full scale investigation is being carried out into this issue.

turned on the torch while Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was making a ministerial statement on the power cuts, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya advised him to turn off the torch and take his seat. The MP urged the government to provide each citizen with a torch as
regular power cuts have become a normal event these days.
