Pakistan cricket chief Sethi resigns
KARACHI, Monday: Pakistan cricket chief Najam Sethi resigned on Monday following speculation in recent days that he would be forced out by the countrys newly elected Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The two were involved in a bitter, public feud in recent years, after Khan accused Sethi of election fraud to help former premier Nawaz Sharifs party win the 2013 election.
Sethi, who was appointed to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) by Sharif, denied the allegation and sued Khan for defamation.
His three-year term as chairman was due to end in 2020, but his departure was widely expected following Khans victory.
It is only proper that you should assume charge and responsibility for assembling a management team for PCB that enjoys your full confidence and trust,  Sethi wrote in his resignation letter, which was posted on his Twitter page and the PCB website.
I wish PCB all the best and hope our cricket team goes from strength to strength, he tweeted.
Prime Minister Khan nominated former International Cricket Council president Ehsan Mani as Sethis replacement.
(Mani) brings vast and valuable experience to the job,  Khan tweeted.
There is a history of Pakistans cricket chiefs being replaced when new governments come in. Sethi is also editor of The Friday Times, a national news weekly, in which he has often been critical of Khan. The magazine runs a regular column -- satirical diary entries by Khan -- called Im the Dim.
In 2016, Sethi led the launch of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), a high-profile domestic Twenty20 tournament that has been widely credited with the rise of the national 20-over side. Pakistan are currently the top-ranked T20 team in the world.
Several high-profile matches featuring foreign players were also played on Pakistani soil under Sethis leadership, seen as major steps in resuming regular international cricket in the country -- halted after a 2009 terror attack on the Sri Lankan team in the eastern city of Lahore.  AFP

The State Photography Festival 2018
Prized click
To coincide with the world photography day The State Festival of Photography 2018 and the award ceremony was staged for the third consecutive year at the Nelum Pokuna on August 19 with the distinguished participation of the President Maithripala Sirisena.
The festival was held from August 19 to 21 at the Nelum Pokuna.
The President Sirisena in his message has said the art of photography could make a significant impact on the society that cannot be achieved even through protests or demonstrations.
Cultural Affairs Director Anusha Gokula Fernando who has spearheaded the endeavour of staging an award ceremony to recognize Sri Lankan photographers made the welcome address. She said the objective of this exercise is to introduce local photo artistes to the international arena and thereby heighten the level of this expressive art.
She said this time around the judging panel had to shortlist from 3537 submissions to select the cream of photographers to be felicitated.
State Advisory Council of Photography Chairman, senior photographer Berty Gunasekera said this years theme of the festival has been, Ecological impact of human activities.
We could categorize photographers into two divisions. One is reporting any incident as we see and the second is a creation that expresses its qualitative value using the photographical language, he said.
A gamut of versatile and amateur photographers was felicitated and their works were recognized at the event.
Photo academyto be set up
Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs, Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha speaking at the occasion assured a photo academy will be commissioned soon to train budding photographers the true essence of the art.
In 1685 Johann Zahn introduced a portable camera for the first time. Ever since then the art of photography has evolved and it eventually shed light on cinematography. Celluloid technology of the cinema industry was then taken over by digital technology. However the origin of all these is, still-photography, said the minister.
A motionless photograph could express an idea that could shed light on transformation of society. I wish the courage and strength for all our photographers to develop their professional skills to great levels, at this occasion, he said.
The State Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Mohan Lal Grero too graced the occasion.
Lifetime felicitationaward to a veteran
In recognition of his unmatchable service to the art of photography and to the nation the Lifetime felicitation award was bestowed on Henry Rajakaruna at the event. The award was presented by the President Maithripala Sirisena.
Henry Rajakaruna has learned photography as a child from the veteran Wilson Hegoda.
He has won his first international award when schooling. Ever since then Rajakaruna has represented many international events to win an array of awards and accolades to bring glory to his motherland. This legendary photographer now at the age of 77 still engages in photography.

Rajapaksa fears Gotabhayas rise to power: Indunil
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his kin fear the political success of the three Rajapaksa brothers; Gotabhaya, Basil and Chamal; Parliamentarian Thushara Indunil said.
He was addressing a press briefing held at the United National Party Headquarters, yesterday.
If Gotabhaya rises to power, they know that Mahinda or his son would not be able take it from him. They also fear that the leadership of the Pohottuwa party will go to Gotabhaya as well. They fear Basil Rajapaksa, as he has a keen political sense. If Chamal comes to power, they fear his son Shashindra Rajapaksa would be next in line, Indunil added.
He said it was the reason the former President wished to be the next Presidential candidate, adding that it had created a rift in the Joint Opposition (JO), with some supporting Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, some Basil and others Chamal.
The MP added that programmes such as Viyath Maga, Hari Maga and Eliya, had faded into the background.
Both Gotabhaya and Basil Rajapaksa had left to their homes in America. One said he was visiting family, while the other claimed that he was going for medical purposes, Indunil said.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa rendered a great service by ending the civil war in this country, although he now holds a minute position as an MP, similar to us. However, Mahindas attempt to become a Presidential candidate again only taints his image, MP Indunil added.
He said the JO was attempting to strengthen their presence in politics.
They claim that they would come to power in future. They said they would topple the government. During the recent local government elections, they deceived people, saying that their votes would make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister. The JO may repeat itself in September as well, he added.
Highlighting the recent incident regarding former President Rajapaksas private secretary Udith Lokubandara, the parliamentarian said that he sympathised with him.
The country laughed at Lokubandara; social media made a joke of him. If this is the way the Rajapaksas treat people who dedicated their lives to them, imagine how they would treat people such as Keith Noyahr, he said. Highlighting Keith Noyahrs case, MP Indunil said that Mahinda Rajapaksa could not evade the matter by saying he had no recollection of it.
Rajapaksa was the one who held the remote control of Noyahrs attack, Indunil alleged.
MP Indunil questioned as to how the former President wished to rule a country if his memory failed him to that extent.

Rejuvenated Djokovic eyes US Open as Big Four reunited
NEW YORK, Monday - From the pits of despair in Paris, record-setting Novak Djokovic now eyes a third US Open title in New York where for the first time since Wimbledon last year, the sports Big Four will be reunited.
Djokovic became the first man to win all nine Masters titles with victory over Roger Federer at Cincinnati on Sunday.
Having captured, against all the odds, a fourth Wimbledon in July, the 31-year-old Serb suddenly finds himself as joint-favourite with world number one Rafael Nadal to triumph at Flushing Meadows.
Champion in 2011 and 2015, and a five-time runner-up, Djokovic sat out the 2017 US Open to nurse an elbow injury.
His physical limitations were still evident when he slumped away from Roland Garros in June after a shock quarter-final loss to journeyman Marco Cecchinato, threatening to skip Wimbledon to mend his shattered self-confidence.
Fast forward three months and Djokovic is once again the man to beat.
Its a wonderful feeling. Its been a couple of tough months for me with an injury but then winning Wimbledon and Cincinnati, Djokovic said.
Djokovics Wimbledon triumph took his Grand Slam title collection to 13, just one behind Pete Sampras.
He also has 31 Masters, two back from Nadal but four more than Federer. He will head for New York buoyed by his dominance over his three major rivals as well -- he leads Nadal 27-25, Federer 24-22 and Andy Murray 25-11.
Hes a great champion, said Federer in praise of Djokovic in Cincinnati.
World number one Nadal, who won the US Open last year to add to his 2010 and 2013 victories, skipped Cincinnati after triumphing in Toronto the week before.
The Spaniard clinched an 11th French Open in June to take his majors tally to 17 before falling to Djokovic in a five-set, 5-hour 15-minute semi-final loss at Wimbledon.
Tennis is a high-demanding sport in terms of physical effort, said 32-year-old Nadal.
I cannot forget that I am older every year.
Federer also knows that the clock is ticking. The 20-time Grand Slam winner won the last of his five US Opens in 2008.
Now 37, Federer would become the oldest New York champion in the Open era should he lift the trophy again on September 9 and second oldest of all time.
FEDERER TO END 10-YEAR WAIT
But he was knocked out by 2009 champion Juan Martin del Potro in the quarter-finals last year having had to negotiate two five-setters in the opening rounds. Despite defending his Australian Open title in January, Federers hopes of a ninth Wimbledon were blown apart in a five-set loss to Kevin Anderson in the quarter-finals.
It was his earliest exit at the All England Club in five years.
Hopefully I have a chance after 10 years to do something special again at the US Open, said Federer.
I cant wait for the US Open to come around.
Murray, the 2012 champion, is set to play his first Slam since a hip injury suffered at Wimbledon last year.
His comeback has been far from smooth after spending almost a year on the sidelines and has played only seven matches since his return.
The former world number one has even seen his ranking nosedive to 378 in the world -- making him Britains eighth-best player!
Outside of the Big Four, Del Potro, at a career-high three in the world, remains a dangerman.
Amongst the widely-hyped Next Gen, world number four Alexander Zverev is still a work in progress.
The Germans run to the last-eight at the French Open this year remains his best performance at the majors while his last two visits to New York ended in a pair of second-round losses.Greek 20-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas, at 15 in the world from 161 this time last year, is the in-form youngster.
He was runner-up to Nadal in Toronto, beating four top-10 players on the way including Djokovic and Zverev.
But a loss in his opener in Cincinnati proved a sobering reminder that most probably it will be either Nadal, Djokovic or Federer who will be a New York champion again this year. b - AFP

Festival of Taniwella
Royalty deified
In archaic civilizations, kings were regarded as incarnate gods. This principle of Divine Kingship survived into later history.
- Heinrich Zimmer
The cult of a deified ruler is a living and dynamic spiritual reality, in Sri Lanka, even in our own day. Engrossing and captivating rites and rituals are performed, day and night, to propitiate deified rulers. This is amply and substantially proved by the cult of Taniwelle Deity, in Madampe.
This Taniwelle Devalaya (shrine) is extensively patronized by devotees throughout the year.
This cult has continued over a long period of time. Thronging masses of fervent worshippers gather at the annual festival of the Shrine of the Taniwelle deity, in the mouth of August. The shrine is located at the 62 km point, along the Colombo-Puttalam main road.
The well-known semi-urban settlement Madampe provides the backdrop for the sacred shrine. When you travel tourists Puttalam, on your right, at this point, you see the effigy of a White Horse. Next to it, you come upon the shrine (devale) popularly known as Madampe Taniwelle Maha Devale. This site is the sacred core of the cult of Taniwelle Deiyo.
Cult worship
Our exploration of the early era of the cult takes us to the days of King Veera Parakramabahu VIII of the Kingdom of Kotte, Sri Jayewardenepura. To all appearances, King Veera Parakramabahu VIII does not seem to have received much attention from the Authors of the National Historical Chronicle  Mahavansa. But luckily, the folk memory about this king is quite eloquent. In terms of the evidence, provided by folk sources, mass praise of the ruler, has been lavish.
Rajavaliya, a reputed historical chronicle of the land, fills the gap left by the main chronicle at least to some extent. According to this work, the king had a junior consort in addition to his chief queen. The Junior Queen had two sons, by the King.
The King, adept in state-craft, foresaw that the Princes by the Junior Queen had to be assigned tasks, away from the Palace. This stratagem was resorted to, with the intention of averting disputes at court, about succession.
The elder prince was given a Royal Commission, honouring him with the title Sakala Kala Vallabha (The Patron of All Arts). In effect, his responsibility was the development of cultural activities, emphasizing the promotion of religious institutions. King Veeraparakramabahu VIII gave his second son a strange kind of assignment. The younger prince was given the title Dhaniya Vallabha literately the phrase means the Patron of Grains. Development of Agriculture was his official duty. He had to ensure that uninterrupted food supplies were available in the land. Consequently building and maintaining tanks, reservoirs, and irrigation canals, came under his immediate purview.
This is where it all starts.
Different proposition
The masses did not have much of a problem with the expression Sakala Kala Vallabha. But, Dhaniya Vallabha was an entirely different proposition. Dhanya being a wee bit on the difficult side, masses quickly turned it into the easier version - Thaniya. Dubbed Taniya Vallabha, the Prince set to work, and transformed the region around modern Madampe, into one vast green oasis. Bumper harvests kept the people happy. Food trade flourished. Prosperity was ensured. Peace pervaded the whole society.
The inevitable outcome of all this was the emergence of an eminent folk hero: Taniya Vallabha. Prince Taniya Vallabha.
The widespread prosperity and the emergence of the new hero had to several interesting developments. Excess agricultural products  especially the food grains and cereals had to be stored safely. The coastal domain close to the new, prosperous settlement Madampe eventually turned into the reputed granary.
Madampe region evolved into a renowned trading emporium. Merchants and traders from overseas arrived there, to transact business in such commodities as Ivory, pearls, and precious stones and of course rice and other grain varieties.
Prince Taniya Vallabhas leadership resulted in the production of bumper harvests in the hinterland.
Storage facilities
The stored grains formed a highly tempting lure to the notorious tribe of sea pirates. They would raid the grains storage facilities, close to the coach, attaching unarmed, innocent people who lived in that area.
The marauding unruly pirates were led by Kadirasan Mudliyar. Extremely offended by these high handed and despicable attacks, Prince Taniya Vallabha, decided to put an end to this menace. Empowered and ably supported by the king  his father and by his loyal elder brother Prince Sakala Kala Vallabha, the daring Prince, Taniya Vallabha, in a fell swoop negated the inroads of the pirate hordes. The leader of that evil force was killed during the encounter.
The masses were, understandably elated. The victorious ruler would occasionally indulge in a speedy ride, on his favourite white steed, along the coast  and that too, all alone.
The masses promptly created an image of the ruler. Here is a god-like ruler riding all alone, along the sea-shore (Vella) in the folk mind Thaniya Vallabha, transformed into Taniwalle Deiyo. And the deification was firmly established.
The original Dhanya Vallabha became Tanivalle Deiyo, through this series of verbal transmutations.
Prince Dhaniya Vallabha (Patron Prince of Grains and Agriculture) achieved re-incarnation  through a series of verbal transmutations  as Tanivalle Deiyo.
Picturesque emergence
I am not too sure whether the rich and long history of Sri Lanka can yield a more impressive instance of a ruler being deified, than this dramatic and picturesque emergence of Tanivalle Deiyo.
Eventually, Prince Dhaniya Vallabha came to be massively adored in the form of Tanivalle Deiyo. Folk sources, at times, refer to the sight of the Prince, flashing through villages, or through the clouds in the sky, mounted on his immaculately white horse.
The cult of this legendary deity has continued over a period spanning nearly 1500 years.
At present, the Maha Devale of Tanivalle Deiyo occupies a venue that resembles a spiritual park. Fervent devotees of Tanivalle Deiyo participate in the Annual Festival associated with the Maha Devale (Maha Devale). The series of rituals begins early in the morning. Sacred ablutions and anointments form the primary facet of the Religious Festival. The days spiritual agenda culminates with the offering of alms-food to the congregation of devotees. Nearly five thousand worshippers, participate in the ceremonies.
The current curator and guardian of the Shrine is Kirthi Senanayake, who has inherited this office from his ancestors. The shrine of the deified ruler  Tanivalle Devale and the adjoining complex of Buddhist places of worship receive wide adoration. But still, the name Tanivalle Deiyo continues to baffle many, with his mysterious aura.
During seasons of abundant harvests, ardent devotees still claim to have caught a glimpse of Tanivalle Deiyo, flashing across the skies, clad in regal attire, head crowned with an elaborate turban, mounted on his gleaming white steed.
This way a deified a great ruler, can pass into the region of legends.

SL to become hot  territory, economic loss of $12 bn.  per year by 2050  - experts
Introduction
The World Bank Economists in an authoritative announcement to the local media has stated that Sri Lanka will become an extremely hot territory with 30C temperature rise and $ 12 billion per year economic loss by 2050.
Having heard so many climate scientists, including Sir Thomas Robert Watson, a former President of Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who was in Sri Lanka about a year ago, pronouncing that Sri Lankas per capita Greenhouse Gas emission is only a negligible 0.81 ton per year compared to the global average of 4.47 tons per year, we never imagined nor expected such a fate to be descending on us so soon.
Even Prof. Mohan Munasingha, Sri Lankan Vice President of IPCC was quoted in a Sri Lankan paper, in early January 2018, as saying that SLs per capita GHG emission is only a very small fraction and therefore we are not a principal offender. We always thought that nature, climate change would direct its anger towards us only after punishing others emitting much higher per capita greenhouse gas quantities.
During question time at the luncheon meeting at Galle Face Hotel, where Sir Robert explained all these using graphical presentations, stating how I saw greenhouse gas emission per unit area as a more trustworthy and relevant parameter to track, in view of Sri Lankas geographical position with corresponding air circulation models and after my comments, Sir Robert said that what I mentioned did sound reasonable. Also mentioning on a lighter note, that there are no computers in the atmosphere connected to cemeteries and maternity homes to calculate the per capita values.
Our annual greenhouse gas emission at 261 t/km2 (please note per unit area and not per capita) is more than three times the annual global average of 66 t/km2.
This is, probably, what climate scientists, including IPCC officials, wanted to hide so that they can prompt us to use more fossil fuels than we should. They also knew that using per capita emission rate is the best way to entice thickly populated countries like China and India to use more fossil fuels.
The differences
When we studied climate change, we noticed some significant aspects and differences which made Sri Lanka unique, some of which are as follows:
1) We recognised that Sri Lanka is a small island of 65,000km2 area with 70N and 810E geographical coordinates and associated air circulation patterns  namely Hadley and Walker circulations.
2) Our own measurements of CO2 concentration in our surroundings at Thalawatugoda indicated it is going beyond 500ppm towards 560 ppm.
3) These findings indicated that we are fast approaching a set up characterized by a temperature increase of 2.80C above that prior to the industrial revolution.
4) Energy we waste from transportation 30,000GWhrs per year is more than twice what we use as electrical energy  13 500GWhrs per year. This is probably the highest ratio for any country in the world and mean the value of this ratio for the whole world would be close to 1.
5) We generate 172t/km2.year of Newly Formed Water (NFW) arising from hydrogen in petrol and diesel and water was not in the Earth System earlier.
6) NFW (i) when in the atmosphere is a worse greenhouse gas than CO2 and reduces wind shear leading to high winds, (ii) when coming down could lead to cyclones, and (iii) when on the ground results in floods, and landslides. We experiencing these today.
7) Since we generate far more CO2 than the global average per unit area, this CO2 will increase temperature faster than the global average; this increased temperature brings about more water vapour to the atmosphere at the rate of 7% per 10C increase which additional water vapour increases the temperature further at the rate of twice that due to CO2 on a kg to kg basis or at a rate of 1.3 times that due to original CO2 emitted. This is why, we will reach that 30C temperature increase pretty soon.
Is there a root cause for all this projected misery
Although there had been comparatively vague statements about Sri Lanka facing higher temperatures in the future, this is the first time three specifics have been predicted for what is in store for us. When it is due, 2050, what temperature to expect, 30C increase and what happens to the economy, lose $ 12 billion are all specified. Just as much as what is in store for us has moved from vagueness to specificity, the time has also come for us to move from vague reasons for climate change to more specific reasons for this predicted climate change. That need to be the precursor for any tangible moves towards avoiding the predicted catastrophe.
There cannot be a discussion on climate change without the words Greenhouse Gases coming into the picture. From Kiehl and Trentberths Energy Budget Diagram to all other explanations of climate change do talk about the Greenhouse Gases. As such we also talk about Greenhouse Gases in our explanation and we also talk about the thermal energy balances as well. We seek justification for that in the statement in CMIP5 literature to the effect that we always notice variations in thermal balances before we notice changes in the greenhouse gas flows. Even in Kiehl and Trentbirth Diagram, there is a thermal component which is derived through an energy balance approach. We have written on this previously with examples from energy flow balances including heat flows coming into the earth system and going out.
It was this understanding which led us to reason out climate change differently.
How our reasoning goes
We always thought that climate change is primarily due to three reasons: (i) We reduce the amount of solar radiation we (a) reflect as shortwave radiation and (b) convert to chemical energy and as a result of these two changes, increase the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the earth system, (ii) we keep on generating waste energy in the form of heat energy whenever we convert one form of energy (say chemical energy in a fossil fuel) to another form (say electrical energy for the grid or mechanical energy in a vehicle) and (iii) during these processes we increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which will prevent the excess energy  due to non-reflected and non-converted solar radiation and waste energy generated during energy conversions  from escaping into outer space.
If we look at these three reasons, Sri Lankans could be seen contributing significantly to each of them. When we build new expressways, we are reducing forest cover or vegetation. It is the forest cover or vegetation which reflect about 25% of solar radiation and convert about 8% of solar radiation into chemical energy. The forest cover also removes CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis at the rate of about 21 tons per hectare per year depending on the type of vegetation. Then once we lay the asphaltic surface on the cleared stretch to build that A grade expressway we start absorbing anything from 88% - 94% of incident solar radiation. And to build these highways we take a loan, which we can never pay back; we can just pay the interest.
Then, we start moving fuel hungry automobiles on these expressways emitting 7.68kWhrs of waste energy, 2.40kg of CO2 and 1.00kg of NFW per every litre of fuel burnt by the vehicle. These gases CO2 and NFW start doubling the effect by preventing the long wave radiation leaving our atmosphere by their greenhouse gas effect.
What is seen on 2400 km of our highways
Or the last six weeks, having the opportunity to travel along our highways to all corners of the island. That included Jaffna, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Ampara, Badulla, Moneragala and Kataragama and what was seen along those routes was A Grade , well carpeted highways excepting a near 25km stretch from Badulla to Passara on the BadullaChenkaladi road. Ninety five percent of the time spent on these roads, saw nothing but roadways with about one to three vehicles on a stretch of about 1.5kms in front. In Jaffna and Mannar seeing mile after mile of these highways bounded by two, three or four lanes of large transmission poles or towers bringing in power to the vicinity all the way from Laxapana. Karainagar bridge area and Mannar bridge area come to my mind vividly.
In other words a vehicle would have covered this stretch of land called the Highway only about 2.4% of the time and what were these roadways doing during the balance 97.6% of the daytime hours with the scorching sun blasting it at a rate of anything above 5.0kWhrs/km2 day. It would have been absorbing this solar radiation at 88% to 94% rate depending on the age of the roadway.
The unique solution and its impact
Now that we have done the damage by replacing the vegetation by a highway, the existence of the highway is not the problem today; but the solar radiation impinging on the same and getting absorbed is the problem. Similarly, vehicles traversing on the highway is not the problem, but their generation of (i) waste energy on one hand and (ii) greenhouse gases CO2 and NFW on the other hand is the problem.
Thus understanding the problem leads us to identify a suitable solution. We need to remember that this receipt of solar radiation is the biggest blessing we have on this planet earth and we should be smart enough to identify how we could convert its existence to be an asset even under most demanding conditions.
It is then we decided to convert this significant threat to humanity to a grand opportunity for mankind and looking at the vastness of activities contributing to climate change from energy generation, industries, deforestation and transportation, we gauged that any resolution of climate change will lead both to (a) the extinction of the economic lull which has been associated with fossil fuel usage and (b) a global economic gale surpassing everything else that has happened in the energy field for at least half a century. It will be the absolute disruption of the current global economic order leading to a new World Economic Order where energy will be available in the same ratio as land occupied. It will also be the perfect combination of Energy, Economy and Environment where each is contributing to the fulfillment of positive objectives in respect of the other two
It was here that we converted the invention of the photovoltaic solar panel to the innovation of Highway Solarisation which is a new technology impacting the business world as suggested by Joseph Schumpeter in his definition for the word innovation. Highway Solarisation means laying photovoltaic solar panels above and along the highways to generate electricity to provide tractive power for battery electric vehicles plying on the highway or to the national grid. With one single stroke of intelligent imagination, we will prevent (a) solar radiation impinging on the highway and (b) vehicles emitting waste energy and greenhouse gases. The moment we combine this energy generation with the new type of tractive power for the automobile, we are disrupting an economic landscape covering more than 40% of the topmost 25 companies in the Fortune Global 500 listing. It is this logic of climate change resolution and the millions of opportunities arising there from which had been the basis of all our articles in the local newspapers for the last ten years.
Its application to the extension of Southern Expressway
A few months back we had done some computations on the extension of Southern Expressway along these lines to demonstrate how Highway Solarisation could help us pay back $1.7 billion at 2% interest loan taken for that project without leaving it for the future generations to pay back and the following is a summary of the results.
So one could see that this Highway Solarisation, if implemented above the few thousands of kilometers of highways in this country, could easily mitigate most of the damages arising from climate change, such as leading to a 30C rise in temperature and $12 billion loss to the economy by 2050 and save an approximate Rs. 478 billion to be spent on oil for transportation which hammers us in Sri Lanka than it does to anybody else in the world. I wonder whether such a beneficial, pioneering project which will help mankind should be ignored for the fear of an errant drivers car colliding with a column supporting the Highway Solarisation System.
What Highway Solarisation could do to the energy fabric of Sri Lanka
Now we could look at what it would do to the energy fabric of Sri Lanka. When we talk about the energy fabric of Sri Lanka, we look at it rather holistically to cover energy for both electricity generation as well as transportation. Energy fabric is what spreads the worst type of gloom over Sri Lankas economy landscape. It is in weaving this energy fabric that we generate an unimaginable 18,790 kt of CO2,10,240kt of NFW vapour and 48,766 GWhrs of waste energy. So it is the biggest culprit in taking us towards that 30C rise in temperature and $ 12 billion loss to the economy by 2050. Are we going to be mere onlookers while this destiny will befall our children in another 32 years.
Please note that it is not the end of the story. It is this same behemoth who took away $ 3.4 billion from our coffers and led to a current account deficit for the 20th year in succession. So now you can see what is in store for us. This is why we have been saying in Sri Lanka, Energy has spelt only unbearable gloom over the Economy and the Environment and it is high time we reverse this trend and make Energy prompt a stronger Economy and an equally Strong Environment.
The President who also happens to be the Minister of Environment, Prime Minister who holds the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Affairs and Minister of Finance should take this issue of 30C rise in temperature and $ 12 billion loss to the economy seriously and initiate action. When there is a mitigation solution along Geo--engineering, energy switching and energy reduction approaches as given in Sustainable Energy by Prof. Jefferson Tester, should not our Political and Administrative establishments take it on themselves to ensure this solution is subjected to a serious study through a 10 MW Pilot Project on that 100 foot road on which we were drying paddy in 2015. That is our duty and our challenge. Anybody who is not interested in achieving this will only be an observer while the country moves towards this 30C temperature rise and $ 12 billion loss to economy.
Please note that all the economic misery called a $ 2 billion current account deficit could be eliminated only by implementing Highway Solarisation along all highways which hold promise in respect of incident solar radiation, adequate width and straightness and there will not be any other solution for this. Any attempts at misleading the superiors by lame excuses and delaying will amount only to the estimates of 30C and $ 12 billion getting exaggerated a few fold.
Conclusion
A reasonably authentic pronouncement by a World Bank Economist says that by 2050 Colombo will face a 30C temperature rise and $ 12 billion economic loss and our own Climate Change Secretariat says that adaptation plans for the nine provinces will be ready by 2020. What we like to emphasise is that no adaptation plan will be adequate without mitigation plans.

SL Tourism to unveil New  Country branding at WTM
The new Country branding for Sri Lanka Tourism will be unveiled at the World Travel Mart (WTM) in London in November 2018.
We are now in the process of selecting a global branding agency for this purpose. Our objective with this initiative is to give Sri Lanka a distinct brand identity which will help us differentiate our island in the global competitive tourism landscape, said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga.
The strategy for this important task has been unanimously approved by all relevant bodies governing tourism in Sri Lanka. At a recent meeting, the strategy was presented to the Prime Minister who endorsed it. It is hoped that the launch of Sri Lanka destination brand in November 2018 will be a critical driver to attract international visitors to the country.
The launch event in London will comprise several activities including the engagement of media as well as key leaders from the global travel industry. The activities in London will be graced by the Prime Minister.
Sri Lanka has always focused on its diversity to attract visitors to the country. Its this diversity that we intend to focus upon, strengthened by its authenticity driven by the rich heritage of our history, nature, culture and our people who smile from the heart that makes our island home a paradise for the visitor. We strongly believe that these factors are further supported by the compactness of this singular island, which gives us a competitive advantage. It makes us distinctive and different. The strategic positioning of Sri Lanka as a destination was developed by a special committee who volunteered their time and professional acumen, with assistance from the governing bodies for Sri Lanka Tourism (SLTDA) and Tourism Promotion (SLTPB). At the invitation of the chairman of this committee, the team engaged the global advertising agencies with representation in Sri Lanka to contribute to the process. They made an invaluable contribution towards this process, for which I am most grateful, he said.
The development of the strategy has been an inclusive process wherein we engaged the multinational agencies in the country and shared our perspectives with the two foremost bodies engaged with tourism  Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and the Tourist Hoteliers Association of Sri Lanka (THASL).
I am confident that this collective and inclusive effort will help drive awareness of Sri Lanka as a destination and will be the fore-runner to help us achieve our ambition of surpassing 3 million visitors in 2019.
Following the launch of the new brand identity of Sri Lanka, a global marketing campaign will be undertaken, for which the RFP process will be executed in the final quarter of 2018.
We intend to launch this campaign at ITB in Berlin in March 2019, which is the largest annual tourism fair in the world.
It is my intention to launch this campaign in Sri Lanka prior to premiering it to the world at ITB in March 2019. I would very much like to have the participation, engagement and support of the entire nation to make our dream of making Sri Lanka the most desired destination for international visitors, the Minister added.

Spotted stripes
The Sri Lankan Leopard is majestic and powerful. Agile and elusive. It is one of the most beautiful creatures on earth. However, the Sri Lankan Leopard, a fascinating species, has in 2008, been listed as endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list. In 1986 the Leopard was declared as endangered in the IUCN list. The leopard is one of the most adaptable species on earth being able to adapt to any condition. It is a master of camouflage and a powerful swimmer and an agile runner, able to ascend a tree. It is also a ruthless killer stalking its prey over long distances or waiting in ambush and then finishing off its prey with a bite from its sharp and strong teeth.
Zoologist Dr Andrew Kittle and Ecologist Anjali Watson held a lecture last week titled Sheltering Under the Leopards Umbrella, hosted by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society. Kittle has conducted a comprehensive study of the Sri Lankan Leopard and has also done a large study of Carnivores. Watson has also worked alongside Kittle on his Carnivore research. She has also worked with primates in South American and Sri Lanka.
Leopard population
Here they discussed the threat to this apex predator (a predator at the top of a food chain) on the island. The Sri Lankan Leopard population is distributed throughout habitats across the island most frequently found in the Dry Zone and Wet Zone intermediate forests. Leopards can be found also in Yala National Park and the Wilpattu National Park and Sri Lankan Central Hills.
Humans and Leopards need to co-exist together but unfortunately, that is not happening in Sri Lanka. Leopards who live in protected zones are being threatened by humans who encroach upon these zones that are the domain of the leopards. Leopards who live in unprotected zones need protection.
Leopards are mostly nocturnal animals who hunt solitarily in the night but can be seen in day times as well. However, the tragedy is that this beautiful big cat is being killed and encaged in zoos. This animal who by right is the king of the predators in Sri Lanka  the smallest of the big cats. The Sri Lankan Leopard is also the largest leopard in the world. The Sri Lankan subspecies is one of the largest subspecies of leopard found in the world
Leopards have been highly prized for their coats with Sri Lankan authorities seizing a number of skins. Also, Leopards bones are in high demand for their medicinal value. We need to raise awareness about how to co-exist with this beautiful and precious creature. We need to educate people on how to avoid them. We need to increase our understanding of Leopards.
In this planet, we live in, we are experiencing bio-diversity loss at a tremendous rate. And most of this is by humans. Human activity as we know interferes with the function of Eco Systems. This involves both land and marine life. These interferences cause changes amongst organisms that nature never intended. Sometimes they reduce population growth in certain organisms and sometimes they increase population growth. Human activities alter the interactions between organisms and their physical environments, said Kittle.
Extinct species
The Dinosaurs were extinct due to other causes and not human interference. Now we see them only on Screen in movies like Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. Even though these movies introduce the concept that the dinosaurs can be brought back, for the time being bringing extinct species back is still a dream. It may be very possible that we will one day see the Sri Lankan Leopard only on screen.
We are rapidly losing out on time. We need all the resources on hand to save the Sri Lankan leopard from becoming extinct. We need human and material resources. We also need the funding. We need support from the governments. The Leopard and the elephant in Sri Lanka are the flagship species. The Leopard must be high on the list when it comes to conservation priorities, pointed out Kittle.
Dr Kittle also mentioned that there is a need to increase protection for Leopards. For example, if someone is travelling in the night they can travel in groups. Or if there are known Leopards in the territory, making a loud noise would help. There are so many survival tips that can be shared in these territories that can minimize the human-leopard clash.
The recent killing of a Leopard in June this year in Kilinochchi is a well- known story in Sri Lanka. The courts ordered the arrest of some villagers who beat a Leopard to death sparking outrage in communities in Sri Lanka who were outraged by what happened when they saw pictures of the Leopard body being proudly handled by villagers. Leopards have as much right as us to live and be left alone. They deserve to be free because they are born free in the wilderness.
Anjali Watson stressed that there needs to be more research done on Leopards and their behaviour patterns.
I think the importance of patch forests and tiny little areas of forests and tea landscapes must be taken into consideration. Also, I think by protecting the Leopard, it acts as an umbrella for other species in Sri Lanka as well. A small piece of land can help a lot in protecting biodiversity in Sri Lanka. We know the central highlands of Sri Lanka have a lot of biodiversity. A little bit of land can make a lot of difference. We know the Leopards need movement corridors. This also helps in breeding. We need these corridors because in 2016 there have been around eight leopard deaths, said Watson.
Leopard activities
Watson said there has been some success in monitoring the Leopards activities. It is important that human activity and leopard activity do not overlap. Watson pointed out that there is a need to push for new protection areas for leopards because when you protect the leopard there is protection for other species.
We need to fight this fear of Leopards. They usually avoid humans and dont look for conflict. If you know there are cubs then avoid that place because the mother feels anxious. If you have small children in the vicinity then be mindful of them. If you see a leopard, make a lot of noise and wave your hands appearing physically bigger than you are. If you know there is an injured leopard avoid that place because then it is more likely to attack a human, said Watson. Watson also pointed out that the higher the prey available the higher is the density of Leopards.
We see Leopard and humans contesting for prey like wild pigs. We also know that leopards get injured when they fall into the traps created for other prey by humans. Leopards are excellent dads because once they have young of their own they protect the cubs from other males. Studies reveal that it is possible that the males remember individual adult females. Males claiming new territory have a reason to kill cubsit brings the mothers back into heat, allowing the males to father their own progeny, explained Watson.
Maybe the reason leopards need movement corridors maybe to avoid murderous males.
According to reliable statistics available, there are 125 mammal species in Sri Lanka, of which 1 is critically endangered, 10 are endangered, 10 are vulnerable, and 3 are near-threatened.
Forests play a key role in Leopard conservation. We need to regenerate small patch forests. Because these forest patches form corridors to large areas. Leopards need these corridors to move into other regions, said Watson.

Steyn faces another injury lay-off
CAPE TOWN, Monday: South African fast bowler Dale Steyn could be set for another stint on the sidelines after picking up a groin injury in a county cricket match on Monday. The 35-year-old, who will undergo an examination of the problem on Tuesday, was unable to complete his 11th over for Hampshire against Nottinghamshire at Southampton and was forced to leave the field.
Steyn has had a horrible run of injuries over the last two years, hampering his bid to become South Africas record test wicket-taker, though he did equal the record in Sri Lanka last month.
Steyn and Shaun Pollock have each taken 421 test wickets.
A serious shoulder injury kept him out for most of last year before a heel problem sustained in his comeback test against India in February sidelined him once more.  Agencies

Struggle  with Ebola
Not many of us are aware of the struggles of a survivor of Ebola, nor do we know of the stigma attached to patients who have suffered and survived the disease. Being a psychologist by profession and a mental health specialist who acted in response to the disease, Pramudith Rupasinghe was able to penetrate the inner thoughts of both the Ebola patients and survivors.
He listened to their stories and difficulties and one which attracted him was the story of Thumba. Meeting Thumba inspired Rupasinghe to dive into this semi-fictional novel, where he describes the struggles the protagonist went through, while at the same time adding a literary, fictitious factor to it. Rupasinghe hides Thumbas true identity in the book by using a different name in order to protect his privacy.
Set in West Africa, the book follows Thumbas journey as he matures into an adolescent whilst living with a tribe and then being displaced in the city. He finds religion and becomes a nurse, treating Ebola patients and subsequently contracting the disease and surviving it. The book reveals that African tribes living in the forests in the late 1900s were exposed to the optimum conditions for the Ebola disease and many had died after showing symptoms very similar to the disease, however, this has not been documented.
The book further explores the hierarchical system in place in such tribes and their way of life. Furthermore, it shows the transformation of Thumbas tribal mindset. The book also highlights the spread of Ebola. The reader bears witness to the struggle of treating an Ebola patient to the suffering of one, after which we are shown the irony of survival as they too must suffer from the ostracism that comes from being an Ebola survivor.

Teejay launches  Mihikathata Adaren project
An urban garden that will provide nourishment while nurturing the environment is taking shape at a school in Hanwella with support from Teejay Lanka PLC under the companys flagship environmental project Mihikathata Adaren (To Earth with Love)with the help of volunteers of Blue Marble 6.0 representing AISEC Kandy.
One of the regions largest textile manufacturers, Teejay has extended this initiative to the Rajasinghe Central College, to cultivate food crops for the consumption of its students. The 50-perch garden will have approximately 200 vegetable plants and 30 fruit trees provided by Teejay, which has also undertaken to support the project with funding.
Once the garden is productive, its yield would be enjoyed by about 50 students resident in the schools hostel, the company said.
Employees of Teejay Lanka will work with the schools students, parents, and teachers to create and sustain the garden. The company has also pledged to monitor progress and provide required additional supportthroughout its first year. Guidance is to be provided by the Department of Agriculture onurban agricultural techniques that will benefit the garden.
Blue Marble 6.0 is the summer initiative of AISEC Kandy, launched with the vision of increasing awareness on environmental conservation. AISEC is a non-governmental not-for-profit organisation in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
Commenting on this project, Teejay Lanka Deputy CEO Pubudu De Silva said, The Mihikathata Adaren initiative engages with the community, especially the younger generation, to foster a love for the planet through creating, nurturing and benefitting from sustainable agriculture. We are confident that this project will generate long term benefits to participants as well as the environment. The To Earth with Love program was initiated in 2014 and became a National Winner of the Energy Globe Award in Sri Lanka.
The Urban Garden initiative at Rajasinghe Central College is the fourth such environmental initiative implemented by Teejay Lanka with school children. In past years, the programme concentrated on reforestation activities by distributing trees to be planted to students and by conducting environmental awareness programmes.
Teejay Lankas own environment sustainability agenda focuses on two key areas, control of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and Waste Management. GHG control includes raising stakeholder awareness, reforestation, afforestation, engaging with environmental movements such asthe Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), rainforest protectors and related sustainable initiatives on GHG emission reduction through process innovation.
The company has a long-term vision for waste management, involving the participation of communities in its neighborhood, which are also the key beneficiaries of Teejays CSR initiatives. Teejayalso focuses on eliminating hazardous chemicals in its processes and is the first company in the industry to introduce a carbon neutral fabric.

The political and legal issues of another Presidential term for MR
Third time is not the charm
The latest debate in the politics of the next presidential election stakes, due in 2020, is whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is eligible to contest yet again for a third term. Now Mahinda Rajapaksa has the unenvied distinction of being the only incumbent Sri Lankan president to have lost a bid for re-election. This despite the legislative success of ramming through a draconian 18th Amendment to the constitution which enabled him to try and seek such an unprecedented third term. The voters in January 2015 thought otherwise and sent Mahinda Rajapaksa packing back to Medamullane, in Hambantota.
At that time, the Rajapaksas did not throw in the towel quite as gracefully as their supporters would like us to now believe. We cannot really forget the strange nocturnal meetings on election night at Temple Trees, the deployment plans for troops to control key state institutions and the exploration of a suspension of the election results through a declaration of emergency, all the subject of a formal complaint to the CID by Minister Mangala Samaraweera. Fortunately, sanity prevailed. The then Prime Minister-designate Ranil Wickremesinghe called on Mahinda Rajapaksa to leave office peaceably and quietly and a helicopter airlifted Mahinda Rajapaksa to Medamullane. That he drove back two days later to the Darley road SLFP office in a bulletproof Government vehicle, a courtesy he denied his own predecessor and party leader, President Kumaratunga, was to be the second step in the Rajapaksa return project, the alleged coup de ta, being perhaps the first.
It was Opposition and TNA leader, Rajavarothian Sambanthan, who has stated boldly in Parliament that all Sri Lankan governments have failed to bring to justice alleged gross corruption and abuse of power of their predecessors. The only exception being the conviction of Sirimavo Bandaranaike and indeed her Justice Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike, by a special presidential commission. In the near four decades since then, according to Sambanthan, Governments have sought to convict their opponents of corruption and abuse of power in the court of public opinion but not in a court of law. An interesting observation by the veteran politician.
The Rajapaksa return project has since taken shape and form in the establishment of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party, the SLPP and the current debate over a Mahinda third term stems from comments made by the SLPPs nominal head and former Minister, GL Peiris. Professor Peiris has opined that Mahinda Rajapaksa is indeed eligible for seeking a third term of office as president of the republic on the basis that the 19th Amendment restoring and re-establishing the two-term limit on the office of the presidency, is not retroactively applicable to those who have held that office before the 19th Amendment. Contradicting Professor Peiris, rather quickly was former Justice and current Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, himself a Presidents Counsel, who dismisses Professor Peiriss claims as outlandish and unreal.
The original intent of the framers of the constitution
Now the good Professor Peiris, as befits a man of legal letters, states that he intends to seek and secure the opinion of the Supreme Court on the eligibility of Mahinda Rajapaksa to seek a third term. He concedes that the 19th Amendment does bar people holding the apex office of the republic for more than two terms, his current contention, however, is that it exempts Mahinda Rajapaksa, who held office twice, but prior to the passage of the 19th Amendment. Now it is generally accepted that laws are not retroactive, unless specifically so stated. But the issue is not retroactive, it is futuristic about the next presidential election due in 2020. Also on the same principle, the Supreme Court recently ruled that Maithripala Sirisenas term of office was limited to five years by the 19th Amendment though the said amendment was post his election at which time the term was six years. Moreover, the original intent of the framers of a constitution or a law is a key issue considered when seeking to interpret a constitution. Clearly, the intent of the drafter of the 19th Amendment was to impose a two-term limit on holding the office of the executive presidency. However, Professor Peiris now leads the political party and not the law department at a university, so it may be worth thinking through the politics of a third Mahinda Rajapaksa term.
The politics not the law of a Mahinda third term
The first political issue of a legal exploration of Mahinda Rajapaksas eligibility for an unprecedented third term, is that it lays bare what has been only private conversations before, the lack of unanimity among the Rajapaksa clan as well as their political allies, self-styled as the Joint Opposition (JO) about Gotabhaya Rajapaksas early and unilateral attempt at throwing his hat in the ring through Viyath maga. Sources close to former President Rajapaksa and indeed Professor Peiris have opined that a loyal acolyte of Mahindas like GL Peiris or indeed a Dinesh Gunawardena may be preferred, rather than the mantle passing to a sibling and hence another wing of the family. Keeping alive the myth of a Mahinda third term actually blocks another Rajapaksa from building himself up, in the interim period before the election.
That the family and indeed the JO are not unanimous in either their tactics or their choice of candidate was also borne out earlier this month through the relatively modest success of the JOs opposition rally at the Viharamahadevi Park and Lipton Circus. The attempt to get around ten thousand people failed when less than a third of that number was mobilized and political insiders claim that Basil Rajapaksa, had not thrown the SLPPs organisational weight behind the event. From the failure of the election of a deputy speaker to their public rallies and choice of presidential candidate, the dissent and dissension in the highest ranks of the Rajapaksa JO are becoming increasingly visible.
The downfall of Sri Lankas historical monarchical dynasties during our pre-colonial era was largely due to succession battles which were often bloody and brutal within the family. The Rajapaksas need to learn from our political history, as they seek to build a democratic political dynasty, the importance of succession planning, especially in the complex context of a post-war, multi ethnoreligious and democratic society.

US Press fights Donald Trump on Media Freedom
There are threats to journalists here today, being identified as traitors to the Motherland, and increased voices from both government and opposition against media freedom, which remains under threat here. Meanwhile, the US media has taken a strong initiative to support Media Freedom from the rising authoritarianism of the Keep America First politics.
In a major defence of the Freedom of the Press and wider Democracy, more than 400 newspapers in the United States came out in a strong stand against recent and rising attacks on the media by President Donald Trump, on Thursday August 16.
The historic move in the fight to preserve the Freedom of the Press came in support of a call by the Boston Globe urging newspapers across the US to take a coordinated stand against Trumps anti-media attacks, just a week earlier. The Globe urged editorial boards of US newspapers - from big city papers to small weeklies - to attack the dangers of the administrations assault on the press. It said each paper would write and publish its own individual editorial, so that each approaches the topic with its perspective and its own voice.
Marjorie Pritchard, the Globes deputy editorial page editor making its pitch to the nations papers said, The impact of Trumps assault on journalism looks different in Boise (Idaho) than it does in Boston Our words will differ. But at least we can agree that such attacks are alarming. The Globes call came after noticing the recent uptick in the intensity of Trumps anti-media rhetoric.
Supporting the call Pritchard wrote in a Sunday tweet This is not about being a Democrat. And this is not about being a RepublicanThis is about the importance of a free press, enshrined in the Constitution, something we should all get behind.
The call for coordinated media action came after recent attacks on the media by Donald Trump who referred to the media as the enemy of the people. At a Pennsylvania rally earlier this month, he repeatedly called the media the enemy of the American people and described the press as fake disgusting news. He asked the large crowd present Whatever happened to the free press Whatever happened to honest reporting And said, They dont report it. They only make up stories, to cheers from the crowd. At one major rally recently he said, Dont hear the crap you hear from these people, pointing the journalists covering the event, getting huge supportive cheers from the audience. Repeated statements about the media or even fake media as the enemy of the people, posed a major threat to journalists in the US, who are critical of the Donald Trump presidency. At some public rallies addressed by Trump, the crowd has shouted questions and made verbal attacks on journalists covering the events from media outlets critical of the Trump Presidency.
War on the press
The Washington Post, supportive of the Boston Globe reported Jay Rosen, a media critic and journalism professor, (on Twitter) stating journalists defending themselves was consistent with the chief journalism aim of telling the truth: The problem, of course, is that there is war on the press being conducted by the president of the United States and his supporters. To say otherwise would violate a different commandment. Yes, it is imperative to keep your cool. It is equally imperative to state what is true.
Others have argued there is a moral imperative to speak up because Trumps rhetoric can result in more than words being hurled toward journalists.
Some have pointed to the killing of five people who worked at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis as an example. The man charged with five counts of murder in the killings had a vendetta against the newspaper, authorities said. The Post columnist Kathleen Parker wrote: Whats clear is that Trump has made it a verbal open season on journalists, many of whom have felt the sting one way or another For all of us ink-stained wretches, the hate mail is more vicious than ever. The death threats more frequent.
The Trump attacks on the media continues to rise. With the approach of the mid-term elections to Congress and Senate in November this year, this is expected to be intense, with increased danger to journalists on the field. Here are some of the quotes from the response of newspapers to the Boston Globes call to respond to dangers of the administrations assault on the press.
The Miami Herald: President Donald Trump has veered into unfamiliar and perilous territory with his unceasing all-out assault on the free press and the First Amendment. Of course, the irony of Trumps attacks on the SICK! and very dishonest people in the fake media he accuses of purveying, yes, fake news is that he himself is a product of the New York tabloids. Hes as savvy about manipulating his coverage as he is adept in undermining it.Every reporter who has ever covered a Trump rally knows the scratch of a threat thats conveyed during that ritual moment when he aims the attention of the crowd to reporters, many of whom no longer stand in the press pen in the back for that reason.
Tampa Bay Times: Trump calls journalists the enemy of the American people. He regularly refers to fake news and the fake news media. Those assaults by the president cannot be brushed aside as theatrics, particularly when they are embraced by some of his strongest supporters and copied by politicians in Florida and elsewhere.
Orlando Sentinel: By labeling news reports he disagrees with as fake news, the president is trying to discredit the journalists this country relies on to keep watch and inform... And even worse, President Trump demonizes journalists, calling them the enemy of the American people and dangerous and sick A presidents criticizing the press is nothing new. But a presidents trying to escape scrutiny by declaring the press the nations enemy goes too far.
The Denver Post: Trump is a difficult politician to cover. His tweets and factually inaccurate statements frequently put him at loggerheads with the media. In a vacuum void of his outlandish statements, some of Trumps policies would earn more straightforward media coverage. It has become a destructive cycle where the media covers Trumps words and instead of self-reflection following scathing media reports, Trump cries fake news Its a dangerous cry coming from the White House.
The San Diego Union-Tribune: Thats why the presidents recent tweet that the fake news is the Enemy of the People and very dangerous and sick is itself dangerous. Flooded with Trumps anti-press sentiments, people increasingly agree with the president; when asked which comes closer to your point of view: the news media is the enemy of the people, or the news media is an important part of democracy 26 percent said the former in a new Quinnipiac University poll of 1,175 U.S. voters. Forty-four percent said they are concerned Trumps criticism of the news media will lead to violence against people working in it While his words inflict harm, Trump didnt invent the term fake news. It dates back to the 1800s. He also isnt the first to weaponize media mistrust.
The New York Times: In 2018, some of the most damaging attacks are coming from government officials. Criticizing the news media  for underplaying or overplaying stories, for getting something wrong  is entirely right. News reporters and editors are human, and make mistakes. Correcting them is core to our job. But insisting that truths you dont like are fake news is dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy. And calling journalists the enemy of the people is dangerous, period.
These attacks on the press are particularly threatening to journalists in nations with a less secure rule of law and to smaller publications in the United States, already buffeted by the industrys economic crisis. Yet the journalists at those papers continue to do the hard work of asking questions and telling the stories that you otherwise would not hear.
Des Moines Register: No one who works in media can defend everything that passes for news in this country today. We recognize it can be painfully off track. It can be biased. Reporters sometimes make mistakes But the press is not the enemy of the people. Its primary goal is to provide information to the public and provide a check on all three branches of government. This is critical in a democracy.
The true enemies of the people  and democracy  are those who try to suffocate truth by vilifying and demonizing the messengerThe response to that cannot be silence.
(The editorials of many of the newspapers that supported the Boston Globe call could be seen on https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/15/opinion/editorials/free-p...)
The Des Moines Register states that Lesley Stahl, the Emmy award-winning 60 Minutes correspondent recently talked about her November 2016 interview with Donald Trump  the first after his winning the election. When asked if he planned to stop attacking the press  something he repeatedly did in his campaign. He said, You know why I do it I do it to discredit you all, so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you. Take a moment to let the implications of that statement soak in.
Donald Trump continues with his attacks on the media and his repeated references to fake news in almost every Twitter message or comment he makes that has any reference to the continuing inquiring about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which he won. The fake news label is now added to most comments by him on reports critical of presidential decisions and the widening autocratic policies of the Trump administration.
There is every indication the US media will need a continued and determined campaign against this Trump trend, and also maintain a commitment to protect the Freedom of the Press and rights of Free Speech, needed from the threats of rising pluralism in the West, with links to the Fascism of the German Nazis.

Nallur Kovil festival
Vibrant veneration
The Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil which is also known as the Nallur Murugan Kovil is one of the most famous Hindu temples in the Jaffna peninsula. It is situated in the Nallur town and the Nallur Kovil festival is one of the longest festivals which usually runs for about 25 days. During these 25 days, Jaffna is filled with people from far and wide and many Tamil expatriates come to Sri Lanka to pay their various vows and take part in the festival rituals. This colourful festival includes vibrant chariot processions, rhythmic drumming, dancing and acts of self-mortification, mainly devoted to god Skanda.
This year the Nallur festival started on August 16 and this annual festival will ceremonially end on September 9. Thousands of devotees will attend the daily Pooja ceremonies in the morning and in the evenings.
During the annual festival, thousands of Tamil Hindu devotees attend the Nallur temple rituals in worship of Lord Murugan, Valli and Devanai Ammn. Specially made and colourfully decorated chariots and traditional Vaganangal is used for the transportation of the Gods. The devotees perform all sorts of devotional rituals to show their devotion to the gods from pulling the chariot to rolling on the bare ground seeking the blessings of the gods. Others line up on the chariot route to get a glimpse of the processions. During this procession, the entire area is a sea of people with barely a space to move.
This annual 25-day festival is generally celebrated continuously every year following the Aadi Amavasai day. The procession commences inside the kovil and eventually winds its way to the outskirts.
Sacred Flag hoisting ceremony
The twenty-five day annual festival of the historic Nallur Kandasamy Temple in Jaffna began on Thursday, August 16 with the Sacred Flag hoisting ceremony (KodiYetam) in the presence of a large number of devotees. The chariot (THER) festival will be held on September 8 and the Water Cutting (Theertham) festival on September 9, temple authorities said. The festival symbolises the precepts of the Saiva doctrine which is a collection of scriptures of Hindu devotional schools. The Hindus believe that the devotee is guided towards God and away from temptation by participating in fasting, meditation during this period.
The Sacred Flag was taken in a decorated chariot from Nallur Saddanathar Sivan Kovil to Nallur Kandasamy Temple and handed over to the Kandasamy Temple chief priest, according to traditional rites which have been a ritual followed since the rule of King Sangiliyan.
The flag was hoisted last Thursday at 10 am amidst the chanting of a large number of devotees present for the ceremony.
The whole area is filled with colourful and vibrant decorations, with images of Lord Murugan in his sacred vehicles taking the form of peacocks, cobras or swans, are carried by the devotees. According to the rituals coconuts are dashed on the ground as an act of dedication to their faith while chants of Haro Hara (glory to thee) fills the air amidst the scent of camphor and incense fragrance.
The Nallur temple holds great significance among the Hindu community and it is a significant landmark in the Jaffna region. The Nallur Kovil epitomises punctuality, order and neatness. Most significantly it is the manner in which the Nallur festival rituals are conducted with such impeccable timing and strict discipline that makes it stand out from the rest.
The festival is spread over a period of twenty-five days during which various Yagams Abishekams and special poojas are conducted. Among the rituals at the festival, the rituals that attract the most number of devotees are the Manjam, Thirukkarthikai, Kailasavahanam, Velvimanam, Thandayuthepani, Sapparam, Ther festival procession, Theertham  the water cutting festival, and Thirukalyanam  The holy wedding. The Ther Thiruvila (chariot festival) is the most popular of all events and is very colourful and commences early in the morning. During the procession, Lord Shanmuhar and his consorts are carried out on a Silver Throne called Simmasanam, an intricately carved masterpiece created by the 7th Custodian, Arumuga Maapaana Mudaliyar in 1900. Hundreds of devotees carry it on their shoulders, and the Simmasanam floats on the heads of thousands of devotees chanting Harohara.
The huge and heavy chariot carrying the statue of God Shanmuhar and consorts is paraded along the streets of the Temple. As the belief goes, the chariot pulled by a rope by thousands of devotees, both rich and poor and immaterial of the cast, old and young is said to be a sign for God Murugan to witness the sincerity and purity of the devotees.
The historic Kandaswamy Temple is situated in Nallur 1 1/2km from Jaffna on the Point Pedro Road. The temple was built in the 15th Century, by Sanpaha Perumal the adopted son of King Bhuvanekababhu, the King of Kotte, who led an expedition to the North and brought Jaffna under the control of Kotte.
After the Jaffna Kingdom was brought under his control, Sanpaha Perumal started rebuilding the Jaffna city and the temple. Later he is said to have appointed Vijayabahu as the ruler and returned to Kotte. Subsequently, the deposed King Kanagasuriyan attacked and drove away from the invader, He and his descendants managed the Nallur Temple up to the arrival of the Portuguese.
Magnificent structure
The Portuguese defeated Sankili, the last king of Jaffna in 1560. The Portuguese General Philip de Olivera demolished the historic Kandaswamy Temple in 1621 the temple then stood at Sankili thopu on the eastern side of the Point Pedro Road as reported by S. Pathmanathan.
As it is reported, the fourth and the present Temple was constructed in 1749 A.D. during the beginning of the Dutch colonial era by one Krishna SubaIyer and Ragunatha Maapaana Mudaliyar in the KurukkalValavu, which is the original temple premises.
The first clock tower was erected in 1899, and the main hall where the deity resides was re-furbished using rocks in 1902. The temple has undergone transformations from time to time with contributions from the general public and in 1964, the Vasantha Mandapam or grand hall was renovated to its current grand state.
The main entrance of the Nallur temple faces the East and is decorated with an ornately carved five-storied tower or gopuram in the Dravidian architecture style at its main entrance.
The inner yard of the Nallur temple consists of shrines for Lords Ganesh, Vairavar, Sun and Sandana Gopala. The holy pond and Thandayudhapaani shrine dedicated to another aspect of Lord Muruga can be seen on the southern part of the Temple. The holy garden of this magnificent structure is located on the northern side.
The Nallur Temple festival will conclude on September 9 with the water cutting ceremony where the deity is dipped in the kovil pond after which devotees plunge in.
During the final days of the festival, devotees pierced embark on a grand procession within the kovil premises while some devotees skewer themselves and are suspended from poles or dance around as the procession moves forward. Some devotees carry the Kavady (burdens) as an act of penance and a means of fulfilling their vows.

Zazai stars as Afghanistan see off Ireland in first T20
BELFAST, Monday: Hazratullah Zazai smashed a blistering 74 as Afghanistan beat Ireland by 16 runs in the opening T20 international at Bready Cricket Club near Derry on Monday.
The tourists posted 160-7 batting first after rain had reduced the match to 18 overs a side.
Ireland fell short on 144-9, as star spinners Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman taking five wickets between them.
Afghanistan will take a 1-0 lead into Wednesdays second match of the three-game series, as they look to deny fellow new Test nation Ireland revenge for being pipped to qualification for next years World Cup.
Zazai, that was his second game, we didnt know much about him. He seemed to hit to all parts, Irish captain Gary Wilson told the Cricket Ireland website.
But we came back really well - after the start they got, that was a great positive. I thought the boys showed great character.
Opening batsman Zazai was playing just his second international match and first since December 2016, but the 20-year-old struck six sixes in a magnificent 33-ball innings.
Afghanistan lost their way after he was caught behind off Simi Singh and Mohammad Shahzad was lazily run out.
Captain Asghar Afghan, who recently changed his surname from Stanikzai, managed a 30-ball 31, but his team scored just 10 runs and lost five wickets in their final three overs.
Left-arm seamer Joshua Little, 18, impressed with a miserly spell of 2-20 from his four overs for Ireland.
Stuart Thompson and William Porterfield both fell early in the run chase to the mystery spin of Mujeeb, before Afghanistan grabbed the crucial wicket of the dangerous Paul Stirling for 27 as Aftab Alam pulled off a sensational catch on the boundary.
Middlesex opener Stirling looked to have hit Fareed Ahmad over the leg-side for six, but Aftab jumped to claim a running take one-handed, while keeping his balance to stay inside the rope.
Some lusty lower-order hitting from George Dockrell and Singh kept Irelands slim hopes alive, but Rashid finished with figures of 3-35 as Afghanistan wrapped up victory.
We can actually take a lot of confidence, I thought we played pretty well, particularly the way we came back with the ball, Wilson added.
Josh Little bowled really well, and thats why we brought him in with the left arm pace he will be one for the next few years.

TATA to continue the  production of Nano cars
Vehicle ownership  should increase in SL
TATA Motors Limited have not stopped the production of the worlds cheapest car, Nano said President Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, TATA India, Mayank Pareek.
He said that they have not stopped production nor have they curtailed exports to the region and they continue to export Nano cars to Nepal and Bangladesh. However as the Nano car doesnt have some requirements in BS4 standard required by Sri Lanka the imports to Sri Lanka have stopped.
He however said that though they dont meet the BS4 standard requirement by Sri Lanka the Nano car is very safe. Pareek also said that TATA vehicles are being aggressively marketed in Sri Lanka and plans to double it by 2020 from around 60, 000 units per year to 100,000 by 2020. Sri Lankan motor vehicle population is still low and it should further increase. Currently out of 1,000 people only 47 own a vehicle and it should be around 70 to 80 per 1,000.
With the economic growth and the rise of per capital increase the vehicle ownership per person is growing rapidly in Sri Lanka.
To meet the additional motor vehicle capacity in the roads Sri Lankan government is also investing to build new motorways and highways and this is very encouraging. Increasing on car ownership is a mark of prosperity to a country and every car sold would indirect generate 5 employment opportunities.
He said that a country should only look at import of brand new vehicles but today this is not happening in Sri Lanka.
We observe that the brand new motor vehicle imports are low and Sri Lanka is fast becoming a used vehicle dumping yard. In contrast India does not permit the import of used vehicles.
Paareek speaking at a round table discussion event hosted by Diesel and Motor Engineering said that they may look at an assembly plant in Sri Lanka after the next five years. We have to study the market patterns in Sri Lanka before making an investment but its being presumed.
Meanwhile Group CEO, DIMO, Gahanath Pandithage said that successive governments are changing the import tax on motor vehicles and this is a major concern for them. We want a clear import tax structure which would remain for a long time.
Asked to comment on the Electric vehicle segment he said Sri Lankan should look at the solar power option for charging as it would bring down the running costs (as against using electricity) and also help to reduce emissions.

Aruwakkalu sanitary landfill site to operate from November
The government plans to commission the operations of the sanitary landfill site in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam by November this year, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Deputy Director General (Waste Management) Eng. Upali Indraratne said.
He said the solid waste disposal issue of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) would be solved to a greater extent with the commissioning of the Aruwakkalu landfill and waste-to-energy projects in Karadiyana and Muthurajawela.
Indraratne was addressing the media during a site visit to the Dompe sanitary landfill site, yesterday.
A team of CEA officials will make an inspection tour of the Aruwakkalu landfill next week as the government seeks to speed up its construction.
Indraratne said the CEA had decided to take legal action against local government authorities which fail to keep the city clean, despite having all facilities and resources.
He added that the CEA had provided facilities to all local government bodies in Gampaha and Batticaloa to ensure the safe disposal of waste. He said about 30 metric tonnes of the segregated waste of six local government authorities; Colombo Municipal Council, Gampaha Municipal Council, Dompe Pradeshiya Sabha, Biyagama Pradeshiya Sabha, Atthanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha and Katana Pradeshiya Sabha, are accepted at the Dompe landfill site daily.
CEA Waste Management Unit Director Sarojini Jayasekara said the Dompe landfill, which commenced operations in April 2015, had caused no environmental or health hazards up to now, adding that it is a good example of scientific disposal of waste.
She said the construction of four more landfills in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Galle will commence by the end of this year. Recalling the challenges the CEA had to face in going ahead with the Dompe landfill due to public protests, she urged public support in carrying out the planned projects.
Dompe landfill site Manager Udamina Jayatilleka was also present.

Australian PM survives leadership challenge
AUSTRALIA: Embattled Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull pleaded for unity Tuesday after narrowly surviving a leadership challenge as discontent with his rule boiled over less than a year before national elections.
Turnbull, considered a moderate, declared his position vacant at a Liberal party meeting to force the issue after rampant speculation that the more hardline Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton wanted his job, with the government trailing the Labor opposition in opinion polls.
The disunity came to a head on Monday when Turnbull was forced to shelve plans to embed carbon emissions targets in law after a revolt by fellow Liberal politicians.
Turnbull won the ballot 48-35, but the episode seriously undermined his position.
It is really important that we put these differences behind us and get on with our job of looking after the 25 million Australians who have put us here, he said afterwards.
We know that disunity undermines the ability of any government to get its job done, and unity is absolutely critical. There was also an election for deputy leader. The incumbent, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, was the only one who threw her hat in the ring and she held onto the role.
Dutton, a former police officer who ran a powerful department that oversees the countrys domestic spy service, border force and national police, quit the cabinet and moved to the backbench.
Treasurer Scott Morrison will assume his job until a replacement is appointed.
John Hewson, a former leader of the Liberal party who is now with the Australian National Universitys school of public policy, said Turnbull was wounded and another challenge was likely within weeks.
This was a trial run and I expect them (Dutton and supporters) to do it again in September, he told AFP, adding that it was all about revenge and ego.
He pinpointed former prime minister Tony Abbott, who Turnbull ousted in a 2015 party room coup, as a key player behind the move.
Abbott wants to get even and Turnbull is now in the tightest of positions. He must stand up for his key polices in the national interest and get out there and argue the case.
Dutton refused to rule out another tilt at the top job, saying he made his move in the belief that he had the best chance of steering the party to an election victory.
What is my next step, what is my job from here My job is to make sure I can prosecute the sort of messages I spoke about and that is the only thing I am focussed on, he said.
It is the latest chapter in a turbulent period for Australian politics.
Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was ousted by his deputy Julia Gillard in 2010. He later returned the favour and stormed back to power in 2013 shortly before losing the election to Abbotts Liberal/National coalition.
Abbott was then unseated by Turnbull and is now a vocal backbencher and critic of his successor.
Abbott was in charge when Canberra agreed to cut emissions by 26 percent by 2030 as part of the so-called Paris Agreement. But he has since railed against the commitment he made. The latest on Monday showed it lagging even further behind -- 45 to 55 percent on a two-party basis -- with national elections due by the middle of next year. - AFP

However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded that it be reduced.
Within several weeks, they had allegedly agreed to accept Rs.100 million. The two were arrested at a hotel car park in Colombo, on May 3, by Bribery Commission officers while accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million.
While objecting to bail, the Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the Bribery Commission informed the Magistrate that there is no special circumstance to grant bail at this time.
However, the Magistrate ordered that the suspects be further remanded till September 4.

Be united to ensure better future: PM
The Hajj festival demonstrates the importance of unity and commitment in guiding the world to achieve long-lasting peace, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking Hajj.
He called on all Sri Lankans to be united as a nation to ensure a better future for the country. The full text of the Prime Ministers message:
Hajj pilgrimage is considered to be one of the five pillars of Islam, which should be performed by all Muslims, who are physically and financially capable, at least once in a lifetime.
Hajj marks the end of the period during which Muslims across the globe journey to Mecca in Saudi Arabia to reassure their faith in God. The expenses for the journey will be borne from what they earned through labour.
The Hajj is a religious festival where the pilgrims from all walks of life come together and pray for world peace. The message of equality and unity that they send to the world is important to all nations.
Muslims also commemorate the offer made by Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice the life of his son, Prophet Ismail to God, during this festival. Hajj provides the entire world with the inspiration necessary for leading a life of charity in order to develop peace and collaboration among us.
The festival demonstrates the importance of unity and commitment in guiding the world to achieve long-lasting peace. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, we must be united as a nation to ensure a better future for our country.
I wish all Muslims who come together for Hajj and all those who will be celebrating Eid-ul-Adha peace and prosperity!

Buttler and Stokes keep India  at bay in Third Test
NOTTINGHAM Aug21, 2018: Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes frustrated India with an unbroken century stand as England at last showed some fight with the bat in the third Test at Trent Bridge on Tuesday.
India were on course for acolossal win when England slumped to 62 for four before lunch on the fourth day. But England, 2-0 up in this five-match series, had recovered to 173 for four at tea, with Buttler 67 not out and recalled all-rounder Stokes 42 not out.
That still left England needing a further 348 runs to reach a huge target of 521. The most any side has made to win in the fourth innings of a Test is the West Indies 418 for seven against Australia at St Johns Antigua, in 2003.
But Buttler and Stokess stand, so far worth 111 runs, had at least helped England regain some self-respect by ensuring they got through a session without losing a wicket.
The pair had their moments of good fortune along the way. Buttler was dropped on one by debutant wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant and on 35 he edged fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah only for the ball to bounce in front of Cheteshwar Pujara, stood too deep at first slip.
Left-handed batsman Stokes -- recalled by England just days after his acquittal on an affray charge following an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September last year -- had made 38 when he was rapped on the pad by Ravichandran Ashwin.
India reviewed the not out decision for lbw, with off-spinner Ashwins delivery seemingly having straightened enough to hit the stumps.
Stokes, however, survived on umpires call.
But both batsmen defended solidly and Buttler completed his fifty in style when he cover-drove Bumrah for a tenth four in 93 balls faced. England, however, lost their first wicket just five balls into Tuesdays play when fast bowler Sharma, testing the left-handed openers from round the wicket, got one to straighten away from the flat-footed Keaton Jennings (13), who was caught behind.
Englands 27 for one soon became 32 for two when Sharma had Alastair Cook (17) edging one that straightened late to second-slip KL Rahul.
England then lost their next two wickets on 64, captain Joe Root (13) and Ollie Pope (16) both caught in the cordon.
Root tried to force a Bumrah delivery he could have left and Rahul, still at second slip, held the sharp chance -- his fifth catch of the match.

Calas heart-rending tale
Many people out there treat their dogs like their children, but then there are others, who subjugate these sweet creatures to extremely inhumane conditions.
Cala, the guard-dog of a mechanic in San Jose, Costa Rica, was one of those unfortunate pups. Her owner kept her chained up on a chain so short that she had no way of resting her head and could barely breathe. When she was sick the owner wouldnt take her to the vet and rarely fed her. Fortunately for Cala, her suffering had a positive end.
Concerned neighbours saw the conditions her owner had kept her in for years and reported them to the police as well as the animal shelter Territorio de Zaguates. When she was finally rescued, Cala had to be treated for emaciation, wounds, and malnutrition.
Lya Battle, the founder of Territorio de Zaguates, told the Dodo, The picture I first saw of her showed a pitiful creature robbed of its dignity and ready to give up - a dog whose spirit had been broken and was just waiting for the end to come while living a never-ending nightmare.
She described the healing process as a slow one, the humans around her still had to cause her pain through the curing of her wounds, especially the gash in her neck caused by years of hanging from a tight metal chain around her neck,
Even after her rescue Cala would come to endure more abuse at the hands of humans. In June, people snuck into the sanctuary in an attempt to kill some of the dogs with poison sausages. While 16 of the dogs died, this tenacious pup survived. Battle said this was probably in part due to her size and although she suffered some neurological problems Calas health returned.
Today Cala is living with a host family and has learned to get along with new humans and dogs alike.
After years of neglect, torture, and imprisonment, Cala seems to be getting all the puppy misbehaving process out of her system and we all think thats just fine. She is happy, strong, willful, a bit stubborn, and spoiled by her foster mom and family, said Battle, adding, This rescue is an epic battle of good against bad and of hate against love, and in the end, as it always does, love wins.

CDC Events and Gensoft launches Asia Logistics Forum
Asia Logistics Forum 2018 organized by CDC Events & Travels together with Gensoft will be held on September 4 and 5 at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. This conference is expected to attract at least 200 participants worldwide.
The significance of the conference is to bring Logistics industry stakeholders in the South Asian region together to enhance their knowledge and further improve the Logistics Industry. This Forum is designed to create a two-way information flow that provides individual meetings, special technical and networking sessions in a professional Conference environment.
Businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of logistics, since it is a crucial factor in the delivery process that gets goods from the warehouse to the customers door. It means that customers are no longer willing to wait long periods of time for goods they order. Standard shipping times are decreasing, and this means companies need to invest in new technology to speed up the last stage of the delivery process or risk losing out to competitors.
Asia Logistics Forum 2018 brings together key decision makers and policy influencers to help delegates plan the changes needed to maintain supply chain efficiency as Sri Lanka poises itself to be a global logistics hub. The Asia Logistics Forum aims to bring together industry stakeholders in the import, export distribution and supply chain management sectors to gain knowledge and exchange ideas on how logistics will evolve in the future.
This one-of-a-kind conference will enable participants to understand how innovation and technology are changing the logistics landscape; that would soon make the leap from being futuristic to being commonplace on our roads, or in the skies.
Innovation is fast becoming an important factor on how logistics companies operate and providing a platform for stakeholders to learn new ways to do business becomes ever more important, explained Nilanka Peiris, Managing Director - Gensoft (Pvt) Ltd.
He revealed further, the new trend is to fine tune industry best practices by bringing in technology to assist in the process. Asia Logistics Forum is also working on a number of exciting opportunities that will unlock long term partnerships within its participants.
Imran Hassan, Managing Director of CDC Events commented, Logistics clusters are vitally important to the growth of commerce and trade and Asia Logistics Forum 2018 represents an ideal opportunity for effective networking between the leaders of global shipping and the sharing of best practice between the clusters.
He added, CDC Events looks forward to be working with logistics providers and help them create a maritime destination that is welcoming to all businesses and people from all over the world, and the realization of this vision..

Reeta was returning from the district court of Colombo. She was earlier told by her lawyer that the magistrate has the powers that of a District Court Judge and that he as an experienced lawyer and an exponent of the courtcraft and knows the mind of the judge than anyone. Therefore the todays failure in getting the custody of her child is nothing more to be worried about.
Why should not she She had already parted good portion of her meagre fortune for this shameless fellow. He called himself happily married. She pondered over the ordeal she had to put up with. Never mind, my body is not all that is important. The custody of the child is her ultimate goal. It also means a self-sacrifice. The lawyers words reverberated in her ears. You must be prepared to make marginal sacrifices. Do not think what you pay is enough to muster a good lawyer. This is a Pro-deo job. She was at a loss to understand the meaning of the word. The G. C. E. advance level education she had at the Kelaniya is not helpful to her in understanding Latin.
The lawyer filled that vacuum. He wants to explain the meaning of all these terms, which he said that she ought to know and as he is quite busy now she is to wait until he returns from the courts. What choice has Reeta got Can she leave this fellows office Can she I have faltered in two previous appearances. How can I find that money Least I can do is to obey the command and stop thinking about what is in store for today.
Loss of parents of a growing girl by no means a happy coincidence. The job she got was after facing a so-called interview along with six other girls and twenty boys were easy. There were more qualified people having lengthy testimonials and certificates and other extra-curricular activities. She thought she would not get the job.
She got it according to her boss though she has no past experience and that she could be trained. She thought when the boss inquired about her family that he became sympathetic. The so-called sympathy she had to put up with that man for two years until she was thrown out from the job on the charge of misbehaviour with a minor staffer. Her fault was when her boss was coming into the office room that she was answering some matters raised by the other party.
She soon realized that this was a set up as she has to give birth to a fatherless. At the settlement of her termination, she was paid three-month salary and further Rs. 5000 referred to as santhosm. Whose santhosm money, she wandered. It is definitely the santhosam for the boss. While parting he said to her that all these help I have given you because you are an orphan. You should have been grateful. Your kind does not deserve this. People soon would know who you are. I can still do you a favour once the child comes. You leave the fellow with me. I can take care of that. And she happened to agree with the proposal due to poverty and the inability to bring up a child by herself in the present condition.
So here is an employer doing a charitable deed to alleviate her difficulties. Good lord such people are found in this world. Otherwise, how can such wretched characters like us to survive in this blessed world Sarcasm is trying to break her head.
Pro-deo, my dear pro-deo! That is the Latin word I have to teach you. Have you learned Latin in school I dont think so!. Nowadays they do not teach these important subjects. That is the cause for this social degeneration. Look, last week I was invited to give a lecture at the law college.
I selected the topic what subjects children should learn. Tomorrow I have to attend a meeting at Kegalle and deliver a lecture on human rights violations in the country. I am handicapped. I dont have the type of the help that I need in this field. People come but they cannot grasp the subject. I think you are intelligent enough. If you agree to my proposal I made to you last time to come and sort out my outstanding matters. After all your aunty is very old she cannot look after you forever; what do you say, Reeta Anyway today I will only release you if you give me a definite answer. All this work I do pro deo. Try to pronounce it properly. It is a useful word for your kind.
What is my kind Everyone seems to talk about my kind. We are the creation of the Holy Father the God! The how can there be different kinds. If all human beings are created by the Holy Father why should there be a difference There apparently has no answer to this questions.
Morning bus from Pettah takes her to Kelaniya by 5.30 a.m but today it seems to be late. She longs for an early bath at her aunts place, which at least provided her shelter for all these years. She has been the only good soul she has known in her own life amongst genteel fork who call me Your Kind. At least she murmured to herself. I am now learning Latin. Pro-deo means in English for merits or free of charge. I think he is a hell of a good lawyer. He exactly knows what children should know to have a moral society. He is a defender of human rights violations. The right kind to be in the right place! At least I am sure of one thing. That is fighting to get my child apart for me he will not come to worry about his fees. She came to this conclusion when she was dropped near Pettah bus stand, he was sporting a smile; a smile of satisfaction. So my kind is needed as fodder to create such smile of satisfaction.
She came to her senses when a vehicle stopped near her. Head popped out said get in. She meekly got into the Volvo car which later stopped at a lush greenhouse. The driver looked younger than her. Could be less than twenty-five. Perhaps may even be schooling. Signs of affluence written all over him. He appears to be no novice. She is proved right. It is a large luxurious well lit bungalow. There is a sprawling garden which is well-kept. She has no idea how to judge a good garden from a bad garden. Nor that she had the experience elsewhere. The sun is rising. Its early luminous rays are beginning to pierce her eyes. She felt some comfort in her skin. The sun rays are reflecting from the three cars parked in the garage. Some servants are smiling at her. Seated in a comfortable armchair in the large verandah, she was told that the lady of the house is in the hospital.
A servant who brought her a pot of coffee. If her mother was alive she would have been happy to see her in that place at that time. She longed to embrace her mother whom she lost when she was only 10years old, to tell her new situation. Well, it is only a dream. She came to senses with the message Baby Hamu wants you upstairs conveyed by another servant. For a moment she felt she is the lady of the house. She suddenly longed for a bath. Reeta added an extra spring and strength to her heel. The sounds of spring; a melody added to the path of the oldest profession in the world.

Chinas Liu breaks 50m backstroke world record
JAKARTA, Tuesday: China's Liu Xiang set a new world record in the women's 50 metres backstroke to win Asian Games gold on Tuesday. The 21-year-old clocked a time of 26.98 seconds -- the first time a female swimmer has broken 27 seconds for the event -- in Jakarta.
Liu, nicknamed Swimming Goddess, finished well ahead of team-mate Fu Yuanhui's 27.68 and Japan's Natsumi Sakai in 27.91 on the third evening of competition. She claims the record held for nine years by fellow Chinese Jing Zhao, who clocked 27.06 at the 2009 world championships in Rome.
RECORD-BREAKING TEEN CLAIMS SHOOTING GOLD
Sixteen-year-old Indian shooter Saurabh Chaudhary set a new Asian Games record as he bagged the first major title of his career in the 10 metre air pistol competition on Tuesday. Chaudhary's 240.7 put him ahead of Japan's Tomoyuki Matsuda, who scored 239.7, and fellow Indian Abhishek Verma's 219.3.
He captured India's first shooting gold medal of the Games in Indonesia after Deepak Kumar and Lakshay Lakshay had to settle for silver in the 10m air rifle and men's trap. In the men's 50m rifle three positions, China's Hui Zicheng saw off his Indian challenger Sanjeev Rajput to take gold with a score of 453.3.
The 2016 World Cup Final silver medallist claimed China's fifth gold medal of the shooting competition, putting them well ahead of second-placed Taiwan on two. In the inaugural mixed trap team event, Alain Moussa and Ray Bassil secured Lebanon's first gold medal of these Asian Games. They saw off challenges from the Taiwanese and Chinese pairs, who placed second and third respectively.
WEIGHTLIFTER DIAZ WINS FIRST ASIAN GAMES GOLDFOR PHILIPPINES
Weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz won the Philippines first gold medal of the 2018 Asian Games and proud Indonesian Eko Yuli Irawan triumphed for the hosts on a pulsating day of action Tuesday.
Diaz, the silver medallist from the Rio Olympics, pipped Turkmenistan's Kristina Shermetova by just one kilogramme to win the women's 53kg class. Earlier Irawan, also a silver medallist in Rio, dominated the men's 62kg competition to take Indonesia's first weightlifting gold of the Games in front of President Joko Widodo. Veteran Irawan, 29, has won multiple major medals in a senior weightlifting career stretching back to his bronze at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, but had never before set foot on the top step of the podium.
Diaz raised 92kg in the snatch and 115kg in the clean and jerk for a 207kg total that proved just enough to edge out Shermetova (93kg snatch, 113kg clean and jerk). Thailand's Khambao Surodchana took the bronze on 201kg. - AFP
Baby born on events opening day named Asian Games
JAKARTA: A baby born on the same day as the Asian Games opened in Indonesia and in a city co-hosting it has been named Asian Games, local media reported Monday.

The girl, whose full name is Abidah Asian Games, was born just hours before the huge events opening ceremony took place on Saturday at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.

THIRD TERM FOR PRESIDENTS
The latest controversial talk given much publicity in both press and electronic media is whether a President who has served two terms of office as President could recontest for the third term. The controversy, as I see is after a break, whether they are eligible.
The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka states in CHAPTER VII  THE EXECUTIVE  The President of the Republic  30-[2] No person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the people shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people.
Can anyone more knowledgeable enlighten the masses, giving weightage to the words NO PERSON and THEREAFTER as we are being misguided by politicians and those who have had special favours during a Presidents regime.

The climax of the traditional vannam
Vannam is one of the Kandyan dance forms. It is the last inclusion in Kandyan dance. There are altogether eighteen Vannams in the Kandyan dance. Each Vannam is based on a separate theme. The last inclusion of Vannam in Kandyan dance has provided a lot of scope for Nirthya movements in the Kandyan dance. It is a truth that the Tamils and Sinhalese live together on this Island for centuries. Both these communities are linked together by religion, language and culture. They are inter-related with one another with peace and harmony. Each community respects each others culture, traditions, religion, and the arts. The Vannams are also often referred to as Vannams.
The word Vannam was derived from the Sinhala text Varnana. According to the ancient Sinhala text earlier, the Vannams were used to sing only. Later they were used to the solo dance, each reveals one dominant idea. The Kandyan King Sri Weeraparakrama Narendrasinghe gave full support. Generally, the Vannams are based on numerous themes. It is based on nature, history, legend, folk religion and folk beliefs. There are many similarities in the terminologies among Vannams, Bharatha Natyam and Kathakali. Each Vannam is based on separate imaginative themes.
Devotion and dedication
Normally many Buddhists visit Hindu Temples and worship the Hindu deities. They worship with total devotion and dedication. Such attitudes bring communal harmony, religious harmony, and mutual understanding between the two main ethnic communities. The longstanding relationship between the two communities naturally influences one anothers rational and cultural relationship.
Generally, the Vannam is based on numerous themes. It is based on various themes, such as folk legends, nature, and religion. Most of the Vannams describe the behaviour of animals such as elephants, monkeys, rabbits, reptiles, and birds. Each Vannama is based on a separate imaginative theme.
First among the Vannam is Gajaga Vannama. Gajaga Vannama is based on a particular legend. It deals and explains that Iravana, an elephant, sporting in the cool water of a lotus tank. The movements of the elephants majestic movements, majestic twists and majestic steps are naturally and beautifully reflected in the Vannama. This is a most attractive Vannama.
In Tamil language, Gaja means elephant. Lord Ganesha the elephant-faced God is always called as Lord Ganapathy, Gajan, Gajamugan, Gajavathan, Gajendran, Gaja Nathan, and Gaja Mohan. There is another Vannama on God Ganesha. In this Vannama, the dancers invoke the blessings of Lord Ganesha. This Vannama is called Ganapathy Vannama.
Naiyandi Melam
Another Vannama is Naiyandi Vannama. In Tamil, there was a Melam (orchestra) called Naiyandi Melam which was quite popular and was in use long ago, but still, in some places, Naiyandi Melam is practised.
The Naiyandi Vannama is dealing with a story connected to a princely Naga (cobra); the snake charmers movements are reflected less in this dance, but the movements of the snake are reflected more in the dance. For this Vannama, Sarpa Sirasa hand gesture is used.
The Sarpa Sirasa hand gesture is used in Bharatha Natyam (Tamil classical dance form), and Kathakali. In Bharatha Natyam, the Naga Narthanam is especially a dance which depicts the dance of the Cobra. Another Vannama called Naga Vannama depicts the one day life of a Cobra which crawls on the floor of the court halls and depicts how the Cobra emerges out of its hole and how the cobra raises its hood in different, directions. This depicts the real natural reflecting movements of the Cobra.
In Bharatha Natyam, the single hand Muthra Sarpasirasa and the joint hand gesture Naga Bandha, Muthras (gestures) depict the Naga (cobra) Muthras.
Another Vannama which is called Hanuma Vannama. In this Vannama the dancer reveals the actions, and different attitudes of a monkey, through the movements, by jumping, from tree to tree etc. The dancers dress as monkeys with monkeys facial feature makeup. In Hinduism, Lord Hanuman worship is widely practised for success, bravery, moral strength, and protection
Some of the Vannams are directly linked with Hindu mythology, for instance, Savula Vannama. Savula Vannama is almost based on Skanda Purana. According to this Vannama, there was turmoil between the Asuras and the Devas.
In the end, Lord Skanda entered the battlefield with sword and spear and fought with the Asuras. At last one of the Asuras was split, into two by the Lord Skanda. In Hinduism Lord, Skanda killed the Sooran (Asura) who were split by Lord Skanda into two. Thereafter, the Asura became a cock and then a peacock.
Victorious dance
Mayura Vannama is another Vannama. The theme of the Vannama is about the peacock Vahana (vehicle) of Lord Kataragama. Buddhists worship the Lord Kataragama. Lord Skanda or Lord Muruga, whose vahana is a peacock, which is also called in Tamil as Mayuram. Lord Skanda (Lord Murugan) is often called Mayuran. The Mayura hand gesture is used in Bharatha Natyam and Kathakali to depict the peacock.

The official Representative of the Sri Lankan Chapter, Mano took over its administration in 2000 that saw the ABRSM leap into heights in classical music among students and teachers alike and music became very professionalized and endearing.
BEST ACHIEVERS
Chanul Dandeniya at the piano opting for Mozart's Sonata in C major, really threw me back the way he caressed the keyboard. He was a petite, shy at a glance and never appeared to have got hold of himself but once he sat down and started playing, he was full of confidence and enjoyed or I would say relished the great composer's score that saw him bag the prize at Grade 5. No doubt, Chanel's rapport with the piano is going to be a lifelong experience as he keeps discovering the masters and I see him making a debut on the international stage if he keeps up the tempo and his passion for the keyboard. Naveen Kulasinghe who snatched diploma at AMBRSM is yet another star in the horizon when his violin spoke for him Beethoven's SPRING SONATA Op. 24 is one score I remember well because I played it for an exam probably when I was Naveen's age and as a Royal College student when the rest of my gang were from Trinity College.
Amazing how history repeats.
Rushika Wettasinge had so much spring at the keyboard playing PAGANANI JAZZ which I am not very familiar with through the eccentric Paganini happen to be a favourite of mine. Rushika richly deserved the only LRSM of the evening.
Anagi Gunasekara was really 'anagi' rendering the all-time favourite, OVER THE RAINBOW (Harburg/Harold Arlen) in a high-pitched soft voice. For a little girl clinching the Grade 4 award, she was great. Anagi was a very confident pretty princess who can afford to aim high in her chosen area of music.

A group of Facebook friends in Pallebedda built a Sangavasa at the Karawilayaya Temple at a cost of over Rs. 800,000.
Neesha Madhurangi, who led this noble deed, said that when she visited the Karawilayaya village once, she saw the dilapidated temple there. After taking its pictures with her mobile phone, she posted them on Facebook along with a caption.
Many Facebook friends thereafter contacted her and asked for details. Several of them got together and visited the temple to see what they could do to improve its condition. They decided to build a two-room Sangavasa and donate it to the temple.
Thereafter, they launched a fund with Rs. 10,000 and it gradually grew with contributions of her Facebook friends here and abroad. Within months, they built the Sangawasa spending the money in the fund and donated to the Maha Sangha, she said.

Facets of tabla playing
Among the latest global trends related to music, the study of positive benefits related to learning music and engaging in music-related activities, are in the forefront. Various research studies conducted in such subject areas as social sciences, early childhood development and neurology has shown that music actively assists in the cognitive development of children.
The medium of expression in music is either singing or else playing an instrument. In the playing of instruments, such instruments used help in the process of expression. The teaching process in learning to play the tabla from long ago is the guru-shishyaparampara (teacher-student relationship) from generation to generation, also called the study method based on gurukula. The main concepts of that are skills, knowledge and application. According to this method, the student will study under the teacher for a long period, while the teacher will systematically teach the technical know-how of playing instruments. In this specialized teaching method which is part of the North-Indian musical tradition, the student is able to improve their knowledge, skills, personality, and discipline.
Solitary practice
There are several stages in the learning of tabla playing. They are the practising of tabla in front of the teacher, the solitary practice, and then practising as a group. In the beginning, one acquires knowledge by stationing oneself in front of the teacher. This system that existed in the ancient guru-shishyaparampara education system, can also be seen in the modern classroom. Here, the student who sits in front of the teacher and starts playing the instrument commences the learning process from the moment they place their hands on the tabla, as per the teachers instructions.
The special factor in tabla playing is that the student needs to grasp the teachers stance of playing well, in order to follow it and learn. The student has to pay good attention to the teachers physical movements, in order to do this. The activities that are carried out at this time will help develop communication skills, listening skills, agreement, mutual understanding, and understanding body language. A student learning to play the tabla only engages in the practice under a teacher for a short time. He will have to devote a lot of time to gain proficiency in the subject, practising at home.
He will have to test the knowledge he gained under the teacher and practically apply his skills at this stage. Writing down a score in a book and playing with that as guidance or listening to a recording of it and trying to match that playing, is not a system that was followed in the guru-shishyaparampara education system of ancient India. Studying a piece under the teacher and memorizing it and practising later, once you are not in front of the teacher, is a very successful method of study. One important factor in this is that the memorized piece of music has many special qualities within.
The composition contained syllables, speed, rhythmic pattern ( the number of syllables in each beat) and other such particular characteristics of each beat need to be remembered well. Apart from practising under the teacher in the classroom setting, when one practices in ones home, one should remind oneself of the steps and practice the beat. This activity also develops ones memory and the patience to engage in study.

Fond memories of  Naipaul
The well known English novelist and the Nobel award winner Vidiadhur Surajprasad Naipaul (1932  2018) is no more. But I will never be able to forget the brief encounter I had with him at the BBC World Service, Bush House, Strand, in London, UK during the mid-sixties. I remember well the moment we were introduced to each other, by a friend of ours who happened to be a very close friend of Vidia, the name we used to call him.
I told him that I had by that time read two of his well-known novels, namely The Mimic Men (1967) and A House for Mr Biswas (1961).
Oh how nice to hear all that, was his intimate response. Then we started a discussion. The two works, when our friend remarked: The Mimic Men is all about us, who are working in the World Service. The response on the part of Vidia was just a smile.
Is it true I asked Vidia.
It may be true for those of them who feel so.
He said, adding an extra dimension to the narrative. For me, V S Naipaul looked a strong-willed person in both his creativity as well as in his personal attitude to problems around him. One good example was his bringing out the work titled as An Area of Darkness (1964), a brilliant account of his visit to India. His exposure to some of the events was presented in such a manner that it had caused a stir in the Indian community who lived in London at the time of publication.
Oxford scholar
For most English reader, during the sixties, Naipaul was known as a West Indian writer due to the fact that he was born into an Indian family in Trinidad. He was initially educated in Trinidad, but the chance of furthering his higher studies at Oxford. His birthplace moulds the background for most of his works. Most of the human experiences embedded are influenced by Hinduism. As Professor David Daiches who introduced Naipaul in his work British Commonwealth Literature (1971) states that his works are conspicuously Indian in orientation, and clearly influenced by an English education. After graduating from Oxford, he became a freelance writer cum broadcaster.
In the first instance, he was known as a humorist. This fact is observed in his works like The Mystic Masseur (1957), Suffrage of Elvira (1958) and Miguel Street (1859), where he uses the street as a stage for amusing and moving stories, parables and anecdotes on people and day-to-day events. He had the knack for narrating stories in the way he desired giving vent to humorous dialogues and situations. This factor paved the way for him to become a favourite writer among the contemporary writers.
In this direction, he was more an English writer than an oriental writer of the calibre of R K Narayan and Rabindranath Tagore. Some critics feel that his work In a Free State, which won the Man Booker Award in 1971, is a combination of his vision and creativity and rationalism. He was outspoken about politics and life.
Quite a lot has been written about his personal life and the career as a freelance writer during his stay in England. As he was dogged by money, worries and loneliness and alienation, he was pressed to write and lead a life of a prolific pen pusher. Nevertheless, he had a lot to write during his 85 years of life. As he met his first wife, Pat, at Oxford, she was a literary supporter. In 1996, she died. Then he met Pakistani journalist Nadire Alvi who became his wife for the rest of his life.
Cynical comments
He had been saying that: My life is short. I cant listen to banalities. It is also said that he was not only worried about the Indian politics but also was at times passed cynical comment on the need to change it. He was once interviewed for Radio by a British writer Patrick French who later brought out this biography titled The World is What it is: the authorised biography of V S Naipaul.
Once during my visit to India in a study tour, I came to know that Naipaul studies have come to be introduced as a special literary course in a few universities. I also came to know that this was a friend as set by some of the English literature professors who had studied literature in the UK. But some literary stalwarts detested the move reminding that Naipaul is quite critical about the Indian literary and political scene.
This is the very reason why we should try our best of study Naipaul, commented one senior professor. I felt that Naipaul studies had paved the way to a cross-cultural communication study that was broad-based in both vision and teaching. For his creative process as stated by Naipaul himself, he had the habit of recording day-to-day events in the form of a series of notes and revelations.
This process as stated by Naipaul, led to a better introspective understanding of the existing socio-cultural patterns of the humans in the public sphere, with an emphasis on the Orient and the Occident. Having left Trinidad for he lived in London most of his time contributing to various magazines and periodicals and regular television appearances. He was often requested to comment on subjects closer to his heart on the television programme known in the sixties as Late Night Line Up presented by David Dingleby.
Naipaul had written more than 40 books since receiving the Nobel award. He was silent until his demise two weeks ago.

GMOA seeks Presidents intervention on activities related to FTAs
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) requests President Maithripala Sirisena immediate intervention to stop all activities planned and to be launched by International Trade Ministry Secretary Chandani Wijewardana, GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that Ms. Wijewardena has planned to go ahead with planning and implementing ETCA and several other Foreign Trade Agreements despite the appointment of a Special Committee by President Maithripala Sirisena to look into the issue.
According to Dr. Aluthge, Ms. Wijewardana is just an official from the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and the relevant authorities should find out whether she posses the required knowledge and education to handle FTAs.
Taking part in discussions on FTAs in foreign countries is just another foreign tour for her, Dr.Aluthge alleged.
Her efforts aimed at formulating more and more FTAs, including ETCA is totally unethical and unacceptable, when President Sirisena has already appointed a Committee to look into the issue of the Singapore FTA and all other FTAs, their impact on Sri Lanka etc,  he added.
What should be done is the immediate halting of all FTAs and related activities until the Presidential Committee Report is handed over to the President, Dr.Aluthge added.

Hajj highlights true value of reconciliation: President
As millions of Muslims around the world come together with the common purpose of religious observance to Mecca in the spirit of unity, the festival of Hajj brings the message of true value of reconciliation as aspired by humanity, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in a message marking Hajj.
The President added: Throughout human history, mass gatherings of people were held for religious rituals and activities that have preserved their religious traditions and strengthened co-existence among communities.
The Hajj pilgrimage embodies the sacred link between the divine and human beings. On this momentous occasion, all devotees across the world transcend differences of nationality or status among them and come together in the spirit of unity to worship the God.
In a world where people wage war against each other based on divisions among them, the festival of Hajj exemplifies the importance of the desire for co-existence among different communities.
I wish all Muslims of Sri Lanka and around the world, who engage in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city for Muslims to deliver the message of equality. Happy and peaceful Eid al-Adha.

Build better Sri Lanka for all: State Minister Fowzie
National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie emphasized the importance in applying the good deeds to our lives and joining hands with the government in building a better Sri Lanka for all belonging to all faiths as Sri Lankans are a mixed community.
The Hajj festival (Eid-Ul-Adha) stresses upon the importance of sacrifice, particularly to give up ones pride, arrogance, high status and become one of commoners draped in a simple white cloth and to collectively march against evils, seeking common good of all, State Minister Fowzie said in his message marking the Hajj festival.
He said, Prophet Mohammed Sallallahu alai wasallam set an example to Muslims to respect others while preserving the religion, culture and right to live in peace and harmony.
On this sacred day of Hajj festival, I am happy to convey my sincere greetings to all Muslim fraternity throughout the country with ever lasting peace and prosperity, he said.
As State Minister for National Unity and Co-existence, he said he appeals to the Muslim community to continue to adopt patience, practiced by the fore-fathers, in a manner that makes other communities understand that Islam promotes love, friendship, brotherhood, unity and peaceful co-existence with others.
As far as the Sri Lankan Muslims are concerned, the State Minister said he is happy that Muslims are a well-disciplined community conducting themselves according to the teachings of Islam. In doing so, they pay due respect to other religions and take enough care not to hurt the susceptibilities to fellow citizens.
I wish all my fraternity EID MUBARAK, he said.

Celebrate life, revere mercy of Almighty Allah: Minister Hakeem
Muslims, during Hajj reflect upon the boundless sense of sacrifice and the tradition of humility and submission of Prophet Ibrahim and Ismail. We celebrate Prophet Ibrahims demonstrated willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of supreme submission to God's command this day, stated Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem marking Hajj.
He added: As He decreed, we celebrate life and revere the mercy and immeasurable kindness of Almighty Allah.
We have arrived at yet another holy day to reflect upon the term sacrifice and the Almighty Gods compassion, at daring times of threats to human dignity and social justice faced by Muslims in Sri Lanka and in many other parts of the world.
The community continues to bear the brunt of antagonism of extremist forces with patience and faces political impediments that have unleashed mutation. At times of despair that they face as minorities, regardless of changing regimes and state policies, this day reverberates the essence of Hajj with special resonance in Sri Lanka.
As followers of the traditions of Prophet Ibrahim, more than any other community in the world, we understand that we too as a community are facing challenges of modernization.
We have endured such critical phases. However, our community of Muslims pledge to give our best to cooperate and to work towards a meaningful reconciliation in our country now. In some parts of the world, oppressed communities have also taken to extreme radical Islamic values and militancy.
Our prayers are with those who are displaced; those suffering in internment; the impoverished and the ailing fellow beings. We reflect upon them and pray for mercy at our moment of celebrationon this Holy day of sacrifice, as always.
May the merciful Almighty Allah help us uphold Islamic values and principles of social justice, at all times.
My sincere best wishes and Eid Mubarak!

May the Hajj Festival shower blessings of Allah to fill our hearts and minds with virtuous values, stated Deputy Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council M. T. M. Iqbal in a Hajj message issued yesterday.
The message added that Islam devotees from countries throughout the world assemble at the holy city of Mecca to perform Hajj, recalling the unwavering confidence and dedication on Allah by Ismail Nabi.
"Concurrently, we as Sri Lankans make use of Hajj to strengthen national unity and resolve to help others without any discrimination in the name of humanity. Allah does not look at a person's wealth or features. He only looks at their hearts and behaviour.
"Let us also follow suit and fill our hearts and minds with virtue with the blessing of Allah," he said.

Fill heart with inner peace: envoy
Hajj rituals fill a Muslims heart with inner peace and tranquilly. Various rituals of Hajj purify ones body and soul. The Hajj festival is also an occasion to propagate unity among all, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine M. Fawzan Anwer said in a Hajj message.
His message added: Hajj, one of the five main pillars of Islam, has a message for the benefit and wellbeing of all people of the world, be they Muslim or not. The wonderful message of Hajj is that a Muslim should live in peace with his brothers in humanity, even if they are of different faiths.
Though Hajj is obligatory once in a lifetime on financially and physically capable Muslims, every single Muslim, man or woman, rich or poor, dreams to repeatedly offer it.
During the Hajj rituals, a Muslim respects and accepts the opinions of different juristic schools.

Hemas Holdings weak 1Q results reflect seasonality - Fitch
The weakness in Sri Lanka-based diversified conglomerate Hemas Holdings PLCs (Hemas, AA-(lka)/Stable) first-quarter financial results is temporary, and is mainly due to the cash flow seasonality of its new school stationary business, Fitch Ratings says.
The agency expects Hemas performance to improve during the remainder of fiscal year to end March 31,2019 (FY19), and we have therefore maintained our expectations that the company will achieve revenue growth of 21% and EBITDAR margin of 13% for the full year. Operational challenges in Hemas fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business in Bangladesh also played a part in the companys underperformance in 1QFY19, although we believe that earnings from this segment should also improve. We expect the Bangladesh operation to benefit from Hemas investments in the distribution network and product re-launches in the past few months, Fitch Ratings said.

The current installation at Hirdaramani features 21,000 solar panels generating 7.7 MW, leveraging cutting-edge mono PERC modules. Used for the first time in Sri Lanka by Windforce, PERC modules optimize the efficiency of solar panels by significantly improving light capture; a technology that is rapidly making standard solar cells obsolete.
The Suryadhanavi project is an exciting new step in this journey and we are committed to building on the success of these first implementations, said Nikhil Hirdaramani, Director, Hirdaramani Group. With growing pressure on the environment, we understand the importance for leaders of industry to set the right example and invest in greener more sustainable manufacturing and processes thus creating an impetus for change, he added.
It is envisaged that through Suryadhanavi, 13.4GWh will be added annually to the national energy mix, accounting for more than 30% of electricity consumption by the Group. This would support an annual reduction of 10,200 Tons of CO2e emissions into the atmosphere, the equivalent of removing more than 2200 Passenger Vehicles from the road each year.
The Suryadhanavi project holds strong potential for further expansion and for making a significant contribution to the nations energy security. The world is fast moving towards adopting renewable energy and we are proud to be at the forefront of driving this change. The support of companies such as the Hirdaramani Group makes these changes all the more viable, said Manjula Perera, Managing Director of Windforce (Pvt) Ltd.
We are happy to be part of this mega project driven by Windforce that will see solar installations spreading across the island making a real impact on the energy security of the country while drastically cutting carbon footprints across industries, added Nikhil Hirdaramani.

Jinasena unveils  innovative water pumps
Jinasena (Pvt) Limited, a leading water management system solutions providers in Sri Lanka, has launched two water pumps in keeping with the companys approach of leading from the front by providing innovation and continuously improving its product range.
The first of the two water pumps is the NR 120/1, a new 1-inch 1HP domestic pump that the companys tests have demonstrated can outper form any similar-sized water pump in the market today. This traditional cast iron pump consists of a Noryll impeller and is ideally-suited for high head application domestic customers with its 80ft total head and 25-30ft of suction depth, which can be increased further with the use of a Deep Well Kit. The pump is compact in size, produces less noise and can withstand voltage fluctuations.

Polymer is a 100% recyclable material that is light-weight, durable and safe. All water samples from the Polymer water pumps have been extensively tested at the ITI (Industrial Technology Institute) to ensure that they are free of contaminants. The entire pump is made of Polymer and is therefore non-corrosive.
Elaborating on the additions to the product range, Prabath Jayawardana Deputy General Manager (Research and Development and Quality Control) of Jinasena (Pvt) Limited said, Jinasenas R&D team continuously performs testing and evaluation of our products as well as competitor products to assess where our products stand in the market.
Both the water pumps are available through Jinasenas network of 19 Service Centres located at Colombo, Bandarawela, Buttala, Girandurukotte, Beruwala, Ekala, Avissawella, Dambulla, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle, Kaduruwela, Tambuttegama, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Ampara, Embilipitiya and Jaffna. Both products come with a 7-year warranty, highly-reliable after sales service and ample spare parts.
Founded in 1905, Jinasena (Pvt) Limited was the first Ceylonese-owned engineering company and was rated among the five leading engineering companies in the island by 1932.

Hajj pilgrimage
Leaving a deep, everlasting impact
Labbaika! Allahumma Labbaika, La Sharikalaka! Innal Hamda Wan Nemata Lak Wal Mulk La Sharieka Lak (I stand up for Thy service, O Allah I stand up! There is no partner with Thee! I stand up! Verily Thine is the praise, the blessing and the kingdom! There is no partner with Thee).
This is how the pilgrims glorify the creator, Allahusubhanawathala when approaching the Holy Kaaba for the first time in their life, at this Almighty Allah remarks to the Angels: Look at My servants, they have come towards me disheveled and scattered while their bodies and clothes are covered with the dust of long journeys.
Oh, My Angels, I take you to witness that I have forgiven their sins; The Angels will say: O Allah among them there is that evil man ..... At this Allah will reply: I have forgiven them all How fortunate the hajjis are to get huge rewards for their good deeds from the benevolent Creator - Almighty Allah.
Pilgrims undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca to perform Hajj barely two months after purifying oneself from the worldly desires and unhealthy habits by fulfilling the obligatory fasting as Almighty Allah commanded in the Holy Quran: Pilgrimage to the House of Allah is a duty man owes to Allah - upon those who can afford the journey. When hajjis set out in the path of Allah they are reminded that they prepare themselves for a peaceful exit from the world.
To perform Hajj, hajjis leave behind their property, intimate friends, relations, kith and kin and further their much-cherished motherland for a short period. Pilgrims realise there will be a time to leave everything mentioned above suddenly and forever. An everlasting preparation one makes in this world before death is by doing good deeds in complete adherence to the laws of Allah as clearly narrated in the Holy Quran and in the ways shown by the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him).
After reaching the Holy City, it is most heartening to see the plain desert of Mecca, in the midst, the Holy Kaaba where pilgrims make Tawaf (circuits) seven times reciting O Allah! I beg of thee forgiveness and peace in the world and the next. O, Lord, give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and save us from the torment of the fire.
The noteworthy feature in Hajj is pilgrims all wearing the same, simple and plain white unsewn cloth and living in the same way.
The white cloth the hajjis wear is unique in the sense that it does not differentiate between Kings and laymen, the powerful and the weak and all wearing white and stand equal.
The distinctions of rank and colour, wealth and nationality disappear. The whole of humanity that converges in thousands assumes one aspect and one attitude before the Master. The true love of Allah here becomes the reality and the hajjis are imbued with immense love of the Supreme Being. Hajj leaves a deep and everlasting impact upon one who performs it.
Most of the religious rites pilgrims perform were that of Prophet Ibrahim his wife Hajara their son Ismail (Peace be upon them). It creates on the faithful a tremendous impression of how a family at the time of trial and turbulence to be united sincerely and faithfully in obeying the Lord of the Universe Rabbil Alameen.
To honour the Prophet Ibrahim, (Peace be upon him) and his family till the doomsday Almighty Allah has commanded the Hajjis to exercise their virtuous acts like running seven times between the hillocks known as Al Safa and Al Marwa.
Hajara Alaihissalam, the wife of Prophet Ibrahim in his absence was running in search of water in the barren desert to quench the thirst of her baby Ismail, she was astonished to see a spring bubbling from where baby Ismail had been kicking his heels and today every pilgrim from this miraculous well of Zam Zam drink, bathe, launder their Ihram clothes and further the Holy water is stored in millions of gallons to be fetched home on their return after completion of Haj rituals.
The Holy Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) has reported having said Zam Zam water is a cure for all diseases.
This famous well of Zam Zam which was rebuilt sometime ago with several pipelines sprouting out provided water for the millions of hajjis from the time of Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) for the last five thousand years without receding which itself proves the Almighty Allahs supreme power over his creations. Drinking from Zam Zam water in three sequences while having the intention to be cured with the blessing of Allah from any disease and facing Qiblah. The pilgrim can make the following duaa:
Allahumma inni asaluka ilman naafian wa-rizqan waasian was-shifaaa min kulli dhaain wa saqam!
O, Allah! I beseech You to bless me with a useful knowledge, a generous subsistence, and a cure from any ailment and disease!
Hajjis soon after leaving Mecca, their anxious moment was to go to Medina, The City of the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH).
According to Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) the Prophet said, O Allah bestow in Medina twice the blessings you bestow on Mecca; Once the Hajjis reached the entrance of Medina the green dome of the Prophets Masjid comes into sight where the auspicious body of the Holy Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) with his erstwhile colleagues Abu Bakr Siddique and Umar Farook Ralliallahunhum was laid to rest.
Hazrath Ibnu Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Prophet said The Holy Grave) is like one has visited me while I am alive (Mishkat). Hajjis spend more than eight days in the Prophets town and are opportune to visit various historic sites and pray for those souls whose sacrifices 1439 years ago made us mould our life according to the teachings of Islam.
While Muslims in Sri Lanka and rest of the world celebrate hajj festival as usual in Mecca, Sri Lankan hajjis will be busy along with hajjis from all parts of the world fulfilling the hajj rites in places like Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifa.
Arafah, which is known as the very important Day of Hajj and is on the 9th of Dhul Hijja, the Prophet (S) said: Hajj is Arafah. [Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi]. The pilgrim must be at Arafat on the Ninth of Dhul Hijjah after Dhuhr time. Anyone, who misses Arafat day, his or her Hajj is void. All the scholars said in consensus that this pillar is the most important one. The Prophet said, Hajj is only valid by attending `Arafah. [At-Tirmidhi, an-Nassaai, Abu Dawud, Malek and ad-Daarimi)
At Arafat, pilgrims make supplication (dua), recite Holy Quran, deliver sermons and earnestly seek the blessings of Allah and his forgiveness.
Like last year this time too Sri Lankan pilgrims will devote more time for supplication to bestow peace and happiness to our motherland and throughout the World in the House of Allah, Kaaba.
It is most heartening and appropriate to recall the Prophet Muhammeds (PBUH) first and the last Hajj was made in Hijri 10th. His hajj was known as Hajjathul Wida or farewell Hajj.
More than one hundred and twenty-four thousand companions of Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) joined the Hajj.
On the 9th day of Arafat the verse announcing the completion of the religion of Islam was revealed to the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) this day I perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion (5-4).
At the Mount Arafat, Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) made the farewell sermon, companions who were present at that sermon began to carry the message - the light of Islam to every nook and corner of the world.
We learn from the above that this is a duty of every hajji who departs from Arafat to take some share in practicing and propagating the teachings of Islam in their environments which alone can bring peace and salvation to the entire world.

Maruti has finally unveiled the first facelift of its c-segment sedan, Ciaz. The new car is an incremental update to the outgoing model with minor tweaks made to the cars interiors and exteriors. However, Maruti has given the car a new heart in the form of a K15 engine. The Ciaz pre-bookings are already live and the car is expected to hit the showrooms soon.
The companys SHVS, micro-hybrid technology is available with both petrol and diesel variants. However, Ciaz diesel will not get the option of an automatic gear system.
The new Ciaz gets a sleeker grill up front with heavy chrome-work. The headlight and DRLs have also been tweaked to house projector headlamps and always-on daytime running lights.
The tail lights have also received a makeover with sleek horizontal lines giving the rear a wider look. Overall the design looks similar to the older version but still gets a refreshed look, all thanks to the changes in the front grille. Ciaz 2018 also gets bigger air vents up front, giving it a bigger and broader stance.
The interiors follow the same colour scheme as the previous version. However, Maruti has introduced a new faux wood panel on the dashboard, giving it a slightly premium touch and feel. The central console comes with a 7-inch touchscreen that supports both Android Auto and Apple Car Play. The instrument cluster gets a major update as well. The car now comes with a TFT screen similar to the one found on the top two variants of Baleno. The new car gets cruise control as well.
The powertrain gets an update in the form of a 1.5-liter K-series petrol engine. The new engine churns out 103 bhp with a respectable 138 Nm of torque. The engine is able to give a class-leading mileage of 21.56 kmpl on the petrol variants. In part, thanks to the SHVS micro-Hybrid system that provides additional torque in stop and start traffic as well as heavy acceleration. The diesel variant gets the same 1.3-liter unit that gives out 89 bhp of power and 200Nm of torque. BBC

Minister gamage proposes export logistic hub in Romania
Romania with the support of government should develop a logistic export hub in Romania said Minister Social welfare and Primary Industries, Daya Gamage. Romania is having free trade with other EU countries and has enormous opportunities to penetrate the European market by having a logistic export hub in Romania, the Minister suggested.
Daya Gamage made this suggestion recently after he met OPREA, Minister for Business Environment, Commerce and Entrepreneurship in Romania Stefan-Radu. This mission was facilitated by the Dr. Victor Chiujdea, Ambassador of Romanian Embassy in Sri Lanka.

Imprisonment of Ven. Gnanasara Thera
Most Ven.Ittapane Mahayanayake writes to President
Mahayanayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha Most Ven. Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera in a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday said that the offence that is said to have been committed by the General Secretary of Bodu Bala Sena Organization Ven.Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera at the Homagama Courts was not committed to achieving a personal benefit.
The Mahanayake Thera in his letter to the President over the imprisonment of Ven.Ganasara Thera said that if the Buddhist monks who speak on behalf of the country and the people are imprisoned, it would pose a challenge to the entire Bhikkhu community
Excerpts from the letter:It is our responsibility to express some sentiment with regard to Ven. Galagodaathte Gnanasara Thera, since he belongs to the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha. Since the court proceedings regarding him are not over, we would not delve into it. Therefore, our Sangha Sabha has decided to bring the following points to the attention of the President.
From ancient times, the Sri Lankan Bhikkhu was a character that always stood and fearlessly spoke for the country and for the benefit of the wider society.
If the Buddhist monks who speak on behalf of the country and the people are imprisoned it would pose a challenge to the entire Bhikkhu community.
We would like to further state that the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha stands for the country as well as for all communities and religions and highly values justice and fairness.

MR trying to settle Pohottuwas internal conflicts by talking about Presidency - Duminda
Former President Mahinda Rajapksa is trying to settle internal conflicts within the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) party claiming that he too has a chance to contest the Presidential Election again, Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday alleged.
Addressing a media conference at the Mahaweli Centre yesterday, Minister Dissanayake said that according to the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution,former Presidents Mahinda and Chandrika cannot contest any Presidential election since no President can hold the Executive Presidency for more than two terms.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is very well aware that he has no chance to be the Executive President of the country legally.
The Minister was responding to a question by a journalist regarding the statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna will seek the Supreme Courts advice, whether under the 19th Constitutional Amendment, a person who had previously held the post of President twice, could contest at a Presidential election again.
Minister Dissanayake said that the conflict between senior politicians of the Pohottuwa party arose after proposing the names of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Chamal Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa for the Presidential candidate of the party by various persons.
Senior politicians Kumara Welgama and Vasudeva Nanayakkara openly opposed some of these proposals while MP Dinesh Gunawardena remained silent since nobody proposed him as the Presidential candidate. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa used this announcement as a trick to unite all these members, Minister Dissanayake added.
Responding to a question by a journalist who asked about the involvement of the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members who recently vacated their posts in the government in the reform drive of the SLFP, Minister Dissanayake said that some MPs like Dayasiri Jayasekara are actively involved in the reform process. But, some of them are not actively participating in the process. So as a party we will take a decision on them.

MR's memory loss
Politicians developing sudden amnesia when confronted with tricky situations has now become a common phenomenon in sunny Sri Lanka. Forgetfulness, to put it in simple English, we thought, was a disease confined to the likes of Duminda Silva. The onetime powerful Monitoring MP of the Defence Ministry professed to have forgotten all the events at the scene of the murder of Presidential Advisor Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra in Kollonnawa on the day of the LG elections. Ditto for ignorance. Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, giving evidence before the Special Presidential Commission hearing the Central Bank bond issue, pleaded ignorance on who paid Rs. one million rent a month for the luxury apartment he and his family were occupying during the renovation of his own residence.
Then it was the turn of Basil Rajapaksa. Questioned by CID sleuths on the ownership of the luxury bungalows built in Malwana, during the Presidency of his brother, the former Economic Development Minister simply claimed he did not know. Not to be outdone, when journalists asked Namal Rajapaksa outside the court hearing the Hi Corp matter the former first son said he was completely in the dark as to how he received Rs. 30 million to invest in the Company.
The latest to be afflicted with the syndrome is the former President himself. Asked by pressmen outside his Wijerama Mw. residence after he was quizzed by the CID over the Keith Noyahr abduction, if it was true that the journalist was released by his abductors thanks to the intervention of the present Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who contacted him over the phone about the abduction, MR simply said mata mathaka ne Karu Jayasuriya katha kalada kiyala (I cannot remember if Karu Jayasuriya called me).
The Keith Noyahr affair was brought to the limelight once again with the advent of the present government. The investigation was reopened, court proceeding followed and suspects were remanded. It is astounding indeed amidst all the hullabaloo for Rajapaksa's memory to be all that slippery to forget this important telephone call that saved the life of the former Deputy Editor of the Nation, ie. assuming that things happened the way it did.
However, the Speaker has already given his statement on the matter to the investigators and it was thereafter that the CID questioned Rajapaksa. Hence, there is no reason to doubt the episode. Besides, the sequence of events received wide publicity in the media, with the reopening of the case, which was not refuted by Rajapaksa and long enough for him to remember if indeed there was a call or not from the Speaker about the fate of the journalist.
One recalls newspaper reports of a similar abduction and release of the brother-in-law of former Minister Jeevan Kumaratunga after contact was made by the latter with former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Here too, perhaps, like the Speaker's intervention, the influence of the film star turned politician who was then a staunch member of the Rajapaksa camp, saved the life of his brother-in-law, whose abduction it was alleged was an accident- the abductors not knowing the identity of the victim.
Hence there is little doubt that the White Van abductions were carried out at the instance of very powerful personages of the Rajapaksa regime, whatever the protestations of ignorance on this score.
It was expressly stated by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to journalist activists Poddala Jayantha and Santh Balasuriya, when the duo were subjected to an inquisition at the Presidential Secretariat by the former Defence Secretary, that he was unable to protect them from harm they may encounter at the hands of military personnel (This was after the duo led a protest demonstration opposite the Fort Railway Station against attacks on journalists allegedly carried out by the military). This, no doubt, gives more than an inkling of the existence of hit squads manned by military personnel to harm journalists. The two media personnel, not long after this fled the country, with Poddala Jayantha virtually maimed.
Be that as it may, a spectacle was made of the whole affair of the CID quizzing the former President at the latter's residence, with bus loads of supporters ferried to the venue to express solidarity with Rajapaksa some of them shouting slogans and displaying placards. The same scenario was witnessed when, sometime back, former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa made an appearance at the CID headquarters. On that occasion the bussed in crowds chanted the slogan Viharamahadeviyata jayawewa (hail queen Viharamahadevi) which no doubt evoked amusement in many watching the TV footage.
Apparently the stampedes witnessed at court houses when the Rajapaksas were brought for their cases is now being replicated at MR's official residence. This, no doubt, is a ploy to intimidate the investigating officers. If so, the government should take steps to prevent such shows of solidarity, because this is a gross interference in the duties of police officers. We say this because the trend might catch on and crowds accompanying politicians hauled up for financial crimes to express solidarity, will tantamount to a rebuke against the law.

Enterprise Sri Lanka
A new hope for the nation
Enterprise Sri Lanka, the governments loan programme launched on June 22, is designed for young entrepreneurs in the country. The Gamperaliya scheme, implemented in accordance with Enterprise Sri Lanka in the countrys poorest regions, is one of the governments primary focuses over the next two years.
Enterprise Sri Lanka is meant to be accessible for all districts, rich and poor, most and least-developed. Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera inaugurated the first exhibition on the Gamperaliya scheme last week, while an exhibition on Enterprise Sri Lanka had been planned to be held between August 29 and 31, in the Moneragala district. More would follow in the Anuradhapura and Jaffna districts as well.
The exhibitions display the sweeping objectives of Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya: raising the per capita income to USD 5,000, creating one million new jobs, doubling exports, and sustaining GDP growth at five percent. In its current iteration, more than a dozen loan schemes are expected to develop Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs), promote green energy, empower farmers, reduce poverty, empower youth and women, as well as to promote tourism, exports and supply chain development.
Through these programmes, the government seeks to address the development of the nation as a whole, but is it feasible In many districts, issues of indebtedness and unemployment had crippled local economies. Would the programme be accessible to them Government officials from the Northern and Eastern provinces said it would.
Enterprise Sri Lanka offers collateral-free concessionary loan schemes for 16 different categories of entrepreneurs: farmers and fisherman, owners of houses less than 1,000 square feet, journalists, young graduates, middle-income youth wishing to purchase a house for the first time, to name a few. The governments stated purpose is to diversify economic growth and create 100,000 entrepreneurs by 2020.
Enterprise Sri Lanka would establish a new relationship between banks and Sri Lankans, to better serve the people. The scheme works in conjunction with all national banks: Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank, as well as a number of private banks. Under Enterprise Sri Lanka, loans are provided through the banking system.
All Sri Lankans can access these loans, Finance Ministry Development Finance Department Director Manjula Hettiarachchi said, They have to pay interest rates. Most of these loans are subsidised by the government.
Most of the schemes offer between 50 to 70 percent subsidies on interest rates. In some cases, under schemes designed for recent graduates and journalists, loans are given without interest. Sri Lanka had experienced economic growth during the last decade, characterised globally as a Middle-Income Economy, especially in the domestic sector. In 2015, the Census and Statistics Department, in conjunction with the World Bank, issued a report that the poverty rate was below 15 percent for a large part of the country.
A majority of Divisional Secretariat divisions in the Colombo and Gampaha districts, as well as sizeable parts of the Kalutara and Polonnaruwa districts, are particularly well-off, with estimated poverty rates below five percent. In contrast, high poverty incidence concentrates in the Mannar, Mullaitivu, Batticaloa and Monegerala districts.
For the wealthiest districts in the country, the governments Enterprise Sri Lanka loan programme is a way of expanding and stimulating further development of already-developed regions. In the poorest districts, the government is using the programme to develop under-developed areas.
In the past, the same financial programmes had not served poorer districts as they did in more developed regions. In the North and East for example, the governments post-war reconstruction strategy focused on expanding credit and building infrastructure. With the sudden introduction of banks all over these war-affected areas, people unaccustomed and ill-equipped to strategically repay their loans, fell into deep indebtedness.Highlighting the topic, Hettiarachchi said, Sri Lanka faces a debt crisis with microfinance, and it seen especially in the North and East. We will provide relief for people facing such issues, as well as those affected by droughts.
One of the most meaningful aspects of Enterprise Sri Lanka, is its debt relief packages which pay off debts of up to Rs.100,000.
Whether or not the relief packages go far enough in relieving debt, remains to be seen.
When discussions on Enterprise Sri Lanka began sometime in 2017, the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) had its own loan programme, which specifically addressed the needs of entrepreneurs in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Since the governments national programme came into being, however, the ONURs loan scheme was dissolved. If Enterprise Sri Lanka is to be successful in the North and East, it would have to provide what the ONUR loan scheme did and more.
ONUR Deputy Directors Somasiri Ekanayake and Suduth Jayasinghe said that the ONURs mandate under Enterprise Sri Lanka, is to act as a coordinating body between the government and district officials.
Jayasinghe said, Enterprise Sri Lanka is accessible. There is a debt trap, and people are waiting for their guarantees by the government.
Jayasinghe and Ekayanake highlighted how Enterprise Sri Lanka works in conjunction with
Gamperaliya, to provide basic infrastructure for people to succeed. According to Ekanayake,
Gamperaliya, theoretically, would address basic requirements of young entrepreneurs attempting to run businesses, such as functioning roads and water tanks.
Addressing the issue of loans in the North and East, Ekanayake said, The critical problem is not an accounting one, but attaining two guarantees from government officers.
In order for entrepreneurs to receive these loans, they need to have assurances from government officials that they are equipped to manage it. Under the ONUR loan scheme, those regulations were relaxed so all that was required of an applicant was submitting the support of two or three other bank account holders, such as other entrepreneurs from their village.
It fostered a spirit of cooperative community development, at least in the process of receiving loans. But ONUR officials were unsure whether or not their recommendation had made it into the final draft of Enterprise Sri Lanka.
We highlighted this requirement during meetings. It is a barrier for the development of the Northern and Eastern provinces. We stressed the provision of concessional loans, Ekanayake added.
The Jaffna District Secretariat Deputy Director said, Enterprise Sri Lanka is accessible to everyoneI feel that it will be helpful for the people in the Jaffna district.
He was not alone; the Mullaitivu District Secretariat Director of Planning said, It is a good schemeEntrepreneurs willing to expand their business will benefit from this programme.
If Enterprise Sri Lanka succeeds, it may help alleviate economic stagnation in years to come. When Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced Enterprise Sri Lanka on May 31, he said, Prior to 2015, government revenue dropped for decades and reached one of the lowest in the world. Debt servicing exceeded the total government revenue. The effects of previous debts will be felt more in future. More than 75 percent of government debt servicing during 2019 and 2022, will be due to the maturing or bunching of debt obtained prior to 2015.
If the Finance Ministers economic forecast is correct, stimulating domestic investment through loan schemes such as Enterprise Sri Lanka is important now more than ever. The government assesses that it would create jobs and propel innovation that would have a multiplicative effect on the expansion of the economy.

Over 100 towns in country do not sell cigarettes
The Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) Union of Sri Lanka has informed Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that there are 107 towns in Sri Lanka which do not sell cigarettes, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the Union launched several programmes to educate the public on the ill effects of smoking and as a result shop owners and businessmen from many towns stopped selling cigarettes.
There are 22 towns in the Jaffna district, 17 towns in the Matara district, 16 towns in the Kurunegala district which do not sell cigarettes. The total number of towns which do not sell cigarettes is 107.
Minister Senaratne admired the contribution made by PHIs to minimise smoking in the country and expressed hope on increasing the number of towns which do not sell cigarettes up to 200 by by 2019 (next year), he said.
Several steps were taken under the direction of Minister Senaratne during past three years to discourage smoking in the country. Increasing the tax on tobacco up to 90 percent, increasing the pictorial warning covering 80 percent of the cigarette packet, banning the sale of cigarettes around a radius of 100 metres from a school and banning smoking in public places are some of those steps, the Minister added.
