A TALENT-LIT EVE BY SUJATHAIANS

Excitement is in the air. Months of sacrifice and effort will soon culminate in a performance that will do justice to the spirit of the girls, staff and management of Sujatha Vidyalaya, Nugegoda - an institution that has produced fine young women. The Daily News visited Sujatha Vidyalaya to speak to the students and staff.
The grand finale of the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Sujatha Vidyalaya, will be a concert involving the whole school. Nipuna Prathibha is an event at Sujatha Vidyalaya held to showcase the talents of students. This year, the Nipuna Prathibha concert will be held involving the whole school.
This is to mark the 50th anniversary of Sujatha Vidyalaya. The event will be celebrated on a grand scale at the BMICH on October 3. The 50th anniversary celebrations will close with the Nipuna Prathibha concert. Here the school orchestra will perform and there will be dancing and singing items, said upper school dancing teacher Samadhi Silva.

A variety of items will be performed by girls of different age groups.
We have been involved in rehearsals for many months every day. The school management is giving us a lot of support. The parents have also been very cooperative. There is also a teacher who comes to train us with the orchestra - Sumith Priyankara. He guides our orchestra. This is the first time such a huge orchestra from Sujatha performs on a stage as big as the BMCIH. The show will start at 6.30pm. This is a big event for our school, stated Silva.
The primary and upper schools consist of over 1,000 students. All items in the aesthetic department will be featured. The sections performing in the concert are pre-school, the primary section and upper school (6- 8, 9-11 and A/L).
This is very much a collaborative team effort. The greatest strength of this event is its variety. It is a balanced event. This is not a public show. It is open only to parents. This will definitely be a success as we have done successful performances before. The management is helping us a lot, pointed out Silva.
The Daily News managed to speak to some of the adorable young ones who will certainly reap the benefits of this experience in the years to come and become smart young women who will be leaders in their chosen fields.
Little 11-year-old Dinithi of Grade 6, was the first to speak to us.
Our show will be made successful by our beloved teachers. This is a really big opportunity for us. The teachers have been very helpful in teaching us dancing. Even my friend are making a big effort.
Thirteen-year-old Dahamya said: There are four dance items from Grades 6 to 8. Our teachers are behind us all the time training us and guiding us. I feel very confident that this endeavour will be a success. My friends are also very keen and practicing very hard.
Eleven-year-old Chanuli said that she felt fortunate to have received this experience. This is a great opportunity for us, and my friends have been with me, helping me and teaching me my steps. The Daily News also managed to speak to some English announcers who candidly shared their views on the event. From their comments, it is evident that this has become a journey of discovery and bonding.
This event has given us a great opportunity to show our talents. Almost all of the students in school are participating. They are performing in various ways like dancing, announcing, singing and the orchestra. I feel it is a great opportunity, said Thenuri Silva. We are organizing this marking our Golden Jubilee. This has been a journey of 50 years. We are so happy to be a part of this event to showcase our talents, the talents of almost the entire school, said Nusra Nazar. We all get to work as one, and we get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each other, and build up on our weaknesses. The good thing is that it will be on a grand scale, said Amali Haniffa.I think this event will be very successful because everyone is showing a great amount of commitment. We are getting down professional trainers and we have beautiful costumes. The talents of the students will be brought out by this event, said Yohara Ranasinghe.
The Sinhala announcers did not conceal the fact that they were proud to be where they are now. Like the English announcers, this has been a novel experience for them and something that is unforgettable.
Bringing our talents out has been the most rewarding outcome of these preparations. Sujatha Vidyalaya is an institution where everyone is keen on bringing out the inner strengths of students. I am so happy and proud to be a student of Sujatha Vidyalaya, said Yashodara Silva.
The overall purpose of Sujatha is to develop the characters of its students. Prior to this, there have been other concerts. There is so much scope for children to develop, said Prashansa Wimalasundere.
We have come here with great expectations. I am proud to be a student of this great school, said Malsha Liyanage.
The Daily News also chatted to some of the teachers on what they think of the mega event. They expressed their satisfaction at the zeal the students display in this important event.
It will be a great success and I say this because of the admirable effort our teachers have put into this endeavour. It has been well planned with much astuteness, paying attention to the need for variety.
We have been practicing long and hard because this involves children and therefore a lot of attention has to be given. Also the parents have given a lot of support. It has been an all- round effort, said dancing teacher Sandumini Perera.
This is a truly remarkable event. The children are keen to participate, even though they are fully involved in their studies. They are truly having fun. Extra- curricular activities are as important as studies. The children learn how to face challenges by taking part in events like this, said A/L teacher Eranga Rodrigo.
This is an event with a difference in various aspects when it comes to items. This show is bigger and more glamourous than any show we have previously done. It is successful in a way we never anticipated. The children are very enthusiastic, said primary section dancing teacher Venuri Wijeweera. Finally the Daily News spoke to three young students who are doing something different from what we normally see at a concert.
Monali who is performing a Latin dance item, expressed her opinion on what a positive impact this event has. We are doing this willingly because we realize how important this experience is. Performing in front of a crowd will mold us. We have rehearsals every day and we practice a lot. But we are able to balance our studies and prepare for exams.
My dance item comes from Japanese culture. Japanese is offered as a subject in our school. That is why for the folk dance, we opted to do a Japanese item. This is a very interesting dance item. There is less than a week for the concert and we are really putting in everything we have! We expect this to be a success, Hansini.
The folk dance consists of dances from four cultures  Japan, Mexican, Latin and Indian. I am performing a Japanese folk dance. It is a challenge since it is foreign to us. But I will give it my best shot. The Japanese dance form is performed in a special way by the Japanese people. So it is something that needs to be perfected, said Hansini.

Two cricketing heroes befittingly recognised

Kumar Sangakkara was adjudged the most popular Sri Lankan by the voting of people and also the icon of Sri Lanka with Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera adjudged as The Unsung Hero at the Sri Lankan of the Year 2016 awards presentation heId last Friday night at the Hilton Hotel Colombo.
They both received their awards to a standing ovation.
The Sri Lankan cricket legend
Kumar Sangakkara the most polished and prudent of batsmen and also the ODI record breaking wicket keeper, is regarded as one of the best batsmen to ever play the game for Sri Lanka.
In a recent public poll set up by Australian cricket Board official site Cricket.com.au, beating Sachin Tendulkar and beside the whopping 1.25 Billion Indian population, the results clearly indicated that Sangakkara is the greatest ODI batsman of all time.
Named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2011 and 2015, Sanga along with A.B. de Villiers, has dominated the number one spot in the ICC Test batting rankings between 2005 and 2015.
This Sri Lankas highest ever ODI run scorer, is the second-highest run-scorer in ODI cricket and the fifth-highest run scorer in Test cricket.
He is the youngest and the first active international player to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture, which was widely praised by the cricketing community.
The unsung hero
It was the first time ever in this country that a person with a dis-Ability and confined to a wheelchair was befittingly recognised for his ability and appreciated for his outstanding achievements and significant voluntary contributions to the largest minority of Sri Lanka  people with restricted ability making near 20% of our population  the honour and recognition to the country.
The sports page of the Daily News of 13 September 2016, was the first to recognise the unsung hero of Sri Lankan Cricket and create the awareness of Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera.
In 2001, it was none other than the late Christopher Martin-Jenkins MBE, President of the MCC (2010-2011), cricket correspondent for Daily Telegraph (1990  1999) and The Times (1999-2008) who wrote to the print media about Perera.
Perera is determined and thorough whenever he has a cricketing project in hand that he might in those respects, at least, be termed a Sri Lankan Don Bradman. Of course he was not himself a famous player and fate only decreed that he would not be the famous umpire he was on the way to becoming, when meeting with a tragic accident on the eve of umpiring his first test match in Colombo.
Perera has won National recognition on 10 November 1992 as a Test-match-panel senior cricket umpire.
By profession he is a Chartered Analytical Chemist and a Fellow of several reputed world bodies.
In October 1985, Perera qualified at Lords Cricket Ground in England, to become the first professionally qualified cricket umpire of Sri Lanka.
He remains the only Sri Lankan to qualify professionally from England as a Cricket Umpire, Advanced Scorer, Training Instructor and an Examiner.
Daily Telegraph on 23rd November 2007 wrote: Perera has many achievements to his credit by reason of his personal adversity and has turned his misfortune into fortune for others.
He has become a writer, an author of two unique books on Cricket and the pioneer activist for accessible facilities at international cricket stadia here.
Wisden Cricketers Almanack, in its Millennium edition of 2000, selected Perera as one of only eight cricketing people to be recognised for his significant contributions to Cricket in these seven different fields.
Dr. Perera playing eight different roles over 17 consecutive years in a voluntary mission of national importance, is the pioneer disability rights activist promoting the enhancement of the quality of everyday life of persons of all abilities by design.
Perhaps what SLC failed to initiate, another source befittingly recognised and appreciated this unsung cricketing hero.
