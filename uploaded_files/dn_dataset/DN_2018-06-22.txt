The jumper rumpus
Justice and Prisons Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale has set the record straight. She has removed all ambiguities with regard to the imprisonment of Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera and the ongoing debate whether the controversial monk should be forced into the prison jumper while serving his term of imprisonment for the offence of threatening the wife of missing media personality Prageeth Ekneligoda in the premises of the Homagama Magistrate's Court.
Minister Athukorale, responding to the advice given to her by the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Sri Dhamma Sangha Sabhawa that the power to disrobe a monk lies with the Sangha Sabha, meaning that the Ven. Gnanasara should not be made to wear a prison jumper, has pointed out that this would go against the grain of the established law in the country. She also referred to the relevant Section of the law that makes it compulsory for the Commissioner General of Prisons to treat all prison inmates on par, including where the jumper is concerned. If, as the monks demand, Ven. Gnanasara be divested of the jumper, the government will stand accused of not applying the law equally. It will also be tantamount to inequal treatment of prison inmates, similar to VIP prisoners getting themselves admitted to the Merchant Ward after sentencing. There is also the likelihood of other prisoners like Potta Naufer, wanting to rid themselves of the jumper'. Why the jumper had become such a loathsome symbol to some remains a mystery. Sri Lanka's first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake, who is fondly known as the Father of the Nation, was put in a jumper by the colonial regime and quite recently Anoma Fonseka proudly showed the jumper worn by her war hero husband to journalists outside the Welikada Prison. Ven. Gnanasara Thera who is fond of displaying his bravery, we are sure, would himself not object being in such exalted company.
Groups of Buddhist monks held demonstrations protesting the incarceration of the Ven. Gnanasara. They were particularly offended by the Threa being made to wear the jumper that is worn by all prison inmates. The protesting monks were also of the firm view that that a member of the Sangha could only be punished by the Mahanayakas, while JHU Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka wants special counts to try monks outside the normal legal system. The latest to enter the fray is Ven. Prof. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera. Addressing the media at the Sunethradevi Pirivena in Pepiliyana on Tuesday, the Thera, while admitting that Bikkuhus who were found guilty of transgressing the law in the past were punished, claimed that they were however never forced remove their robes. President of the Bar Association U.R. De Silva, meanwhile, said that there were 15 other monks currently in prison and that they wore jumpers. What is more, there was no uproar as at present, concerning the Ven. Gnanasara Thera.
Any discerning person viewing the current issue surrounding the Gnanasara Thera, dispassionately, would not fail to spot the political overtones underpinning the whole affair. A similar selective concern was evident when so called war heroes, who fell foul of the law, were arrested and imprisoned whereas there was a deafening silence when the greatest war hero of them all, Sarath Fonseka, was dragged away and thrown in the slammer. The Ven. Gnanasara was tried under the laws of the land and there cannot be a separate law to deal with members of the Sangha. It is grossly unfair by clergy of other religions who had never asked for separate laws to deal with their members. The Anglican vicar Rev. Mathew Peiris wore the jumper while serving his prison term and what is more the Ven. Mapalagama Buddharakkitha Thera and Ven. Thlawduwe Somarama Thera were also in jumpers. There was no furore then. No Bikkhu, or a Sangha body asked for special courts to try them or that they be spared the jumper'. It was accepted that every individual was equal before the law - Buddhist clergy included.
Why this clamour only now, over a monk who is known to have flirted with former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, is all too obvious. The Joint Opposition has opened another flank to attack the government exploiting the majority sentiments vis-a-vis members of the Sangha. They have seized on the ideal candidate whose anti-minority outbursts appeal to the majority community. Some question as to why Ven. Gnanasara has been dealt with speedily under the law while others involved in much serious offenses are still at large. We are here not going to question the court procedures. Suffice it to say that the Homagama Magistrate had acted fearlessly, free from political pressure, in imposing the maximum sentence on the monk, knowing it was bound to cause a huge furore and hurt the government much.
Needless to say, the matter would have been dealt with differently under Mahinda Rajapaksas who is known to have openly interfered with the judiciary, and, what is more, pandered to majority sentiments. The likes of Ven. Gnanasara Thera, certainly, would have gone scot-free, to carry on with his antics, to the great detriment of Buddhism.

However the minister stressed that all the accreditation agencies must maintain a good rapport with all the business chambers, not with individual industries in the country in order to address loopholes and existing issues in the area of accreditation and certification and to ensure that Sri Lankan seal is treated with respect and preference by the international community.

Ban the Hopper..!
After my morning walk, I sit for an hour on my terrace garden, savoring my pot of delicious coffee.
All around me I hear the sounds of birds and squirrels, as the peepul tree towering over me provides a home to them and peace for me. As I sip away, different smells start drifting up to me; that of breakfasts being prepared by loving hands. Theres the aroma of hoppers, the whiff of an omelette, the crisp smell of a dosa, theres bacon and eggs rising somewhere, and all the pleasant odours drift up to me, and enhance the beautiful mood I am in. I feel a stillness.
And as I drift into this time of sheer tranquility, I wonder whether Ive ever heard one smell cry to another, Hey, youre intruding into my space!
Youre smelly please tone down!
Stop crackling while youre frying! You stink. Youre too noisy!
No, all these different smells from different kitchens, go through their many chimneys, then joining together in friendly harmony float to the sky as one perfumed fragrance of love!
But then come people; leaders who feel some particular smells are not needed: They look at loving hands that make the dosa, fry the omelette or place the hoppers in the plate, then scowl as in another kitchen a different smell, tells of another breakfast being made
Hey! say the different aromas sadly as they drift up into the sky the next day, One of us is missing
Hes been banned! says the dosa and the others drift up in silence.
Time goes by and same leaders ban one or the other till only two remain. Slowly all the chimneys start giving out the same smell, as loving hands make the same food, till one day, the same aromas drifting up from different kitchens see something amiss, Looks like two chimneys have no smells coming from them
Theyve been banned! say the others sadly.
Why
Because they used an inferior oil!
And the next day only one smell remains, the other banned as it came from food cooked by hands of a different faith. But even that one smell remaining shivers, as it sees same leaders coming with a ban notice, and then it sadly sings:
First they banned Beef And I did not speak out Because I was not Beef,Then they came for the Omelettes And I did not speak out Because I was not an Omelette.Then they banned the Dosa And I did not speak out Because I was not a DosaThen they came for the Hoppers And I did not speak out Because I was not an Hopper,Now theyre coming for me And there is no one left to speak out for me!
There are no birds, no squirrels, nothing but the stench of fear from the chimneys..!

Boeing lands $6.6b FedEx deal  as freight demand grows
Boeing Co landed a deal for 24 cargo aircraft from FedEx Corp worth $6.6 billion as the revival in the air freight market continues to grow.
The package-hauler plans to add 12 of Boeings medium-size 767 freighters and 12 of the larger 777 cargo aircraft to its order book, the Chicago-based plane maker said in a statement Tuesday. FedEx is already the largest customer for both aircraft models.
Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx has been using new aircraft orders to replace ageing freighters, such as its three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, to improve fuel efficiency and reliability without adding much capacity to its air cargo fleet, said Chief Operating Officer David Bronczek on a conference call with analysts. That may change as demand for air freight begins to grow, he said.
Weve added very few incremental planes along the years here, he said. On the other hand, if we continue to see strong growth like were seeing now we could use them to add capacity.
After languishing for much of the decade, global air shipments rebounded strongly last year, spurred by online shoppers and strong trade. The trend has provided new lift to Boeings wide-body jet line-up, where freighter models include the 767 and jumbo 747 jetliner.
Boeing last month announced plans to bump up annual output of the 767 by 20 per cent to 36 planes by 2020. The ageing jetliner is gaining new popularity as a mid-size freighter favoured by the likes of Amazon.com Inc and FedEx. That would be the third increase in the monthly production rate since early 2016 for a jetliner best known for opening transcontinental travel to twin-engine jets in the 1980s.
The freighter variant is the oldest model in Boeings current product line-up, dating to a 1993 order by United Parcel Service Inc. for 60 of the cargo jets. The first 767 freighter was delivered in October 1995.
The deal for the new aircraft will be added to Boeings orders and deliveries website once certain contingencies have been met, Boeing said. FedEx already is awaiting deliveries of 53 of the 767 freighters and 6 of Boeings 777 cargo planes. The planes are headed to FedEx Express, the companys main package delivery business, which flies freight planes all over the world. (Gulf News Aviation)

BOI Enterprise Jiffy Products celebrates 15 years
Jiffy Sri Lanka Manufacturing Plant in Kobeigane, Kurunegala celebrated 15 years of operations in Sri Lanka.
Ruwan Rajapakse, Managing Director of Jiffy Sri Lanka stated in 2003 Sri Lanka faced many problems and had a poor international image but a few brave men in Norway had the confidence to start business in Sri Lanka and thier company was one.
He added that over 10,000 jobs now depend on Jiffy both directly and indirectly. In addition the company contributes approximately Rs. 1.5 billion to the province.
The Chairman of Jiffy, Bjorn Hendrik Rasmussen said that Jiffy started operations in Sri Lanka with just 14 employees and currently has 200 permanent employees and another 800 temporary employees at the three facilities that the company has set up in Sri Lanka.
Jiffy Horticulture Products are exported to over 40 destinations worldwide. Among the products made by Jiffy in Sri Lanka are Jiffy - 7C pellets made of 100% Coco pith that are used for the propagation of bananas, papaya, grapes, roses, strawberry and Forestry.
Another product is the Jiffy Grow Block also used to grow Crops, which is enclosed in a degradable netting.
The Jiffy Grow Bag uses Coco pith and husk chips for a broad range of crops such as tomato, pepper, cucumber and roses.
These products are now well known to all those interested in Horticulture. The focus of the Company is now on developing the highest quality human capital. It was the high quality of Sri Lankas human capital that led to the company becoming a world leader and the Jiffy brand is now known worldwide.
Rasmussen stated that the Mother company is highly interested with the work done at Jiffy Sri Lanka and currently new products are being developed in Sri Lanka for the global market.
The next speaker at the event was Dagfinn Andersen CEO of Jiffy Group, who spoke about the companys marketing strategy. Andersen stated that the company had invested in Sri Lanka because he discovered that coir could be added for the manufacture of their products.
Jiffy pellets first went to the Dutch market which was the most demanding in the world and currently millions of these pellets are being sold to the Netherlands.
Grow bags made in Sri Lanka are sold to Canada which is also a very demanding market where the highest standards have to be met. Another major customer of Jiffy is B & Q of the United Kingdom.
Thorleif Hals Board Member of Jiffy is to soon assume duties as the new CEO international of the Jiffy Group.
He said that in the world of Horticulture, Jiffy was as well -known a brand as Coca Cola is to soft drinks.
The Norwegian ambassador Thorbjour Gaustadsaether said: Jiffy was a very important project because it has succeeded in creating jobs in rural areas of Sri Lanka outside Colombo which has benefited from much of the investment opportunities.
Jiffy has the highest confidence in its Sri Lanka operation. Success has been achieved as a result of hard work and commitment. These investments reflect the confidence that Norwegian companies have in Sri Lanka and I am positive that more Norwegian companies are expected in future to invest in the country.
The Chief Guest of this event Dharmasiri Dassanayake Chief Minister of the North Western province said that two decades ago coir dust was a major environmental problem. By making pellets out of them has not only has led to a productive use of coir dust but also resulted in protecting the environment in the country.

Brandix supports Green  Building Council  Go Green campaign
An environment awareness campaign that culminated with an island-wide tree planting initiative and a Green Walk in Colombo, was successfully carried out by the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka (GBCSL) with support from Brandix, an inspirational practitioner and advocate of eco-friendly manufacturing.
Themed Go Green  Change tomorrow, today, the campaign was conceptualised to celebrate World Environment Day 2018.
The Green Walk that encouraged raising voices for a better environment attracted over 3,000 participants and Mayor of Colombo, Rosy Senanayake. The walk began at Independence Square and concluded at the Vihara Maha Devi Parks open-air stadium.The tree planting campaign to plant fifteendifferent species across all 25 districts of the island is also currently underway.
The Councils campaign was targeted at the general public, green business-related organisations and sustainability adopted products and service suppliers. It was organised to create enhanced awareness on the importance of environment protection and to enlighten participants on practical solutions such as savings through green building practices, conservation of the environment, and driving sustainable development to control the harmful effects of climate change and other environmental degradations.
The Green Building Council of Sri Lanka is a consensus-based not-for-profit organisation committed to developing a sustainable property industry for Sri Lanka by encouraging the adoption of green building practices. It is diverse and possesses an integrated representation from all sectors of the property industry and academia.
A spokesperson for Brandix said the Groups support for this program was in line with its own sustainability agenda and an expression of appreciation for the efforts of the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka. Brandix built the worlds first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum-rated apparel factory under the Green Building Rating System of the US Green Building Council (USGBC) and has since obtained LEED certification for its facilities in Seeduwa, Koggala and Ratmalana.
One of the latest examples of the Groups efforts to reduce its carbon footprint is a 1.65 MW solar power plant at the Brandix Essentials factory in Batticaloa, which notably is the largest rooftop solar plant in Sri Lanka.
The Brandix Groups sustainability road maphas required the development of its own Eco Index -- an assessment tool which is used to measure the environmental performance of Brandix factories and offices across the Group. The Index computes percentage reductions in key environmental indicators for Air, Water and Earth as measures are rolled out across Group factories to minimiseCO2 emissions, energy and water consumption and solid waste disposal. The Group has set itself the target of becoming 100% carbon neutral by 2020.

Cancer Society holds awareness programme
The 'World No Tobacco Day' which fell recently was commemorated by the Sri Lanka Cancer Society (SLCS) with the participation of schoolchildren of Sri Parakramabahu Maha Vidyalaya, Narahenpita, Colombo.
The objective of conducting the programme was to create awareness of schoolchildren about the importance of rejecting all kinds of tobacco products, including cigarettes and also about the risk factors involved in smoking.
The SLCS Public Education Committee has also decided to conduct cancer awareness programmes in rural and urban area educational institutions to cater to schoolchildren and school leavers.
SLCS, Public Education Committee chairperson Indrani Nanayakkara said the SLCS will focus on educating young children since children are the most vulnerable sector in society.
She said not only tobacco but betel and alcohol too lead to cancer.
She said 85 per cent of lung cancers are due to the length of time a person smokes and lung and oral cancer are the most preventable cancer if one gives up smoking.
SLCS Public Education Committee officer D.W.S. Jayaratne quoting National Cancer Institute statistics said a large number died of cancer last year and the majority of them were tobacco smokers.
He said cancer in Sri Lanka is steadily on the rise and recent statistics reveal that a large number of Sri Lankans died of oral, oesophagal, stomach, cervical and breast cancer every year,".

If youre bringing your dog outside youll want to consider a repellant. If you take your dog in the woods and to the lake and you will occasionally have to pull ticks off him. Make sure to check him after a trip in the woods.
Puppies Eat Anything
Always keep in mind your pup will put just about anything in its mouth. Youll want to make sure theres nothing dangerous in reach. These include things like things that will break apart or trash.
Teeth
Taking care of your dogs teeth is something that often gets neglected, but its very important to keep their chompers in tip-top shape. Like humans, they can develop tartar and plaque buildup and gingivitis.
When caring for your dogs teeth, the earlier you start, the better. The younger your dog is, the more comfortable theyll become with the process, and of course it starts them on a healthy path early on. Another easy way to take care of your pups teeth is by giving them a dental chew.
Grooming
Each breed of dog requires a different amount of grooming. This could be bringing it to get a haircut at the pet store, some occasional brushing, or just giving some baths. When giving your dog a bath youll want to get the water to a safe temp and use some pet specific shampoo. You can use treats to make the experience better. Also make sure to get all the soap out or it can get itchy.
Nails
Youll want to keep your pups nails from getting too long. This is something you can do yourself, or you can have it done for you at any place that does grooming, such as a pet store.
Extreme Temperatures
You want to make sure your puppy is safe in extreme temps. In the cold make sure theyre not out too long unless theyre a breed that can handle it. Roads are often salted against ice, so make sure to wipe their paws down after a walk. In the heat youll also want to watch how long theyve been out and how theyre panting. Get them cooled down as needed and make sure theyve always got water available.

Compensation to Ex-LTTE combatants, an LLRC recommendation - Mujibur
United National Party (UNP) Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman yesterday said that the much debated Cabinet Paper submitted by Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D.M. Swaminathan seeking to grant compensation to war affected persons including ex-LTTE combatants consists of some of the recommendations of the Lesson Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He was responding to a statement by National Freedom Font Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa on this Cabinet and asking people to stop paying taxes to the government, if it continues with its move to pay compensation to ex-LTTE combatants.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Rahuman said that Weerawansa is attempting to incite racism by making false statements.
As a person who survives in the field of politics by arousing racist feelings, he (Weerawansa) never raises his voice to strengthen religious harmony, national unity and reconciliation.
MP Rahuman further said that the ex-LTTE combatants are also citizens of this country. So they have a right to lead normal lives without any restriction or monitoring after completing the rehabilitation process.

COPA scrutinised 125 institutions in two years - Chairman
The people should not misinterpret that financial management and the performance of public institutions is poor under this government based on revelations through the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) reports.
COPA Chairman and Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the flaws of public institutions under previous governments had been investigated flippantly and not in a very professional manner.
He said that only 400 institutions had been brought before the COPA from 1978 to 2015. In the last two years 125 institutions have been probed since then."Nearly one third of the COPA workload of 37 years under different governments had been done by the COPA during the last two and half years, Minister Alagiyawanna said.
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Committee Room number 6 in Parliament complex.
Alagiyawanna said the service accomplished by the COPA since 1978 is so poor due to practical reasons. He added that there were only 26 members in the COPA whereas there are 837 public institutions including 51 Ministries, 92 departments, 19 Government Special Spending Units, 25 district secretariats, 9 Provincial Council Funds, 45 Provincial Ministries, 215 Provincial Councial Special Spending Units and Departments, 46 Provincial Council Authorities, 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas to be assessed annually.
However from 1978 to 1988 only 108 public institutions had been scrutinised while from 1983 to 1993, 50 institutions had been scrutinised, Minister Alagiyawanna said. "Only one public institution had been scrutinised during the ten years from 1994 to 2004 and from 2004 to 2010 one another public institution had been scrutinised."
He said finding fault in public institutions based on the COPA reports is irrational.
However, since 2015, the COPA sought for a mechanism to face the challenge of bringing the public institutions before the COPA. Finally a questionnaire was proposed to be forwarded to all institutions.
The answers would be assessed by the Auditor General by visiting the respective institutions and later presented under a report to Parliament. This mechanism was implemented after the government came to power. Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna said.
It was successful. But just by doing these assessments no justice is met by the people in the country. So we think is that if we can prevent the recurrence of these flaws, was an achievement.
He added that the report prepared on a questionnaire was earlier tabled in Parliament. He said that due to this assessment, there seems a great improvement. In 2015, there were 104 public institutions that obtained less than 50 marks while it dropped to 50 percent in 2016. He added that there were only 282 institutions that obtained marks between 80 and 90 in 2016 and same increased to 447. He also added that the institutions that earned above 90 marks were 60 in number in 2016 and it increased to 73 the next year.
Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna further said that due to the new measures taken by the government, even the public could make complaints to COPA by browsing the www.parliament.lk website.
COPA member JVP Parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti also spoke.

Dogs much smarter than cats!
Dogs are significantly brainier than cats, according to a new study.
While cats have around 250 million cortical neurons  brain cells linked with intelligence  dogs have some 530 million.
Cortical neurons are involved with thinking, planning and other complex behaviours associated with intelligence.
How many neurons you have in your cerebral cortex, I believe, is a major determinant of your biological capabilities, said Vanderbilt University neuroscientist Dr Suzana Herculano-Houzel, one of the studys co-authors.
Dr Herculano-Houzel developed the method for accurately measuring the number of neurons in brains.
Im 100 per cent a dog person, admitted Dr Herculano-Houzel.
That bias aside, she said these findings suggested dogs had the capacity to do much more complex and flexible things with their lives than cats can.
In a Royal Society journal article published last year, neuroscientists Professor Ursula Dicke and Professor Gerhard Roth stated that the number of cortical neurons comes to mind quite naturally when searching for a neurobiological basis of intelligence.
At the least, we now have some biology that people can factor into their discussions about whats smarter, cats or dogs, said Dr Herculano-Houzel.
Besides cats and dogs, Dr Herculano-Houzel and her collaborators also measured the brains of hyenas, lions, bears, mongooses and raccoons.
Hunting requires more intelligence than grazing, so the scientists assumed they would find far higher numbers of cortical neurons compared to brain size in meat-eating mammals than found in their prey.
In fact, it turns out the cortical neuron-to-brain ratio was low in larger mammals like bears. This is the same relationship between number of cortical neurons and size as is found in plant-eating mammals.
A bears brain is 10 times the size of a cats, but it has about the same number of neurons.
Brains require a lot of energy, and though meat provides plenty of that, the scientists concluded carnivores must strike a balance between investment in brains packed with cortical neurons and overall size.
Meat eating is largely considered a problem-solver in terms of energy, but, in retrospect, it is clear that carnivory must impose a delicate balance between how much brain and body a species can afford, said Herculano
-Houzel.

Duminda Silva, gang were members of an unlawful assembly - AG
The Attorney General yesterday informed Supreme Court that Duminda Silva along with other accused had committed a series attacks being members of an unlawful assembly carrying firearms prior to the main shooting incident.
The appeals filed by five accused including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court were yesterday taken up for hearing before Supreme Court five-judge-bench.
DSG Mudalige informed court that the evidence given by several witnesses including two STF officers have confirmed that a group of people including eleventh accused Duminda Silva began to assault several women who were near the Rahula Vidyalaya polling booth in the Kotikawatta area.
Evidence had suggested that Duminda Silva along with his security detail had arrived at the polling booth inquiring from women including the wife of Prasanna Solangaarachchi to whom they had voted for.
Witness Damith Suranga had told court that Duminda Silva came in a jeep with several other vehicles carrying T56 weapons being displayed from inside the vehicles, the DSG said.
He said this incident was a conflict between inter-party activists Prasanna Solangaarachchi and Sumudu Rukshan during the local government election held in October 2011. "Duminda Silva has given his support for Sumudu Rukshan. Bharatha Premachandra had given his support for Solangaarachchi's election campaign.
The enmity prevailed for a long period of time between two factions caused violence to escalate," the DSG added.
Supreme Court five-judge-bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.
Five accused including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva who were sentenced to death by Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra had filed appeal petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the Colombo High Court judgment.
Duminda Silva, the eleventh accused in the murder case had filed an acceleration petition in the Supreme Court requesting that the hearing on the appeal be accelerated on medical grounds.
Through his appeal, Duminda Silva stated that he was seeking the jurisdiction of Supreme Court to review and set aside their conviction and the death sentence imposed by High Court on September 8, 2015.
Five accused including former MP Duminda Silva were sentenced to death on September 8, 2015 by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011. However, the verdict was divided two to one with judges Padmini N.Ranawaka and M.C.B.S. Morais finding five accused guilty for 10 charges including committing and conspiring to commit murder of four people while Justice Shiran Gunaratne the President of Colombo High Court Trial-at-Bar found the thirteen accused not guilty of all seventeen charges.

FFSL to launch series of international matches
The Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) is launching a series of international matches from July onwards as part of their long term strategy to bring back international games on home soil, an FFSL official announced at a press conference held at their headquarters.
Jaswar Umar, General Secretary of FFSL said that the Federation has now established a commercial department directly under his supervision with the support of AFC.
The new department has now finalized its long term strategy that looks very existing than ever before and the international match campaign begins in a colorful style with two games from a Europe team Lithuania on the 8 and 11 July at the Race Course, said Umar.
The FFSL has very professionally planned these international games to mix both international commitments and to bring back football as a strong brand for commercial exploitation. Fans and other stakeholders will see very different experience and engagements before Match Day, on Match Day and after Match Day, he said.
The president of FFSL Anura de Silva also shared views about the new progress and said, We requested AFC president Salman Bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa that FFSL needs more practice international matches and the AFC have agreed and come forward to support us. This year we will play practice matches against Korea, Japan and Maldives. Our main concern is the South Asian Football Championships and we are towards it.
The AFC president is driving his ambitious vision of One Asia, One Goal by supporting countries that require extra support from AFC.
They have already approved several special projects such as Mini-Pitch, Presidents Development Initiatives Projects and Capacity Building projects for Sri Lanka. The artificial turf that was funded by FIFA shall be used for the Sri Lanka National teams preparation for International games. Complying with international standards, this turf provides an opportunity to train national teams for any weather conditions, said De Silva.
This is part of our football vision 2030 and there are many similar development programs scheduled to take place in the near future for the development of our countrys football right throughout the country, General Secretary of FFSL Umar said. - KR

Former Sri Lankan legend  to lead MCC in tri-series
The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is scheduled to play a T20 triangular tournament next month involving Nepal and Netherlands. The event will be held on July 29, Sunday at the iconic Lords Cricket Ground also known as the Mecca of Cricket.
Meanwhile, Mahela Jayawardene, the former Sri Lankan cricketer, was recently announced as the skipper of the MCC team.
MCC will cross swords with the two associate nations before the pair lock horns in the last of the three T20s on the day. Jayawardene was a fulcrum of the Lankans in all three formats during his playing days. The veteran had played 149 Tests, 448 Tests and 55 T20Is in which he has managed 11814, 12650 and 1493 runs respectively.
The retired cricketer also has an exotic relation with the Home of Cricket. He played 4 Test matches in the country from 2002 to 2014 respectively. He scored 448 runs at an average of 64.
Most importantly, he had the privilege of featuring on the Honours Board in the visitors dressing room at the historic venue. In 2002 and 2006, he racked up a couple of centuries.
The 41-year old has 54 international tons in his kitty as well. His highest Test score of 374 came against South Africa back in 2006 at the SSC Colombo. He has also been a grand success for the team in the limited overs format. He scored a magnificent century in the final of the 2011 World Cup in India.
He creamed the Indian bowlers to help his side compile the competitive total for the home team to chase.
The cricketer retired from all forms of cricket after playing the Cricket World Cup in Down Under back in 2015. His last match was against South Africa in the quarterfinal of the mega event at the Sydney Cricket Ground.  cricktracker

France battle into World Cup last 16
Yekaterinburg, Thursday: Teenager Kylian Mbappe became France's youngest World Cup goalscorer as they beat Peru 1-0 on Thursday to reach the last 16 and condemn the South Americans to an early exit.
France, one of the pre-tournament favourites, join Uruguay and hosts Russia in the knockout rounds with one group game to go.
Paris Saint-Germain forward Mbappe -- aged 19 years and 183 days -- underlined his rich talent and claimed his place in the French record books when he poked home in the first half.
Didier Deschamps' side face Denmark on Tuesday with top spot in Group C up for grabs but progression to the next stage assured.
In contrast, Peru face Australia with their fate sealed and just pride to play for in front of their passionate and large following that has decamped to Russia. Some Peru fans were in tears even before kick-off -- a generation of Peruvians have never known their country in the World Cup before.
The South Americans' last appearance was in 1982 and they made this like a home game, ensuring their red and white dominated the Yekaterinburg Arena.
That included the two enormous temporary stands that stretch high above both ends, exposed to the elements, where Peru fans bobbed and bounced to keep warm.
Paul Pogba, the Manchester United midfielder who a few days ago called himself "the most criticised player in the world", flashed a drive wide and defender Raphael Varane did likewise from a header. With 15 minutes gone, Pogba and France began to impose themselves.
Antoine Griezmann drove straight at goalkeeper Pedro Gallese after Olivier Giroud -- starting in place of Ousmane Dembele -- set up the Atletico Madrid forward.
Deschamps had clearly told his side, disappointing in beating Australia 2-1 in their opener, to go long and use Giroud's physicality.
Peru's best outlet in the first half was rampaging full-back Luis Advincula, who had the beating of defender Lucas Hernandez down France's left flank. Peru, unfortunate to lose 1-0 to Denmark in their first game, took until the half-hour to have their first serious chance, with recalled skipper Paolo Guerrero stinging the legs of Hugo Lloris. France captain Lloris, making his 100th appearance for his country, was a bystander for long periods. On 34 minutes France went in front. Pogba cleverly played in Giroud, his shot took a deflection and looped over Gallese, allowing Mbappe to stab into an open net.
New-found confidence ran through the French and Hernandez should have made it 2-0 just before the break.
As in the first half, Peru made the better start to the second and midfielder Pedro Aquino arrowed a long-distance rocket onto Lloris's upright.
But for all their possession, Peru -- in their distinctive white kit with red sash -- caused the French defence few problems. Barcelona centre-back Samuel Umtiti was imperious alongside Real Madrid's Varane. AFP

Geoffrey Aloysius noticed to appear in courts
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Chairman Geoffrey Aloysius was yesterday noticed to appear before the Colombo Fort Magistrate on July 5 to inquire as to why he did not comply with a Court Order.
On a previous occasion, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had issued an order directing Geoffrey Aloysius that a report pertaining to the direct and indirect assets belonging to PTL be provided for ongoing investigations.
The Court was informed through Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara that PTL Chairman has failed to comply with this order and sought a suitable order in this regard.
Meanwhile, the court was informed that the Inland Revenue Department is yet to finalise the reports pertaining to the assets and liability statements regarding PTL.
Mrs. Jayasundara said a statement given by a witness by the name of Amal Ravindranath has confirmed the fact that a State Minister had received Rs.3 million from W.M.Mendis and Company. She further said the prosecution was conducting a complex investigation where the PTL had exchanged over 10,000 cheques among various third parties.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till July 5 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
Defence Counsel Anil de Silva PC, Kalinga Indatissa PC appearing for the suspects informed court that they are expecting to file a fresh bail application on the next hearing date. Defence Counsel further said their clients were ready provide details pertaining to their assets and liabilities. The Magistrate ordered the suspects provide their assets and liability reports without any delay.
The Attorney Generals Department had informed Court that CID is in the process of initiating necessary legal action for the extradition of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Anil Silva PC, and Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.

Some of the worlds top food brands have been created, due to a formula or a recipe of creating another product going wrong. One such mistaken formula is that went to create the world most consumed beverage, Coca Cola.
Back at Sri Lanka in the late 1950 a family in Moratuwa was entertaining some relatives at a birthday party and the desert that was prepared went wrong but the sweetness in it was admired.
The host of the party, P. Christie Perera who was working at Colombo Agencies one of the biggest importers was later suspended pending inquiry for an offence he did not commit recalled current Chairman/Managing Director Sunil Quintus Perera, reminiscing the birth of a game changer in the Sri Lanka confectionery industry.
Idling at home he thought about dinner and a sweet desert and talked to his wife, Mabel and changed a recipe which she had in possession and made a sweet. Then he packed it and sold it to some of the shops in Moratuwa. The product caught on and shop owners wanted more.
He then began to make the sweet in a more organized and large scale manner and branded it as Glucorasa jujubes which was later, Sri Lankas highest selling sweet for several decades.
After a few months Colombo Agencies called him and said that the inquiry against him was completed and he was found innocent and wanted him to come back. Sensing that there was a better opportunity in the Glucorasa business he declined the offer.
However the Colombo Agencies management felt guilty and then offered him long credit for some of the raw material that had to be imported to make this sweet.
With the business growing he decided to name the sweet as Glucorasa. The others in the family also helped and in two years time the first Sales Manager F. P. Perera, (known as Anton) who is the brother of Christie, was appointed. The first major investment was a lorry which was bought for Norbert at Rs. 750 for the distribution of Glucorasa.
Growing in confidence they decided to introduce more brands and then jellies chewing gum, peppermints, toffees and wafers were introduced and these products too became instant hits and earned the market leader position in all their products.
The Company which was named as Uswatte Confectionery Works and moved to Galle Road Rawatawatte was consolidating its position in the market and some of the products were exported as well. The employee strength increased to 300.
However with the closed economy followed by the insurrection in 1971 their business suffered a major setback with the distribution network being restricted and also raw material imports including liquid glucose curtailed.
In this backdrop the company was faced with major financial constraints and by 1977 Uswatte Confectionery Works employee strength narrowed to less than 10 and production too came down.
With the introduction of the open economy the company breathed a sigh of relief and by 1980 we introduced new products, Tipi Tip and wafers to the Sri Lankan market.
We managed to turn around and was sailing smoothly until 1998 when tragically, my father, Christy Perera, expired and the second generation taking over the management.
This resulted in several issues surfacing with several administrators trying to run the business without much experience and vision. To add to this there was another youth uprising during years 1988-1989 which also had a major negative impact to us. In 2001, when I saw that the Company was noose diving. The banks were asking us to sell the land and settle their dues while the Department of Inland Revenue also closed down our import accounts because everything was in arrears.
I told the other directors that things cannot go on like this and someone has to direct it. They knew that I was capable of turning the company around and they appointed me the Chief Executive Officer.
The first thing I did was to service the loans and reduce liabilities and then things started moving smoothly. However the other directors once again started to get involved and to overcome this in 2007 I decided to buy the shares and there were many sellers.
I had 34% shares but since I didnt have the controlling share I sweet talked with the Indian shareholder who was having 22% shares and bought it in 2010 to have control in Uswatte.
At the time of my taking over the business as CEO the business was at a very low key with the turnover for a month as low as Rs. four million which was not sufficient even to pay the salaries of the staff and other overheads. I sold some of my land and reinvested that money into the business. I went to the banks, suppliers and the Department of Inland Revenue and asked for time to settle all the dues and having trust in me gave me time to settle all the dues which I did honoring my promise.
I also built up the sales to about Rs. 40 million by 2012 and the secret for this is that I stopped all credit payments and adopted several other prudent financial measures. I called all the distributors and told them our financial situation and they agreed to by our products for spot cash.
I also decided that the venue in Ratmalana factory was not suitable to have the factory as my fathers house was behind it and people were constantly going in and in and in 2012 I purchased this 10-acre land where Uswatte Confectionery Works is currently situated in Bandaragama. I had to start from scratch and build up this gradually and completed the whole set-up in three years converting a bare jungle into a factory complex by building from brick to brick by investing every rupee saved to stay afloat amidst tight financial constraints.
This new ultra-modern factory and office complex of Uswatte Confectionery Works (Pvt) Limited, built at a cost of Rs. 200 million, will be opened by President Maithripala Sirisena at Millaniya in Bandaragama. Being able to build this state-of-the-art complex on our own land within three years was a dream come true.With the business back in to its glory we introduced several new products and also started exports to many countries. Today the company also provide employment to over 550.
Perera, who was also the President of the Lanka Confectionery Manufacturers Association (LCMA), noted that the local confectionery standard is very high but imports keep coming. We have also urged the government to look into this issue by providing some concessions for local manufacturers by way of concession for the import of raw materials
He also introduced his family members to the business and Director of the company Shanura Perera, who underwent training to become a pilot and later joined his fathers company. His daughter Suhanya M. Perera Ockersz also joined the company to handle the accounting sector.
Growing in confidence we are now taking another major step by opening the second factory at Bandaragama to manufacture biscuits investing Rs. 400 million.
Today, we can be happy and proud of this great victory which was the result of all our hard work, dedication and commitment, he said.

Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, MP Seneviratne said the group of 16 MPs held two successful meetings in Matara and Matale and based on the public response, they decided to support the JO.
Accordingly, we have decided to support the JO in Parliament as well as all its future political deliberations. Our aim is to change the present government and begin an anti- UNP drive," he added.
SLFP MP and former Minister Dilan Perera said that movement of the 16 MPs has the support of many professionals, intellectuals and academics. We hope to mobilize people from all sectors and get their support to form an anti- UNP force. We expect their support at upcoming elections, he added.
The US which co-sponsored the resolution against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has now withdrawn from it. In this backdrop, the government must decide whether it should carry on some of the Geneva agreements.
During many previous occasions, we have seen Opposition members formed as groups joining the government to get posts. But, we are the only group which gave up ministerial posts by joining hands against the government," he said.

Mind your step, someones spilled breakfast all over Gloucester Road.
No, not a croissant or cereal bar. Its eggs, and theyre in every form you can imagine them in. Oh, and theyre not real.
If you alighted at or passed the station on your commute this morning, you mightve noticed the massive new art installation. You can see large fried eggs, cut boiled eggs, and eggs still in their shells splattered all over the 80m platform at the London station.
It is the work of British artist Heather Phillipson who posed against her new work My Name is Lettie Eggyscrub, which is a part of a major commission for Art on the Underground. The 3D art was commended by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who said the bold work, the biggest public art gallery, was in a bid to support female artists.
Many commuters travelling on the District and Circle line were wowed by the huge installation and posed next to it.
One Tweeted the art, saying: Someone was clearly in a rush to get on that tube at Gloucester Road  spilled breakfast all over the platform. TfL also got involved, replying to the tweet saying: You cant make good art without cracking a few eggs. Have a good day.

Investment proposal for Htota Industrial Zone under review
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that 15 investment proposals for the Hambantota Industrial Zone relating to the Hambantota port are being reviewed at the moment.
These industries in the field of manufacturing, packaging, assembling etc. will be set up at the industrial zone .
According to him, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) is receiving a significant number of more enquiries from local and foreign investors on land in relation to the investment proposals. These proposals will also be reviewed in due course and selected ones will be allowed to commence operations on lands provided by the SLPA.
The Minister was addressing the media at the Ports and Shipping Ministry yesterday.
Meanwhile, China Merchant Port Holdings Limited (CM Port) released the final tranche of US$ 584 million for the Hambantota Port, completing the US$ 976 million investment. This marks the single highest ever Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) received by Sri Lanka to date.
With the receipt of this amount the level of the countrys foreign exchange has gone up and this situation will result in the stabilization of Rupee , the Minister said.
It is expected to receive more foreign investments in future with the Rupee stabilizing . Besides, investors will be encouraged he said.
Minister Samarasinghe added that countrys Credit Rating is being evaluated by currently by an international rating company. The country will receive a better rate in this regard as a result of the Hambantota transaction.
When the Minister was questioned whether the CM Port has asked the SLPA for the man-made island situated closed to Hambantota port for entertainment activities as per media reports, he flatly rejected such reports and said that the island cannot be used for entertainment activities except port related activities as per the conditions and regulations of the MOU signed between the SLPA and the CM Port.
The Minister added that the CM Port has suggested to the SLPA that the third phase of the Hambantota port will be started within the next three year period. The CM Port has expressed its willingness to invest US 300 to 600 million for the third phase.
The revenue of the SLPA has gone up by 5 per cent in the first quarter this year compared with the same quarter in 2017.Total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was 10 billion and it was 11 billion in the first quarter of 2018.
Meanwhile, the total expenditure has come down by 6 per cent compared to last year. Asked what the reason for this was the Minister said that it is the result of better management.
As a result of responsible management and overall prudent management the SLPA could make a profit while cutting down expenditure he added.

The irresistible berry
Juliet Coombe goes in search of the fruit of love on a bumpy tractor ride in the Ambewela region, which takes you on a fascinating tour covering growing strawberries from seeds to saplings under cover and finally a strawberry treat at the farm shop at the end.
Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God never did," wrote Dr William Butler in the 1600s. The strawberry is perhaps the most popular sweet fruit on the planet and it is hardly surprising with such an amazing story and taste.
They have of course grown wild for millennia and can be read about in the poetry of ancient Romans such as Ovid and Virgil. Although, the commercial varieties we have today are a cross between the Chilean large fruited variety of the Mapuche and Huilliche Indians and the European varieties, it was the English who really moved the breeding program forward, which is very apt as the strawberry is actually part of the rose family and 20 tons of them are consumed each year at the home of tennis Wimbledon along with 7,000 litres of cream. However, the French can lay claim to breeding the first line of the modern variety as well as being the first to move the wild strawberry from the forest to the garden.
Besides being very tasty, very red and heart-shaped, and therefore seen as the fruit of Venus or Love, it has been used in countless different ways and subject to as many folk tales. The strawberry, so named because of the straw-like runner shoots it sends out horizontally, is a great source of vitamin C, antioxidants, potassium, fibre and folate; as well as being wonderful to bathe in  ask Madame Tullien from Napoleons court; or even to write with as did the 15th century European monks. The Romans used them to cure pretty much anything, including melancholy, fainting, all inflammations, fevers, throat infections, kidney stones, halitosis, attacks of gout, and diseases of the blood, liver and spleen  no wonder they were symbols of purity, healing and passion. They were not all good, though, as Anne Boleyn of Henry V111 s court in England discovered, when a strawberry shaped birthmark was ominously found on her neck, making her the butt of witch conspiracies, or with the fate of Shakespeares Desdemona, whose Othello had them on his hanky. Some even believe that if you halve a strawberry with someone of the opposite sex you will fall in love with each other  and indeed it does put everyone in a good mood after eating a bowl of them.
Not a great deal is known about Sri Lankas history with the strawberry but Jagro strawberry farm and Ramya Horticulture are definitely worth a visit where they can tell you more about their beginnings and the two varieties they grow: the Tamar, which comes from Israel and is characterised by good taste, shape and size and has a long productive season; and the Festival, an attractive, tasty, easy to harvest, low waste, slow perishing variety, which comes from Florida and is named after their regular event, the Strawberry Festival. The strawberries are clearly delicious as they export increasing amounts to UAE and the Maldives. Also, dont miss going to Adma Agro for your Strawberry treats where they are in all the menu choices, but only after a tractor experience into Strawberry and vegetable farm in the Ambewela region. After buying strawberry jam, trying a milk shake and buying a pile of them, head off to Jetwing Warwick Gardens for a rice and curry Sri Lankan lunch. Here you can enjoy a menu also picked fresh from the estates farm or treat yourself and spend a weekend staying in this gorgeous stone built bungalow and learn the art of organic farming and have a go at making coffee and for something really interesting hand making of local tea.
White, green, BOP and OP teas are great, but if you really want the true Sri Lankan village experience then talk to Meena about Wangedi Pekoe tea, which brings a sparkle to the line house people as they explain how to do it. Through the mountain mists you will find women pounding the mortar with a kittle pestle using natural sun withered tea leaves, which the true tea picker turned into gold dust tea during the British era. To make Meenas tea, you pluck 5 kgs to make one kg, which will sustain a family for three weeks. The leaves are roasted in a pan over boiling water before sun-drying, an hour after which tea can be served. Before she became a hospitality guru with a line home stay experience Meena D S Meenamnal used to be a full time tea-plucker. She tells the local women do not add sugar as this makes them thirsty, nor do they add milk as it is very expensive and something they reserve for the children and babies. The women drink tea to give them stamina, and energy to get through the demanding lifestyle of living in the hills.
Nothing beats enjoying the views drinking a lovely cup of this handmade hill country tea on the Jetwing Warwick Gardens lawn, while eating freshly picked strawberries and photographing the incredible vistas of the valley below before it vanishes as the sun sets and the clouds make the rest of the world disappear for another day.

Jedinak levels but Australia  can only draw with Denmark
Samara, Thursday: Australia captain Mile Jedinak hit a second-half VAR-assisted penalty to secure a 1-1 World Cup draw with Denmark on Thursday that left the Socceroos' last-16 hopes hanging by a thread.
Bert van Marwijk's men travelled to Samara needing a win after their unfortunate 2-1 defeat to France in their Group C opener.
Australia battled back impressively after Christian Eriksen's seventh-minute opener but were unable to find a way past Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from open play despite dominating a pulsating second half.
The result leaves Denmark on four points and Australia with just a single point after two games apiece.
Tottenham midfielder Eriksen, identified as the dangerman by Australia in the run-up to the game, showed sublime technique to finish after Nicolai Jorgensen's neat lay-off in the area. Australia's response was impressive but with just one point from two games the Socceroos' chances of advancing in Russia now appear slim.
Eriksen's early opener was a body blow for Australia but they were given a lifeline when an outswinging corner seemed destined for the head of Hertha Berlin winger Mathew Leckie but came off the arm of Yussuf Poulsen.
The Leipzig front man had been Denmark's hero with the matchwinner against Peru but was adjudged to have handled the ball and the referee consulted the Video Assistant Referee system before pointing to the spot.
Jidenak, who had scored a penalty against France, stepped up to fire easily past Schmeichel in the 38th minute. Eriksen's free kick caused mayhem in the box just minutes later, with Mat Ryan collecting in relief after the ball came off the leg of Trent Sainsbury a yard from the goalline.
The Socceroos were quickly into their strde after the restart, only for Pione Sisto to curl just wide of Ryan's goal.
Yet Australia went on to dominate a second half that saw Aaron Mooy and late substitute Danel Arzani go agonisingly close.
Van Marwijk, who replaced Ange Postecoglou at the helm of the Australian team in January, handed 19-year-old Arzani another chance to impress after a late cameo appearance against France.
With practically his first touch, the teenager set up Huddersfield Town midfielder Mooy for a drive that flashed just wide.
Andrew Nabbout's game ended prematurely when he fell and suffered what looked like a dislocated shoulder, the Urawa Reds front man replaced by Tomi Juric.
Arzani did well to keep the ball in play and outfox Sisto to fire across the area but the chance went begging. Just minutes before the final whistle the Iranian-born teenager produced an angled strike that forced a great block from Schmeichel. AFP

19TH DEATH ANNIVERSARY OF MERVYN DE SILVA FALLS TODAY:
A journalist par excellence
Mervyns career as a journalist, as a literary critic, as a satirist, as a political commentator, as a broadcaster, both within the country and abroad, is without peer, either before or since and is not likely to be equaled for a long time to come, if at all.
Neville Jayaweera, The Island, September 8, 2002
Mervyn revealed dimensions to his personality in which there was a strong romantic strain. He had a feel for the heroic, the courageous, the brave and brainy anti-authoritarian protagonist.
P. Duleepkumar, Sunday Times, September 5, 1999
The volume entitled TITO in the World Press: On the Occasion of the 80th Birthday was published by the Yugoslav review Borba.
The opening contribution to the volume published in 1972 in Belgrade was by Abraham Guillen, writing in the newspaper Marcha, in Uruguay. Guillen, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, was known as the counselor and strategist of the legendary Uruguayan urban guerrilla group, the Tupamaros, of which President Mujica was a leader as a young man and comrade-in-arms of the movements founder Raul Sendic.
The article on page 14 of the volume was by the most legendary journalist of the Arab world, Mohamed Hassanein Heykal of Egypt, writing in the famous paper he edited, Al Ahram.
Nikolai Podgorny, the President of the USSR was another contributor, writing in Pravda.
Luigi Longo, a founder member with Antonio Gramsci and Palomiro Togliatti and later, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party and partisan fighter against Mussolinis fascism contributed a piece on Tito to lUnita.
One of the most famous Western journalists of the post war 20th Century, CL Sulzberger contributed his piece in the pages of the New York Times, of course.
World affairs
On page 30 of the volume is the editorial bearing the name Mervyn de Silva and appearing in the Daily News, Sri Lanka on May 19, 1972. (In an interesting symmetry, when he was unfairly dismissed from the editorship of the Daily News, the article in The Guardian, UK, described him as the Hassanein Heykal of Sri Lanka.)
The article on President Tito of Yugoslavia not only reveals Mervyns views on that great hero of 20th Century history and founder leader of the Non-Aligned movement, but also Mervyns own values, especially in the field of world affairs.
Once again the Yugoslav Parliament has honoured President Tito. The occasion this time was his 80th birthday, an event which is being celebrated throughout Yugoslavia with all the spontaneous warmth and admiration that is reserved only for a true national hero. This Tito certainly is.
A courageous patriot and partisan, he won the hearts of his people by his heroic role in the bloody struggle against Hitler and fascism. As a military strategist and statesman he played the game of war and politics with such exceptional skill and sagacity that Yugoslavia emerged from the war a free and independent nation. Soon the same courage and skill stood him and his country well when Yugoslavia was faced with the menacing challenge of Stalins expanding empire. That brave defiance gained Tito and Yugoslavia the undying regard of all independent nations, big and small. In these glorious beginnings and in such acts of patriotic spirit lies the secret of Titos enduring authority over his people. For more than a quarter century Tito has been Yugoslavia.
But Tito is more than the architect and master of Yugoslavia. He is a world figure, universally renowned and respected. If his stern sense of national independence made his foreign policy a model for other nations during and after the Cold war, his innovations in socialist practice (both in politics and in economics) have earned him the reputation of an ideological pioneer and experimenter.
The Third World has a special reason to regard him with affection. He was the first European of any standing to respond sincerely to the aspirations which swept the ex-colonial world after the war.
This led him gradually to identify himself with the non-aligned community. And it was Yugoslavias capital which became the venue of the first non-aligned conference. With Nehru, Soekarno, Nasser and Nkrumah gone, Tito remains the dominant personality of this expanding international community. (Universally renowned and respected, Mervyn de Silva, Daily News, May 19, 1972)
Political ideas and values
So, Mervyns identifiable values were: a courageous patriotism/patriotic spirit, anti-fascist struggle, a free and independent nation, a stern sense of national independence, innovative experiments in socialism, brave defiance, the Third World, the aspirations which swept the ex-colonial world after the war, the non-aligned community. To reiterate: courage and brave defiance in the service of national freedom and independence, patriotism, anti-fascism, innovative socialist experimentation, Third Worldism and nonalignment.
Those were some of Mervyns political ideas and values, but what of the values of Mervyn the man, as reflected in his life and witnessed by those close to him who had known him since his youth
Writing in the Sunday Times of September 5, 1999, which would have been Mervyns 70th birthday had he lived for a few months more, his university friend PS Duleepkumar, founder of Accounting Systems and Services (and cousin of the iconic leftist Bala Tampoe) wrote of Mervyn with revealing insight:
Mervyn's brilliance as a journalist has been universally acclaimed and rightly so. The qualitative difference in Mervyn's writing was I believe greatly due to his over-arching interest in international affairs and the width and the depth of his reading. He was able to interconnect events happening in different parts of the world in terms of a universal trend or in relation to a common principle. This enabled him to see the unfolding events in Sri Lanka objectively and in a wider perspective than most and made him much sought after by the diplomatic community. Mani Dixit, the former Indian High Commissioner, marked him as one of the best, if not the best, he had met on his numerous postings.
There was a prophetic dimension to his writing. He was in the forefront of the thinking which mooted the significance of geopolitics in the conduct of foreign affairs. He emphasized the primacy of India in the structure of our foreign policy. The Tamil Nadu factor
In the Lanka Guardian which was his prime achievement, he was at pains to give weightage to the expression of the minority view on the vexed nationalities question.
Mervyn revealed dimensions to his personality in which there was a strong romantic strain. He had a feel for the heroic, the courageous, the brave and brainy anti-authoritarian protagonist. General Giap and Che Guevara come to mind.
We differed on many matters but talked the same languageMervyn was completely unambitious in the best sense of the word. Never a seeker of vain glory, he was also oblivious to wealth and money. He lived to satisfy inner compulsions which were filtered by his reason and intelligence for a life of self-fulfillment in accordance with his outstanding talent. (PS Duleepkumar, Sunday Times Plus, September 5, 1999)
Let us leave the penultimate word to Mervyn himself. What follows are the opening and closing paragraphs from the inaugural edition of the Lanka Guardian which he founded on May 1, 1978:
The Lanka Guardian is primarily a journal of opinion. The proper functioning of a pluralist democracy presupposes the free interplay of diverse opinions. The freer and more active, the better
We have been advised to be lamps unto ourselves. The press in particular has been invited to light the path of our leaders. For common humanity the possibilities of personal salvation, so freely given to the artist and the saint, can only be enhanced by the larger endeavour of social emancipation. The act of informed discussion is itself a source of illumination. (Mervyn de Silva, Other News, Another Opinion, Lanka Guardian Vol. 1, No 1, May 1, 1978)
Thus for Mervyn de Silva, the path of personal salvation runs through social emancipation which is the larger endeavour of the two, and to which one contributes the role and function of illumination by means of informed discussion which presupposes the free and active interplay of diverse opinions for which pluralist democracy is a precondition. In sum, social emancipation and pluralist democracy, or more intimately and inextricably, social emancipation through pluralist democracy.

Lanka in Huawei Technologies Smart City net
Huawei Technologies has focused attention towards the setting up of Smart Cities in several Asia-Pacific region countries including Sri Lanka.
Huawei Southern- East Asian Region Group CTO and Executive Consultant Michael MacDonald in an interview with Daily News said that Huawei has planned to strengthen ongoing development activities in Asia- Pacific Region countries by setting up Smart Cities. Sri Lanka too has been identified.
MacDonald said a Smart City is a one that leverages information, Communication and data technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government processes, enhance the flow of information and ultimately improve the lives of the citizens living in Smart cities.
Asked whether the Sri Lankan Government makes any request from Huawei to set up Smart Cities in the country MacDonald said Huawei is always eager to participate in Smart City projects and can play the role of infrastructure provider for network such as ICT, IoT and cloud facilitator for ecosystem development or simply trusted advisor for experience sharing.
MacDonald also highlighted the advantage of setting up a `Smart City in a developing country like Sri Lanka and said that citizens could reap large benefits of having Smart cities in their cities.
Smart cities could provide many important services and improvements to suburban and rural populations and it would also help to attract foreign business by acting as a gateway between the larger base of citizens and the connected world,
He said Huawei has provided the services to over 200 Smart City projects all over the world and this has already benefitted over 400 million people in thirty countries worldwide. He said among the countries Huawei has provided large scale services to thickly populated cities in Longgang, China, Yanbu, Saudi Arabia and in Gelsenkirchen in Germany where citizens reap large benefits from the Smart city concept.
Asked whether a developing country like Sri Lanka needs `Smart Cities MacDonald highlighted that developing countries can benefit even more from Smart Cities as each solution component will significantly elevate the effectiveness of government services. He said in Kenya, Huaweis command center and IoT are aligned with their national strategy to protect Kenyans, the promotion of tourism and encourage foreign economic investment.
In many countries throughout Asia, cloud data centers are being used to consolidate information and provide a single window and instance of data across multiple departments and in turn making the processing of vital government documents and applications traceable and faster.

Lasting solutions needed
Every day seems filled with uproar about the state of the economy, the unpredictable hike in fuel prices, escalating taxation, and the constant struggle to keep up with the increasing cost of living. Amidst this chaotic landscape, the governments priorities in tackling our countrys burning issues seem misplaced.
Due to political agendas and the fight to win favour with some constituents and affiliated parties, government authorities have turned towards the tobacco and alcohol industries for an easy win.
While curbing alcoholism and the fight against tobacco is a noble cause, one must question whether it is right to use these as bait to distract the public away from the governments inability to solve even the most basic issues such as garbage disposal.
While I commend the government for their diligent work in this regard, I have noticed that whenever the government faces a lot of pressure from the public to address larger social issues such as corruption, poverty, proper access to clean water and of course the garbage fiasco, it is inevitably followed by a lot of talk on their next steps toward eradicating smoking and drinking in Sri Lanka.
Currently, the latest debate appears centred around the plain packaging of cigarettes. This appears to be a crude distraction in order to spur the public to engage in a dramatic hot topic discussion and direct the conversation away from the aforementioned burning issues for which these officials are accountable to find timely solutions.

Mitchell holds up Lancashire with ton
LONDON, Wednesday - Worcestershire opener Daryl Mitchell batted all the way though his side's innings to post his second century inside a month against Lancashire in the English County Championships.
Mitchell's 118 helped Worcs rally from 81-5, but they were all out for 247 with Joe Mennie and Jordan Clark both claiming four wickets. After an opening stand of 77 in reply, Lancashire then slumped to 86-5, as Ed Barnard took four late wickets.
A staggering 20 wickets fell in the day on what is usually a batsman's paradise at Tunbridge Wells as Kent earned a first-innings lead in the meeting of Division Two's second against first.
Keith Barker returned his best bowling figures in four years - 5-32 - as Kent were bowled out for 197. Only Kent captain Joe Denly offered any lasting resistance with 59 before Warwickshire collapsed to 125 all out.
Jonathan Trott was unbeaten on 51, then Kent, batting again, closed on 4-0.
Colin Ackermann's unbeaten 151 helped Leicestershire take control on day one but Middlesex's Tim Murtagh's five wickets limited the hosts total.
Neil Dexter added 66, as he and Ackermann put on 129 for the third wicket, before Dexter was caught behind off the bowling of the in-form Murtagh. At the close, the hosts were 353-8 with Ackermann and Gavin Griffiths (18*) securing a fourth batting bonus point.
Northamptonshire recorded their highest County Championship total of the season but were unable to take full advantage on day one against Gloucestershire. The hosts went from 99-0 to 220-6 as Luke Procter, Ben Duckett and Richard Levi all failed to convert good starts. Matt Taylor (4-70) and Ryan Higgins (3-52) shone for Gloucestershire, who restricted them to 282 all out. With 13 overs to face Joe Dent fell lbw for 11 to the final ball of the day as the visitors closed on 25-1. Phil Salt and Tom Haines hit maiden Championship hundreds as Sussex piled on the runs to reach 439-5 on day one against Durham at Arundel.
Salt hit a six and 18 fours in his 130, while 19-year-old Haines collected 19 boundaries in his 124. Their stand of 244 was a second-wicket record for Sussex against Durham, beating the 196 compiled by Bill Athey and Alan Wells 22 years ago. Glamorgan struggled to 175-7 on a rain-shortened first day against Derbyshire after choosing to bat in Swansea.
Seamer Tony Palladino (4-49) wrecked the top order as he swung the ball prodigiously in cloudy conditions.
But Chris Cooke (69) led the counter-attack, sharing half-century stands with both David Lloyd (21) and Andrew Salter (26 not out). Palladino returned to bowl Cooke shortly before the close of play to reassert the visitors grip.

Nourish your skin at night
NNO was the first skincare nourishment brand for night time use to be introduced in Sri Lanka. Women are generally habituated to apply something on their face before they leave home, during the day but nothing really before they go to sleep.
Mega Lifesciences a science based company realized the importance of night nourishment as the best form of skin nourishment, rejuvenation and revitalization through tons of scientific papers and articles published on this subject.
Doctors and experts recommend about eight hours of sleep every day to help the body reinvigorate itself. The body including the skin is exposed to stressors during the day that plays a damaging role and a sound beauty sleep of about 8 hours helps the body get back in shape and makes the skin look fresh and beautiful.
Anything applied on the skin at that point of time has the best possible chance of getting absorbed and work its magic. As far as the skin is concerned cell renewal and repair happens at night.
NNO was based on this concept of nourishing the skin at night which is the best time for absorption and nourishment to happen and ensuring that the skin gets enough moisture, firmness, elasticity, strength and smoothness to face the onslaught from the environment the following day. Thats why we say wake up to a beautiful skin, every day.
Valid scientific studies done on NNO prove that it has an excellent global safety record as proven by the Spin Control Institute, France on consumer trials and that NNO improves the key essential parameters of the skin such as moisture, firmness, elasticity and smoothness in as early as two to three weeks time.
NNO is probably the only brand of its kind with studies done on it to prove its safety and efficacy.
NNO is especially of great use for mothers in their middle age who might face problems of dry skin and wrinkles, which also has to do with their hormone changes leading to drop in the skin density and ability to retain moisture. This results in the skin looking dry and old. NNO is a sure remedy for this problem and its satisfied customer base both in Sri Lanka and overseas proves this fact.
NNO is manufactured by Mega Lifesciences, a human wellness company with a global foot print spread across 31 countries in the world and its manufacturing plants in both Thailand and Australia, conform to international quality standards. The local partners for Mega Life sciences is A.Baur & Co Pvt, Ltd, a Swiss company in operation since 1897.
Mega Lifesciences have always been a pioneer in introducing many unique and first of its kind products in Sri Lanka, bringing to the Sri Lankan mothers their international exposure and expertise.
Mega Lifesciences manufactures its own products and has complete control on quality from start to finish. NNO is 100 per cent natural and uses a simple cold press technology in the extraction process which guarantees increased naturalness. The product is consumer friendly, it is convenient to carry and a pleasant fragrance makes it all the more soothing.

83 percent of loans obtained prior to 2015: Govt. to pay Rs. 1.9 trillion as loan repayments
The government which inherited a massive debt burden from the Rajapaksa regime, would have to pay Rs. 1.9 trillion this year as loan repayments of which 83% being loans obtained prior to 2015. Yet, we have taken on this burden and are moving forward, while not placing too much of a burden on the people, said Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
In a country with a population of 21 million, there were only 400,000 tax files opened, but after we brought in the new Tax Bill, many tax payers have come forward voluntarily to pay even a small percentage of taxes. By last Wednesday, 69,000 new tax files had been opened. If we continue this momentum, by 2020, we would be able to reduce the VAT by 2.5%. The government has taken measures to streamline the domestic income, which would take the countrys economy forward, while providing concessions to the people, said Minister Samaraweera.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, commencing the debate and presenting two notifications under the Excise Ordinance. Under this ordinance, the Finance Ministry had agreed to reduce the taxes on the bottling of toddy with the aim of implementing measures to monitor the toddy industry.
According, to Samaraweera, from 2019 to 2020, it would be the most difficult period, as some of the loans would reach maturity and the country would have to pay over Rs. 4 trillion.
Yet, with all that burden, we have managed these loans during the governments 100 day programme, we increased the government servants salaries by Rs. 10,000. Despite having to increase fuel prices, it was still under what the previous government provided. After three years, there had only been a small increase in the prices of essential commodities. Yet, it is only coconut prices that we were unable to control. For those who question our government as to what we had done for the country, I would wish to say we have done our utmost for the country, especially in the health sector, the government has done a commendable service.
Today, we provide hear patients with stents absolutely free of charge. Cancer patients are provided treatment for as long as they require it, without limitations for their cancer treatment, etc. Ironically, although the people know how much we have done, they are reluctant to admit it, he said.
The Minister noted that as a result of many requests made, the government has decided to exempt the withholding tax on childrens accounts which earlier stood at 5%.
During the previous regime, the 2.5% withholding tax was charged on these minors accounts. However, we increased it to 5%, but having paid heed to the numerous requests to exempt accounts of minors under 18, we have taken the decision to remove the withholding tax on these accounts completely.
However, we admit that there were certain clauses in the Inland Revenue Bill brought in April and have made several amendments. The royalty fees charged by artistes was also taxed and we have brought in a new amendment to exempt the tax on royalties earned up to Rs. 50,000 monthly. Only income from royalties above this amount would be taxed.
Further, the channelling service tax and taxes imposed for services obtained from private hospitals, except room charges, would also be exempted from tax, as we had realised that due to the congestion at government hospitals, many patients seek treatment at private hospitals.
Therefore, as a sensitive government, we have identified certain shortfalls in the Inland Revenue Act and further amendments would be made and several others would be included and an amendment to the current Act too would be presented to Parliament during the first week of July, he added.
VAT Amendments to be presented in July
A series of Amendments to rectify the identified loopholes of the newly introduced Inland Revenue Bill will be presented in Parliament in the first week of July, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Speaking in Parliament yesterday he said the removal of 15 percent VAT on channelling at private hospitals, exemption of all savings accounts of children less than 18 from income tax and exemption of royalty payments upto Rs 50,000 per month from income tax are included in these amendments.
He said these amendments have already received Cabinet approval.We have already informed our officers not to charge these taxes, as we hope to pass the amendments soon, he added.
He said artistes who earn more than Rs 50,000 per month from royalty payments would still have to pay the income tax. He said 15 percent VAT will continue for those who obtain residential treatment in private hospitals.
The new Inland Revenue Act came into operation from April 1.It introduced a new income tax structure to raise state revenue by closing existing loopholes in revenue collection.
Severe shortage of AL Maths, Science graduate teachers: Minister proposes special allowance to attract more
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said there is a severe shortage of qualified teachers in the GCE Advanced Level Science and Mathematics streams in the entire country because the majority of degree holders who specialised in such subjects do not apply for teaching vacancies.
To address this issue, he said he hopes to present a Cabinet paper in the near future proposing granting a special allowance for teachers who teach Science and Mathematics subjects to attract more degree holders to fill the teacher shortage.
JVP MP Nihal Galappaththi brought it to the notice of the Minister that there are no teachers in the Zahira College, Hambantota which is the only Tamil medium national school in the district to teach Advanced Level Science and Mathematics streams at the moment.
In response, Kariyawasam said, there is a severe shortage of qualified teachers for Advanced level science and mathematics subjects, both in Sinhala and Tamil mediums. I hope to present a Cabinet paper to propose granting an allowance to Advanced Level science and mathematics teachers in addition to their salaries so we would be able to attract more degree holders for the remaining vacancies.
Adjournment debate on PC elections on July 6: Debate on Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA on July 18

Considering the different views, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has proposed to hold a full day adjournment debate on PC Elections on July 6 and it has agreed by the party leaders.
Parliamentary sources said Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha had informed Party Leaders that the President is of the view that the PC elections must be conducted under the new electoral system, which is a hybrid of First Past the Post system and the Proportional Representation system.
However, Minister Rauf Hakeem had objected stating that the minority parties could not agree to it. They had preferred the old electoral system with preferential votes.The meeting had ended inconclusively.
Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition has sought an adjournment debate on Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Following the request of JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, the Party Leaders have agreed to take up the said debate on July 18.
State Ministers Harsha, Eran berate TNA MP: Government does not discriminate against North and East
State Ministers Dr. Harsha de Silva and Eran Wickremaratne roundly criticised TNA MP S.Sritharan for not having the courtesy to appreciate the many positive work being undertaken by the Government in the North.
MP Sritharan was highly critical of the Government in his speech stating that the needs of Tamil people in the North were being overlooked and that they were being treated as second class citizens. He said a referendum must be held for people in the North and the East asking as to whether they would like to continue to live together with the people in the South.
He accused that Sinhala families were being resettled in Vavuniya North to deliberately change the ethnic composition in the region.
He said the lands in the area were held by the military. Joining in the debate on 1990 Suwaseriya Foundation Bill, MP Sritharan was critical that the people in the North have more burning problems to be resolved than having an ambulance service.
At this point State Minister Dr. de Silva said, You criticise, we listen. A lot of what you said was not accurate. You know the Army is gradually returning the lands of the people. This is a fact.
You did not have the courtesy to appreciate it. Before the end of next month, 1,061,315 million people in the North will receive pre-hospital care ambulance services and emergency response services free as we extend Suwaseriya to the North. Before the end of this year we will extend this service to the East as well.
If you do not want it to the North tell us, we will take it back, said the seemingly miffed State Minister.
State Minister Eran Wickremaratne, who took the floor after MP Sritharan, said the Government at no point discriminated the Northern Province from the rest of the country.
We cannot solve all the problems of the people in the North at once, and neither we can solve all the problems of the people in the South at once. The Finance Minister held discussions with the military Heads even this week to release more lands in the North.
The Government has given high priority for the reconciliation programme. The Government cares not only about the Northern Tamils, but also about the Tamils and other minority groups in the South.
I disagree with Dr. Harsha de Silva for asking MP Sritharan as to whether they want the Suwaseriya service to the North. We should deliver and serve all our citizens equally and MP Sritharans stance should not matter in implementing the state policy, he commented.

Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub launched
The Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub project, a keystone of the various public transport systems servicing the citys central business districts, was launched yesterday.
Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, hosted the inaugural meeting for this with the private sector, the directors of all main development banks, and the French Ambassador in Colombo.
The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development has commissioned a feasibility study and concept design, which will be funded by the French Government through a grant to the Government . A team of local and foreign consultants in transportation operation, engineering and architecture companies  are working with the Ministry of Megapolis and the French Development agency (AFD  the French Governments development finance institution) to ensure the success of this key project. Colombo has long been admired as one of the most beautiful cities in South Asia, but today it needs an ambitious and audacious vision to renew itself  one built on the unique identity that our diverse city has developed over the centuries, explained Minister Ranawaka.
The government of France will support the Sri Lankan government in this feasibility study through a dedicated grant of Rs 166 million , said Jean-Marin Schuh, Ambassador of France. French expertise in transportation and urban planning is recognized worldwide and we are proud to share it with Sri Lanka.
AFD is proud to be a key partner of Sri Lanka to enhance the Western Region Megapolis liveability, to strengthen its inter connectivity, and ultimately to support its sustainable economic development for the benefit of the Sri Lankan population, said Martin Parent, AFD country Director. In this endeavour, AFD will be pleased to finance the public share of the investments needed to make this challenging project a reality.
Patrick Ropert, CEO of SNCF Gares and Connexions, the company that owns and operates Frances 3,000-strong train stations network and one of the three members of the French consortium, praised an iconic and strategic project, for which French Railways integrated approach from design to operations and revenue generation-is a perfect fit.
The Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub is recognised as a flagship transport project with sectorial integration for long term development. Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub will link coastal and urban railway lines, intercity and local bus stations, Light Rapid Transit, the Port Access Elevated Highway and other strategic development projects such as Port City, Colombo International Financial City. It will connect transport modes, connect the people of Sri Lanka, and shape the future of the city by dramatically improving mobility for all.

Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub:
A Rs. 160 million (1 million Euro) conceptual and feasibility studies on the Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub, funded through a grant from the French Treasury, was launched yesterday.
The feasibility study will be conducted by the French consultancy firms AREP and Egis, and SNCF Hubs and Connections.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, addressing the launch at Shangri-La hotel, Colombo, said this would be a key gateway to Colombo and provide coordinated access to the Colombo city.
Pettah, envisioned to be a business district with access to the Colombo Port City, has a huge issue with handling transport and traffic. Passengers, traveling from one system of transportation, cannot switch to another without undergoing many difficulties, said the minister. The aim of the programme is to provide a comfortable and efficient public transport system.
The Multimodal Transport Hub will also complement the needs of other projects in the area, such as the Beira Lake development project and the Ocean City 2035 project. Nearly 280,000 people a day are estimated to travel to and from Pettah by 2025.
The minister urged the officials of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), Road Development Authority (RDA), Colombo Municipal Council and others to share their ideas with consultants to integrate all plans into one. The consultants too were asked to look into the needs of the people in the area.
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministrys Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub Project Director Srimantha Fernando, meanwhile, observed that it was imperative that the project gets off the ground as many other projects such as the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, and the upgrade of railways and the elevated highway into Pettah had to be put on hold until the basics of the hub were decided.
Given that the feasibility study would take a year to complete, the ministry has taken steps to concurrently start work on other projects connected to the hub.
The Colombo Plan developed by the UDA, Beira Lake development and the multipurpose project at Chalmers Granary in Pettah have been thus given the green light to proceed.
Minister Ranawaka said in addition to the hub, his ministry was also developing mini hubs in other cities in the Western Province such as Battaramulla, Kottawa, Kadawatha, Katunayake, Moratuwa and Piliyandala. The proposed LRT funded by public-private partnerships is to travel through Kadawatha, Kolonnawa, Homagama, Kottawa and Piliyandala.
AREP Team Leader Andreas Heym, addressing the gathering, explained that the hub would first be an intermodal pedestrian platform to connect people with one form of transport to another. The essential part here is the pedestrian. They will be able to move from the bus, train, car park and LRT seamlessly, he said. Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe said they would work together with foreign experts and local professionals to synchronize and get a good product in the end. Transport and Civil Aviation Secretary D. S. Withanage said more options of transport from urban areas to the city centre would help reduce travel time for the public and it would encourage more to switch to public transport to reduce congestion and pollution in the city.

President vows no return to dictatorship
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday took serious exception to a top Buddhist monk urging former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to take over the country as a Hitler-type military dictator.
President Sirisena said as a Buddhist he had the highest respect for the clergy, but could not agree with a senior monk of the Asgiriya chapter who invited Rajapaksa to be a Hitler, take the military and take power.
He said the voters toppled former strongman President Mahinda Rajapaksa because they wanted to end a decade-long iron-fisted rule and win back their personal freedoms.
In January 2015, people did not vote for food or jobs, the President said addressing a meeting Nikawaratiya. They voted for freedom and democracy. I have restored both and will not allow this country to slip back to a dictatorship.
He was saddened by the call of Ven. Venduruwe Upali Thera who sought a return to an era when citizens were deprived of their basic human rights and any dissent was immediately crushed.
We have restored the freedoms of the people, and media freedom. In fact, these freedoms are being abused and we are attacked without any fear of reprisals, unlike in the past.
He said he was being criticised as a weak leader because he did not oppress the people unlike his predecessor. Former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike too was criticised using the same language and he was assassinated three and a half years into his term, the President noted.
Despite the threats, the President said he will not waver and will not allow the hard-won democracy to be undermined in the country.
The Venerable Upali Thera raised eyebrows with his sermon at a birthday celebration of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa on Wednesday encouraging him to be like a Hitler who slaughtered six million Jews in the Holocaust and take power as the next President of Sri Lanka.
The monk prayed that the youngest Rajapaksa sibling will be the next President.
As the clergy, we feel the country needs a religious leader, the monk said.
Some people describe you as a Hitler, the monk told Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Be a Hitler! Go with the military. Take the leadership of the country.
He was happy that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was being mentioned as a potential candidate to be the next president of Sri Lanka. With the blessings of Mahinda Rajapaksa, people aspire to have Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as a presidential candidate, Venerable Upali Thera said even as two other Rajapaksa siblings in contention -- Basil and Chamal  were also in the audience.
Gotabhayas alms giving to mark his 69th birthday was attended by opposition MPs, including some SLFP parliamentarians who left the government recently. Venerable Upali Thera, the Anunayaka (deputy) in the Asgiriya Chapter, made it clear that Gotabhaya was his choice over the other Rajapaksa siblings who also want to be President.
The monk made no reference to allegations that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was responsible for white van kidnappings and extra judicial killings, but said he could be a religious leader, a Buddhist leader and a Sinhala leader.

National Poson festival  2018
Procession from Isurumuniya to Mahamevnawa tomorrow
Preparations for the national Poson festival to be held in Anuradhapura, is currently underway with offerings of water from the Tissa Wewa being planned to be utilised to commence a traditional, week-long Poson pirith-chanting ceremony at the Mahamevnawas Sacred Space (pirith mandapaya).
The procession escorting vessels filled with water from the Tissa Wewa, would commence from the historic Isurumuniya Raja Maha Viharaya to the sacred space on June 23.
The period between June 24 and June 30 had been declared the Anuradhapura National Poson Festival Week. The Poson festival steering committees head, Anuradhapura Government Agent (GA) R. M. Wanninayake, told the Daily News that all meat stalls and liquor shops in the district would be closed during the Poson week. He added that one million devotees were expected to visit Anuradhapura for religious observances during the festival.
The Mihintale Poson Sathi Pirith Pinkama commenced on May 17 and further, the Lake House annual Mihintale illumination programme would be initiated on June 26 and would continue for three days.
The government agent said all necessary infrastructural facilities, mainly security, electricity, drinking water and sanitation, had been made sufficient for around one million devotees expected to be present in Anuradhapura and Minintale during the religious celebrations. He said that amidst the prevailing drought, steps had been taken to provide adequate drinking water facilities to the public.
The Mahaweli Water-Management Committee had agreed to provide 6,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water through the Kala Wewa and Nachchaduwa tank to the Tissa Wewa, Thuruwila Wewa and the Nuwara Wewa; the main sources of drinking water in the Anuradhapura district and its surrounding suburbs.
Meanwhile, a philanthropist in Minuwangoda, Sunil Jayasinghe, had agreed to provide 200,000 litres of cooled drinking water to devotees during Poson at Anuradhapura, Mihintale and Thanthirimale, using a fleet of bowsers.
Wanninayake urged the public not to use the Tissa Wewa and Nuwara Wewa tanks for bathing during the Poson celebrations as the festival steering committee had decided to ban such activities at the two tanks.
However, devotees could bathe in the Basawakkulama, Nachchaduwa, Mahakanadarawa and Bulankulama tanks, the three ponds between the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and Mirisawetiya as well as the Malawathu Oya.
He warned that no lifeguards would be positioned at the Nuwara Wewa and Tissa Wewa and that police would also be present at the aforementioned sites.
It was expected that 100,000 devotees would observe atasil before the Samadhi Buddha Statue, the Ruwanwelisaya and the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi during Poson. The Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank would provide breakfast and gilanpasa to sil observers and Buddhist monks.
Government Agent Wanninayake said that the festival would hopefully be an eye-opener to those who were engaged in corrupt activities; an opportunity to repent and leave behind their wayward lifestyles.

RAVI RATNAYEKE - a classy all rounder
Long before Sri Lanka gained admission to the portals of the highly prestigious of Test cricket playing arena, Trinity College produced some cricketers of class in Philip Buultjens, G.P. Bobby Schoormen, Eustace Rulach, Nimal Maralande, Malsiri Kurukulasuriya, Harinda Dunuwille, Himmendra Ranaweera, Glen Vanlangenberg and many others who could have made headlines in International cricket.
In the post Test era the best ever cricketer to come out of that prestigious school from the hill capital of Kandy is that stylish and elegant batsman- wicket keeper who went on to captain the country and set up records in batting and wicket keeping in all forms of cricket and who is without doubt Kumar Sangakkara.
Classy all-rounder
Before Sangakkara came along JOSEPH RAVINDRA RAVI RATNAYEKE who was a classy all rounder from Trinity College. He was a rare cricketer who bowled right arm and batted left hand. As a fielder he was not brilliant, but one could describe him as adequate.
The burly cricketer standing over 6 feet, he started batting in the middle and as his career progressed he faced the new ball and did a pleasing job. He ran in like former England right arm fast bowler Brian Statham and delivered some quick deliveries which included the in swing and out swing an also packed a devastating Yorker. Batsmen had to be extremely careful when facing RATNAYEKE.
His wielded the willow as a stylish left hand batsman with clever use of feet, admirable timing and he had strokes all round the wicket in his armoury. He seldom played a rash stroke and presented his wicket and guarded it as if his life depended on it. In addition he was a fine team man and his captains admired his contributions.
Nain scoring strokes
RATNAYEKE had the ability to play any stroke in the book. But his main scoring strokes were the drives on the V. He was also a good cutter and had a defence that was rock solid. He was an indispensable all rounder to any team.
As a fielder he was slow footed and that could be excused for because being bury, he could not move quickly to stop the ball, but was a sure catches when the batsmen lofted the ball, rarely dropping any vital or costly catches.
Before going on to detail his performances for the country, I would like to describe the Father of this great son YASA RATNAYEKE. A stylish left hand opening batsmen in the early 1950s for St. Josephs College, Darley Road. As a tender cricketer I still remember the swashbuckling near hundred he made against my old school St.BENEDICTS College, on the Kotahena mat.
Champion Joes team
YASA played in a Josephian champion team under that diminutive opening batsman Reinzie Perera which team included some outstanding crickets of the calibre of Mahinda de Silva ( Elder brother of Raja, who was a fine leg spinning all rounder who also captained the school), Ralph Brohier, Chrisantha Fernando, Tony Buhar, Talath Ismail and Malcom Berenger to name a few.
YASA had a rare record which still stands and that is that opening the innings in the 1953 big match against St. Peters College he remained unbeaten making 70 odd. In that era the score book would pencil it as COB (carried on batting) now it goes as not out.
Nine wickets in an innings
RAVI RATNAYEKE played for Trinity from 1997 to 1980 capturing 81 wickets with 9 wickets in an innings against Dharmaraja. He was sweating it out to capture the last wicket and make it 10 in an innings, but the last batsman was run out.
From father to son. RAVI started his school career at St.Anthonys College, Kandy before ending up at Trinity College. After showing his prowess at Trinity, he made his entry into first class cricket playing in the under- 25 game against Tamil Nadu in 1980/91. His opening bowling partner was Asantha de Mel.
Sri Lankan selectors watching the young man in action where he bowled with great promise taking three wickets were impressed and the selectors who picked him for a tour of England in 1981.
Playing six games
On that tour playing in six games he took nine wickets, with a bag of five wickets against Sussex. After Sri Lanka gained Test status a year later it was a pity that he could not make it to the countrys team against England led by Keith Fletcher in the Inaugural Test at the Colombo Oval..
However he was rewarded being picked to tour Pakistan in the countrys inaugural tour to Pakistan in 1982 and made his debut in the Final Test in Lahore taking three wickets. He bagged the prized wicket of Pakistans leading batsman Zaheer Abbas in the Second ODI.
Coming down to Colombo he sported Nondescripts CC colours from which club he made it to the Sri Lanka team. It is on record that in one Test against Pakistan in Sialkot he took 8 for 83 which was his best.
Man of the match award
In a Benson and Hedges game one day international against the West Indies he scored 50 and captured five wickets and although being on the losing side won the man of the match award and received a gold medal.
RATNAYEKE who is now domiciled in Melbourne, and once on holiday here related this bitter experience to our late Kandy Correspondent JIFFREY ABDEEN who had done yeoman service for the DAILY NEWS and SUNDAY OBSERVER for well over three decades.
He said that his house was burgled and among the items lost was his wifes jewellery and a gold medal; which he treasured that he won when he was adjudged man of the match for capturing five wickets and making a 50 against the West Indies in Benson and Hedges limited over international.
He lodged complaint with the police, but the robber was evading arrest. However the police investigator who was handling this complaint was a friend of his who had played cricket with him.
Walking on the road
One day while walking on the road, the policeman had noticed a man sporting an uncommon medal and a closer look at it saw the words RAVI RATNAYAKE inscribed on it. The robber was immediately arrested and he spilled the beans.
RATNAYEKE born on May 2 1960 and played 22 Tests and 78 ODIS from 1982 to 1990. He scored 807 runs in Tests and 824 runs in ODIS with a top score of 93 in Tests and a fifty in ODIS. He took 56 Test wickets and 85 ODI wickets. He had four five wickets.
Made his Test debut
He made his Test debut in on March 5th 1982 against Pakistan and played his final Test on December 16, 1989 against Australia. ODI debut March 12, 1982 versus Pakistan and played his last ODI against Australia on May 2, 1990. He migrated to Australia in 1990 and played for Preston CC in Melbourne.
All round cricketers of the likes of JOSEPH RAVINDRAN RATNAYEKE are what Sri Lanka cricket needs today

Rs.6 billion to conserve marine  resources, sustainable industries
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera reaffirmed the countrys commitment to conserving marine resources and sustainable industries adding that Rs.6 Billion has been earmarked for long term projects which includes reducing and eliminating marine pollution.
The Minister was speaking at the Regional Symposium on Sustainable Development Goal # 14 which brings together like minded stakeholders and member nations.
Reducing marine pollution and mitigating its effects in Sri Lanka has been prioritized in the 2018 Budget under the Blue-Green initiatives, and the government of Sri Lanka has allocated close to Rs.6 billion to implement long-term solutions to reduce and eliminate marine pollution and developing sustainable fishing practices, he said.
It is important to control Illegal,Unregulated, Unreported (IUU) fishing. Fishing methods such as mechanized and bottom trawling have a multitude of negative externalities that need to be addressed in a holistic manner through multilateral cooperation, the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera added that since the reinstatement of GSP+ in May 2017, there has been a 125% increase in seafood exports to the EU in the year 2017, attributing it as one the major success stories of the governments efforts to open up market access for Sri Lankan exporters.
Sustainable resource management is essential in order to successfully export into markets such as the EU. It is precisely this type of sustainable export industry that was envisaged in the 2018 Budget, themed Blue Green Economy: Enterprise Sri Lanka.
The Minister also spoke on investments in the tourism and fisheries industries adding that measures have been taken to replenish and conserve the coast in areas such as Mt.Lavinia, Ratmalana and Angulana. The government he said has also taken several initiatives to protect numerous lagoons around the island so to restore their unique eco-system making them resilient to climate change.
Accordingly, hotels and other establishments are being assisted in investing in technology to ensure zero discharge of waste to the rivers and streams. Additional Pigeon Island, Bar Reef and Delft have been declared as conservation and marine protected areas, he said.
In order to build on these initiatives and ensure longevity, a virtual institute for the blue-green economy has been launched as a pilot project, to create and sustain spinout programmes identified under the Blue-Green initiative, the Minister added.

Minister Akila Viraj addressing the media said the the Championship which commenced in the year 1984 came to halt in the year 2004 due to unkown reasons. Taking up duties as Minister of Education the ministry decided to relaunch the championship1i 2016 which was held in Kandy minus any sponsors. The first Championship was a initiative taken by the present advisor to the ministry of Education Sunil Jayaweera.
When the matter was taken up for discussion he whole heatedly agreed to commence the Championship and it is our duty to thank Jayaweera for carrying out this daunting task on grand scale in 2016 said the Minister.
Adding further he noted that at present junior athletes have come ahead of the senior athletes by winning medals at the recently concluded Junior Athletic Championships held in Japan.
This proves that if the junior sportsmen and women are nurtured well from their tender age they are sure to continue their sporting careers and winning streak bringing glory to the country. The ministry decided to recruit nearly 5000 Physical trainers few months ago and we already selected them and will posted schools that minus PTIs said the Minister.

I am sure once this part is completed every child will be engaged in some kind sport which will also keep them healthy throughout their lives.

Professor Wilfred S.E. Perera:
To Sir, with love
Professor Wilfred S.E. Perera, our beloved guru and mentor and a leading light in the field of maternal and gynaecological care in Sri Lanka for well over four decades, celebrated his 90th birthday on June 15.
The humble and unpretentious great man did so amongst his close-knit family, friends and grateful students, who cherish the privilege of being tutored by an extraordinary man of knowledge, talent, kindness and humility.
Prof had his primary education at St. Aloysius College, Galle. Both his parents were teachers and the ethics of hard work and discipline were instilled early in him and his siblings. His dedication for learning was such that, as he later recalled, when home lights were switched off at night, he would sit under a nearby street lamp to continue his studies.
Having entered Colombo Universitys Medical Faculty, his brilliance was apparent from the beginning. Many First Classes and gold medals were to follow and he was off to the United Kingdom, with his eyes set on becoming a general surgeon.
Following a fellowship in surgery and upon returning home in his early twenties, his career destiny would change on a chance encounter with Professor Sir Nicholas Attygalle, the much-feared Professor of Obstetrics and the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.
On hearing that his star student had decided upon a career in general surgery, he commanded and coaxed him to change his mind into a career in his speciality, Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Prof would fondly reminisce of Sir Nicholas as a man with a heart of gold, in spite of his being widely known as a highly authoritative terror. Membership and training in the speciality would follow and general surgerys loss was the gain of maternity and gynaecological care in Sri Lanka, for many decades to follow.
To say that Profs clinical acumen and surgical skills were exceptional is an understatement. Anecdotal instances of us students and then registrars looking at each other in incredulity upon his diagnostic skills on examination of a patient abound. There was no need for ultrasonic confirmation as he was never wrong. It is sad to recall the demise of such diagnostic skills that have been now replaced by imaging techniques. Modern generations of medical professionals will never know the exceptional diagnostic ability possessed by clinicians of Profs calibre and genius.
His surgical skills were legendary and we in our long association with him as students, registrars and later consultants, cannot recall a single instance of his being overwhelmed by a surgical situation. Those were the days of radical malignancy surgeries and he set upon surgeries such as Wertheims hysterectomy, Schauta and Mithra procedures and radical vulvectomy with aplomb. His skill and speed in such surgeries was exceptional and his professorial unit at North Colombo Medical College became a well-known referral centre for such radical surgeries. Prof would never decline if surgery was even remotely possible. Complete surgical cure was the rule before being transferred to the Cancer Institute for further management.
Despite being an exceptionally busy professorial unit, ours was a happy team where committed hard work was the norm. Morning ward rounds were a long lesson in clinical learning and a gentle nod or a smile from Prof was reward enough for a long evening and a nights hard work for us trainees. Prof never shouted or scolded, but we would work hard to avoid disappointment in his face. His method was simple - hard work by example, and we were keen not to disappoint the great man.
Profs reputation as a surgeon and a clinician was international. Our little island was then blessed by two internationally acclaimed talents in the art of gynaecological surgery, the other being Prof. Henry Nanayakkara. During our post-graduate training in the United Kingdom, many of us recall being asked by the bigwigs of gynaecology in the UK, of these professors well-being. These top gynaecologists took pride in knowing them personally and having seen them in action, and we took pride in being associated with them.
If ever there was anyone who shied away from obvious glory his reputation would bring, that was Prof. I recall an instance where a particularly difficult radical surgery was performed on a patient closely known to another famous professor. At the tea break following the surgery, he announced that he and another reputed clinician agreed that Prof must be the best gynaecological surgeon in Asia. With a guffaw, Prof was out of the tea room in a flash and into the operating theatre, embarrassed at such praise. That was Prof personified.
It is easy to keep reminiscing of the clinical and surgical skills of this great surgeon, but I am certain all who know him would agree that his hallmark and his greatest gift to us is his absolute humility. In spite of his iconic status, he probably never thought or felt he should live up to it. Anyone who met him not knowing who he was, would never guess he is anything other than a simple, friendly and kind man.
Whether as the young gynaecologist of repute, internationally known professor of gynaecology or in peaceful retirement, his demeanour never changed. With his gracious broad smile, your hand clasped in both his hands and with childlike eagerness to inquire of your well-being, he would greet you, whoever you are. His obvious glee to know you are well and deep concern if all was not well, made him a friend and a father figure to everyone who knew him. How nothing he achieved in his lofty life ever affected his simple ways is appreciated by us as his greatest virtue. His genuine love for humanity and his sense of duty make him attend every lecture, presentation, event or inauguration, encouraging the organisers and presenters of the event.
Rita, his beloved wife and life partner, passed away a few years back, affecting all of us who knew her, and Prof in particular. She was an amazing lady, in step with him in everything that was good of him. She was friendly, unpretentious, kind and generous to a fault. Her pretty face was always lit up with a genuine smile and a large portion of her very active life was dedicated to the welfare of others. The handsome and benevolent couple helped a large community of relatives, friends and less fortunate people to stand up in life, taking them under their wing and providing shelter, support and education over prolonged periods of time. Prof, following Aunty Ritas demise, continues her duties of generosity to date.
Profs is a family of academia and music. The great Sunil Shantha was his cousin. Profs love for music is well known and his renditions of beautiful and lesser known Sinhala songs of yesteryear is a much looked forward to feature of gatherings.
What appears an enchanted life was no bed of roses either. He too, like all mortals, had to face up to deep personal pain in his lifetime. The loss of his beloved daughter to an unexpected illness in her teenage years, loss of his loved brother at the high point of his career as a High Court Judge following a road accident, and subsequent demise of his beloved wife were some of them. His overcoming such travails through resolute courage speaks volumes of the man. In short, he is a man with a wonderful mission - to serve humanity to the best of his ability as long as he can.
His three children too need special mention. They have inherited their wonderful parents gift of graciousness and humility. They, with their families, are a huge strength to Prof, and the excellence in academia and music continues.
On this very special occasion of his 90th birthday, we his ever-grateful students, friends, relations and all who enjoyed the experience of his genius and benevolence, rise to wish him many more years of good health and happiness and thank him for the privilege of being touched by a very special human being.

SLT Customer Club, SLT volunteer  staff conduct Planting for  Water project
SLT Customer Club Ratnapura together with the SLT volunteer team has organized a mission, Planting for Water, which is a reforestation project conducted at Rakwana Palamkotte mountain range, bordering the world heritage Sinharaja rain forest.
This program was greatly supported and guided by the regional authorities from the Department of National Community Water Supply, Forest Department Sri Lanka and volunteers from the community living in the area.
A major challenge faced by villagers in the Rakwana Palamkotte area is the lack of suitable drinking water. This water shortage is directly linked to the deforestation that took place in the area many years ago. In fact, one of the most serious challenges that our country will have to face in the near future is the inadequacy of clean drinking water.
I am proud to work with the SLT team from their Headquarters and Ratnapura branch office together with members of the SLT Customer Club Ratnapura for the protection and the future survival of the Sinharaja Rain Forest which is considered a World Heritage. We are glad that SLT has recognized the sense of urgency of protecting our environment and embarked on this truly noble endeavour. We hope that others also will support us for these types of worthy projects in the future as every citizen in Sri Lanka only stands to benefit from the protection of the environment. said by Yehiya M. Iflar, President of the SLT Customer Club  Ratnapura.
Members of the SLT Customer Club  Ratnapura, the team of volunteers from Regional Telecom Office of Ratnapura and Corporate Relations Division of SLT with the support of the customers and people living in the area joined hands for this worthy cause in order to carry out reforestation in 5 acres of land in this area and contribute towards preserving our natural heritage for the future generations.
Through this reforestation project, the team expects to help build a protection buffer-zone, between the World heritage site, Sinharaja Forest Reserve and connected mountain forests. Natural water resources are becoming highly endangered. So we all as citizens of this country, need to act fast on this critical issue. Rohana Ellawala, General Manager (Corporate relations) of Sri Lanka Telecom expressing his views on this voluntary program said.
The ecosystems of the world heritage Sinharaja rain forest and connected mountain forests need to be protected and every citizen of Sri Lanka can be a part of it. It is important to understand that the Sinharaja rain forest is one of the most important forests in the world, and it has been recognized as such by the UN due to the diverse varieties of endemic and rare species of wildlife found at the rain forest.

## Title: Spend your free time meaningfully
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, June 22, 2018 - 01:00
Spend your free time meaningfully
How people spend their free time can actually have a big impact on their success in the professional world. Successful people tend to spend their free time in these ways so read below and find out why:
1. They Exercise
Physical exercise is important for both physical and mental health. Taking a half hour after work or on a weekend can get your blood pumping, get your endorphins flowing, and revitalize your spirit. You'll build muscle, burn calories, and oxygenate your brain--giving you a release after a day of stress. Exercising regularly also helps you remain disciplined, which can be valuable in a demanding work environment, and can reduce the long-term effects of stress as well--meaning regular exercisers tend to be less stressed about their jobs. You'll also look better and feel better, which gives you greater confidence.
2. They Read
Reading is a lifelong skill, and successful people never stop reading new books. Whether it's fiction or nonfiction, books help give you a greater understanding of the world around you.
They introduce you to new characters, new environments, new cultures, new philosophies, and new ideas, and might even help you build new skills (if you're reading nonfiction, at least). Similarly, reading regularly helps to build your vocabulary and your semantic comprehension, giving you greater communication skills--and something to make small talk about during those particularly awkward business meetings.
3. They Take Classes
Education shouldn't stop at college, and shouldn't be restricted to institutions. The most successful people in the world are the ones who make a commitment to never stop learning. They're always incorporating new skills for their resumes and learning new aspects of the world around them. Instructional courses aren't particularly difficult to find, either, especially in the modern era. Many local colleges offer courses for free, and you can peruse local forums or gatherings to find impromptu group workshops. And don't underestimate the value of free online courses. If you have a free hour and an Internet connection, you can start learning a new skill.
4. They Volunteer
Volunteering, no matter where or how you do it, is beneficial for you and your community. Whether you're helping to clean up a highway, working in a soup kitchen, or providing mentorship to a group of young professionals, your time goes a long way toward improving the community around you. Professionals primed for success realize the importance of giving back to the community, and feel happier because of it. Volunteering is also a valuable networking experience, introducing you to other people who, one way or another, can help you drive your career forward.
5. They Network
Many networking events exist outside the realm of corporate hours. They include weekend breakfasts, cocktail hours, and after-hours gatherings for conversation and usually food and drinks. Successful people are willing to step outside their comfort zones in an effort to meet new people--regardless of any professional circumstances surrounding that effort. They're not necessarily interested in meeting people to land new sales or find a new employee--instead, they simply like talking to people and meeting people, and success naturally follows them from there.
The wider your network of contacts is, the more opportunities you'll have down the road.6. They Have Hobbies. Focusing exclusively on work might seem like a fast track to success. With nothing else distracting you, you can funnel your full effort into your job and do in one week what would take most people two. But this approach has a nasty downside; it stresses you out, sets you up for burnout, and prevents you from developing skills in any other areas. Finding and pursuing a hobby, on the other hand, helps you relieve stress, put your job in perspective, and build skills that complement ones you use at work.

Super strong bodybuilding gran
This is 68-year-old former glamour model, Angela.
Shes a bodybuilding grandma who can lift her own weight, and she says that weedy men are always trying to chat her up because they want her to dominate them. Now a mental health nurse, Angela says that shes plagued by guys DMing her on Facebook.
I tend to find that the guys who are attracted to me, who follow me on Facebook, are the ones that want dominating, she says.
Silly little weedy men asking me: Could you lift me Could you pin me down Would you wrestle me What do your biceps measure
I think theyve got some kind of personality problem, but Im always polite, because I work in mental health and know there are a lot of people who live miserable existences and are not very well.
I think they look at me and see me as a goddess. And a kind word from me, if it makes their day, means Ive achieved something.
Despite having a hip replacement last year from arthritis, the mother-of-two is still able to lift 65kg.
Shes only just stopped pretending to be in her 40s.
I only recently stopped pretending to be 48, says Angela. Instead, I ask people to guess my age and, so far, no one has said anything over 52!
I look at people who I work with, who are in their 40s and they look like my parents, because theyve never worked out or modified their diet. Im proud of what Ive achieved and the way I look.
Angela says that shes seldom asked out these days, even though shes been engaged three times. She puts it down to coming across as intimidating.
I think men are strange creatures. Men stare, but Im very seldom asked out, because I think, fundamentally, they find my physique intimidating. I once asked some guys at the gym, just as a matter of curiosity, whether, if they saw me in a nightclub, they would come up and ask me out. They said, Hell no! Because you look intimidating and youre very confident.
Her gym journey began in the mid-70s, when womens bodybuilding started to take off. Up until that point, shed had a successful career as a glamour model, appearing in daily newspapers and working as a forces pin-up  a role that involved inspecting troops in nothing but a bikini.
Until the 1970s, Id never been in a gym, she explains.
People just didnt go to gyms in those days. But I was with a guy who started taking me. He used to buy a magazine called Muscle and Fitness and they did a feature on Lisa Lyon, an upcoming American bodybuilder. I looked at the picture and said, I want to look like her. He said, Youre dreaming. You havent got the commitment or the motivation or the discipline  and that was all the motivation I needed. Two years later, Angela started competing. By the mid-90s, shed won numerous competitions and at one point, held seven titles  including British champion.
Today, she no longer competes but Angela still trains for about 90 minutes most days and although guys might be intimidated by her body, women are quick to pay her compliments.
I was crossing the road a few days ago and a woman stopped me and said, I hope you dont think me rude, but your body is absolutely amazing. And I said, No, thats made my day!
And although shell be 70 next year, Angela doesnt see an end to her weightlifting coming any time soon. Ive had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands, but trained with my hand in a splint.
Ive gone to the gym on crutches, Ive gone in plaster and Ive always trained. Its a dedication.
Ill keep going as long as Ive got a pulse and can walk.

## Title: Trump orders halt to family separations

Trump orders halt to family separations
US: President Donald Trump ordered an end to the separation of migrant children from their parents on the US border Wednesday, reversing a tough policy under heavy pressure from his fellow Republicans, Democrats and the international community.
The spectacular about-face comes after more than 2,300 children were stripped from their parents and adult relatives after illegally crossing the border since May 5 and placed in tent camps and other facilities, with no way to contact their relatives.
Despite the order, there was no plan in place to reunite the thousands of children already separated from their families, according to multiple US media reports citing officials from the Health and Human Services Department (HHS).
Those youngsters would remain separated while their parents were under federal custody during immigration proceedings, according to The New York Times, before officials backed off those comments late Wednesday.
It is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter, said Brian Marriott, senior director of communications at HHS's Administration of Children and Families.
Reunification is always the ultimate goal, he said.
Pictures and accounts of the separations sparked outrage and a rebellion among Republicans in Trump's own party, as well as international accusation that the US was committing human rights violations.
What we have done today is we are keeping families together, Trump said as he signed the executive order. I didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated. At a later campaign-style rally of supporters in the northern state of Minnesota, he reiterated that the change does not mean a softening at the border.
We will keep families together, but the border is going to be just as tough, he said.
Trump then accused rival Democrats of putting illegal immigrants before they put American citizens. For weeks, Trump had insisted he was bound by law to split the children from their parents and that only Congress could resolve the problem -- before he radically shifted gears.
His daughter and advisor Ivanka had reportedly urged her father to end the separations, while First Lady Melania Trump made a rare political plea, saying the country needs to govern with heart. We want security for our country, the president said Wednesday. And we will have that -- at the same time, we have compassion. The order says the Department of Homeland Security -- and not the Justice and Health and Human Services Departments, as under previous policy -- would have continuing responsibility for the families.
It also suggests the government intends to hold the families indefinitely by challenging an existing statute, the 1997 Flores Settlement, that places a 20-day limit on how long children, alone or with their parents, can be detained.
That move could lead to new legal battles for the administration.
Trump said there was a need to sustain his zero tolerance policy to prevent crime, which he blames illegal immigrants for.
We still have to maintain toughness, or our country will be overrun by people, by crime, by all of the things that we don't stand for and we don't want, he said.
Earlier, as countries marked World Refugee Day Wednesday, global leaders assailed Trump for the separations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Council of Europe and Pope Francis all took issue with the zero tolerance policy.
May said images of migrant children kept in cage-like units were deeply disturbing, and the Council of Europe, a global human rights watchdog, said Trump had abdicated any claim to moral leadership in the world.
After a downturn last year, since October, the number of migrants seeking to cross the southwest US border from impoverished Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, as well as from Mexico, has surged.
From March to May this year, more than 50,000 people a month were apprehended for illegally crossing the border from Mexico.
With the legal system swamped, the Department of Defense on Wednesday said 21 military lawyers would be seconded to the Department of Justice for about six months to help prosecute misdemeanor improper entry and felony illegal reentry cases. Nearly all of the arriving families, and many others, have officially requested asylum, citing the incessant violence in their home countries.
The policy, with mandatory separation of children from adults, was announced May 7 as a deterrent.
The issue struck an emotional chord, with accounts of children screaming and crying in facilities prepared for them.
Gene Hamilton, a senior Justice Department official, said the executive order was a stopgap move and that Congress needs to pass new legislation to give the president more powers to fight illegal immigration.
Current laws including the Flores Settlement, he argued, simply encouraged people to enter the country with their children, expecting to be caught and then released into US society.
Democrats and Republicans had at least two bills crafted Wednesday to address broader immigration issues, but it was not clear if any had adequate support to pass.
But Democrats and rights groups were immediately critical of the plan to change the Flores Settlement.
The Flores Settlement prohibits the indefinite detention of children -- even with their families -- and any order to undermine this critical protection will be immediately challenged in court, said senior Democratic Senator Dick Durbin. - AFP

Welenda.com, online market place launched
Welenda.com, an online market place has been established allowing Sri Lankan businesses to reach international market with ease.
The e- market place is considered be a ground-breaking online business venture allowing Sri Lankan businesses and industries to break barriers and reach the international market, was launched in the US recently.
The online retail service which opens up a new avenue for Sri Lankan businesses and industries underscores the message that Sri Lanka is ready to make its presence felt in the international market.
It can also be described as the Sri Lankan version of Aliexpress, an online retail platform owned by Chinese firm Alibaba that is fast gaining popularity in key markets across the world.
The founder of the platform is Chamli Tennakoon, a Sri Lankan living in the US, who has wide-ranging experience in the fields of digital strategy and digital marketing.
It is true that online shopping is gaining momentum in the Sri Lankan market. But we saw a vacuum in the online shopping landscape in Sri Lanka as it did not offer a window of opportunity for local businesses to enter the international market. That as where we, Welenda.com, come into play, Tennakoon said.
Sri Lanka, we believe, has a lot to offer to the international market. At the same time, Sri Lanka is ready to conquer the global market, despite its size. Some Sri Lankan brands have already transcended our boundaries and become key global brands. We simply want to expand the horizons for Sri Lankan businesses, he added.
Welenda.com, Tennakoon says, guarantees the most reasonable prices for the products on offer.
Welenda backend AI can find the value range of any product that we list on the website, but still if a customer finds the same product at a lower price within 24 hours of purchasing, well refund the customer 100% of the difference, he added.
Thats what differentiates us from other e-commerce platforms. There are no hidden costs. That way we have ensured maximum benefits for those shopping on our platform, he added. Welenda.com will be functional from June 30 and Tennakoon says he has already drawn plans to further expand its services during the phase II development stage.

Psychiatry and the Media - Towards Better Communication:
Why words matter
Mental health is a vital component of our health. The World Health Organisation constitution states Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. A mentally healthy person is able to cope with normal stresses of life while working productively to make a contribution to the community. However the burden of mental disorders is growing across the globe with a significant impact on every aspect of human life and the society.
How do we foster social well-being with the assistance of the media was the focus at the 15th Annual Academic Sessions themed Psychiatry and the Media -Towards Better Communication held recently organised by Sri Lanka College of Psychiatrists.
Mental Turmoil
Sri Lanka College of Psychiatrists President and Faculty of Medicine Colombo University, Professor in Psychiatry, Raveen Hanwella shed light on the difference between mental ill health and mental disease, both at the individual as well as the community level.
The definitions of the two terms though related are conceptually different and the interventions suitable for mental ill health are not suitable for mental disease. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5 (DSM 5) published by the American Psychiatric Association is the most up to date manual that classifies mental diseases. In this book around 157 types of mental diseases are identified. A mental disease is an illness that affects the way people think, feel, behave or interact with others. There are three major mental diseases  depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia. The other common disorders include dementia and other anxiety disorders, Professor Hanwella said.
He explained that in medicine, there are three types of prevention, primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease even before it occurs. Next as the secondary prevention a psychiatrist will look at mitigating the impact of the disease that had already occurred. Then in tertiary prevention we try to soften the impact of the mental illness, Professor Hanwella said.
Unfortunately for most major psychiatric disorders, there are no known effective primary care interventions. We cannot prevent a person from developing a major depression, schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder. The best we can hope for is secondary prevention where we diagnose the disease at the earliest opportunity and start treatment followed by tertiary prevention to minimise the impact of the disease, Professor clarified.
He further said it is a common misunderstanding, that interventions effective in improving mental health will also be effective in the treatment of mental disease. Music therapy, art, yoga and meditation may improve mental health but they cannot be used as effective treatments for mental diseases. Treatment for mental disorders is to seek psychiatric assistance as early as possible. Unfortunately, patients who have a mental disease, perhaps due to stigma or lack of understanding, may seek alternative therapies with non-psychiatrists hoping for relief from their distress. This is a dangerous practice and should be discouraged, Professor Hanwella added.
Effective treatment
Elaborating more on mental illnesses Sri Lanka College of Psychiatrists President-elect and Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Kelaniya University, Shehan Williams said mental disorders has no single cause. Breaking of a love affair, domestic issues, studying too much cannot bring about mental illness. There are multiple causations for mental illnesses which includes genetic, biological, psychological, and environmental factors, he said.
Professor said these biochemical imbalances in the body or the brain identified as a mental illness can often be treated. With the availability of alcohol and substances we find lot of young people coming out with mental disorders. Neurological change paves way to mental disorders and these disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide. Untreated mental illness can cause severe emotional, behavioural and physical health problems, he explained.
He further said it is the responsibility of all people to shatter the stigma and seek assistance of psychiatrist to treat mental disorders. When diagnosed early and treated properly, many people fully recover from their mental illness and can effectively return to their normal activities, Professor Williams stated.
Childrens mental health
According to WHO, worldwide 10-20 per cent of children and adolescents experience mental disorders. Half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14 and three-quarters by mid-20s. Neuropsychiatric conditions are the leading cause of disability in young people in all regions. If untreated, these conditions severely influence childrens development, their educational attainments and their potential to live fulfilling and productive lives. Children with mental disorders face major challenges with stigma, isolation and discrimination, as well as lack of access to health care and education facilities, in violation of their fundamental human rights.
The World Health Organizations (WHO) Global Strategy for Womens, Childrens and Adolescents Health calls for the provision of nurturing care to all children. This means a stable, protective and emotionally supportive environment set up by parents and other caregivers that promote the childs good health and learning. Given the additional challenges that they experience, parents of children with developmental delays or disorders should be specifically supported in providing nurturing care within a whole family approach.
Consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Dr. Sudarshi Seneviratne explained that stigma in a child will be carried on with him to school, school van and peers. Children mostly experience development disorders which are treatable through behaviour therapy, parent training and family therapy. Medication will start only if necessary and they are not addictive, thus consulting a psychiatrist is nothing to be feared, she said.
She advised the parents to be responsible in letting children use social media. Addiction to social media has negative impacts on children. They face self esteem issues, difficulty in concentrating, social anxiety and irregular sleep patterns. These issues occur before addiction. Fortunately in Sri Lanka we dont see much addiction to substance but at present children are addicted to social media. Parents should be more responsible in handling the children, Dr. Seneviratne said.
Inadequate response
WHO says health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental disorders. As a consequence, the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide all over the world. In low- and middle-income countries, between 76 per cent and 85 per cent of people with mental disorders receive no treatment for their disorder. In high-income countries, between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of people with mental disorders are in the same situation.
The organisation points out the poor quality of care for many of those who do receive treatment as a compounding problem is. In addition to support from health-care services, people with mental illness require social support and care. They often need help in accessing educational programmes which fit their needs, and in finding employment and housing which enable them to live and be active in their local communities.
WHOs response
WHOs Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2013, recognizes the essential role of mental health in achieving health for all people. The plan includes four major objectives:
More effective leadership and governance for mental health;
The provision of comprehensive, integrated mental health and social care services in community-based settings;
The implementation of strategies for promotion and prevention; and
strengthened information systems, evidence and research.
Responsible reporting
Meanwhile, annual academic sessions also looked at how media should report on mental illnesses and suicide without creating a stigma, rejection and discrimination.
Senior Lecturer/ Honorary Consultant Psychiatrist and Head, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya University, Dr. Pabasari Ginige said media portrayal and reporting of mental illness are incredibly powerful in educating and influencing the public.
When reported well, media can be a tremendous tool to raise awareness, challenge attitudes, offer great insight and help dispel myths. However sensational journalism and overplaying risks, misery and chaos promote fear and mistrust and widens the gap between understanding facts and myth, she explained.
She added studies show a strong association between nonfictional media reporting on suicide and imitative suicidal behaviours. The greater the amount of suicides media covers, greater will be the chance of finding the imitation effect. Female suicides demonstrated more imitative effects while the younger and middle age groups are more vulnerable to imitate compared to the older age groups, she pointed out. Dr. Ginige encouraged the press to rethink and refine the way the mental health issues and suicides are covered. Journalist should choose the right language to describe people with mental health issues. Using inaccurate terms can reinforce stereotypes and stigma. Images used along with the report can also be just as damaging as the words or the headlines. Some images can be considered `triggering for people. Images that show how people self harm may lead to the imitation of self harming behaviour, she said.
Dr. Ginige advised media to be extra vigilant when using online sources for a suicide story as instantaneous and viral circulation of information are abundant online.
Sex and media
National Institute of Mental Health, Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr. Kapila Ranasinghe spoke on the issues in reporting sexual health and violence issues. Media coverage of human sexuality including sexual crimes has an impact on the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours of the public regarding these phenomena. Unfortunately, when it comes to sexual violence, mainstream media is guilty of promoting ideas and behaviours that sustain sexual violence prone culture. Violence with passion, portraying women as sex objects or suggesting that sex drive is an out of control force is problematic. Sexual violence is often treated with humour in media and it diverts the respect or attention that should be given to the incident, he explained.
Dr. Ranasinghe said that predominant ideas about sexual violence are incorrect. He said a common belief is that if a woman is wearing provocative clothing, then she is partly responsible if she is sexually assaulted. It is a vicious cycle when we believe myths. We blame survivors and arent holding perpetrators accountable, and then we reinforce a status quo. Survivor is a term for an individual who has experienced an act of sexual violence. This could mean any form of sexual assault, stalking or sexual harassment. The word survivor is often used in place of `victim in order to empower those affected by it, he pointed out.
Finally Dr. Ranasinghe said that media needs self discipline. I believe we have a professional obligation to assess, the best we can, the vulnerability of individuals as we write stories about the most painful and difficult elements of their lives. As journalists you write the story and move on but those who are connected to the story will be forever connected. So we have a duty to show great care and concern, he concluded.
District General Hospital, Chilaw, Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr. Prabath Wickrema and Peradeniya University, Professor of Psychiatry and Consultant Psychiatrist Thilini Rajapakse also conducted a practical session on reporting suicide.
Ultimately, there is a great opportunity for media to better educate and inform the public about mental health issues which has traditionally been neglected and side-stepped. It is important to do research. Communicate with people impacted by mental health problems. Follow the reporting guidelines, particularly on the more sensitive subjects of suicide and self-harm. Then it is hoped that the myths, misconceptions and misreporting of mental illness will be replaced with a more educated public that feels more confident in talking about their own mental health.

Wildlife fails, angry mob kills leopard  in Kilinochchi
A group of villagers captured and killed a leopard after it had reportedly attacked and injured nearly10 people at Ambakulam, Kilinochchi yesterday.
Our reporters said villagers had informed Wildlife Officers after the leopard had attacked several people earlier and efforts to capture it had failed previously.
It is said that the leopard had attacked and injured a man looking after cattle yesterday after which the villagers had again informed the Wildlife Officers.
However villagers had later begun a hunt for the leopard which had attacked one of the hunting group prompting a retaliation which ended with villagers killing the leopard.
Several people had been admitted to Kilinochchi hospital with injuries which according to Police had been sustained due to the leopard attack .
A video of men killing the leopard went viral on social media which prompted condemnation by animal welfare activists with a question mark on the role played by the Wildlife officers whom according to our reporters were lethargic and late on acting on the complaints of the villagers.
