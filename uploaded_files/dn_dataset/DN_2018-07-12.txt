Polythene food wrapping sheet produced defying ban
Some parties continue to manufacture polythene food wrapping sheets using high density polythene (HDPE) resin defying the ban, said Plastic Pakaging Pte Ltd, Chairman Mervyn Dias
Speaking to Daily News Business he said the Central Environment Authority (CEA) should control the import of HDPE resin and crack down on manufacturers who defy the law and still produce food wrapping papers with HDPE resin.
Dias said food wrapping sheets which are produced with HDPE resin take over 500 years to degrade and cause heavy damages to living beings including fauna and flora. This is in contrast to biodegradable and compostable products which get composted within 180 days. He said bags and food wrapping sheets that are manufactured with HDPE resin was banned from September last year and was strictly enforced from January this year.
Chairman Dias said his 30 year old company manufactured food wrapping sheet and bags with the approval of the Central Environmental Authority which conform to the EU standard EN 13432 and they also exports the products to UK and France and the international certification is a must to export compostable bags.
He further said even the CEA has requested all polythene resin importers to be registered with them in order to stop manufacturing food wrapping sheets with HDPE resin.Meanwhile CEA, Waste Management Unit, Director Ajith Weerasundara said CEA officials are engaged in frequent raids on traders, hoteliers, grocery shops, pharmacies, restaurants to see who defy the law by keeping polythene wrapping papers in their possession.

President to sign  execution warrants
President Maithripala Sirisena said he will use his powers to place his signature to execute the death sentence on traffickers sentenced to death for drug offences.
This will be enforced on convicts who continue to operate the drug racket from their prison cells.
Although there are conflicting views about the death sentence in our Buddhist society in particular, if a society which listened and preached an overdose of religious discourses is going on the wrong direction, timely decisions should be taken to bring this menace under control, the President said.
The President said this participating in the inaugural ceremony of the Mathata Erehiwa Pasalen Javayak (thrust against drugs from the school) programme held at the Getambe playground in Kandy last morning.
This programme is conducted countrywide jointly by the Education Ministry and the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention concurrent to the National Drug Control Programme.
The President said whatever opponents said there had been a drastic reduction in crime and women abuse in the country during the last three and a half years. Referring to the crime statistics report for the last 10 years since 2008 submitted to the National Security Council yesterday, the President said bogus and cooked up reports in certain sections of the media about an increase in crime since the advent of this government were being used and dangled by certain sections to achieve petty political gain.
Drugs and certain social websites had been a main factor contributing towards an increase in killings and sexual abuse of women.
The government as well as parents should devote their main attention towards protecting children from this situation. During the programme aimed to build a good country free of liquor and drugs, an awareness should be made among schoolchildren to make them the prime messengers in society. The President also distributed awards and mementos among state officials who made a special contribution towards the National Drug Prevention programme in appreciation of the services rendered by them. The President also handed over a Rs 2 million grant to Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake as a contribution towards the Peradeniya University Medical Faculty Oral Cancer Unit.
Ministers Lakshmen Kiriella and Lucky Jayawardena, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, MPs Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, Bandula Yalegama and politicians of different hues and other officials were also present on the occasion.

Ramp-blazer!
He believes in controlling ones own destiny and that life is for living. The youth who is vying to become a successful entrepreneur has made his mark in the UK fashion scene and had worked with many renowned designers there and abroad. He also has walked the ramp and posed for the shutterbugs for renowned fashion brands like Next, Debenhams, Ray Ban and New Look.
You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make it drink. Others can show you the way but it is up to you to tread that path. This has been the motto I have strived to live by both in my professional as well as personal life, says Prabuddha Rangana Thilakawardane.
A past pupil of Kirindivita Gemunu Junior College and Bandaranayake Vidyalaya, Gampaha, Prabuddha won the Model Search 2013 title while he was studying in Cambridge, UK. This turned a new page in his modeling career and opened doors to new and wider opportunities. He also got the chance to expand his horizons.
I was the only Asian among the contestants and I felt proud to represent Sri Lanka there. Topping the male model category in the event gave me the opportunity to establish contacts with the experts in the UK fashion scene and drew many projects my way, he enthused adding that the female model category winner of the competition became one of his close allies. She became Miss England for Miss Universe 2014 and was ranked among the top five finalists at Miss Universe 2014.
He notes that it was the glamour and the wow factor behind modeling which drew him to the field. His entrance to the subject had happened out of the blue after he was motivated to apply for the pageant which was held to choose a male face to represent the Swedish cosmetics brand Oriflame. He became the winner of Oriflame Male Face of the Year 2010. This was his first break.
The industry excited me. After I won the Model Search pageant I was faced with the prospect of moving to London to start a career as a professional model. I was at a crossroad because I was keen to follow my studies as well as interested in taking advantage of this golden opportunity. Since I was able to establish a good network with the top professionals in the industry I was able to remain in Cambridge and continue my studies while taking part in fashion shows staged in the region and in London. This was an enlightening experience as it highlighted the differences in culture and how it was expressed through fashion, he said.
On the flip side its one world where the male is in minority. They are paid much less than their female contemporaries. Still the charm is irresistible.
Today we live in a society that appreciates fashion regardless of gender identity. If you have the right characteristics and are dedicated and ambitious you can make a difference. The industry has progressed a lot in the past five years and new up and coming designers are pushing the boundaries of male fashion and modeling. Male models are making a big impact on the fashion market. We are living in an exciting time for menswear. I look forward to what is to come, he opined.
Behind the so-called frivolous form there is sweat and toil. Prabuddha explains that becoming a successful male model is no easy accomplishment. He got his initial training from Brain Kerkoven. Rozanne Diaz, Dinesh Chandrasena, Senaka de Silva and Lou Ching Wong too have been giving words of wisdom to the budding young model.
Ramp modeling is finely choreographed. But in one show I forgot what the choreographer taught me and made an error. I tried to hide my mistake as smoothly and professional as I can. I hope I had not offended the choreographer who worked really hard on the routine! he elaborated on one of his experiences on the runway.
Being a part of the fashion industry can be very pressurizing too. Prabuddha advises those who are wishing to follow a career in modeling to be true to oneself and to belive that one can succeed.
You will always come across challenges in life but it is how you deal with them that will shape you as a person. Allow your personality to shine through and dont let others put you down. Achieve your dreams and most importantly  enjoy your life, he mused.
Prabuddha hails from Katugasthara, Gampaha. His parents are Micheal Thilakawardane and Rupa Malani Thilakawardane. He has one sibling, Lasith Thilakawardane. His style icons are Bradley Cooper, Hrithik Roshan, and Aamir Khan because they are good role models both in their careers as well as in their fashion sense. He also loves Latin Style dancing, especially Bachata and Salsa.
He wishes to help youth who come from modest backgrounds to follow their dreams in providing them with the necessary training and support in the future. He aspired to become a responsible role model for them.
Always believe in yourself and follow your passion. You too will find an opportunity even if it isnt planned just like I did. Life is full of opportunities and you need to be brave enough to grasp them. Simply put in 100 percent of your energy and effort into whatever you do. That is the key to success, he pointed out.
He is currently involved in some projects. He needs to concentrate on his physique to tailor it to fit the needs of a specific assignment.
You need to meet such demands. I am very excitied about my upcoming venture and hopefully you will be able to read about it soon in the newspapers, he added with a mischievous wink.

Rolling out the red and high performance realities for Sri Lanka
As the crow flies, this month of the all conquering Roman Emperor Julius Caesar...has seen its fair share of decisive victories and plenty of changes that Sri Lanka Rugby need to absorb and evolve.
Life on planet rugby and in Sri paradise is finally starting to look the part and hopefully a decent platform to leap boldly where no Sri islanders have done.
Decisive, specifics and ambition need to thrust our game forward and upwards.
We must conscientiously muscle our to better status in Asia, with our rugby hearts and sights ...on bigger, better, faster, more competitive, and more lucrative for our stakeholders.
This global hub and Olympic discipline is rocket friendly and well on its countdown to launch.
We need our most capable and astute administrators to set our sights, not just on a better footing ...but definitely on stronger results, upgrades and a leap up the rankings.
Sri rugby has to aim to be a dominant force in Asia and command more respect up at the top.
As we speak ...current rights to most rugby Asian is Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, UAE, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore etc ..
This is where we need the game to team up and upgrade.
Over the next 3years here are some likely opportunity and evolutionary factors.
Junior rugby age grade must be our major development push.
U17, U18, U19, U20...re evaluation and clarity in how we dominate all formats, both boys and girls 7s and 15s.
Not an impossible task by any stretch and practically achievable with a few basic performance upgrades.
A fresh look at results over the last 5 years in Asia, will stand up with much volume and relevance.
The president, executive committee, CEO, executive director and life members, need to get a strategic team set up for the skirmish ahead.
Priyantha Ekanayake, Rohan Gunaratne need to sit with Asanga Seneviratne, and the incoming Lasitha Gunaratne ...plus our rugby stalwarts age grade rugby and honorary life members...to get this 3-year battle launched.
Priority number 1 is that it is unanimous that we mark our ambition and set out to achieve it ....so that in 2021, Sri is the biggest contender and most consistent union at junior rugby in Asia.
For those troubled by the ambition, consider this ...Asia wide
We are top 5 in U19 15s side, Top 3 in U19 7s, Top 1 in U17 7s, and Top 8 in U 16 7s.
Seniors men & women
15s men top 7Asia, 15s women...New development, 7s men top 3 Asia and 7s women top 6.
This is our current status and no rocket science theory as to how we dominate Asia.
All juniors definitely in the bag by 2020.
All senior rugby ...with the exception of the 15s which has been significantly owned and jealously guarded by Japan, and unlikely successors from China, Korea, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka or Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore or Kazakhstan for the impressive world league anytime soon.
But for 7s ...it is definitely on the radar to embrace this title by 2020.
Womens 7s needs a full mind and muscle skills plus pace upgrade to elevate them to top 2 and fierce contenders for sure by 2020. Just in case you are an expert and slightly perplexed...worried on 4 Jul 2018 wrote: Sri islanders rugby & the happy beyond
Happy are those who instinctively know....
It is a brave rugby heart that would give Sri Lankan hopes that ultimate step up to world cup status and rank us among the rugby elite ...
This globally fascinating discipline has little time or quarter for amateurs and hesitant islanders, who are unable to clear their lines.
Sri Lanka Rugby ..formally the Ceylon Rugby Football Union, then the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union....history, pride, respect, courage and a potent recurring dream to be counted and considered among the greatest rugby nations.
On that perfect pass, our 7s team, led by the hardworking Muthuthanthri ...are currently in Paris for an extended experience tour. The Sri union finally able to get on board and some practical game time for the squad to absorb pressure and mature under different conditions.
Worried that we are dreaming too big ....dont be.
Rugby is well set in Sri paradise, and has a remarkable following especially at school and national level.
Of course obvious upgrades and matter of professionals is soon to be set in stone ...the game has evolved, the players starting to see a means of a career and survival as a pro rugby player.
This is perhaps the most competitive and exciting times for the game and its player base in Sri Lanka....Carlton international rugby gave life to the international world format 7s that captured the imagination of the global 7s phenomenon. Now we stand on the brink of the next frontier for Sri Lanka Rugby....that frontier and pioneering skills will defiantly be for 7s and more so as an Olympic discipline., our fastest and most realistic pathway to greatness and world status.
Big big hand to St Peters and management for the Milo Knockouts trophy and big hand to fellow rivals St Josephs for grabbing more glory and the Singer 7s champions Cup with a statement win over favorites Royal in the final.
Much credit to all teams, backroom staff and the support for inspiration, motivation and volume wherever it mattered.
The players must be still tasting that fabulous joy of endorphins while they float for a while.
Grand indeed for the ok boys rugby set ups that support the game at all levels..its beyond fantastic how much is done to keep the ship afloat.
May it grow in stature and give these young developing minds and skills a lasting memory as they graduate to club and bigger.
Finally for all rugby hearts in paradise, I need Papare.com, Ganeesha David to specifically assign your best photographer to capture both Rev Father Rectors from Peters and Joes...smiling broadly ...and undoubtedly, the Saints marching in!
Bula bula the sheer euphoric joy of islanders rugby this month of Julius.
Cheers.

S. Asian nations should strengthen cooperation - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, said that Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries should strengthen regional cooperation. He also called for collaboration between Parliaments to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
Speaker Jayasuriya was speaking at the inauguration of South Asian Speakers Summit in Colombo, yesterday.
The SDGs are an opportunity for South Asian Parliamentarians to demonstrate our commitment to improving the lives of people and the health of the planet on which all human existence depends, said Jayasuriya, who also served as the Minister of Power and Energy from 2001 to 2004.
The Speaker also called for a sustained effort on behalf of all participants in the Summit to fulfill the objectives of the Indore Declaration.
Following up on the initiatives of the second South Asian Speakers Summit in Indore, India and the first summit in Dhaka in Bangladesh, Jayasuriya enumerated the highs and lows of Sri Lankas efforts to fulfill the promises of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as agreed upon in Dhaka and the subsequent Indore Declaration.
He cited the establishment of a Parliamentary Select Committee for Sustainable Development and the enactment of the Sustainable Development Act No. 19 of 2017, as key achievements in Sri Lankas initiative to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda.
The Indore Declaration calls for poverty eradication, gender equality, climate change and disaster management and regional connectivity, among other, more nuanced goals.
Accordingly, Jayasuriya highlighted the surprising post-tsunami decline in the national poverty rate from 15.2% in 2006 to 4.1% in 2017. He also mentioned Sri Lankas near gender parity on educational measures and notable improvements in physical infrastructure connectivity across the island.
Jayasuriya brought up Sri Lankas gender inequality in political representation and high child poverty rate, which exceeds the national average. And, he added that the challenges of climate change are escalating, as evinced by the increased frequency and heightened intensity of natural disasters on the island.
Calling the SDGs, a robust framework around which Parliaments could base their strategic plans and pursue their oversight and accountability work, Jayasuriya stressed the strategic importance of SDGs, but emphasized that such high-reaching goals could not be achieved by the government alone.
A whole of society approach, is important to attain this very ambitious agenda, he said, all actors have an equal stake to participate in SDG implementation.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Inter Parliamentary Union President

Sadness as Belgiums golden generation exit World Cup
BRUSSELS, Belgium, Tuesday: Belgiums defeat by France in their World Cup semi-final produced mixed feelings of sadness, gratitude and pride from fans at home on Tuesday, who bemoaned a missed opportunity for their golden generation.
A second-half header from Samuel Umtiti in Saint Petersburg gave France a 1-0 win, earning them a place in Sundays final in Moscow against either England or Croatia. Thousands of crestfallen fans walked away quickly after the final whistle sounded on a giant screen in the town of Waterloo, south of the Belgian capital Brussels.
Were very disappointed, 27-year-old Alice Cordier told AFP in Waterloo, where French emperor Napoleon was defeated by a mix of European forces in a huge battle in 1815.
Its really too bad to lose to France, Belgiums national bad luck, she added. But we are still proud to be Belgian.
Some echoed the love-hate relationship and inferiority complex many French-speaking Walons have with their bigger neighbour France.
We will hear it spoken about for one hundred years, 26-year-old supporter Stephanie Smeets said. The French will take the mickey out of us.
French speakers, who share a country with Dutch and German speakers, are particularly sensitive to what they see as Frances condescending attitude toward them.
Its only the second time in history that Belgium have reached the World Cup semi-finals, 32 years after Diego Maradonas Argentina beat them at the same stage in Mexico in 1986 before going on to win the title.
France won the World Cup in 1998 and are now in their third final.
But Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was full of praise for the Red Devils.
Bravo @BelRedDevils for your performance and having thrilled us until the semi-final, Michel tweeted.
HARSH LOGIC
For many observers, this generation of talented players including Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne, Vincent Kompany and others had a real chance to come home victorious.
Regrets are eternal. It will not be our day of glory on this 10 July, a presenter of Belgiums French-language RTBF television station said after the final whistle.But he thanked the team.
Thanks for having allowed, thanks to football, to forget everything a bit and enjoy moments of pleasure.
Analysts have also praised the multicultural team, including those whose parents are Congolese and Moroccan immigrants, for helping to unite a country split by political tensions over the Dutch and French language.
In Brussels, the national colours -- black, yellow and red -- were draped over cars, balconies and cafes that showed the match on television. In one cafe, Mathieu Geslan, a 32-year-old French baker who has lived in Brussels for nine years, wore Belgiums red jersey to watch the match with his Belgian partner Aurore Szabo.
The French have won once the World Cup. So why not have the Belgians win this time he said at half-time when the score was still 0-0. After the match, there was plenty of analysis of what went wrong.
The Belgians did not manage the last half hour well, 79-year-old Jean Dhave said in the Brussels suburb of Uccle.
We are sad but it is deserved, said Dhave, a manager of a tennis club who organised a special evening for the match. He said that key men De Bruyne and Hazard were not on form. Belgian comedian Benoit Poelvoorde had predicted a 1-0 France victory in newspaper Le Soir.
I think our team will lose Tuesday evening because it has every chance of winning. Thats the harsh logic, he said.  AFP

Quimper, Wednesday: Slovakia's Peter Sagan clinched his second stage win of the 2018 Tour de France on Wednesday, beating Sonny Colbrelli and Philippe Gilbert at the uphill finish of stage five.
Defending champion Chris Froome (Team Sky) and the other overall contenders finished in or close to the main group as overnight leader and Olympic road race champion Greg van Avermaet (BMC) retained the yellow jersey.
Belgian Philippe Gilbert sparked the hostilities early on the uphill finish of the 204.5 km ride from Lorient, but the Quick Step rider failed to open up a significant gap on the chasing bunch.
Van Avermaet, wearing the yellow jersey, then pulled to the front in a bid for the stage win as the finish line approached but peaked too early.
The race leader was left powerless when Sagan sped past on his left. Colbrelli pushed the Slovakian all the way but, as he did on stage two, finished second best to Sagan.
Sagan said following the yellow jersey had helped land him the stage.
"I'd like to thank Greg (van Avermaet) because he did me a favour when he went for it, I don't know if he did it on purpose but he dropped a lot of people," said Sagan, who has tightened his grip on the points classification's green jersey.
Asked if it would be a battle all the way to Paris with Fernando Gaviria for the green jersey prize, Sagan said: "I hope not!"
The pair have two stage wins each from the first five and Sagan had predicted Tuesday the Colombian might struggle with the climbs.
"The fact he wasn't in the sprint was good for me," Sagan said. AFP

Lanka up against worlds best fast bowlers
Series will be won or lost in the batting department  Du Plessis
GALLE, Wednesday: There was a time when there was an air of invincibility about the Sri Lanka cricket team when they played Test matches at home. They were virtually unbeatable on home soil for since winning the World Cup in 1996 till 2014 they lost only six Test series at home out of 37.
But since 2014 that form has dipped to the extent that Sri Lanka has been struggling to beat opposing sides even under home conditions and dry turning pitches. They have lost series to South Africa, Pakistan, India (twice) and suffered their first Test loss to Bangladesh in a drawn series.
When current head coach Chandika Hathurusingha took charge one of his main objectives is to ensure that Sri Lanka did not lose at home.
Whether Hathurusingha will be able to guide the destiny of Sri Lanka in the two-Test series against South Africa starting at Galle International Stadium today remains to be seen (with an ICC minimum two-match suspension hanging above his head).
If at all Hathurusingha goes unpunished this will be the first Test series he will be in charge of at home. The Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series was his first at home.
With Sri Lanka still struggling to come to terms since losing some of their legendary cricketers in the past four years or so, facing upto the no. 2 ranked Test side South Africa with their battery of pacemen is no easy task whether playing at home or abroad.
As South African captain Faf du Plessis said at the pre-match conference yesterday: We certainly still believe that our three seamers can get wickets on a dry pitch. The ball will reverse swing if its dry. And with pace reverse swing is always a factor. The decision will lie on whether we want to play a second spinner or an extra batsmen.
Test matches get won based on your bowling department, and your ability to get 20 wickets. Weve been extremely lucky to have a great pace attack. Even with Keshav Maharaj coming into the Test team last year, hes been an exceptional bowler for us. I do feel within our bowling attack that we do have the ability to get 20 wickets on whatever the surface is, Du Plessis said.
This series will be one where the batters need to stand up from both teams. Sri Lanka is in the same boat. Theyve got very good spinners and theyll sit there thinking theyve got the ability to get 20 wickets as well. Thats where youll see the series won or lost - in the batting department.
STEYN ON VERGE OF RECORD
The Proteas premier bowler Dale Steyn is certain to return to the Test side after injury forming an alliance with the world no. 1 ranked Test bowler Kagiso Rabada and no. 4 ranked Vernon Philander. Steyn is on the brink of becoming his countrys leading Test wicket taker requiring just three wickets to go past current holder Shaun Pollock. Steyn has 419 wickets from 86 Tests to Pollocks 421 from 108.
According to his captain Du Plessis, Steyn has the best record amongst fast bowlers in the subcontinent. In Asia alone Steyn has an impressive record with 90 wickets (avg. 22.66) from 20 Tests with a strike rate of 40.4. On the last tour to Sri Lanka in 2014 he took 13 wickets (avg. 17.46) to help South Africa win the two-Test series 1-0.
Dales x-factor is how he picks up wickets with a reverse-swinging ball. His way of getting wickets with the new ball is getting it to move around a little bit with swing, and a little bit of seam, really consistently, said Du Plessis. But theres a period of the game Dale gets his tail up. He gets one wicket, and is up there with the most dangerous bowlers in the world, because he is so skilful, and he can get the ball to reverse swing at pace.
Im hoping to see Dale bowl really quick again. He hasnt bowled for a long time, so hell be excited to get the opportunity again. Its a good sight to see when he gets the ball reversing, and hes running in and keeping those legs really fast.
THE THREAT OF MAHARAJ
Let alone the pacies Sri Lanka will also be confronted by the left-arm spin of Keshav Maharaj whom South Africa didnt want to expose in the two-day warm-up game. However in his absence another little known spinner Tabraiz Shamsi pressed his claims with five wickets for 45 against a Board XI bowling slow left-arm chinaman. Maharaj has proved an ideal foil to the pacemen and figured in many match winning displays for his country.
Kesh bowls the majority of his Test overs on flat wickets - wickets that dont assist him at all, with spin. Hes already up there in terms of rankings from a spinners point of view, said Du Plessis. The thing with Kesh is that he gives you control. The best spinners in the world have got a huge strength in control. Keshs control is already there - we know that. Now hes got pitches that offer him that turn. So Im expecting a good tour for him. Hes a guy that works really hard. And guys like that generally get the reward.
Since the departures of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, Lankan batsmen of late has struggled against spin and Maharaj is going to be quite a handful if Sri Lanka resort to preparing turners.
With so much rain around the country the chances of the Lankan spinners headed by veteran Rangana Herath getting a dry wicket to trouble the South African batsmen is unlikely with the pitch being covered constantly. Sri Lanka despite their recent success in the West Indies with their pacemen will probably resort to spin here with not more than two quicks likely to make the final 11. They are certain to play two spinners with off spinner Dilruwan Perera also in the frame. Whatever bowling combinations that Sri Lanka will come up with will be of no use unless their batsmen put the runs on the board.

Sinharaja jumbos to stay put
Cabinet approval was granted this week to establish an Elephant Retention Centre in Dippin Estate, Kalawana, Ratnapura for the two elephants living in the Sinharaja Reserve.
The Wildlife and Sustainable Development and Regional Development Ministry had proposed that 36 hectares of land be acquired for this purpose.
The land will be in the Parugala area (Dolekanda Grama Niladhari Division) in the Dippin Estate. This land currently belongs to the Hapugastota Estate and the government would pay a sum dictated by the Government Valuation Department to take it over.
There was wide public protest including opposition from UNESCO who had declared Sinharaja as a World Heritage Site, when the Ministry had proposed moving the two elephants to the Wildlife Retention Centre in Horowpathana. Environmentalists had pointed out that the elephants used to cooler climes would not survive in such a hot environment. The President intervened to suspend the relocation.
The Wildlife and Sustainable Development and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka however stressed in his Cabinet paper that the elephants had been causing severe damage to crops, property and livestock of the people in surrounding areas, and the resulting conflict had led to the death of a villager in Kajuwatte.
At a meeting held on June 19, 2018 villagers had requested that the elephants be removed from the area.
In 1940, there were 18 elephants in the Sinharaja area but by 1980 this number had gradually decreased to three. One of them disappeared in 2007. Both natural and human causes have led to this decline.
Since1998, 15 persons had been killed as a result of elephant attacks in the areas closer to Sinharaja, with 20 vehicles damaged. Severe damages have also been reported to property, crops and several animals like cattle and goats had also been killed by the elephants.
If they are not moved, the people may take action on their own. And it is our responsibility to protect the elephants, the Cabinet paper on the matter said.

SLFP has lost its identity - NP Governor
For the first time in its 65-year-long history, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) faces political turmoil and the obligation of all party members is to restore the party to the position it previously held, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray stated in Ambalangoda.
The Governor was speaking at the reorganising convention of the SLFP Ambalangoda Bala Mandala on Sunday.
Today, we have launched the reorganising programme of the party islandwide in a context of political, economic and social transformation. Political hassles are evident in every aspect of society. The government is overwhelmed with political disputes. Every party manifests political crisis. Those who came to power chanting the mantra of yahapalana have become the kingpins of corruption, deceit and fraud, Cooray said.
At every election, every party pledges to free the country of such political, economic and social evils. However, after coming into power, they simply ignore their election pledges and instead protect the corrupt people who exploit the national wealth. Hence corruption, deceit and fraud prevail as usual with no interruption, Cooray said.
Only the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike initiated firm action against corruption. He expelled five Cabinet ministers of his government as they were proved to be guilty of corruption following the findings of the Thalagodapitiya Special Commission of Inquiry. After SWRD, no leader of the country could take any action against any corrupt politician.
Cooray said that during the recent past, the SLFP was dominated by opportunistic crossovers of UNPers. Those who joined the SLFP in the guise of strengthening the hand of the then President held the all prominent Cabinet portfolios while the strong party leaders who dedicated their lives to the progress of the party had to be content with negligible positions in the government. However, those opportunists who joined the party during the era that it thrived left it at the time of its adversity.
Our party gradually moved away from its original political mission and vision. The SLFPs political approach is quite different to that of the UNP. The SLFP always advocated a philosophy which aligned neither to capitalism nor to socialism. We always took the middle road in politics. The present party reorganisation should be carried out in a manner that re-establishes a truthful and practical political philosophy.
Now the party is completely reorganised. All opportunists have left the party. We have to reorganise the party following the genuine middle-path political vision of our founder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Cooray said.
State Minister Piyasena Gamage, Deputy Minister Nishantha Mutuhettigamage and Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva also spoke.

The main objective of the Ministry is to assist the government to reach its development goals.
Under these objectives, it has been planned to obtain US$ 25 billion annually from exports and create one million job opportunities by 2025 through import-substitution policies. The development of a national policy for primary industries is important to boost the export sector.
The initial conceptual framework of the national policy has already been developed, he said.
Speaking on the measures to minimise crime, the Minister said that it has been identified that drug trafficking, especially heroin trafficking, is the main cause for underworld activities. It is necessary to eradicate drug trafficking to minimise underworld activities.

Stability of the economy to improve - First Capital
With stable interest rates and low inflation, First Capital Holdings PLC Research says that the stability of the economy would further improve during 2018.
The stable environment is expected to slowly improve business confidence and consumer demand towards 2H2018. We believe business confidence and consumer demand are currently below average and they are expected to normalize during the period.
Head of Research, First Capital Dimantha Mathew in their monthly economic review adds that they expect Market returns to be stronger despite slower earnings growth outlook of 5-7%.
Healthy valuations may warrant a rerating of the market providing returns of 13% market return over the next 6 months while targeting 15% return for 2019E supported by accelerating earnings growth to 10-12%
Banking rates which has a 6-month lag effect to Government securities are likely experience less volatility over the next 12 months.
Dollar index is expected to remain strong over the next 12 months while with continued reforms inflows into Sri Lanka debt and equity capital markets are likely with the attractive yields. Further Sri Lanka moves into the peak season of exports Sep-Mar. We expect more stability in the rupee in 2H2018, but downgrade our target to LKR161.
We expect the yield curve in Government securities to peak during 3Q in 2018, and register a slow downtrend. Despite having some pressure in 1Q2019 it is not expected to be as high as 3Q2018. Thereby, from bearishness at the start of 2018, we are now bullish on bonds beyond 3Q2018.
We believe 1Y, 5Y & 10Y trade within the bands of 9.0%-10.0%, 10.0%-11.0% & 10.5%-11.5%. However, it should also be noted that any breakaway from reform program (Deviations affecting IMF program) or political deadlock may result in breaking the upper bands of the tenors.
First Capital Research expected the yield curve to be upward trending 1Q-3Q2018 with acceleration in the uptrend towards 3Q amidst bunching of debt maturities during 3Q2018.
Following the USD 2.5Bn sovereign bond some stability was seen during Apr 2018. However, business confidence dropped to a 70-month low in Apr 2018.
Contrary to the prevailing uptrend in yields, compared to other tenors, the shorter tenors registered a continuous dip in yields with investors expecting a further rise in the overall yield curve.
Stronger macro fundamentals, higher investments and pickup in consumer demand is likely to increase growth in 2019 end to 5.0%.

The ministry needs good workers who are ready to listen to the people and give an honest service to them. If the workers do not act accordingly and do not care for the needs of the people, they will have to be transferred. Our prime aim should be to provide quality service to the people, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera on Monday.
The minister was speaking at a seminar for deputy and assistant labour commissioners at the Labour Department.
Speaking about the difficulties faced by estate workers who come to the Labour Ministry or Labour Department, the minister said that a mobile service to aid the public will be launched in the near future with the assistance of the Central Bank.
He said the Asian Development Bank had already warned the country about the repercussions of offering the pension benefit. The bank indicates that countries which provide pensions will be unable to carry on even for the next 25 years, with the increase in the retirement-age population.
We need to search for other options before its too late and we already have started discussions with trade unions. But the unions have a pessimistic view about the other options, the Minister said.
Labour Secretary Nimal Saranatissa and Labour Commissioner A. Wimalaweera also participated in the event.

Olympic medalist, Sports Ministry consultant and Director of the Sugathadasa Sports Complex, Susanthika Jayasinghe whilst thanking Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha to make use of yesteryear champion athletes knowledge and experience for the betterment of the future of Lankan athletics, showered praise on another former Sports Minister late VA Sugathadasa.
Today is a special day as we celebrate the birth of V. A. Sugathadasa which fell on July 10. If not for him we would not have such a sports facility to train and compete. There were many leaders and politicians in this country, but we only have a one international level sports facility, said Susanthika at the Sugathadasa Sports Complex during the commemoration ceremony held for late V. A. Sugathadasa who donated the Sugathadasa Stadium to the nation.
I am telling it as a person who has engaged in sports for over 20 years and as a sports administrator. Because of this stadium I have been able to win four international victories. It is Mr. Sugathadasa who started this ground in a small way and elevated it to international level. He has been a good example to all who serve Sri Lankan sports. Sugathadasa pioneered the Nationalized Services sports with 150 officials and supported the government to uplift sports which has paved the foundation for many victories later, she said.
Susanthika also acknowledged the support given by the former President Ranasinghe Premadasa in developing the Sugathadasa Sports Stadium.
I hope the present administration at Sugathadasa Stadium will work hard to fulfill the aspirations of late Mr. Sugathadasa who wanted to bring hidden talent to national and international level. With the correct directions of Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa, I am confident that we can render a better service to Sri Lankan sports, she concluded.

Thais rejoice
THAILAND: Thailand celebrated the successful mission to free 12 boys and their football coach from a cave Wednesday, with the nation heaping praise on the rescue team as the triumphant tagline Hooyah pinballed across social media.
The nerve-shredding three-day mission ended on Tuesday with the final group of four boys and the coach emerging from the cave which had held them captive for 18 days.
The rescue received blanket coverage in Thai media with newspapers The Nation running a Hooyah! Mission accomplished and the Bangkok Post emblazoned with All Wild Boars saved.
Despite spending days in the dark, dank cave health officials said the boys - who are aged 11 to 16 - are in good physical and mental health.
It might be because they were all together as a team, helping each other out, Thongchai Lertwilairattanapong, Inspector General of the Public Health Ministry told reporters, singling out their 25-year-old coach for keeping their spirits high.
The group remain in quarantine in Chiang Rai hospital where one of the last batch of people to leave the cave has minor pneumonia, he said.
Some of the first boys to be freed have been able to see their parents, he added.
The saga of the Wild Boars gripped the world, with the lives of the group hanging in the balance as the threat of heavy rain injected urgency to an already perilous extraction bid.
On Wednesday a few hundred Thai school children gathered opposite the hospital, looking up at the building that will be home to the rescued football team for the coming days.
Their teacher led them in a chant thanking everyone who came to help make the mission succeed, in a small reflection of a wider gratitude towards the foreign experts who helped extract the stricken group. Rescuers had weighed up several options to save the boys, including keeping them in the cave through the months-long monsoon season.
But they were prodded into the dangerous task of diving out the team through submerged chambers and claustrophobic passages as oxygen levels in the cave plummeted and rains menaced.
The group were led out in three batches by a team of 13 international divers flanked by the Thai Navy SEALs, who greeted each successful rescue with a Hooyah on their Facebook page.
That sign off quickly turned into a hashtag shared across social media, where luminaries of business, politics and sport extended their best wishes to the team and the rescuers.
Authorities have shrouded the details of the rescue bid in secrecy, with fragments of information emerging about the heroic efforts of the dive team.
The dangers of the rescue were brought into sharp relief last Friday by the death of a retired Thai Navy SEAL as he ran out off air in the flooded cave complex as the extraction plans were being laid.
Im very happy and relieved. I havent been able to sleep for days. Im happy that the boys are out too, Khamluh Guntawong grandfather of the team coach Ekkapol Chantawong said.
Ekk really loves and cares for the boys, he added, of a figure who is emerging as something of hero despite being the only adult to accompany the boys into the cave on June 23. The group became trapped in rising floodwaters and were found nine days later emaciated and dishevelled on a muddy ledge, with water lapping ominously below.
The saga captivated a global audience for over two weeks, rewarding them with a remarkable happy ending.
French football star Paul Pogba dedicated his countrys World Cup semi-final victory over Belgium to the heroes of the day, well done boys, you are so strong he tweeted. - AFP

## Title: Towards good governance and Sri Lankan identity

Towards good governance and Sri Lankan identity
Our Yahapalana Government is embroiled in an oil conundrum. It apparently has no idea whether oil prices, meaning crude oil prices are moving up or down. Despite the IMF blessed and much touted automatic price revision formula oil prices went up one fine night but came down tumbling by dawn the next day.
It was the Finance Ministry that increased prices and they were brought down by the President. Either the President was unaware of the price increase or he had come to know of it only through the media. We do not imagine a lesser minion deliberately keeping His Excellency in the dark.
The excuse given by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was that it was not officially informed of the increase. It is hilarious since the CPC is the distributor and stockiest of oil. May be this is the Wonder of Asia or a small miracle, to use an old form of expression.
Another news item that appeared simultaneously is that the President has ordered the word SAITM removed from the degree certificate that would be given to former SAITM students after completing their degree at the Defense University. This also happened after the relevant Bill was passed by the Parliament.
There were also many instances of taxes being introduced and collected but changed soon on orders from the top. It was also reported in the press that pass marks at an interview to recruit Prison Guards were raised at the last minute when letters of appointments were about to be mailed, once again on orders from the top. What the top means is unknown. It is a hidden figure or a VVIP avatar.
All this shows that the governments left hand does not know what its right hand does. This happens when the brain is unable to coordinate action or when the brain falls sick. It is the result of a brainless action. It is as alien to the concept of good governance as chalk to cheese. Instead of good governance it seems more like non-governance.
Agricultural Ministrys rent issue
There is also the infamous example of the government paying an exorbitant sum of money to a sub-standard building to house the Agricultural Ministry. Rent was paid even before occupation and repairs. This is not the practice when renting a house for an individual wherein rent is paid for a house after occupation. No one rents a house years ahead. Major repairs are generally done by the owner or deducted from the rent. Hence, it is an example of bad governance. That it prevailed till the Minister was changed is no credit to the Minister who defended the transaction despite public opposition.
The three years of governance had virtually devalued the rule of law despite certain initial advances at the outset. The independent Commissions are under-performing or constrained by existing laws. Or else executive action overrides them. Flimsy excuses are given for laws delays and promises are not transformed into actions.
Let me take a digression at this point. Our political leaders on either side of the divide talk well. For example they swear by their respective religions to develop a Sri Lankan identity and vow to even pay with their lives to secure and consolidate the territorial integrity of the country. But in action they behave as if the country is already divided. There is only a geographical union of territory or a unified land mass and islets belonging to it.
According to dominant political thought, Sri Lanka is divided, at least into two. For there is always a distinction between the North and the South or a distinction separating the Sinhala Buddhists and the rest. In this division the Sinhala Christians or Catholics have no place at all and they acquiesce in silence. An articulate group of Sinhala Buddhists want to practice ethno-religious hegemony over Tamils and Muslims.
In place of unity in diversity they preach uniformity through obedience or subjugation and at best through assimilation. Ideologically, the country stands separated de facto though not de jure. It would be futile to expect a Sri Lankan identity as long as the North  South division or the We They approach is strong in the psychology of the public. It is tragic that well-known religious leaders and erudite scholars also espouse this division instead of attempting to forge a harmonious Sri Lankan human identity. They have silently forgotten the Buddhas teaching that hatred begets hatred. Instead they poison the public mind with hate-mongering.
outcry over Vijayakalas remark
It is this psychological division that is at the root of the controversy over former Deputy Minister Vijayakala Maheswarans reference to a resurrection of the LTTE. The same thought has been expressed by several others in various instances and in various contexts but without such furor. Calls have been made to expel her from Parliament. The Judiciary is extending its long hand in order to grab and punish her. While former LTTE leaders such as Kumaran Pathmnathan and Vinayagamurthy Muralitharan are at large enjoying freedom, Vijayakala, a lady widowed by the LTTE killing her husband, is to be tried and made a heroine among the pro-LTTE followers worldwide with scant considerations for the political fall-out from such an event.
If it suits their interests the chauvinist forces would consider the Constitution a sacred cow. They are enraged as they allege that Vijayakala has acted against the Constitution. When political leaders refused to implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which is now a part of the Basic Law of the land and call for its abrogation these very same people were silent.
Political leaders, both of the Government and the Opposition are engaged in useless debates over utterances of persons without discussing and finding solutions to the existential problems of the people. This happens to such an extent that the public is beginning to suspect whether these debates are by prior agreement.
The continuation of these debates would mean exactly the continuation of a state of non-governance. It is time for the people to seek an alternative way forward discarding these politicians to the dustbin of history.

Tri-forces to be empowered to bust drugs
Police powers will be granted to the Tri-Forces by law for two years to help the Police in eradicating the drug menace in the country.
A joint Cabinet paper submitted by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as Defence Minister and Public Administration and Law and Order Minister, Ranjith Maddumabandara has pointed out that while the Police and Police Narcotics Bureau did a commendable job in apprehending drug related crime, the worsening drug situation in the country required assistance from the Tri-Forces.
A meeting at the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention too had pointed out this need.
Minister Maddumabandara in the paper pointed out that the Navy already worked to apprehend drug traffickers on the high seas in accordance with the Customs Ordinance, Emigration and Immigration Act and the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act.
Thus this would be an extension of that.
Laws will be prepared with recommendations from the Attorney Generals Department.
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday said Cabinet had also agreed to implement the death penalty on large scale drug traffickers in a bid to arrest the current trend. President Sirisena said had agreed to sign the death penalty on 19 large scale drug traffickers, especially those who run their operations from within prison itself. There have been no executions in Sri Lanka since 1976 although the death sentence had been handed out. Those sentenced to death automatically have it turned into life imprisonment. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga proposed to introduce it but had to withdraw its implementation as a result of strong public opposition. In 2015, President Sirisena too said he would implement it if it was sanctioned by Parliament.

U.S. 7th Fleet aircraft locates missing Lankan fishermen
A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft located a missing fishing vessel on July 10, after joining search efforts at the request of the Sri Lankan Navy.
The vessel was located by an aircraft from the Pelicans of Patrol Squadron (VP) 45 assigned to U.S. 7th Fleet and flew out of Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia.
As we continue to explore the operational reach and agility of the P-8A Poseidon, the trust and relationships we build with our multi-national partners becomes more and more apparent in such a complex and broad Indo-Pacific region, said Cmdr. Mark E. Zematis, commander Patrol Squadron 45. The positive relationship between Sri Lanka and the United States is what allowed our aircrew and maintenance team to effectively launch and assist with the recovery of their countryman.
The 40-foot vessel and crew of six went missing on the morning of July 8 near Dondra Head, Sri Lanka. A Sri Lankan Navy ship is headed to the location provided by the P-8A along with a commercial vessel nearby to render assistance.
The P-8A is the worlds newest, most capable maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and operates regularly throughout the Indo-Pacific in support of regional security and stability.
The Seventh Fleet, which celebrates its 75th year in 2018, spans more than 124 million square kilometers, stretching from the International Date Line to the India/Pakistan border and from the Kuril Islands in the North to the Antarctic in the South.
Seventh Fleets area of operation encompasses 36 maritime countries and 50 percent of the worlds population with between 50 to 70 U.S. ships and submarines, 140 aircraft, and approximately 20,000 Sailors in the 7th Fleet.

Weightlifting to get a boost in Kandy
Weightlifting is to be given the best of support in Kandy in the future. At one time this sport was dominated in Kandy and produced several weight lifters who brought honor to their clubs, themselves and the country.
Kandy was the hub for the Iron sport. All this was made possible due to the immense support and helping hand extended by Kandy YMCA, who were backed by the National Olympic Committee and Sports Ministry.
Weightlifting was introduced to Sri Lanka as a sport in 1939 by an Englishman, who was a serviceman, named G.J. P. Hill at a trial contest at the Fort YMCA. This was followed by Kandy YMCA, but they soon went bankrupt in 1954.
Nine years later, in 1963, an organized and focussed association was formed in the name Sri Lanka Amateur Weight Lifting and Body Building Association.
This association, like in 1939, conducted a trial meet for amateurs in 1963 which was continued until 1974.
The same year, the bodybuilding section of the association broke away and formed the Sri Lanka Amateur Body Building Association, which was, since 1977, called the Sri Lanka Weightlifting Federation. The Sri Lanka Weightlifting Federation is a member of all its senior federations like the Asian, Commonwealth and the International Body Building Federations. Since the Federation was formed, it expanded its activities to the four corners of the country with the help of the Ministry of Sports.
Today weightlifting is catching up in a big way in schools. Even girls are interested in taking to this sport and be recognized. The Services have taken up the iron sport in a big way. From the first bronze medal, from the Pakistan International game in 1982 up to the present weightlifters have brought in many Silver and Bronze medals.
Our weightlifters have taken part from 1982 Asian Games and in 1984 Olympic game in addition to several International championships.
In 1986 we won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Championships in Malta.
In the good old days, promoters such as S.A. Wijawickrema Snr and Jnr, A Dharmadasa, Maurice Windus, with a few others did their best to promote this sport. When the sport was declining and on the verge of heading towards a natural death, the above mentioned people came forward and brought the sport to its original status with great commitment and dedication.
There is another person one cannot forget he is T.S.J. Packeer Ally the doyen of Iron sport. When the iron sport was revived after 40 odd years, the first team to tour overseas (Peking), was G.V.A. Croos (Bantam), S.A. Wijawickrema Jnr. (Feather), Mahesh Sabaratnam (Light), Niyaz Majeed (Middle) and W.S.K. Perera (Light).
The team was managed by J. Ranasinghe, T.S.J. Pakeer Ally (Coach) who was a FIFA qualified Football Coach, Linne Schoorman went as referee.

## Title: 'What we do when we write... '

'What we do when we write... '
Some years ago I was chatting with a friend on Facebook about Emily Dickinson. I quite frankly told him even though I liked Dickinson the poet I loved the most is Thomas Wyatt. To my dismay, he sent me an emoji of a confused man scratching his head in response to my statement followed by the question, Thomas who From then on in all discussions with regard to poetry either during virtual meetings on Facebook or in real life I stuck to safe poets like Wordsworth, Blake, Milton even though I had no particular regard for any of them. But now it seems I can bring my love for the 16th Century lyric poet out of the closet. Another writer, far greater than I, loves Wyatt.
If you already guessed who I am talking about, I will gladly lend you my copy of his latest novel, Warlight the moment I finish reading it (the exact date this will happen is uncertain considering that I am still on page 42 of his Booker Prize-winning English Patient). If you are still in the dark as to this writers identity though, heres another clue.
Just four days ago he won the prestigious Golden Man Booker Prize - the one-off award given in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Man Booker. Yes. He is Michael Ondaatje.
Among the shortlist of the five novelists selected by a panel of judges from the 51 previous winners of the Man Booker, which honors the best novels written in English and published in Britain or Ireland, were V. S. Naipaul, Penelope Lively, Hilary Mantel and George Saunders. In a statement issued by his publisher, Penguin Random House, Ondaatje said, I am honoured as well as very surprised to receive this award for The English Patient, as I was to be in the company of the other remarkable nominees.
As reported in the Guardian, speaking at the close of the Man Booker 50 festival in the Southbank Centre, London, on Sunday, Ondaatje explained he had not reread The English Patient, which moves between a nurse tending a horribly burned man in an Italian villa at the end of the second world war and a tragic love affair from his past, since 1992. Not for a second do I believe this is the best book on the list, especially when it is placed beside a work by VS Naipaul, one of the masters of our time, or a major work like Wolf Hall, he said, adding: I suspect and know more than anyone that perhaps The English Patient is still cloudy, with errors in pacing. He also says that he felt it was important to acknowledge the authors who never won the Booker prize, specifically naming William Trevor, Barbara Pym and Alice Munro.
Kamila Shamsie who selected The English Patient from the Booker Prize winners of the 1990s said the novel stood out due to the authors treatment of his female characters. A lot of books by male writers are only interested in the lives of men  they may be wonderful books, but the women figure quite peripherally, she said. Hana to me is the centre of the novel, and is done with such love, care and understanding and complexity. In a poll conducted to select the Golden Booker, it is said the English Patient received the most votes, with nearly 9,000 votes cast by the public.
Needless to say, it feels amazing to know that Ondaatje once trod on the same streets that my feet fall on today, that his eyes once saw the same sky that I see outside my window. Born in Colombo in 1943, Ondaatje is of Dutch, Sinhalese and Tamil ancestry. He sailed to England in 1954 on his own when he was only eleven years old to join his mother and relocated eight years later in Toronto. As he confesses in an interview with Robert McCrum in 2011 in the Guardian, As far as origins go, Ondaatje was probably a Tamil name, originally from India, but Im not much of a Tamil now..I cant speak the language, apart from a few rude words. He resists a public identification with Sri Lanka, though he still has plenty of family there. I really dont want to become the representative of a country.
Yet, it goes without saying that even though he may no longer be a Sri Lankan the encouragement he gives Sri Lankan English writers by creating the Gratiaen Trust and the Gratiaen Awards with the money he received as the joint-winner of the Booker Prize is invaluable.
To quote McCrum, Ondaatje wrote poetry at first, making his debut with The Dainty Monsters and The Man With Seven Toes, and then found this curious desire to write prose. His first success, The Collected Works of Billy the Kid, is a volume of poetry that hovers lyrically on the edge of narrative, in a genre thats hard to define. His best novels  Coming Through Slaughter, In the Skin of a Lion and The English Patient  followed in a surge of creative confidence. The Academy Award-winning movie of The English Patient starring Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche and Kristin Scott Thomas, directed by Anthony Minghella, propelled Ondaatje to a level of international celebrity he found uncomfortable, observes McCrum.
According to Tom Barbash who spent two afternoons with Ondaatje in August 2007, Ondaatjes books are morally complex and structurally adventurous, in part because he doesnt know the structure going in. His method, he says, is to cast out in the dark. He begins with dreamlike images, slowly building his intricate story, but then subjects his work to a lengthy and vigorous editing process that can span years. Ondaatje is a genius with time and place, in part as a result of what hes learned from his other loves: music, film, and photography.
Barbash also says Ondaatje likes writing in other peoples houses. On the unseasonably hot weekend of our interview we meet at the home of one of Ondaatjes friends, where the novelist has been staying on and off for the last several months, and where he wrote part of his new novel, Divisadero, says Barbash. It is a quiet house on an equally tranquil street in the Berkeley flats. Divisadero takes place in the Bay Area and by staying in this house Ondaatje was continuing a time-tested habit of moving to where his novels are set. When writing The English Patient he moved into a small house in the Italian countryside, for Anils Ghost he found a house in his native Sri Lanka, and recently he took up residence in the French countryside while writing the portion of Divisadero that takes place in France. He says he can get work done anywhere, but that a particular house can ignite his imagination.
Talking about what drives him when he is writing a book Ondaatje explains it has little to do with an overall plot. Instead, Its finding someone you can live with for four or five years on the page.
Then that person meets somebody else and you have a community of people who interact. The real pleasure of writing is making a portrait of that person in the most complex wayand the most compassionate way, hopefully.
Apart from his love of Robert Browning and Thomas Wyatt Ondaatje also enjoys (to quote McCrum) games, thrives on tales of embarrassment and merrily admits to being incorrigible.
Asked about his juvenile side, he unfolds from his wallet a Robert Frost quotation and reads it out in self-affirmation: What we do when we write represents the last of our childhood. We may for that reason practise it somewhat irresponsibly.
At the end of his interview with Ondaatje, Barbash concluded Ondaatje has a gentle, welcoming manner, and longish white hair, which rises somewhat wildly from his head. He has a soft but resonant speaking voice and laughs easily, often while poking fun at himself.
In his own eyes Ondaatje sees himself as someone who lives according to the Eastern aesthetic tradition. In the East, the artist follows the brush.

Where non-state higher education errs
Finding employment is the intention of the majority of the graduates in Sri Lanka. Very few Non-State Higher Education providers are successful in providing student centred learning. There is limited access to state universities and therefore, students tend to access Non-State Higher Education providers in affiliation with foreign universities. However, many of the Non-State Higher education providers charge unreasonable amounts of fees as course fees from students which will ultimately end up similar to a traditional tuition provider. There are no recreational facilities and no library facilities provided for students in many of the Non-State Institutes.
Recognition of foreign universities
Some of the Foreign Universities are listed in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook published by the Association of Commonwealth Universities and International Handbook of Universities. The University Grants Commission recognizes foreign universities based on the listing in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook and International Handbook of Universities as directed by the circular issued by the Ministry of Public Administration (16/92 dated March 13, 1992).
Albert Einstein once stated that Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
This component of imagination is far beyond among todays graduates who just obtain the paper qualification from, small private higher education provider who maintains a profit-making endeavour with foreign universities. Many of these students lack soft skills, competence and are unable to even write a letter though they have done English as a subject as per their transcripts/ academic records. Many such cases have been reported in Non-State Institutes operate in Northern, Eastern province and maintaining branches in the Western province as Higher Education providers. Its a major crime on students life that does not have university exposure.
Lack of career guidance
There is no proper regulatory mechanism on Non-State Higher Education providers. There is no career guidance or internal quality assurance mechanism operating properly in many of Non-State Higher Education Institutes. In such a situation where do our students go This question has never been raised even in Parliament.
Degree Certificates of the students are not provided on time in most of the Non-State Institutes. Students are waiting for years to obtain the Degree Certificate. Most of the cases were reported pertaining to Ambiga Institute and many other private Higher Education providers operating their businesses in Batticaloa, Jaffna and Colombo. These institutes are providing degrees of Madurai Kamaraj University and Alagappa University in India where many students have not provided degree certificates, provisional certificates or transcripts / academic records on time. Therefore, students are not in a position to go for an employment. In most of the situations, they produce a letter provided by the respective Non-State institute without producing proper academic records by the affiliated university.
Employers in Sri Lanka
Employers in Sri Lanka need to be concerned with the academic records produced by the applicants of Non-State Higher Education providers. Every applicant needs to have the Degree Certificate, Provisional Certificate, transcript of academic records or either one of those records. Without having such records simply by producing the letter given by UGC recognizing merely the university does not say anything pertaining to the authenticity of the degree obtained.
However, many of the students have the practice of obtaining a letter from the respective institute mentioning the course completion instead of obtaining their degree certificates, provisional certificate, transcript of academic records.
Recognition of the respective University by the University Grants Commission based on the listing of Commonwealth Universities Yearbook and International Handbook of Universities is not sufficient to verify the ability of the graduate. Every employer needs to check the authenticity of the degree certificate possessed by the student with the respective university.
Employ able graduates
Recently there were series of interviews held pertaining to Development Officers where many of the students are from Non-State Higher Educational Institutes. In such instances, a comprehensive programme is needed to train them before employing them as front office managers or development officers who frequently need to liaise properly with the public. On the other hand, state graduates have a good competition. However, for the employer, its a matter of quality.
Many of the Ministries, State and Non-State organisations before sending their employees to foreign universities do not verify the recognition of the University from the University Grants Commission. However, when they return and reposition in their employment, they try to verify the recognition from the University Grants Commission, whereas the respective employee faces many difficulties especially when the University is not listed in the Commonwealth Universities Year Book and International Handbook of Universities. This was reported in the cases of Tri-Forces in Sri Lanka as in many of the instances Military Academies were reported as not listed in the Commonwealth Universities Yearbook and International Handbook of Universities. Therefore, it is advisable to verify the recognition of the Foreign University or Higher Educational Institution from the University Grants Commission before sending employees through scholarships for higher studies.
Institute of Engineers Sri Lank does not recognize some foreign universities. Therefore, students of Liverpool John Moores University after obtaining their graduation and recognition letters regarding respective University from University Grants Commission, used to prepare identity cards by themselves mentioning the name of the University Grants Commission to identify them as Civil Engineers without obtaining any approval from the Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka which is a wrongful act.
Further, the Chartered Institute of Marketing in Sri Lanka has issued letters to one of the Embassy of State of Qatar in Sri Lanka mentioning that they have registered under the University Grants Commission since inception.
Some of the Non-State Higher Education providers (Local) have obtained letters from the Department of Education, Western Province to promote Bachelor of Education Degree Programme conducted by Lincoln University among the teachers in Sri Lanka.
Memorandum of Understandings
By citing reconciliation some of the academia is in the process of signing Memorandums of Understanding with Foreign Tamil Non-State higher education providers where there is no international recognition nor such affiliated entities. Further, those foreign entities are catering to the requirements of Tamil Diaspora which are not beneficial to the Higher Education in Sri Lanka.
Public and employers hereby need to be vigilant about such malpractices of such Non- State Higher educational institutes and public involvement in such activities.
The necessity of Reviewing and monitoring of Non-state Higher Education providers
In the UK Higher Education Review takes place with the involvement of Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA). There are currently three versions of this review method.
 Higher Education Review (Alternative Providers)
 Higher Education Review (Embedded Colleges)
 Higher Education Review (Foreign Providers)
Providers seeking to sponsor migrant students are subject to educational oversight by QAA and must be reviewed on a regular basis using one of these review methods. Higher Education Review (Alternative Providers) is also the method by which applicants seeking specific course designation are reviewed.
Further, education about educational oversight and specific course designation is available on the relevant Government websites in the United Kingdom.
Further, expediting the establishment of National Quality assurance Council to involve independent review and monitoring of Non-State Higher Education providers is a timely requirement.

## Title: Will the group of seventy ever see the light of day

Will the group of seventy ever see the light of day
The three major political parties likely to be in the running for the next national elections- the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- were seen grappling with contentious issues last week, as the jostling continues for pole position in the countrys political stakes.
The party faced with the most daunting challenge last week was the UNP. That was after Vijayakala Maheswaran, then the State Minister for Child Affairs, attending a public event in Jaffna made a statement that law and order in the region had declined to such a degree that children in the region were safer in the days when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) controlled the North.
Maheswarans statement was made in an emotive context, in reference to the recent murder of a six-year-old girl. For children in the North to be safe and for them to live without fear and return home from school, the LTTE need to be resurrected, she is reported to have said. It is this aspect of her speech, where she had called for the resurgence of the LTTE that led to her downfall.
The statement was all the more surprising because Maheswarans husband, T. Maheswaran, a former UNP parliamentarian for the Jaffna district was assassinated by a person with alleged links to the LTTE. Maheswaran was killed on New Years Day in Colombo in 2008. The Colombo High Court in 2012 found John Pauline Wellington, a former LTTE intelligence operative guilty of the murder.
The backlash to Vijayakala Maheswarans speech was swift. Mainstream and social media were quick to pick up the story where a minister of the government while lambasting the President for inaction and bemoaning the law and order situation in the North and East, was calling for a resurrection of the LTTE.
The UNP and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in particular, had to deal with two aspects that ensued from Maheswarans speech: the political fallout for the UNP both in the North and South of the country and legal consequences for Maheswaran for what could be construed as advocating separatism.
In purely political terms, the UNP could have done without Maheswarans dramatic outburst. While the UNP still maintains arguably the best standing among the Tamil and Muslim communities among the major parties, it is no secret that in recent years this has come at the expense of alienating the Sinhalese and Buddhist segments of the population.
pro-Sinhala nationalist stance
That didnt happen overnight. It was brought about by the UNPs go soft approach towards the LTTE dating back to the 2002 ceasefire which failed as opposed to former President Mahinda Rajapaksas hard-line stance which led to the decimation of the terrorist outfit and the end of the Eelam war in 2009.
Even after the war victory, Rajapaksa consciously cultivated a pro-Sinhala nationalist stance, convinced that politically it was easier to win elections by gaining an overwhelming share of the majority community vote rather than appeasing the various demands of the minority communities. It was a strategy that paid off in 2010 but failed spectacularly in 2015, leading to his ouster.
Obviously, the SLPP and the Joint Opposition (JO) were quick to pounce on Maheswarans comments. They demanded a debate and created a furore in Parliament where Wimal Weerawansa behaved in his characteristic uncouth manner, hurling personal insults at Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Jayasuriya handled the situation with aplomb, calling out Weerawansa for his uncivilised conduct.
Initially, Maheswaran was due to explain her comments but, with her speech caught on camera, there was to be no turning back. Following a discussion with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe where Maheswaran explained that she was emotional at the time of the speech and offered an unconditional apology, she was asked to resign, which she did.
That was a sine qua non for the UNP because keeping Maheswaran in its ministerial ranks after that statement would have attracted the Tiger label with politically disastrous consequences in the South. The UNP is likely to lose some votes in the Jaffna district where Maheswaran has her political base, but that could be considered negligible in comparison to the potential for a greater backlash in the South of the country if she was retained.
The UNP has also commenced disciplinary proceedings against Maheswaran and a four-member committee comprising ministers Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Kabir Hashim, Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Thalatha Atukorale have been appointed to inquire into the issue.
The potential legal consequences for Maheswaran could be worse. Pursuant to a complaint received from a Buddhist monk heading a pro-nationalist organisation, Police have already commenced investigations.
Police informed the Chief Magistrates Court in Colombo last Friday that Maheswaran could be charged for offences that appear to have been committed under Section 115 and 120 of the Penal Code, violating the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and provisions stipulated under Article 157A of the Constitution.
Article 157A(1) of the Constitution cites that no person shall, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. Whether Maheswaran violated this article will now be a matter for the courts to decide. The court has already called for video footage and media reports of the former ministers speech.
If that was an unwanted distraction for the UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP were not without its travails. There had been hope in some quarters of a rapprochement between the two parties, as they prepared for national elections. Among the seniors espousing this strategy was S. B. Dissanayake. Also in agreement were Dayasiri Jayasekera and Thilanga Sumathipala.
In fact, Dissanayake went public with his vision splendid: for President Sirisena to run for re-election with the support of the Rajapaksa camp and for Mahinda Rajapaksa to become Prime Minister in any government that would subsequently be formed, for which there was no constitutional barrier.
No-confidence against PM
It was with this hope that several of those who were identified with the so-called group of 16 who voted to support the motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were appointed to party positions in the SLFP by President Maithripala Sirisena at its restructuring exercise in early June.
For example, former Ministers W. D. J. Seneviratne, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha were appointed as senior vice-presidents of the party while Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle was appointed as a deputy secretary of the party.
All that appears to have come to nought as the SLPP insists that those in the group of sixteen wishing to join ranks with the new party must sever links with the SLFP leadership and acknowledge Mahinda Rajapaksa as their leader. This has become a significant obstacle to reconciliation efforts between the two parties.
As a result, there is a strong likelihood that at least a few of the group of sixteen will opt to remain under the leadership of President Sirisena. Hence the prediction that the group of sixteen will become one with the remaining members of the JO and become a group of seventy is unlikely to eventuate.
With political activity in the main political parties remaining in such a state of flux, more upheavals and controversies are likely. Make no mistake, the campaign for the presidential and general elections due in 2020 have already begun.

Sri Lanka should pull back from plans for death penalty
Sri Lanka should pull back from any plans to implement the death penalty and preserve its longstanding positive record, Amnesty International said yesterday.
President Maithripala Srisena was reportedly pressing ahead with plans to execute 19 death-row prisoners convicted of drug-related offences.
By resuming executions after more than 40 years, Sri Lanka would damage its reputation. The government must immediately halt plans to carry out any executions, commute all death sentences, and establish an official moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty as a first step towards its abolition, Amnesty International Deputy Director for South Asia Dinushika Dissanayake said.Sri Lanka has been a leader in the region, with a record of shunning this punishment at a time when many other countries persisted with it. Now, when most of the world has turned its back on the death penalty, it risks heading in the wrong direction and joining a shrinking minority of states that persist with this practice.
Amnesty International is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, regardless of the crime or the method of execution.
Executing people for drug-related crimes is a violation of international lawwhich says the death penalty can only be imposed in countries that are yet to abolish it for the most serious crimes, meaning intentional killingand would brazenly defy Sri Lankas international commitments, including its repeated votes in favour of a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty at the United Nastions (UN) General Assembly, most recently in 2016.

Strategies on debt recoveries and problem credit management
Credit is the extension of fund to a borrower which he/she pays interest rate for using the money. In finance the term recovery refers to collection of amount due.
Normally recovery depends on the purpose, time and business running process etc. Recovery is different from one credit to another. In a local context, Sri Lanka is to grow by 5% in 2018 said by the Central Bank Governor, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, driven by an expected credit growth of 15%. This in turn creates certain vulnerabilities of money extended as credits that may not paid back, hence affecting the financial sector. The countries has seen a decline in the gross NPL ratio to 2.5 per cent as at end 2017, from 2.6 per cent as at end 2016, despite an increase in NPLs of LKR 18.3 billion during 2017.
Today in the world of business, credit has become a crucial aspect.
For a growth oriented company doing business on credit gives it better leverage to be more dynamic in its operations, this enhances the bottom line for the business.
Therefore Credit has become a pivotal aspect for any business whether it is the lending of money by financial institutions, giving credit by trading or manufacturing institutions and even by a service provider in any field. Hence the urgency for any business is giving credit for the goods or services and ensuring that the amounts are duly recovered from the customers.
A prominent aspect of banking in general and lending in particular is the ability of a lending officer to assure lending out funds could be tracked down and recovered.
The problem of credit default is to be brought to concern by any organization and, one that has cost many financial institutions fortunes in bad debts. Because of information asymmetry on a companies, credit default funds that may never be recovered might be lend out by credit officers.
This program will ensure that the participant will be able to derive the highest precautionary measures when it comes to credit being given, by using a professional credit management process.
In addition the participant would know how recoveries could be done with different strategies and options such as negotiation based on the nature of the customer and his ability to pay the obligation of credit. Also legal measures such Arbitration and Litigation would be touched upon.
In addition, methods in estimating credit losses such as the application of discounted cash flow methods and other such estimation methods would be talked about in this program. The program conducted by the key speaker Gamini Karunathilake, who was the former CEO of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC (MBSL) with his upcoming book on Law and Practice of Bank Securities and Recoveries. Karunathilake would part his archive of knowledge on debt recovery with over 25 years in the field and his valuable experiences which you as a participant could learn from. Following the talk would be a dynamic panel discussion with Karunathilake, A M A Cader and Priyantha Herath where the participants can ask there burning questions on the field and would be given an array of answers from the panelists that have their own backgrounds and experiences.

Bakamuna completes successful launch of Pop up
Bakamuna, a mixed media lifestyle design brand, enabled by MTIs idea2fund has successfully completed a nine day run of their Pop-up at The Hilton Colombo.
The brands first ever Pop-up, a re-purposed bullock cart that carried a range of lifestyle products such as home ware, stationery and accessories was stationed at the Hilton Colombo from June 23 till the 1st of July.
The traditional mode of transportation was given a modern vibe with the use of contemporary design elements and was used to showcase a range of products that had been created through mixed media design.
The overall footfall generated by the Pop-up was noticeably greater each day and it proved to be a major attraction for tourists and locals alike. This store concept enables Bakamuna to easily take their mobile shopping experience to different locations.
Bakamuna had the amazing opportunity to interact with our local and international community on a more personal level and we were so happy to be able connect with all those who came by. By being a part of the Bakamuna experience, they were able to gain a better understanding of the inspiration behind our designs., said Chief Bakamuna/CEO, Rochelle Bibile.
We greatly appreciate The Hilton Colombo for giving us a platform to launch our first ever Pop-up and we hope to set up at many other locations around the island, spreading our quirky vibe and showcasing our visual stories wherever we go.
Bakamunas specialty is mixed media; an art form where two or more mediums such as ink and digital mediums or painting and collage are combined in to a single composition. Bakamuna has taken this concept a step further and incorporated materials such as wood, rubber and fabric in to their products, while establishing their signature Bakamuna style; traditional elements with a contemporary twist.
Having launched early last year, we are immensely happy with the speed at which Bakamuna has been growing. The opportunities for design in Sri Lanka are expanding and this is substantiated by the success of our first ever Pop-up, said MTI Venture Manager for Bakamuna Malithi Herath.
Having started with the store in store concept, the Bakamuna Pop-up  a locally owned and operated franchise will now expand on the concept by having similar stores across the country.
A part of the proceeds from the project are to go towards aiding art therapy based programs for centres catering to children who are economically challenged.
Bakamuna aims to create, connect and collaborate and actively looks to support the local art community in diverse ways.

Beat bad odour
Bad odour does not only come from the underarms. It can originate anywhere there are sebaceous (oil) and sweat glands. This includes the scalp, genitals, feet, and even the nipples. Bad breath is another cause for embarrassment. Banish body odour and bad breath for good with these solutions. 
Best way to help cure foot odour 
Smelly feet are less of a problem socially than underarm body ordour because the unpleasant odour is usually contained by shoes and socks. However, the smell may become obvious if the person with smelly feet visits a home where shoes are taken off before entering, as is the custom in various countries and homes.

The following steps may help control foot odour: 
1) Wash your feet at least once a day:Warm water is better at killing bacteria than cold water. Make sure you dry your feet thoroughly afterward, including in between your toes.
2) Socks:They must allow the sweat to evaporate. The best socks are those made of a combination of man-made fibers and wool. Wear a clean pair of socks each day.
3) Shoes:If you wear trainers or shoes with plastic linings make sure it is not for long. A leather lining is better for sweat evaporation. If you have a problem with sweaty feet, do not wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Shoes do not completely dry overnight.
4) Pumice stone:Bacteria thrive on dead skin. If the soles of your feet have patches of dead skin remove them with a pumice stone. These are available to buyonline.
5) Deodorants and antiperspirants:Ask your pharmacist for special foot deodorants and antiperspirants. If you have athletes foot, you should not use deodorants or antiperspirants. Treat the fungal infection with appropriate medication.
6) Walk around barefoot:Whenever you can, walk around barefoot or at least slip out of your shoes regularly.

Causes of bad breath 
Persistentbad breath or a bad taste in the mouth may be a warning sign of gum (periodontal) disease. Gum diseaseis caused by the buildup of plaque on teeth. Bacteria cause the formation of toxins to form, whichirritatethe gums. Ifgum diseasecontinues untreated, it can damage the gums and jawbone.
Get rid of bad breath
Bad breath can be reduced or prevented if you: 
Practice good oral hygiene. Brush twice a day withfluoridetoothpasteto remove food debris and plaque. Brush teeth after you eat (keep atoothbrush at work or school to brush after lunch). Dont forget to brush the tongue, too. Replace yourtoothbrushevery two to three months or after an illness.
Use floss or an interdental cleaner to remove food particles and plaque between teeth once a day. Rinse with an antibacterial mouthwash twice a day. Dentures should be removed at night and cleaned thoroughly before being placed in your mouth the next morning. See your dentist regularly - at least twice a year. He or she will conduct an oral exam and professional teeth cleaning and will be able to detect and treat periodontal disease,dry mouth, or other problems that may be the cause of bad mouth odour. Stop smokingand chewing tobacco-based products. Ask your dentist for tips on kicking the habit.
Drink lots of water. This will keep your mouth moist. Chewing gum (preferably sugarless) or sucking on candy (preferably sugarless) also stimulates the production of saliva, which helps wash away food particles and bacteria. Gums and mints containing xylitol are best.
Keep a log of the foods you eat. If you think they may be causing bad breath, bring the log to your dentist to review. Similarly, make a list of the medications you take. Some drugs may play a role in creating mouth odours.

Tips on how to followa routine to avoid body odour 

1. Keep yourself squeaky clean 
Shower at least once a day, and youll wash away sweat and get rid of some of the bacteria on your skin.
Sweat by itself is basically odourless. But when the bacteria that live on your skin mix with sweat, they multiply quickly and raise quite a stink.
Washing thoroughly, especially the areas where you tend to sweat, can help with body odour.

2. Use antibacterial soap 
Washing thoroughly with an antibacterial soap bar will help get rid of some bacteria, which can help with the odour. Look for the word antibacterial on the soaps packaging.

3. Towel off well 
Once youve showered, dry yourself completely, paying close attention to any areas where you sweat a lot.

4. Use industrial strength antiperspirants 
Once youre clean and dry, use a strong antiperspirant on your underarms. These have aluminum chloride, a chemical that helps keep sweat at bay, and they often also have a deodorant in them. Use it twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening.
You dont need a prescription to get a powerful antiperspirant. Look for ones that say theyre higher strength. If you think you need more help, ask your doctor about prescription antiperspirants. 

5. Keep your clothes clean 
Change clothes often when youre sweating heavily. Fresh clothes help keep body odour down. Be sure to change your socks as well, especially if you tend to have foot odour. Use deodorant powders in your shoes, replace insoles often, and go barefoot when possible.

6. Cut out or cut back on certain foods or drinks 
What you eat affects your body odour. Foods that tend to make you sweat more, such as hot peppers or other spicy foods, might also lead to body odour. And the aroma of foods like onions or garlic can be carried in your sweat. Drinks with caffeine or alcohol may also make you sweat more.

Belgiums Courtois blasts France victory as shame for football
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Tuesday: Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said his teams defeat by France in the World Cup semi-finals on Tuesday was a shame for football, criticising Didier Deschampss side for a defensive style of play.
Centre-back Samuel Umtitis 51st-minute header from a corner gave France a 1-0 win, as they defended deep to close it out and reach a third World Cup final.
It was a frustrating match. France didnt play at all, they defended with 11 players within 40 metres of their goal, Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois told Belgian TV channel RTBF.
They played on the counter-attack with (Kylian) Mbappe, who is very quick. Thats their right. They know when an opponent plays very deep, thats where we have problems.
The frustration is there because we didnt lose to a team who are better than us, we lost to a team who play nothing, just defend.
Against Uruguay (in the quarter-finals) they scored with a free-kick and a goalkeeping error.
Today, a corner. Its a shame for football that Belgium didnt win today.
France, the 1998 champions, will face either England or Croatia in Sundays final at Moscows Luzhniki Stadium.  AFP

Best Anti-Aging Foods For Younger Looking Skin
The foods that follow are among the most beneficial for your body as you get on in years. But they need to be had as part of a balanced diet plan with a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Of course, you will also need to factor in your own food sensitivities and other health constraints, if any, before loading your grocery cart with these foods. 

Pomegranates 
Pomegranates are packed with vitamins and antioxidants that can help you fight off sun damage to your skin. The ellagic acid in it can help slow the breakdown of collagen that keeps your skin looking supple and youthful. So you can ward off those wrinkles and counter your bodys inflammatory response to ultraviolet radiation exposure from the sun.
Equally crucial, pomegranate juice could help keep your memory sharp as you grow older. As one study found, older test subjects with age-related memory issues saw improvement in their memory after having an oz serving of pomegranate juice daily for the 4 weeks of the test.

Blueberries 
Berries in general and blueberries in particular are rich sources of antioxidants. The anthocyanins they contain help keep blood vessels elastic, allowing you to have lower blood pressure.
Drinking the juice could also help boost cognitive ability. If youre coping with depressive due to aging, the juice could even ease that problem, as one study found. It turns out the anthocyanins stimulate the neurons in the brain and also reduce geriatric depressive symptoms. 
Free radical damage that causes graying of your hair could potentially be slowed by the protective effect of the antioxidants in the berries.

Green Tea 
Oriental favorite and increasingly popular as a beverage the world over, green tea can be a wonderful addition to help you slow down the clock.
Make the most of green tea polyphenols and catechins to prevent hyperpigmentation from sun damage that can leave you skin looking blotchy and older. Green tea isnt just great to consume but also works as a topical treatment to prevent oxidative damage to your skin from UV radiation. Look for sunscreens with green tea polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or infuse some green tea extract into your sunscreen.
Research has shown that growing older is linked to a rise in hyperplastic pathologies, or, simply put, a rise in the rate at which your cells reproduce, a precursor to problems like cancer. Consuming green tea may also help induce apoptosis or cell death of tumor/cancerous cells. Again, it is the EGCG that prevents the proliferation of cancer cells.

Green Leafy Vegetables 
Another kind of green comes from the green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale that are already celebrated for myriad reasons  not least of which is the vitamins and minerals they pack in. But they have an important role to play against aging.
Protect yourself against inflammation and its potentially aging effects by consuming anti-inflammatory greens like collard greens or kale and spinach.
The vitamin K in spinach can also help cut down the bone loss you experience as you age. With stronger bones, you are less likely to have a fracture, a common worry for the elderly.
Keep your eyesight in good form with carotenoids like lutein and beta-carotene that green leafy vegetables are rich in. Research has found that those who eat spinach more often are less likely to experience age-related macular degeneration or deterioration of eyesight due to aging.
Even your hair will love you for eating spinach. The vitamin A in the vegetable helps produce sebum, the natural oils in your scalp, keeping your hair well-conditioned. The vitamin E in it protects hair from sun damage. The vitamin C boost collagen production to ensure healthy hair growth. This could stave off premature graying or hair loss due to vitamin A, C, or E nutritional deficiency.

Garlic 
Among its many claims to fame, smelly garlic can help you prevent a lot of aging-related issues.
Researchers suggest that as you grow older, the oxidative damage to your cells also accumulates. The result Cardiovascular disease, Alzheimers disease, cancer, and other degenerative diseases. Garlic, rich in antioxidants, can help counter oxidative damage and exerts a protective effect on your body.
Age-related stiffening of blood vessel walls, as well as atherosclerosis that sets in for some with age, can make hypertension a problem. Garlic helps relax your blood vessels, easing blood flow and consequently lowering blood pressure. This makes it a good dietary means to keep up heart health and potentially avoid strokes and heart attacks that arise with age and impaired blood flow.

Beans 
Time to trade in a few animal protein mains for some beans. Not only are they versatile, working in casseroles, salads, and soups, theyre also easier on the pocket. Thats not all, though!
Beans are fiber-rich and contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. They are able to lower your risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease  all issues plaguing people with age. In addition, they could even help lower your cholesterol levels.

Water 
Odd as this may sound, an often overlooked aspect of what you eat is what you drink. And water plays such an important role in our bodys well-being.
In spite of this, many of the elderly suffer from dehydration. By some estimates, as much as 20 to 30 percent of the senior population could be living with water loss dehydration.
This is due to a mix of factors, including reduced kidney function, hormonal changes, the effect of medication, as well as cognitive and physical disabilities. Unfortunately, not drinking and replacing the water you lose can hasten the way you age.
Dehydration can lead to wrinkled skin as one very visible effect. But it can also increase disability and even raise mortality risk. -curejoy.com

Blood bank Director transferred out
The acting Director of National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) Dr. Rukshan Bellana has been removed from his post from yesterday.
He had been transferred to the Health Ministry, Health Ministry sources told the Daily News yesterday. Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) members attached to the National Blood Transfusion Centre launched a strike on Monday demanding his removal as acting Director.
Meanwhile, Health Minister and Co-cabinet spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said he had ordered an inquiry against Dr. Bellana over his actions, but he was not happy with the punishment given by the Public Services Commission earlier, in demoting him by only two grades for insulting the President.
I summoned them for a discussion and asked them what the punishment given was they said he would be demoted by two pay grades, I told them, so if you insult the leader of the country, you have a demotion of two pay grades, if it is the Prime Minister one And if it is a minister is it just a stern warning.
Strongly critical of the inquiries into public officials who have insulted the Heads of State, the Minister said an inquiry into another government official who had called the Prime Minister a mental patient, had not yielded results even after a year.
Over a year and no report. This is the state of the government, he said.
The Health Minister stressed that amidst strong opposition from him, the former Ministry Secretary and the Health Services Deputy Director General had gone ahead with the appointment.
He said he had to even seek the Presidents assistance to have the acting director removed from his post yesterday.

Budget allocation for early childhood development to be upped
Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said that the government has recognised the importance of early childhood development (ECD) and measures have already been taken to increase the allocation from the national budget for the improvement of ECD centres.
Attending the launch of the National Census of Early Childhood Development 2016 yesterday at Waters Edge, Minister Bandara said that instilling a positive attitude, discipline and skills in children at a young age will foster the development of human capital for the countrys future.
An ECD centre is where the foundation for education is made. Building a nation based on good health, education and life skills is the foundation for a countrys development, she said.
She said that most teachers at the early childhood centres have no adequate qualifications and even parents are unaware of the importance of early childhood education.
Minister Bandara further said that this was the first time such a project was conducted in South Asia.
The Early Childhood Development (ECD) project is funded by World Bank and implemented under the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MWCA) with the objective of ensuring equitable access to and improving the quality of ECD services.
The census reported that 578,160 children in the two-five year age group were attending 19,668 ECD centres around the country. Of them nearly 47.6 percent were five years old, while further 37.3 percent were four years old. The attendance of younger children at the centres was relatively low: about 1.8 percent were two years old, while 13.3 percent were three years old.
A majority (70.8 percent) of centres in Sri Lanka were managed by private individuals or organisations. A further, 19.8 percent were managed by the government (local government authorities and other government institutions). Of the rest, 6.5 percent were managed by religious organisations and 3 percent by non-governmental organisations.
The report also affirmed Minister Bandaras statement on the lack of qualified teachers in ECD centres. The report stated that a majority teachers (59.9 percent) and teacher assistants (62.8 percent) possessed GCE A/L qualifications. About 33.6 percent of teachers and 31 percent of teacher assistants possessed GCE O/L qualifications.
The percentages of teachers and teacher assistants with degrees and higher educational qualifications were 3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. Teacher and teacher assistants with educational qualifications below GCE O/L were around 2 percent to 5 percent respectively.

Cabinet approves LRT projects feasibility studies
The feasibility studies of the first two Light Rail Transit (LRT) projects from Colombo Fort to Battaramulla and Malabe, received Cabinet approval this week.
Cabinet approval was also granted for the signing of the loan agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Government of Japan (GOJ). GOSL had request GOJ for an Official Development Assistance Loan under the Special Term for Economic Partnership (STEM).
The estimated cost of the project is 253,028 million JPY, which includes 206,106 million JPY from JICA component and 46,922 million JPY from the GOSL.
The LRTs come under the Megapolis Transport Master Plan proposed in the Western Region Megapolis Master Plan - 2030 prepared by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
Seven LRTs had been proposed, and two which connect Colombo Fort with other main centres, while extending to the Battaramulla and Malabe areas, had been chosen as the priority lines to be implemented first. The two lines are to be constructed as elevated lines due to the high-density of development in the area.
JICA had conducted preparatory survey with the Megapolis Ministrys cooperation, to come up with a feasibility study for the project. Based on findings of the final report of the Preparatory Survey, a New Light Rail Transit System in Colombo with a length of 17 km from Malabe to a Multi-Modal Transport Hub at Fort consisting of 16 stations and a depot, had been declared feasible. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) too, is at its final stage and the Resettlement Action Plan had also been completed by Project Management Unit and submitted to JICA for their concurrence.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka pointed out that JICA expected the loan agreement to be signed by end of 2018 to complete detail design in 2019 and for civil works to be commenced by 2020, with commercial operations to begin by 2025.
The loan is to be provided at a concessionary rate of 0.1 percent per annum for civil works and procurement of equipment and 0.01 percent per annum for consultancy services, with 0.2 percent of the loan amount as fronted free. The repayment period of the loan is 40 years, including a grace period of 12 years.

Cabinet nod for programme to provide grants
The government would implement a rapid programme to hand over land grants to 1.1 million families who currently hold land permits between 2019 and 2020.
Cabinet approval was granted to the above project proposed by a joint Cabinet paper by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatileka.
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, addressing the Cabinet media briefing yesterday, said those families had held land permits for generations, unable to develop or sell their lands; This will provide many opportunities for them. They have been following officials for years, attempting to convert their land permits to deeds or grants so that they can write it to their children.
There has been a great deal of corruption involved in the process, but this will solve all those problems, he said.
He added that whilst certain individuals question that the land grants may leave their bearers open for exploitation, a survey conducted by the Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry had revealed that over the years, 96 percent of the beneficiaries had not misused or sold their lands; Therefore, we cannot have 96 percent of them punished because of the minority.
The government, under the Land Development Ordinance, had handed over more than 1 million land permits, and of them, 930,082 had been converted into land grants. However, grants had not been provided for land permits issued for 700,000 blocks of land and 436,992 blocks under Jayabhoomi permits.
To enable such a process, a survey of all such lands is currently being carried out. Accordingly, 1.1 million land grants would be issued between 2019 and 2020, through the accelerated programme.

Adding sugar in tea manufacture
I read with interest the article by Walter Wuthmann in the Daily News dated June 29. Having been a tea planter for over forty years and having obtained very good tea prices for the teas manufactured on the estates I was in charge, I would like to make a few notes on this subject.
The good tea prices I obtained was not by adding sugar or any other external agents but by getting a good standard of green leaf to the tea factory. The saying goes Tea factory is to get a good standard of green leaf for manufacture. No Estate Superintendent or factory officer can make good tea with coarse green tea leaf. The green tea leaf arriving at the tea factory for manufacture should be 80% good tea leaf.
The green tea leaf should not be damaged or heated up in transport, and after weighing at the tea factory should be spread out in withering troughs or tats with minimal or no hot air being used for withering. Thereafter the withered leaf is fed into rollers, rolled for thirty minutes, sifted, fermented and fired in the drier. The fired tea is graded, packed and sent to the tea brokers for sale at the Weekly Tea Auction. This is a process known to every tea planter. If sugar is added this I believe is done to accelerate the fermentation of dhools before firing. This is like adding sugar to Kasippu. The accepted refuse tea percentage is 3 to 5% and not beyond. If as the Minister says it is 15% there is something radically going wrong. The maintenance of correct plucking rounds should be closely checked by the superintendent in-charge or proprietor of the estate.
Declining of tea yields due to not increasing tea extents
The TRI has given proper guidelines on these subjects. The correct procedure to be adopted to increase tea yields, the tea fields have to be catagorized into A B C D.
A and B category are fields with good yields but world require infilling. C and D category fields are low yielding fields that have to uprooted and re-planted with high yielding clonal tea. Uprooting will start with D category fields and then C category fields.
The tea bush will tell the tale
It was the late General Ranjan Wijeratne who was a reputed tea planter who later became Chairman of Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation who uttered the words The tea bush will tell the tale when he visited estates meaning the tea bushes will indicate to him whether the Superintendent was working on that estate or not.

Clinical waste disposal issue at Karapitiya Hospital
Clinical waste disposal at the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital has come to a stanstill for several weeks now posing a grave health hazard to the public.
This is owing to a practical impediment faced by the contracting company responsible for the removal of the hospital's clinical waste.
The contractors who operated their incinerating plant in Mulleriyawa has faced a public outcry owing to which they had to stop the waste discarding process, it is learnt.
The incinerator installed at the hospital had been devastated and subsequently deactivated and it had not been replaced with a new one despite numerous requests made to Health Ministry authorities.
The accumulation of clinical waste prevails even at the Matara General Hospital and several other private hospitals in the area.
Hospital Director Dr. Jayampathi Senanayake admitted that the disposal of clinical waste has happened due to a snag faced by the contractors which has left clinical waste accumulating in large quantities creating a severe health risk.
The incinerator at the hospital has also ceased to function for a long time.

Nepal will re look at launching direct flights to Colombo once again said the Ambassador of Nepal, Professor Bishwambher Pyakurya.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the Sri Lanka-Nepal Friendship and Business Council networking event under the title, Foreign Investment Opportunities in Nepal, in Colombo he said that this matter is discussed once again.
The air link between Colombo and Kathmandu had previously been tried by Himalayan Airlines but was discontinued after flights reached only 40% capacity.
Whether or not a direct flight between Kathmandu and Colombo would be established in the near future were also the most pertinent questions of the evening.
Many at the event and senior officials from the tourism industry in Nepal and Sri Lanka made the point that both countries could capitalize on their tourist seasons, which flow into one another.
Tourists migrate towards the cooler climates of Nepal and the Himalayas in the summers, but the season abruptly ends in the fall.
A direct flight between Kathmandu and Colombo may be more viable with a stopover in an Indian destination to increase capacity a participant said.
The evening also focused on strengthening economic ties between Sri Lanka and Nepal through infrastructure, energy, and tourism.
The four-member panel at the event included President of the Sri Lanka Nepal Council Jagath Savanadasa, Professor of Economics at the University of Colombo Dr. Sirimal Abeyratne, and President of SLs Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ruwan Edirisinghe.

A doctor who cared
For a very long time, Sri Lanka has been categorised as a country on the road to being developed. In the journey towards reaching developed status, the island continues to face grave challenges. Many of the countrys citizens still find it difficult to get access to clean drinking water. In other places, people receive step-motherly treatment, beaten by drought and trapped in the humanelephant conflict. When the North and the South are fast developing, the middle is often ignored. Many in these areas have no steady income and live in harsh circumstances.
This story comes from the village of Nanneriya, in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat in Kurunegala. It is of a doctor who faced adversity with a smile and took on the challenge of turning around a small hospital into hope for a whole village.
Doctors these days do not have the best of reputations. Their names have come to be attached more with trade union action rather than service. But in Nanneriya, one doctor stands above all in her capacity to serve the people who need it the most. To serve when no one else would.
Dr. Niranjali Siriwardena has worked for the past few years at the Nanneriya Divisional Hospital, winning the hearts of not only those in the village, but also those in the surrounding villages.
Nanneriya Divisional Hospital
The Nanneriya Divisional Hospital was started in 1938 and, according to the Hospital Development Committee Vice President M.W.P. Somasiri, it was first started as a maternity clinic.
In 1952, an OPD section was established and people could come to see a doctor and get medicine. Since then, a large number of doctors have worked at this hospital. But we have never had a doctor like her, he said.
The hospital in general requires three doctors to function, but since its inception, it has had trouble in attracting and keeping doctors who would like to work in such a remote and difficult area.
Dr. Siriwardena, who first came to Nanneriya Hospital in April 2014, found herself thrown into the deep end. This was her first posting after graduation and thus she had to learn fast to survive and thrive in Nanneriya.
A year after she arrived, her colleague, another doctor, was transferred out and for the last three years she has been running the hospital all on her own. She was the only doctor available.
She does the work of three doctors, said Somasiri. Many doctors before her complained that they would only work if there are at least two doctors in the hospital. She did not complain, but took over the whole hospital and ran it. She is very efficient, she comes to work at 7 am and sits in that chair and treats patients until 5pm or 6pm. She talks to them and to be honest, she provides a service above and beyond her role.
The good doctor
Sujeewa Priyadarshani, a resident in Nanneriya, has built a close relationship with the resident doctor.
We have treated her like part of our own families, she said. She is very pleasant and talks nicely to us. Though this was her first posting, she did not immediately leave us saying it was a difficult place to work in. Many doctors before her left soon after they arrived because they considered it too difficult to work here. She is now leaving us. we are very sad about it.
Dr. Siriwardena will leave Nanneriya this week as her time there has come to an end and she has been transferred to another area.
Some patients, when they finally meet the doctor after having spent a long time in the queue, immediately feel better once they speak to her. I think she has some power to cure people because after having spoken to her, at times we forget why we came to see the doctor in the first place.
Priyadarshani also observed that around 350-500 patients would visit Dr. Siriwardena every day and she would patiently tend to them all, working seven days a week.
Given her dedication, it is not only the residents of Nanneriya who have come to regard the doctor highly. Word had spread that her hands could cure and patients from surrounding villages too started to come see her for their ailments.
S.L. Razik, a resident of Wannikudawewa, observed that patients from Giribawa, Nawagattegama, Welewewa, Moragahawewa, Iginimitiya, Palugolla, Kaatuwewa, Sangappalaya, Wanniamunukole, Nallachchiya, Siyambalewa, and Galgamuwa would come to see the doctor even though they had better hospitals in their own areas.
The doctor does not take a break, she works all seven days a week. I have to say that she rendered a remarkable service during her time here. There were times when she did not even have time to eat. I have seen, with my own eyes, her sipping water to satiate her hunger. A lot of people suffer from mental issues. Some have issues at home. Our doctor would listen to all of them. We share our stories with her. she does not look to any racial or religious divisions.
Overcoming challenges
Life however had not always been easy for the doctor. Given her success, there have been times where certain parties unhappy about her popularity threatened her and asked her to leave the hospital. R.S.P. Kumari, a resident of Polwatte, Maha Nanneriya, recalled that there was a time when thugs came to her official quarters and threatened her with violence if she did not leave. But Dr. Siriwardena forged ahead regardless of the threats. When rumours spread that she had asked for a transfer, Kumari said the whole village turned up at the hospital and begged her to stay,
The blood pressure of many of the older women rose during that incident. That is the kind of relationship we have with our doctor.
Some doctors work just for their salary, but our doctor is not like that, she added. She is friendly to all. There has been no other doctor in this hospital who has been like a daughter, mother, teacher and sister to us. Those before her would come to the hospital at 8 am sharp and leave by noon, regardless of whether there are patients or not. But our doctor is not like that, she would never leave her seat if there was a patient waiting for her outside. When she speaks to the old, calling them mother or father, some start to cry because they experience the love they yearn from their children from her.
This job cannot be done by all doctors. It is not easy to work here. It is difficult for them to win the hearts of the people. At times this hospital runs out of essential drugs and because it is not a main hospital, it is also not often that we get expensive drugs. But the doctor has intervened to get these drugs from other hospitals, so the poor dont have to suffer.
Many in this area are daily labourers and are extremely poor, said retired Principal J. M. Ranga Bandara. At times they dont even have the money to take the bus to come and get the medicine. The doctor has helped many such patients. She writes the prescription for drugs that need to be bought from the pharmacy and then asks the patients whether they have the money to purchase them. To be honest, many dont have money to buy drugs from a pharmacy. It is because of this sensitive nature of hers that we all love her. At any time of the day or night, if a patient is hospitalised, she would rush to the hospital. There have been plenty of times where she has been seen running to the ambulance with an oxygen tank because there were no staff at the hospital to do that.
Born in Mahara, Kadawatha, Dr. Siriwardena came to this village in the hope of doing her utmost for the people. And her most important contribution has been the desire to truly listen to those who come to her. At a time when doctors hardly have time to listen to the basic needs of their patients, Dr. Siriwardena has proved to be an exception.
Learning to listen
There are many people who suffer from mental illness in these areas, said R.H.M. Punchimenika. As a result, many are suicidal. The doctor spends a lot of time with such patients. She tries to save every patient who is admitted after an attempt at suicide. At times, she tries her best to transfer patients who have been bitten by snakes, who cant be treated here, to other hospitals so that their lives can be saved. Our doctor has also cured patients who have had infected limbs where other doctors have simply recommended amputation. They all say that they walk today because of this doctor. We also have many kids addicted to drugs in this area. The doctor takes great effort in guiding them along the right path. Some people spend money to travel 15-20 km just to come and see our doctor.
Nanneriya Hospital Family Health Services Officer Indrani Lalitha Kumari said it was very rare to find such a doctor. Not everyone is like her. Everyone on the staff has great respect for her. She is very humble when she works with us. She is very motivated to work here and serve the people. It is not easy for all doctors to be like her. But she always does her duty by the patient.
Finally, as Dr. Siriwardena prepares to leave this week, she said, with tears in her eyes, From the day I came to work at this hospital, people have treated me well. I too have reciprocated similarly. I am close to all to the extent that though a patient comes to me for treatment, he or she also tells me about all their problems at home.
There are some who simply drop into see me even when they are not sick. Many in this area are not rich. So I have helped many of them as much as I could. When this hospital runs out of drugs for kidney patients, I have had the drugs brought from other hospitals. I believe in sacrificing a lot for my patients. It has been something I was taught in my childhood.
I will be satisfied if I could serve society and its people during the short time between birth and death. It has been four years since I came here and the time has come for me to leave. I have spent so much of time with all the people here that I feel quite sad to leave. If I am given the opportunity to return, I would do so.
The Nanneriya Divisional Hospital has been crowded for the past few days. They are all not patients. They are those who are grateful to Dr. Siriwardena for having come to their hospital and turned things around for them.

Dont Keep Sally..!
It was a video clip of a lion, most probably an escapee from a zoo walking freely on one of Chennais bridges! The person shooting the video, had even rolled his glass down to get a closer shot obviously excited that he had a forward that would go viral, but in doing so, I wondered whether they knew they were endangering their own life and others in the car
You dont fool round with a lion, do you
For eight years, Sally had been the Romero family pet. She was only one foot long when they brought her home, but Sally grew and grew until eventually she reached a length of eleven feet and weighed eighty pounds.
Then one day Sally, a Burmese python, turned on 15 year old Derek, strangling the unsuspecting teenager until he died of suffocation. Police said the pet snake was quite aggressive, hissing and reacting when they arrived to investigate the young mans death.
We as a country have a national pet and its name is Corruption!
Like Sally the python, we have seen it grow from a little snake to a python of giant proportions. Like the king of beasts I saw in the video this pet continuously stalks the country, a roaring lion and finds willing victims everywhere!
A few years ago the watchman in charge of security met me, Sir, he said, we caught some boys stealing metal grills from the compound. We suspect they also stole car radios and lift petrol from parked vehicles during the night!
Take them to the police, I said and started hurrying away.
Sir, these boys are from our locality!
I was shocked. The parents were called, they begged not to do anything harsh to their sons. They slapped and thrashed them. One boy looked at his father strangely. Why are you thrashing me dad he asked.
For stealing, shouted his furious father, I am so ashamed of you!
What about the exam papers
What papers asked the father taken by surprise.
The ones you bought for my engineering entrance exam Wasnt that also a form of stealing What about the red lights you cut and bribes you pay to traffic policemen
Well talk at home, said his dad hurriedly, as he took his son and left.
The question papers we buy our children, the grease we put into the hands of officials are all like little Sally the python. Innocent little amounts that help things work faster. But Sally grows and grows until one fine day, we find our children or even ourselves caught in its deadly coils.
Kill that leopard of corruption or that lion as it comfortably lives side by side with us.
Dont keep Sally..!

EU- SL investor dialogue consolidates economic relations, resolves important matters
The sixth EU- Sri Lanka investor dialogue was held at the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade recently.
Many of the earlier outstanding matters had been resolved through dialogue and the joint efforts of the Sri Lanka and EU authorities.
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama who chaired sessions and led the Sri Lanka delegation said, We are making an effort on our side to clear all issues. I wish to thank the Ambassadors for their support and co-operation. I am very pleased that we have made considerable progress in resolving outstanding issues and building up our relations with the European Union on a solid foundation.
Tun Lai Margue, Ambassador of the European Union replied to the Minister and said, We are very pleased to meet again and I agree with the Minister that we have managed to resolve many of the issues that existed between Sri Lanka and European Union. Among the matters which were discussed was the need to always ensure transparency when it comes to tendering procedures. This was very important to build up confidence in the European Union for Sri Lanka. It is also factor that impacts significantly on considerably the attraction of FDI inflows to a country.
Minister Samarawickrama was assisted by Chandanie Wijewardena, Secretary Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General of the BOI and Mangala Yapa, Board Member of the BOI.
The Sri Lanka institutions present were the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, the Department of Public Finance, Ministry of Digital Infrastructure, Sri Lanka Customs, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka, Inland Revenue Department, Department of Fiscal Policy and the Department of Emigration and Immigration.
Ambassador to the European Union Tun Lai Margue was assisted by Jorn Rohde, Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Charge d Affaires of Romania Victor Chiujdea and senior diplomats of European Union countries.
The event was co-ordinated by Roshan Lyman, Deputy, Political, Trade and Commercial Section, EU mission in Colombo.
Both sides also discussed other matters such as the need for Sri Lanka to accept digital signatures on documents and the promotion of paperless communication.
Other matters for discussion included issues relating to specific companies such as payments of dues and the acceptance by Sri Lanka of classifications of products of the European Union such as the term energyon food and drinks labels as well as colour coding to identify sugar levels in food and beverage products.
The question of noise pollution at a resort hotel was also discussed and a solution was sought.
At a macroeconomic and strategic level the European Union represents an important source of investment for Sri Lanka.
In the period 2005  2016, EU enterprises operating under BOI invested an estimated US$2.5 billion in Sri Lanka.
The bulk sectors for investment were manufacturing (other than textile and apparel) valued at US$ 557 million; textile and apparel manufacture (US$ 327 million); telecommunications (US$ 617 million): Airline services (US$ 325 million); and power generation (US$ 255 million).
The leading European Union countries in terms of FDI to Sri Lanka are the United Kingdom with 90 projects under BOI (of which 54 exporters), Germany (42 projects, 31 exporters), the Netherlands (29 projects, 14 exporters), Sweden (20 projects, 13 exporters) Italy (18 projects, 14 exporters, France (13 projects, 10 exporters) and Belgium (10 projects of which 6 exporters). The EU-Sri Lanka dialogue is therefore a vital forum that offers considerable opportunities for attracting European investment to Sri Lanka.

Facebook broke British law; faces maximum  fine for Cambridge Analytica scandal
Facebook broke British law by failing to safeguard user data, and by not telling tens of millions of people how Cambridge Analytica harvested their information for use in political campaigns, British authorities announced Tuesday.
The platform faces a 500,000 fine - the largest allowed under Britains data protection law -- from the United Kingdoms Information Commissioners Office.
The agency launched an investigation into Facebooks data security practices following the revelation in March that political data firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of as many as 87 million Facebook (FB) users worldwide.
Investigators focused on the question of whether anyone involved with the campaigns for or against Brexit misused that information. Investigators have seized dozens of servers and other equipment containing hundreds of terabytes of data.
The ICO released its report shortly after midnight Wednesday in the UK.
Its findings will be of interest to U.S agencies, including the FBI, Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, investigating Facebooks role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
The British company worked on Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign.
A source familiar with the inquiries told CNN that the SEC is examining the timing of Facebooks disclosure of the data transfer to investors, while the FTC is looking into whether the data transfer violated a 2011 consent decree that governs how the platform can use consumer information.
Facebook faces mounting scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators concerned about its handling user data and how a Russian operation with ties to the Kremlin exploited the platform to foment discord in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election.
Zuckerberg has conceded to lawmakers and the media that his company failed to protect its users, a point Erin Egan, Facebooks chief privacy officer, repeated Tuesday.
As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015, she said in a statement. (CNN)

Facelift for Ninewells Caring for life
From birth to the twilight years of her life, the woman plays an important part in maintaining the balance in life along with men. Both sexes are interdependent and complement each other. Though not the ultimate goal of a woman, she shines in motherhood as a guardian of a child, showering that child with tender love raising her sons to become princes and her daughters to become as strong as her. The womans influence in the life of a child cannot be dismissed. She is vital to the flow and energy in life.
Sri Lankas only private sector hospital specializing total mother and baby care, Ninewells Hospital re-launched its corporate identity with renewed focus, expanding its emphasis to the entirety of woman and child care. There is no doubt that Ninewells is renowned as the best private hospital for maternity care. Mothers and children matter to Ninewells the most.
Ninewells, Director Marketing, Nilantha Rathnayake, pointed out that Ninewells hospital is the only dedicated specialized women and childcare hospital in the large hospital category in the country. Other hospitals also offer the same service but as a part of their general service portfolio. Not as a specialist in that segment of the market.
The core business is still maternity care and we deliver almost 600 babies a month and 4,500 babies a year, and while doing that we thought we needed to broaden our scope giving added facilities to womens health, so we have established the Healthy Womans Center as well as all other facilities and we have looked at broadening the fertility center. Our success rate in the fertility center in comparison to other hospitals is very high. We will be improving the fertility center as well, said Rathnayake.
Ninewells Medical Director Dr. Vibash Wijeratne, said that Ninewells has taken a strategic decision, from repositioning of its brand from mother and baby to a woman and child care hospital.
By doing so, Ninewells is able to take care of a larger audience. When you say woman it encapsulates pregnancy, new born baby, grown up baby, the toddler, teenager, adolescence, grown up woman and becoming pregnant. We can take care of the entire life cycle of a woman in that way. We are a 110 bed hospital and we have dedicated 60 to women care and another 40 beds for pediatric, said Wijeratne.
Wijeratne pointed out that they have done a complete revamp into the website and the APP is very informative and interactive.
Under Access international, the hospital is now being managed by professionals in hospital management. And staff training, specifically nursing, inclusions of best doctors and consultants offering services, capacity building and introducing quality and best practices are some of them, said Wijeratne.
Ninewells, Director, Dr. Thiasha Fernando, said that Ninewells has always been reputed to be a mother and baby hospital.
We have now repositioned ourselves and expand more to cater to women and child care. This means that we can provide broader health care for women throughout their entire life cycle, starting from the birth of a baby. We have a very good NICU (Neonatal intensive care unit) team. Our care also involves pediatric care, Gynecological treatment and Obstetric care. We also have sub specialties like pediatric dentistry, ENT and a state of the art radiology department as well. Our web site gives a lot of information and it is very user friendly and accessible, she explained.
The APP focuses on our core business which is the mother and baby, giving the mother information every week while the baby is growing in the womb and give some comfort tips on pregnancy and having a baby and being a new mother, said Fernando. Fernando pointed out that sustainable care is always at hand for the mother and children. The team at Ninewells is one of the best in the country with state of the art technology and facilities.
This is because family is most important to them. Their vision is good quality standardized health care for women and children.
Director of Ninewells board and Group Director of Access International main board, Shamal Perera pointed out that the initiative of the hospital is to give unparalleled service to expecting mothers and women before expecting and after they deliver the child and as they grow older, give a service unparalleled in healthcare and wellness in Sri Lanka. Ninewells is the only specialized hospital in the country. We believe we are in a niche area of a business that has a lot of scope and we want to bring happiness to parents. You can see this when someone becomes a parent for the first time.
It is a fantastic feeling and we believe there is a lot of room for growth in this sector. We have around 4,500 babies being born at Ninewells every year and we believe it is the highest in the private sector in the country.
We pride ourselves on this. We have all the facilities needed. We are equipped for any situation whether it is a mother or a child. We give superior service, Perera said.

Federer suffers shock Wimbledon quarter-final loss to Anderson
London, Wednesday: Roger Federer suffered a stunning Wimbledon exit as the defending champion blew a two-set lead and wasted a match point in a 2-6, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 6-4, 13-11 quarter-final defeat against South Africa's Kevin Anderson on Wednesday.
Federer's bid to win a ninth Wimbledon title came to an astonishing end as the Swiss star collapsed in a nail-biting four hour and 13 minute classic that ranks as one of the tournament's greatest upsets.
It was Federer's earliest departure from Wimbledon since his shock second round defeat against Sergiy Stakhovsky in 2013.
Eighth seed Anderson will play 2016 runner-up Milos Raonic or American ninth seed John Isner on Friday for a place in Sunday's final.
"Down two sets to love I tried my best to keep fighting. Beating Roger Federer here at Wimbledon will be one I remember, especially in such a close match," Anderson said.
"I kept telling myself to keep believing. I said today is going to be my day. You need that mindset against Roger.
"I'm ecstatic. That's what you work so hard for. Matches likes that are very special."
For the only the second time at Wimbledon, Federer was beaten after holding a two-set lead, with his previous loss from that position coming against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the 2011 quarter-finals.
The 20-time Grand Slam champion appeared to be moving towards his fifth successive Wimbledon semi-final after taking the opening two sets.
That initial burst gave Federer 34 successive sets won at Wimbledon, equalling his own record set between 2005 and 2006.
But, playing on Court One for the first time in three years, Federer was unusually error-prone and became visibly frustrated as eighth seed Anderson refused to surrender.
Anderson had failed to take a single set off Federer in their previous four meetings.
Yet once he had ended Federer's run of holding serve for 85 consecutive games -- a streak dating back to last year's semi-final -- Anderson's confidence soared.
Deploying his huge serve to lethal effect, Anderson roared back to leave the champion's title bid in tatters thanks to a barrage of 28 aces and 65 winners.
Anderson is the first South African man to make the last four at Wimbledon since Kevin Curren in 1983.
The 32-year-old made his maiden Grand Slam final appearance as last year's US Open, losing to Rafael Nadal.
But his run at Wimbledon might have come as a surprise even to Anderson, who had never made it past the fourth round prior to this year and lost in the first round of the grass-court event at Queen's Club last month.
Not since Wayne Ferreira in 1994 had a South African man made the Wimbledon quarter-finals, but Anderson wasn't overawed by the occasion.
Federer didn't seemed bothered by being away from Centre Court when he cruised through the first set in just 26 minutes.
But he lost his rhythm at the start of the second set as Anderson made his move.
Federer responded, quickly breaking back before taking the set in a tie-break.
But Anderson was just getting started.
He saved a match point at 4-5 when Federer missed a forehand, then broke to serve for the third set.
Federer was completely out of sorts by now and his uncharacteristic struggles on his forehand didn't improve in the fourth set.
Anderson scented blood and, out-duelling Federer time and again, he broke in the seventh game to level the match at two sets all.
Federer couldn't convert a break point at 3-4 and as the final set headed into extra time a lone voice in the crowd, mindful of England's imminent World Cup semi-final against Croatia, shouted out "Hurry up I need to watch the football".
Only once before had Federer played more games at a Grand Slam and on that occasion, he prevailed 16-14 in the 2009 Wimbledon final against Andy Roddick.
But this time Federer cracked, serving his first double fault at 11-11 to give Anderson the crucial break that ushered the Swiss legend to the exit door. AFP

NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf Championship 2018:
First schools event for National, Private or International Schools
For 2018, Sri Lankas most popular junior golf tournament, sponsored by expert financial planner NDB Wealth, will add a new segment to the tournament with the introduction of schools. Re-branded as the NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf Championship, registrations for the tournament are currently open.
The tournament is scheduled for August 8 at the historic Royal Colombo Golf Course (RCGC) with the inclusion of the first-ever schools event, including pupils of any registered National, Private or International School in Sri Lanka. The format for this tournament is being altered as follows:
There will be a Team Event where schools can field a team of two players below 19 years. A school can field more than one team. Team pairings can be 2 girls, 2 boys or 1 girl and 1 boy where all will play 18 holes. Playing tee markers will be as per the Senior or Junior Individual Events specified below and the winner of the schools team event will have the lowest team aggregate score.
The Individual Event is being narrowed down to Senior and Junior Divisions, which are further broken down into Boys and Girls. This enables participants to compete for the following trophies, certificates and prizes in the Senior Division [over 12 years and below 19 years]: Boys winner, Boys 1st runner-up, Boys 2nd runner-up, Girls winner, Girls 1st runner-up and Girls 2nd runner-up. Junior Division (under 12 years) golfers will fight it out for trophies, certificates and prizes for Boys winner, Boys 1st runner-up, Boys 2nd runner-up, Girls winner, Girls 1st runner-up and Girls 2nd runner-up. Last years tournament saw Taniya Minel Balasuriya winning the Gold category (aged 15 to 17 years), with Levon Niyarepola topping the Silver category (aged 12 to 14 years). Nirekh Tejwani and Kvahn Tejwani were the victors in the Bronze (aged 10 to 11 years) and the Copper (aged nine years and below) categories, respectively.
With a revitalized mission that has added schools to the mix, we hope to propel the sport of Junior golf to greater heights across Sri Lanka.
Now in its 4th year, the re-branded NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf Championship encourages planning, foresight, calculation and competition, which are vital skills seen in both exemplary financial planners, and the best golfers.
We invite all youngsters to participate, and even get their schools involved, and see how they measure up against Sri Lankas best junior talent, said Prabodha Samarasekera, CEO of NDB Wealth.

This indicatesa poor return on costly educational investments at the tertiary-level anda source of social distress. As a part of their recruitment efforts on university campuses, the private sector should offer paid internships during university holidays, to provide a taste of what it really means to work in a competitive business.These internships should also becomea compulsory part of all degree courses. University careers services should be properly resourced and forge links with the private sector and state institutions.
The recently published Sri Lanka Development Update 20181 by the World Bank focuses on creating more and better jobs for an upper middle-income Sri Lanka. It usefully analyses the state of Sri Lankas labour market and identifies challenges to attaining this development goal.
The World Bank reports deep dive into the issue of womens labour force participation in Sri Lanka, including in post-conflict areas, is particularly thought-provoking. The report also reiterates the World Banks usual macroeconomic narrative about slow growth and lacklustre progress in economic reforms.
In my view, Sri Lankas experience does not tally with the typical Arthur Lewis model, in which surplus labour moves from the low-productivity rural sector to drive the expansion of a high-productivity modern sector. Today, Sri Lanka has a paradoxical combination of slow growth (3.2% in the first quarter of 2018)2 and labour scarcity (a low unemployment rate of 4.2% in 20173).
A tight labour market means that the private sector is increasingly starved for skilled labour. Although several international and domestic factors are shackling Sri Lankas growth, the labour market deserves special attention. The time is ripe for a few well-implemented measures to increase labour market flexibility and boost growth. The private sector has to raise its game too.
Four kinds of labour market issues merit serious discussion in Sri Lanka. First, the World Bank report rightly identifies the need to raise female participation rates to increase Sri Lankas labour supply amidst its transition to an aging population.
Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen candidly observed that investing a dollar in girls secondary education provides the best social return4 on development finance. In this vein, Japan is trying to increase female participation rates as a part of the so-called Abenomics structural reforms. Affordable child care is a key need, including in subsidised nurseries at large private firms and community-run creches at the village-level, to encourage mothers to return to work.
The top Sri Lankan firms should unilaterally set the example and others are likely to follow. Another need is ending harassment of women at the workplace and on transport through a MeTo social media movement, with compulsory workplace training in both the private and public sectors.
Second, while the mismatch in available and required skills in the private sector is mentioned in the World Bank report, a missing issue is the poor English language ability of worker,s which hampers labour productivity in the countrys growing services sector.
When wages rose in Bangalores global IT hub a decade ago, Indian firms did not come to neighbouring Sri Lanka, partly due to a shortage of ample supplies of English speaking graduates. Instead, Indian IT firms went to the Philippines to set up shop.
The language problem is compounded by a lack of competent English teachers. A radical solution from East Asia is to import low-cost but competent English teachers from the Philippines on short-term work visas under a technical cooperation arrangement.
A similar scheme may be developed for importing Chinese teachers given a growing Chinese tourist and investor presence in Sri Lanka and a dearth of Chinese-speaking local workers and managers.
Unemployed Arts graduates
Third, the World Bank report discusses the unemployed Arts graduates. Almost half (48%) of university graduates in 2016 were from an academic programme in the arts.
This indicates a poor return on costly educational investments at the tertiary-level and a source of social distress, which have propelled two youth insurrections in Southern Sri Lanka. As a part of their recruitment efforts on university campuses, the private sector should offer paid internships during university holidays, to provide a taste of what it really means to work in a competitive business.
These internships should also become a compulsory part of all degree courses. University careers services should be properly resourced and forge links with the private sector and state institutions.
Furthermore, charging even affordable, modest fees for university education would attune young minds to job market prospects. It might also reduce incentives for antisocial behaviour like ragging and unjustified student protests.
Finally, the cost of a bloated public sectoraccounting for 14.4% of employmentreceives scant mention in the World Bank report.
The public sector has historically been the employer of choice for the average graduate, due to lifetime employment and a pension. But fiscal constraints linked to a high debt to GDP ratio of about 77%7 means that this is increasingly unsustainable.
New Zealand example
The New Zealand example of trimming the public sector may be instructivereforms there included a combination of a national public-sector employment audit, natural departures due to early retirement, a redundancy/retraining scheme, increased lateral entry from outside, and introducing new technologies. Salaries were also raised for remaining civil servants that provided incentives for improved productivity and service delivery. Whatever reform is possible within current political circumstance, it should be gradually implemented over a decade.
Decades of providing free education and health care, along with food subsidies, gave Sri Lanka a reputation for being a success story among developing countries in providing basic needswith an ample supply of cheap, literate, and productive labour.
This helped to attract export-oriented foreign investment to the clothing industry and created about 900,000 jobs 8 after the country opened up in 1977. But the reputation of Sri Lankan labour may be at risk following a 30-year civil war, alternative spending priorities, and growing institutional imperfections. Combining private sector action with labour market reforms can help put Sri Lanka firmly on the road to upper-middle income status.

Former Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya D.P. Kumarage said that although three months had lapsed since he was removed from the Basnayake Nilame post, no disciplinary inquiry had been held so far. As such, he considered his removal as part of a major conspiracy.
He said he was removed with the assurance that an investigation would be conducted in three months and a decision would be made consequently. As nothing had been done in this direction so far, it was incumbent on the Buddhasasana Minister to reinstate him in the post.
He said this after he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their temples in Kandy and received their blessings yesterday.

France reach World Cup final as Paris erupts
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Tuesday: France reached their third World Cup final after overcoming Belgium on Tuesday, sparking scenes of unconfined joy in Paris as tens of thousands of people poured into the streets.
In scenes reminiscent of Frances 1998 World Cup win, delirious crowds surged up the Champs-Elysees avenue and surrounded the Arc de Triomphe, waving flags and letting off flares.
A header from Samuel Umtiti in Saint Petersburg was enough to give Didier Deschamps team a 1-0 win against Belgium.
The 49-year-old coach is now just one win away from winning the World Cup -- 20 years after he captained the team to victory on home soil.
The tournament favourites must wait 24 hours to discover whether they will play England or Croatia in Sundays final in Moscows Luzhniki Stadium but they will approach the game brim full of confidence.
Belgium started the stronger of the two teams but Umtitis header from a corner in the 51st minute was the pivotal moment as the defender stole the limelight from jet-heeled Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann.
Frances other hero was goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who made a spectacular fingertip save in the first half to deny Toby Alderweireld and then kept out Alex Witsels drive as Belgium cranked up the pressure towards the end of the match.
Deschamps said he was delighted to have the chance to bury the pain of the Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won in Paris.
I am very happy for my players, he said. It was hard against a very good Belgium team. I take my hat off to my players and my staff.
Finals have to be won because we have still not got over the one we lost two years ago, he added.
France started the tournament in Russia slowly, struggling for goals in the group stages but hit their stride in an impressive 4-3 victory against Lionel Messis Argentina in the first knockout round.
Boasting an impressive combination of experience and youthful zest, they controlled their quarter-final against Uruguay, running out comfortable 2-0 winners.
The defeat is painful for Belgium, foiled at the semi-final for the second time in their history, as the clock ticks on their so-called golden generation.
Captain Eden Hazard dazzled in patches but Kevin De Bruyne was quiet and Romelu Lukaku was a shadow of the player he had been earlier in the tournament, even though Belgium enjoyed most of the possession.
Martinez bemoaned the goal his team conceded from a corner.
I couldnt ask more of the players attitude, he said. If you are going to have to lose such a match, which is bearable, it is the manner in which our players lost, pushing for everything, trying everything until the final whistle.  AFP

Future of banking is digital information sharing-HSBC head Ajay Sharma
Trade within Asia has exceeded trade with both the US and with Europe in recent years and this trend would continue in the future too, Ajay Sharma, head of trade finance for HSBCs Asia-Pacific region told a recent forum in Colombo.
An emerging middle class will require more manufacturing; it will create more consumption and will drive significant economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region in the coming years, Sharma told the 48th Annual General Meeting of the Shippers Council in Colombo on Monday.
To address these increases, Sharma advocated for the use of technology to streamline information sharing between trade partners. Commenting on digitization he said that it has helped to revolutionize the shipping sector and urged more companies to streamline information sharing through digitalization.
This would cut down cost and time expenditures by 33%.
He cited UN figures, estimating that if all of trade could be digitised, it would reduce the time taken to export by 33%, and cut costs by nearly a third. When a customer comes to us and provides papers to us, we convert it to a digital format, send it across to the other end. Theres another bank there. They look at the digital information, send it to their customer, who then submits more paper, and you get the story.
Today customers, shipping companies, all the freight forwarders and authorities, have all digitised their information. However they do not share information with each other digitally.

Future bright for Belgium despite failure to win trophy - Martinez
Belgiums future is bright despite a 1-0 World Cup semi-final defeat by France and the issue of an aging squad, says manager Roberto Martinez.
The Red Devils golden generation face the losers of Englands game with Croatia in Saturdays third-fourth play-off before going home.
Seven of Belgiums 23-man squad are in their 30s.
Belgian football has got a wealth of young talent coming through, said Martinez.
Belgium, who have never won a major tournament, impressed in Russia - knocking out Brazil in the quarter-finals - but fell short against a solid French side.
My disappointment is huge, said former Wigan and Everton boss Martinez.
It wasnt about having a good tournament and coming top four - it was about trying to win it. Its a sad dressing room now. We could easily have come to this stage and frozen. France are used to these big games but we coped with that side really well.
Martinez - whose side were unbeaten in 24 games until this defeat - extended his contract in May for another two years.
Its too early to make any assessment for the tournament, he said. We need to focus on the final game and fight for third place. Then well regroup.
As it happens in any big tournament, we need to look at the younger generation and try to become stronger from tournament to tournament. And in my role Ive got the eyes into Euro 2020 so its not the right moment to make an assessment just yet.
Samuel Umtitis header was the only goal at the Krestovsky Stadium in St Petersburg.
Martinez added: The difference between defeat and winning was down to one dead-ball situation.
Thats how close the game was. Im proud of my players. We gave everything we have got. You have to congratulate France and wish them well for the final.
France face the winners of Wednesdays England v Croatia game in Sundays final.
France manager Didier Deschamps says it is time to write a new, beautiful page as they reached their third final in six World Cups. Deschamps captained Les Bleus to their only World Cup win - in their home tournament in 1998.
I never mention my own history, he said. They know it. Some of them were not born but they have seen the pictures. The story is different now, I cant make comparisons and cant talk to them about players from 10 or 20 years ago.
Now is the time to make a new, beautiful page. One must live in their times, we cant look back and see what is in the rear-view mirror.
Deschamps was in charge two years ago when France were beaten finalists by Portugal in Euro 2016, another home tournament.
I was there two years ago and it was so painful that we want to taste the victory now.
We have to appreciate it and we are going to share this happiness with our families. We are going to do everything to be on the right side and make sure what happened two years ago does not happen again.
With our state of mind we can climb mountains and that is what we have done.  BBC

A futuristic vision
Politicians, they say, think of the next election but statesmen think of the next generation. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe have spoken about the Governments plans for the next generation, knowing very well that a country should have a vision for the future to prosper.
This is indeed the basis for the Governments Vision 2025 programme. The target is only seven years away. The UNs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with which many of our development plans are also aligned, calls for a 2030 deadline, just 12 years away. But most developed countries think even further ahead. Most countries have already announced long-term plans for 2040 and 2050. For example, many countries plan to phase out all fossil-fuel powered vehicles by 2040, paving the way for electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Sri Lanka too announced such a policy last year, giving a sign that our leadership is thinking in, and for, the long term.
Now Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has upped the ante, outlining bold plans to make Sri Lanka a fully developed country by 2050, around 32 years away. According to the Prime Minister, plans have already been formulated and the foundation laid to transform Sri Lanka into a fully developed country by 2050. Undoubtedly this is a challenging task which ought to be carried forward with patience and prudence by working with a group of people with divergent views, the Prime Minister said in Singapore, participating in a Question and Answer session of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Conference organised by the Trade and Industry Ministry of Singapore.
This is indeed a paradigm shift in our thinking patterns and a departure from the usual political slogans. As Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out, since Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean has been clearly understood the longtime target is to develop the country into an Economic, Financial and Social Centre. Indeed, we have made very little use of the strategic geographic location over the years. We must exploit this strategic location in the Indian Ocean to ensure economic development in a region which will be pivotal for global economic growth.
The upcoming Colombo International Financial Centre (Port City, which will be fully complete by 2040) and further developments in the Colombo Port will add impetus to these efforts. The Premier noted that Sri Lanka is taking dedicated efforts to create a society based on the export economy by inheriting new technology. Earlier, addressing the World Cities Summit in Singapore, the Prime Minister explained how two Urban Corridors will be developed soon, one along the 134 km-long Central Expressway leading to Kandy, and the other along the 241 km-long Southern Highway leading to the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport, which will eventually benefit around nine million people. This is a commendable move undertaken with an eye on the future.
The mega infrastructure project envisions the Western Province, which includes Colombo and the capital Sri Jayewardenepura as a Megapolis of interconnected metropolitan areas. This would include a Light Rail Transit system with elevated railways, elevated highways, a multi-modal transport hub, the development of old waterways, and three LNG plants. It will encompass a Logistics City, a Forest City, and an Aero City. These projects have the potential to take Sri Lanka to 2050 and beyond. There should be a bigger push for investments relating to the Mattala Airport and the Hambantota Port, inherited from the previous regime.
But all these plans must be seen in the context of a national development drive, encapsulated as a policy document that should not change when Governments change. This has unfortunately been the bane of local politics where policies change every five years or so. If these development projects are viewed from a national angle, not a political one, no future government will be able to curtail them. We must take a cue from developed countries where national policies are cherished by every Government, regardless of their political alignment. Corruption must also be eliminated completely from the social fabric.
No country can develop without helping the youth to prosper. The youth are tomorrows leaders may be a popular slogan, but this rhetoric must be translated into action. There is a large group of youth entrepreneurs in the country who should be provided assistance to rise and shine. If they are provided assistance for self-employment and SME projects, the grassroots communities will benefit. This should be part of any poverty alleviation strategy that looks to 2050. Sri Lanka already has very good education and health indices, but these sectors too should get more attention in the 2050 development plans.
We are generally used to thinking of a goods and services economy, but the knowledge economy factor is even more important as the world embraces Information Technology. We must lead the region in IT facilities and infrastructure, which is vital to attract more investments to the country. It is appropriate that the Prime Minister made these remarks in Singapore, whose success story is worthy of emulation. It is a winning formula that can be applied anywhere with positive results.

HONOURING Winnie the  Poohs  Legacy
It really is a lovely, funny adventure. Well come out the better for it, having seen it, I think.
That much Ewan McGregor promises of Christopher Robin in ETs exclusive featurette. McGregor plays the titular Christopher in the film, the grown-up version of Poohs best pal.
Winnie the Pooh comes back to him at a difficult time in his life, McGregor explains. He sort of speaks a lot of truth, Pooh.
The film, which opens in theaters on August 3, is from director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) and co-stars Hayley Atwell as Christophers wife, Evelyn, as well as one of the original voice of Winnie the Pooh, Jim Cummings. New additions such as Brad Garrett and Toby Jones round out the voice cast, as Eeyore and Owl, respectively. Of returning A.A. Milnes beloved stuffed animals to the screen, Atwell gushes, These are the characters that my generation, my parents generation and now this generation are growing up with... This is a charming story of a man finding his home again and finding that inner child.
In addition to honouring a legacy like Cummings, Christopher Robin enlists the songwriting of Richard M. Sherman, who wrote music and lyrics for the very first Winnie the Pooh short film, 1966s Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree.
Winnie the Pooh became a dear friend of mine when Walt gave us the assignment to write songs for the first Winnie the Pooh short film, Sherman says.
And here, so many years later, it is very special to be back in the Hundred Acre Woods.

Increased spot fines for traffic offences from Sunday
Regulations to impose increased spot fines for 33 traffic offences will come into effect on Sunday (15).
The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry has amended the fines imposed on relevant motor traffic violations with the aim of controlling the rising number of road accidents and ensuring disciplined driving, a Ministry spokesman said.
According to this amendment made by the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, spot fines imposed on 33 traffic offences will be increased by 30-50 percent.
Spot fines for speeding have been revised as follows: for speeding 20 percent above the speed limit, a fine of Rs 3,000; between 20-30 percent above the limit, a fine of Rs 5,000; between 30-50 percent above the limit, a fine of Rs 10,000; speeding over 50 percent above limit, a fine of Rs 15,000.
The high-speed fine will have to be paid within 14 days. After 14 days, the offender will have to pay double, a spokesman from the Traffic Police said.
A spot fine of Rs.2,000 has been introduced for offences related to non-compliance with traffic rules, disobeying the commands and signals of police officers, not taking precautionary measures when parking a vehicle and instructing without an instructors licence.
A Rs. 1,000 spot fine for excessive emission of noise and smoke from a vehicle, non-use of seat belts, not displaying the revenue licence and driving licence when required, non-compliance with traffic signs, using inappropriate signals when driving, and failure to wear protective helmets.
Offences related to identification plates, use of motor vehicles in contravention of the provisions of the revenue licence, failure to obtain authorisation to drive emergency service vehicles and public service vehicles, driving a special-purpose vehicle without obtaining a licence, failure to obtain authorisation to drive a vehicle loaded with chemicals, hazardous waste and failure to have a licence to drive a specific class vehicle would also subject to a spot fine of Rs.1,000.
Reversing a motor vehicle for a long distance on a road and exceeding the number of persons allowed in front seats of motor cars would also subject to a spot fine of Rs 1,000.
The fines applicable to the carriage of persons in excess of the authorised number in private coaches and of goods other than personal luggage in motor cars or private coaches, carriage on lorry of goods in excess of the maximum load or maximum axle load, exceeding the number of persons carried in a lorry and failure to carry the emission certificate or fitness certificate of a vehicle have been revised to Rs. 500.
The regulations state that where a police officer makes a detection in respect of certain traffic offences and where the person involved admits liability for such offence, such person may, in lieu of prosecution for such offence, become liable to the spot fine.
The traffic fines would be implemented following an Extraordinary Gazette notification that was issued on January 15 this year. The relevant spot fines charge sheets have already been printed and handed over to all police stations and will be implemented by July 15, the Ministry spokesman said.
We believe the new fines will ensure the drivers are more careful. It has worked in other countries. We also believe, at least 50 per cent of the violations committed will reduce due to the increased fines, he said.

Investments under FTA: Singaporean investors keen to enter services and manufacturing sectors
Subsequent to the signing of the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA) there is already interest among Singaporean investors to invest in services and manufacturing in Sri Lanka and this FTA can catalyze more, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama said.
He was speaking at the Outreach Seminar on Tuesday in Singapore. There is also much potential for diversification of exports through the trade-investment nexus that this agreement encourages, as well as new JV opportunities for Sri Lankan companies.
The investment chapter will give a strong signal to prospective Singaporean investors  it gives protection to investors, predictability and transparency, protection, national treatment and many provisions to attract investors. The Agreement provides a binding commitment and framework which we didnt have earlier.
We are particularly keen to have Singaporean companies partner with our Sri Lankan companies to create new business ventures.
The signing of the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement between Singapore and Sri Lanka in January this year has unlocked a new era for both our countries. The real focus of this FTA is on investment from Singapore in services and manufacturing  potential for diversification of exports through the trade-investment and new JV opportunities for Sri Lankan companies.
The Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement is a landmark Agreement for Sri Lanka. It signals to the world that the country is moving to a new era in international trade and investment and it is the first bilateral Trade Agreement that Sri Lanka has forged in over 10 years.
This Agreement is an important part of the new National Trade Policy launched last year and is a linchpin in the on-going trade policy reforms.
The Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA is part of a broader strategy of looking East to renew our trade relationships. While we focus on growing and sustaining in our traditional markets of the US and Europe, we have begun to diversify our markets towards Asia and focus on plugging in to Asian supply chains.
The key benefit of this FTA is leveraging the trade-investment nexus and plugging into Asian supply chains, the minister stressed. The agreement provides a binding commitment and framework on bilateral investments, which we did not have earlier and this will encourage investment.
The scope of this agreement is very progressive; it is wider than the proposed China and India agreement  goes beyond to cover Telecommunications, Financial Services, E-Commerce and Government Procurement. Singapore has recognized that the e-commerce chapter in this FTA is quite a progressive one.
As far as Rules of Origin (ROO) are concerned  no ASEAN cumulation is allowed under this FTA. Standard ROO agreed is 35% Value Addition and CTH change of tariff heading. Additionally there are Product Specific Rules on 2000 tariff lines and product chemical rules, which are exceptions to the ROO.

Mandzukic breaks England hearts and fires Croatia into World Cup final
Moscow, Wednesday: Mario Mandzukic scored the winning goal deep in extra time as Croatia beat England 2-1 in an utterly gripping World Cup semi-final in Moscow on Wednesday to set up a final date with France.
The Juventus forward netted in the 109th minute to complete a remarkable comeback from a shattered Croatian team and take the small nation of little more than four million people into the World Cup final for the first time in their short history.
Kieran Trippier's magnificent early free-kick had seemingly set England on course to reach their first final since they lifted the trophy on home soil back in 1966.
But it wasn't to be, as Croatia came roaring back in the second half and equalised through Ivan Perisic before somehow finding the energy to win despite being taken to extra time for the third time in 10 days.
The biggest winners of the night could well be France, who have had an extra day's rest for Sunday's final after edging out Belgium 1-0 on Tuesday.
That will not matter too much right now for Croatia, who are the smallest nation to make it to the final since Uruguay back in 1950.
England had been the ones hoping to make history, in what was their first appearance in the semi-finals in 28 years.
Then they were beaten on penalties by West Germany. Having ended their famous penalty curse by beating Colombia in a shootout in the last 16, they might have fancied repeating here. But Croatia, having won on penalties against Denmark and Russia in the last two rounds, saw the game out, dousing the World Cup dream of Gareth Southgate's side that had gone from the improbable to the possible over the last month in Russia.
Southgate stuck with the same starting line-up as that which eased past Sweden in the quarter-finals, while Inter Milan's Marcelo Brozovic replaced Andrej Kramaric in the Croatian line-up.
They were looking to the inspirational Luke Modric to control the game, but instead it was he who gave away the early free-kick from which Trippier put England ahead.
It was a fantastic curling effort from 25 yards from the Tottenham Hotspur full-back, and England's first goal direct from a free-kick at the World Cup since David Beckham against Ecuador in 2006.
England could not have imagined a better start.
Croatia were stunned, and Ivan Rakitic, usually so accomplished, was especially off his game.
Zlatko Dalic's side did gradually grow into the contest, but they could still be relieved to go in at half-time only one goal down, especially as Harry Kane was denied by a combination of goalkeeper Danijel Subasic and the woodwork on the half-hour mark.
Croatia hung on and it was to their immense credit that they turned the tide after the break in what developed into an epic encounter.
Shooting towards the end of the Luzhniki Stadium where most of their fans were gathered, they equalised in the 68th minute, as Sime Vrsaljko crossed from the right and Perisic stole in front of the stooping Kyle Walker to score with his left foot.
Having looked so comfortable earlier, England's young side were rattled, and they were lucky not to go behind soon after as Perisic sent a low shot across Jordan Pickford and off the far post.
Unable to get the second goal while they were on top, Croatia were forced into extra time again.
Vrsaljko cleared a John Stones header away from in front of the line, but England had Pickford to thank for a brilliant save as Mandzukic connected with a devilish Perisic cross.
It was a wonder the Juventus forward did not break a limb as Pickford crunched into him.
He managed to carry on after treatment, and he was on hand to sweep the ball low past Pickford after Perisic's header back into the area caught the England defence on the hop to finally decide a brilliant contest.

Medics to rock music lovers
It is a common belief and a much bandied general impression that medical doctors are a very serious set of people who are mainly involved in looking after people with illnesses. True enough they perform that ever so immensely important task in society in the sphere of healing the sick and such a mission is by no means to be taken lightly in view of its tremendous significance. Healing the sick is certainly a noble task and many of them are renowned performers as well as experts in their own chosen specialties of the profession.
However, it may come as a surprise to many that several of these medical men and women have other talents. Among these are musical, acting, drama and performing arts aptitudes. There are many extremely gifted performers of real class amongst our medical men and women. In recognition of this the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) provides an opportunity for these artistic men and women to present their abilities and flair in music, drama and dance at the SLMA Doctors Concert held during its Annual International Scientific Congress. It is usually presented on the evening of the second day of the congress proper and this year it will be held at Galadari Hotel on the July 28 from 7pm onwards.
This is a much awaited opportunity for members of the medical profession and their family members to let their hair down and forget medicine for the evening. This year, there will be around 30 performers whose repertoire would include songs, instrumental presentations and skits. In addition there will be a few invited recitals by non-medical virtuosos of international repute who will add a touch of extra class and a sparkling dazzle to the entire event. The final item of the evening would be a harmonised choral presentation by the entire Executive Council of the SLMA depicting the beauty and glamour of our motherland.
This year, renowned musician and Vice-President of the SLMA, Dr. Christo Fernando, together with the two Social Secretaries Dr. Pramilla Senanayake and Dr. Preethi Wijegoonewardene, have produced a musical and drama extravaganza.
The programme consists of a collection of golden oldies, modern pop, stage acts and many other superlative components.
Members of the medical profession, their guests and even members of the general public can register and obtain a free entrance ticket from the Sri Lanka Medical Association at No.6, Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 7.

Microsoft launches  surface go
Microsoft has unveiled its direct challenge to Apples iPad, the cheaper, smaller and lighter Surface Go 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet.
The Surface Go resembles other models of Microsofts successful Surface tablet range, but has a smaller 10in screen, is 8.3mm thick and only weighs 522g.
Panos Panay, chief product officer for Microsoft, said: Surface Go is small and mighty, giving you the performance you need to be productive.
When we designed this device, we had to ask ourselves what people want and need from a 10 Surface. The answers seem obvious  lightweight, productive, and accessible to more people.
Unlike the more powerful Surface Pro tablet, the Surface Go has Intels seventh-generation Intel Pentium Gold, which Microsoft says balances power consumption with performance, for a battery life of nine hours.
The Surface Go has Microsofts high-resolution PixelSense screen technology, including support for the Surface Pen stylus, with its full 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and very low latency. The tablet also has its own version of the detachable keyboard from the Surface Pro, and the built-in kickstand that supports up to 165-degrees of angle.
The new tablet is also the first to have both USB-C and Microsofts Surface Connector, following the introduction of USB-C to the Surface Book 2 in December.
The Surface Go also has a microSD card slot, a headphone socket and Microsofts Windows Hello facial recognition camera for unlocking the device. It runs in Windows 10 S mode out of the box but can be switched to regular Windows 10 at any time.
While questions remain around customer demand for a lower-power Windows machine from Microsoft, experts were broadly positive about the introduction of a cheaper Surface device, saying that it made Microsofts offerings more competitive with Apples iPad and Googles Chromebooks, which have found success in the education market.
The Surface Go is an excellent proposition. Built for Office 365 is a nice way of saying - it is not your mainstream laptop (and it shouldnt be), said Rushabh Doshi, mobility analyst at Canalys.(The Guardian)

Nato summit: Leaders to focus on Afghanistan conflict

Nato leaders plan to turn their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan, on the second day of a summit so far dominated by demands from President Donald Trump.
Trump on Wednesday urged Nato allies to commit 4% of their annual output (GDP) to military spending.
He also singled out Germany for criticism over its defense spending.
Nato leaders are hoping for a more conciliatory tone on Thursday before Trump leaves for the UK.
But in a late-night tweet from Brussels, the US president reiterated his criticism.
"Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn't nearly enough," he declared.
He earlier accused Germany of being held prisoner to imported energy Russian energy, claiming it is "totally controlled" by Moscow.
EU figures suggest Russia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports, but gas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production.
What's the plan for Afghanistan
Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani will be present for the second day of talks, and Nato's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024.
Britain's Prime MinisterTheresa May has already confirmed that the UK will send 440 more troopsto serve in non-combat roles in Afghanistan.
The US also committed an extra 3,000 troops to support Afghan forces in September 2017 - bringing its total to 15,000.
US officials have said Washington is planning a strategic review, a year after Trump agreed to remain involved in the 17-year conflict.
What else is on the agenda
Nato leaders will discuss the alliance's ties with Georgia and Ukraine. Both countries want to join Nato, but their bids are not expected to make progress.
That is because Russia has engaged in territorial incursions into both states, and Nato rules prevent countries with a land conflict from joining.
By contrast, a ceremony will be held for Macedonia after it was invited to begin accession talks on Wednesday.
Where does Trump go next
When the Brussels summit winds up, Trump will arrive in the UK on Thursday for a two-day working visit.
Trump is the 12th sitting US president to make such a trip, and will spend time with the Queen and prime minister before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at his golf resort.
Thousands of people are expected to protest against his visit across the UK.
Trump is due to hold hisfirst summit with Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, on 16 July.
He shocked some by quipping that the Nato gathering might prove tougher than next Monday's summit with Putin.

Paris celebrates Frances march to the World Cup final
PARIS, Tuesday: The French national anthem La Marseillaise, chants of Were in the final and a cacophony of car horns and fire crackers rang out over Paris on Tuesday as residents of the capital celebrated Frances march to the World Cup final.
A crowd of 20,000 gathered to watch Didier Deschamps team beat Belgium 1-0 in their semi-final in Saint Petersburg on a giant screen at Paris historic Hotel de Ville, or town hall.
With viewing space at a premium every vantage spot was occupied -- with fans perched on trees, on top of vans, on dustbins and bus shelters.
Samuel Umtitis decisive goal in the 51st minute triggered the waving of a sea of tricolor flags as ecstatic supporters -- many in the national teams colours -- kissed and hugged and danced.
Vive la France, vive la Republique shouted Alia and Sacha, two Parisian schoolchildren.
We are so proud to be French tonight! Alia explained as fire crackers exploded on the cobblestones. Motorbikes, cycles, cars, dustbin lorries - they all came to a standstill to join in the celebrations. With France under high security since the November 2015 terror attacks the fan zone at the town hall was policed by over 1,200 members of the security forces.
Fans, who had climbed on top of buses gingerly inching their way through the crowds, were dancing and waving flares and flags, as the bus driver fought a losing battle to get his passengers to their destination on time.
VIVE LA FRANCE
I was 18 years old in 1998, it was one of the most beautiful nights of my life. Well repeat that this Sunday, said Sebastien.
This team is fantastic, he said, beaming.
Boys, were world champions one man in his 30s was heard telling his mates. Stop that, youll bring us bad luck he was reprimanded before the group of friends broke out into the chant of the night -- Were in the final. From balconies, families waved the French national flag, children kitted out in Les Bleus shirts waved to the crowd below.
The Rue de Rivoli, normally choc-a-bloc with Tuesday night traffic, became a temporary pedestrian zone as crowds made their way along it past the Louvre to the Champs-Elysees, where 20 years earlier Paris had gathered to celebrate Frances sole World Cup win.
Two decades on, there was a sense of deja vu as thousands of euphoric fans turned the City of Lights most celebrated boulevard into a giant street party.
Up in the capitals red light district at Pigalle in the 18th arrondissement, the neon lit-windmill outside the Moulin Rouge cabaret was shrouded in a haze of smokebombs and flares.
Its magnificent, beamed Thierry Perier, 45, who was with his eight-year-old daughter.
We needed this in France, we deserved it. We had the best players and for the moral of the French, to win the World Cup would be the best present ever, he said, his voice hoarse from cheering.
Another fan, 17-year-old Lea, was not even born when France won their one and only World Cup on a heady night at the Stade de France in a 3-0 triumph over Brazil. Lea told AFP: Its so beautiful whats happened. We are going to experience our own 98 now! - AFP

Petition against Maharagama UC election
An election petition had been filed in the Colombo High Court seeking a declaration that the election of 23 candidates who contested for the Maharagama Urban Council under an independent group (motorcycle symbol) is invalid and that they are disqualified.
The petition had been filed by 21 candidates nominated by the UNP at the Local Authorities election held on February 10, for the election of the Maharagama Urban Council.
Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga fixed the election petition for trial and respondents were directed to file their objections on July 30.

The petitioners stated that 1 to 23 respondents of the election petition were not voters of the Maharagama electorate and neither were they ordinarily residents within the Maharagama electoral area. The petitioners stated that the elections of the members of the Independent Group No. 2 are void since they did not have the qualification required by Section 8 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. The petitioners alleged that most of the candidates who contested under motorcycle were not residents of Maharagama. The petitioners said the addresses listed next to their names read as Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatta. Counsel Suren Fernando with Sanjeewa Kaluarachchi appeared for the petitioners.
