ICC wants footage from new Al Jazeera graft documentary
Sydney, Tuesday: The Al Jazeera TV news channel is planning a follow-up documentary about alleged corruption in cricket, Australian and global cricket chiefs revealed Tuesday, appealing for access to unedited footage to properly investigate the claims.
The Qatar-based broadcaster made a series of spot-fixing allegations in a first documentary entitled "Cricket's Match-Fixers" earlier this year involving unidentified current and former players.
In that programme, Al Jazeera made contact with an Indian-based member of what it described as a fixing syndicate said to be linked to the notorious D Company crime gang.
"We are aware that there is a second documentary in the offing, this time based on historical recordings between a fixer, suspected to be (Aneel) Munawar and bookies in India," said Alex Marshall, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, in a statement.
"As with the first programme, we will investigate any claims made in a full and thorough manner and we take any allegations of corruption, historical or contemporary, extremely seriously.
"Based on what we already know, we have engaged the services of an independent betting analysis company to examine the claims made about particular matches."
He urged Al Jazeera to hand over its evidence.
"Access to the raw, unedited footage enables us to build a complete picture around the claims in the documentary and ensure our investigation is as fair and thorough as possible," he said.
After the original documentary, the ICC launched a probe into the claims and said it had identified everyone involved except Munawar. It appealed Tuesday to the cricket community to help track him down.
"We have identified every other person in the original documentary and have spoken to a number of them in connection with match-fixing, including those who are not deemed to be participants under our Anti-Corruption Code," said Marshall.
"However the true identity of Aneel Munawar remains a mystery. He plays a significant role in the programme, yet enquiries with law enforcement and immigration sources have not identified or located him."
He added that while a lack of cooperation from the broadcaster had slowed its investigation "we have been able to discount a number of claims made in the programme and continue to pursue other aspects". AFP

Immense economic benefits through SL-Singapore FTA - Eran
Sri Lanka will soon reap multiple benefits from the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA as it was carefully drafted to give optimum benefits to Sri Lanka, State Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Eran Wickramaratne said yesterday.
He told a business interactive session in Colombo that Sri Lanka will also have an FTA with China and Bangladesh and will also fine tune the current FTA with India in the near future. The participants of this interactive session included an 18-member business delegation from China organized by the Belt & Road International Production Capacity Cooperation Promotion Centre, Beijing.
Minister said that Sri Lanka has come out from a shaky economic situation to a stable economic situation. The economic growth is now stable and a growth rate of 4% has been recorded.
Several key infrastructure projects are now being implemented and the much-awaited East Container terminal at the Colombo harbour too would soon take off.
He also said that Sri Lanka had a record FDI last year and China was a major contributor for it.
Meanwhile former President Non-Ferrous Metals Industry and Senior Advisor of BRI promotion centre, Kang Yi said that China has already invested over USS 7.7 billion for the belt and Road initiative (BRI).
He said that BRI has so far crated over 235,000 new employment opportunities. The BRI has also invested to link nations together by road and sea in Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and 14 countries. In additions heavy investments are made on Railways and the BRI train is now touching 7 countries in Europe and Russia.
He said that the BRI has also included Sri Lanka as one of their countries and this will bring huge benefits to Sri Lanka as the island is located in the main route of BRI. Chinese Prime Minister Xi Jinping visited Sri Lanka while President Maithripala Sirisena visited China cementing the long standing relationship of the two countries.
The Chinese managed Hambantota Port is investing for the development of the harbor while work on the Logistic Park of Hambantota harbor area too has commenced along with 80 similar economic zones that were created after the launch of BRI.
He said that from the belt and road initiative, Sri Lanka too would benefit and already over 100 countries including Sri Lanka are involved in it.

INTERNATIONAL TRAINING ON SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN LOGISTICS SECTOR
Mekong Institute (MI) in Thailand started the International Training on Green Freight and Logistics Development.
The two-week training program is being held at the MI Residential Training Center until August 29, 2018 and will also involve a structured learning visit in Bangkok on August 30-31.
Prof. Vanchai Vatanssapt, founder of Mekong Institute (MI) and Chitral Jayawarna, Deputy Chief Manager, Communication & Public Relation Sri Lanka Ports Authority
The training program, which aims to promote awareness of the importance of sustainable practices in the transport and logistics industry, brings together 19 participants from various countries spanning three continents: Burundi, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Panama, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zambia. Sri Lanka representing Chitral Jayawarna, Deputy Chief Manager, Communication & Public Relation, Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Addressing the participants who come mostly from key relevant government agencies, MI Executive Director Dr. Watcharas Leelawath said the value of the knowledge to be gained from the training course. With capacity building, we want to also push forward for policy change. We have to make the real change by linking with the policymaker so they are informed of good policy and strategy options. As you come from the government sector, and then you are one of the instruments to make this change happen.
He also added that the training serves as an excellent opportunity to likewise learn the good practices of the private sector. He said that the private sector is the growth engine of the economy and if the logistics industry grows, then business and employment will also prosper. There are multiple benefits from the change in the policy, he added.
Madhurjya Kumar Dutta, Director of the Trade Investment and Facilitation (TIF) Department, also said the importance of green, which remains at the core of the training program. He explained that with globalization and the increase in cross-country investments, there is also a heightened demand in transport and logistics. Such demand, he said, constitutes about 40-60 percent of the freight in the road transport sector.
This is also one of the major contributors in the carbon emissions, transport and logistics is a crucial issue then, and in fact it features in at least 11 of the 17 sustainable development goals. It is an important area for us to contribute through different activities. Training is one of these areas, he said.
MI and international and regional experts from the Greater Mekong Sub-region will be providing their technical expertise on the six modules to be covered in the training including (1) introduction to green logistics; (2) green freight certification process; (3) preparing companies for green logistics; (4) policy and consumer awareness; (5) e-logistics in supply chain management; and (6) the role of the government in promoting green logistics. As part of the SLV, the participants will be visiting LatKrabang Inland Container Depot and Bangkok Port.

IOR architecture must recognise intrinsic role of littoral states  PM
Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen
It is indeed a great pleasure to be back in Vietnam - a country steeped in a rich history of defiance of spirit, an unbreakable will, and a strong and resilient people.
Vietnam in ancient times was a bustling trading hub, deeply connected with the outside world. It was also integral to the creation of crosscurrents of people, goods, and ideas across the Asian lands and seas.
The UNESCO World Heritage site My Son Sanctuary, which dates back from 4-13 Century CE, located in central Vietnam close to the ancient port city of Hoi An, is an exceptional example of cultural interchange, with an indigenous society adapting to external cultural influences, notably the Hindu art, religion and architecture of the Indian sub-continent. Historical texts also reveal that the Funan Kingdom which is said to have comprised parts of Cambodia, Vietnam, the Malaya Peninsular and Thailand stood as one of the most powerful kingdoms of Southeast Asia ruled by Kaudinya, a Hindu Brahmin King, and Queen Soma.
There are parallels we can draw with the Indian Ocean Region. This region has for many decades resisted domination by a single power. It has been the lifeline of ancient trading routes. It has also continued to remain a melting pot of civilisations, religions, and cultures whilst retaining its essentially multipolar character. It is only appropriate therefore, that the third edition of the Indian Ocean Conference- IOC 2018- be held here.
The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is set to define the destiny of the planet in the 21st century. At the centre of this geopolitical turn of events, is the Indian Ocean - an ocean which is increasingly being defined as the Ocean of the Future.
In addition, the linkages between the Indian and Pacific Oceans are envisaged to create a maritime super highway that can bring prosperity to all.
Those who traversed this great ocean for millennia, the traders, the explorers, the philosophers and religious teachers left behind ideas - ideas that were merged with our own thinking and began to take a uniquely Indian Ocean character. In the littorals you will find therefore, the harmonious blend of Eastern and Western thinking, systems and approaches. It is in this milieu that a new world order is beginning to take shape. The littorals, by geographic design, are integral partners in this process.
Five global trends
I want to highlight five main global trends that I believe are critical turning points. These turning points will dictate how economic prosperity and development will be disbursed globally. It will also determine the new world order.
Firstly, the world order has become more fragile, polarised and unpredictable. Multilateral frameworks are increasingly under pressure. The ability of the collective to manage interdependence effectively is at risk. The weakening of state structures and the diffusion of power to non-state actors is creating a complex international environment. The multilateral systems ability to deliver development and growth is being questioned. Movement in multilateral trade negotiations in particular has faced significant challenges.
However, for small countries, there is great value in the idea of the sovereign equality of states. It allows us to have a voice in how the world should be shaped. It also allows us to derive benefits from a system of trade and governance for the welfare of our people. The multilateral system advocates temperance, a quality on which the world governance system has effectively functioned in the past few decades. Therefore, the challenges facing a more fragile multilateral system can be highlighted as the first turning point.
Secondly, we are seeing a pushback against globalisation. Trade tensions between economic giants pose significant risk to global trade. The challenges facing the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the renegotiation of NAFTA and Brexit negotiations to name but a few. The question is  are these signs of a retreat from closer integration
Globalisation and closer economic integration has helped countries across the globe to develop and prosper. Without such integration and market access, it would be difficult for small nations like my own, which follow open market policies, to survive.
This turning point is closely interlinked to the future of the multilateral system. For instance, the success or failure of the Doha Development Agenda will demonstrate whether countries continue to value common rules and standards and are willing to remain engaged in such a process.
Thirdly, there is growing strategic rivalry and military buildup across the globe spilling on to the ocean space. This is the space in which the next great game will take place. There is competition to build spheres of influence and create overarching architectures and a new strategic order appears to be in the offing. There is an abiding interest in maintaining the safety and security of the sea lanes of communication. In the ocean space you see force posture, buildup of naval and air facilities, and the establishment of military bases. The expansion of military presence of major and middle powers in the ocean space highlights the centrality of the oceans to future development. With such developments, these players stand poised to take advantage of strategic opportunities or step into any perceived power vacuums.
The geopolitical revolution of the rise of Asia, in both political and economic terms can be termed the fourth turning point. The global economy, hitherto dominated by the West will be driven by new actors. China is projected to be the largest economy in the world by 2050 accounting for 20 percent of world GDP, with India in second place and Indonesia in fourth. In the period 2016-2050 Vietnam, India and Bangladesh have been identified as the three of the worlds fastest-growing economies.
Economic cooperation has become another area of Indian Ocean geopolitics. Nevertheless, what many see as competition in the development field, host countries treat as complementary. It is important to identify complementariness from the host countries perception as to their own needs for economic infrastructure, FDI and trade access. A better way to meet these needs is to welcome such initiatives for economic cooperation as important drivers of Asian Growth. Furthermore, the ongoing discussions between ADB, AIIB, BRICS, on building synergies for growth is an important development. The activation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will also serve as a catalyst for economic integration in Asia. It would be important for BIMSTEC and IORA to have a closer engagement with ASEAN on the Bay of Bengal Trade Development. Deepening interactions and integration with the Gulf and East African states are equally important.
The fifth turning point is the rise of multilayered regionalism differing in range of scale, scope and membership in the Indo-Pacific. These frameworks are attempting to create large economic areas, with multiple new regional leaders driving these processes, giving rise to a truly multipolar world. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the Free Trade Area of the Asia and the Pacific (FTAAP), BRICS and the Belt and Road Initiative to name but a few.
There is renewed interest in regional constructs that go beyond economic interests and spill over to the political, defence, security, and strategic domains. Hitherto, regional constructs have tended to steer clear from directly engaging and grappling with these issues, focusing instead on improving trade connectivity, people-to-people contacts, and social and cultural ties. There is renewed acknowledgement of the intrinsic linkage between economic prosperity and security and stability. Another important aspect of these multilayered frameworks is the rise of maritime regionalism.
The multilayered regionalism of the future should push for inclusivity rather than exclusivity and be built amongst countries unrestrained by geographic or other constraints. The multipolar world of the future would be anchored by multilayered regionalism and be built on common understandings, alliances and institutions that are currently taking shape. Maritime Asia and the Indian Ocean Region are central to the rise of multilayered regionalism.
These five global trends will have a significant impact on how the world will be shaped in the years to come.
Peace and Stability in the Indian Ocean Region is our mutual interest. This region has enormous economic potential and is the lifeline of global trade. Given its geo-strategic and geo-economic significance, the region is constantly being defined and redefined along sub-regional, pan-regional and super-regional lines.
Free and open Indo-Pacific
The concept of the Indo-Pacific is a case in point. The Indo-Pacific does not as yet have an accepted identification of its territorial limits with the economic and military rise of Asia. Common geopolitical issues have arisen. The Indian Ocean trade is vital to both. For the United States, the Indo-Pacific stretches from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India and is a combined economic and security vision. Prime Minister Modi described the Indo-Pacific concept recently as a natural region, with ASEAN countries as the main connect between the two oceans in both geographic and civilisational sense. He also stressed that the Indo-Pacific should stand for a free, open, inclusive region that encompasses those that are located geographically in the region and those that have a stake in it. Both Japan and Australia have also spoken in terms of a free and open Indo-Pacific. The Belt and Road Initiative spearheaded by China is also gathering momentum. In this context of super regional constructs, what is the role of the Indian Ocean littorals Where do we stand and in fact, do we need to take a stand Both constructs offer opportunities for development for littoral states.
Super regional constructs should not compel the littorals states to choose or take sides. Such constructs should be inclusive and open. They should also be conscious of the aspirations and preferences of the regions own approaches when being consolidated. The littoral states and the stakeholders must participate in deciding any new regional architecture being proposed. The role of the littoral states in managing great power rivalry and competition is an important one. Within any new construct being proposed, including the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Ocean must maintain its own distinct identity. Even during World War II, there were two commands South East Asia with British accepting the surrender and the Pacific command with America accepting the surrender. The commands however did not work in isolation.
It is our view that in order to uphold order, mechanisms for cooperation need to be explored. Certain cooperation constructs have emerged such as the QUAD which is weighted towards the Pacific and has no input from littoral states. The other option is to strive at an arrangement where littoral states can actively participate and contribute. For example arrangements such as the CGPCS and the CMF worked well to suppress Somali Piracy. IONS, Shangri-La Dialogue, naval exercises, trilateral maritime security cooperation between India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives and our own Galle Dialogue are important fora which provide opportunities for networking of the security communities at strategic and operational levels.
We also believe that there is a significant need for enhanced Indian Ocean Region regionalism that focuses on augmenting cooperation across the maritime domain. Such regionalism should strive to create closer linkages between ASEAN, IORA and BIMSTEC given the rising imperative for cooperation that spans the entire Indian Ocean Region.
Chinas economic expansion has led to a specific focus on the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean sea routes are vital to the economic interests of China. USA has been in the Indian Ocean since Diego Garcia and has been a key stakeholder. A free and open ocean is vital to Japan and its economy. India is the territorial power with a direct stake in the Indian Ocean. Security and economic challenges arise from both complimentary and competing interests of these large stakeholders as they interact with each other in the Indian Ocean Region. The geopolitics of the Gulf can also spillover and impact on Indian Ocean trade. Littoral states, especially the smaller states oppose domination of the Indian Ocean by the great powers. Such states have an important role to play in managing great power competition. Regional constructs that exist, were constituted prior to these new developments and therefore lack the capacity to respond to this situation. The preference is for a rules-based order in the Indian Ocean that benefits all.
Sri Lankas interest in IOR
Sri Lanka has been deeply involved in developing ocean governance processes since the time of negotiation of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Located as we are, at the centre of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has significant interest in actively contributing to events that are currently unfolding in the region. Our geostrategic location includes Trincomalee, one of the finest deep-sea harbours in the world. Trincomalee is also the second largest natural harbour in the world, with a 500 metre-wide entrance channel. Historical incidents have demonstrated that Sri Lankas location can impact on the security not only of the Indian Ocean but also other area such as South East Asia, Middle East, Eastern Coast of Africa and even the Pacific.
Sri Lankas initiative on Freedom of Navigation in the Indian Ocean is primarily aimed at maintaining a rules-based order. Our aim is not to draft a new code but to initiate a process. Our purpose is to create a platform for dialogue where Indian Ocean littoral states and major maritime users are able to convene and discuss issues of mutual interest and concern. It is always important to anticipate challenges and work towards practical solutions based on UNCLOS which continues to serve as the Constitution of the Seas.
Towards this end, we will be hosting a track 1.5 dialogue in Colombo on October 11 and 12, 2018, on the theme The Indian Ocean: Defining Our Future. This track 1.5 dialogue is a lead up to a multilateral diplomatic conference which we hope to hold in 2019 with the aim of developing a common understanding amongst Indian Ocean littoral states and major maritime users. We look to forward to your support for Sri Lankas initiative.
Resolving issues concerned will speed up the process of multi-stakeholder dialogue in the Indian Ocean Region. As we progress through these for a, lets aim for deeper discussion which would ultimately facilitate a common understanding and decision making amongst the multi-stakeholders with an interest in the Indian Ocean Region. It is important for the Indian Ocean littorals to take the lead in this process.
I see all these developments, including the Indian Ocean Conferences that have been held thus far in Singapore and Sri Lanka, and the one being held today in Vietnam, as important forerunners and complimentary exercises. The fourth Indian Ocean Conference can be one where we endeavour to move from generalisation to specific modalities of cooperation.
Ocean of the Future
The Indian Ocean is the Ocean of the Future. It constitutes cultures emanating from ocean-based civilisations and colonial era systems, practices and values which are compatible with international standards and norms. Regional institutions as presently constituted lack capacity to effectively respond to the geopolitical developments of the region. Any new regional architecture envisaged should be multilayered and must recognise the distinct identity of the Indian Ocean Region and the intrinsic role of the littoral states. The new regional architecture must also be multi-stakeholder and therefore include the littoral states and those with an interest in the region. It should discuss and resolve issues pertaining to the Freedom of Navigation and also seek to engage with ASEAN as the link to the Pacific.
To my mind this is a critical juncture in global history. International relations of the future will be determined in a more maritime and Asia-centric world. The rise of the East also foretells a unique opportunity for Asia to introduce its own model of international relations underpinned by maritime salience of the Indian Ocean Region, its civilisational traditions and historical circumstances. Indian Ocean trade networks date back at least 4,000 years and the people of Asia were connected by seagoing commerce centuries before the arrival of the Europeans.
These robust trade routes with ships plying were unique in that neither nationality, race, religion nor culture were an issue when it came to trade. Voyagers across the Indian Ocean went to the Southeast Asia and the Far East and westwards to the African, European and Mediterranean regions. There were no obstacles to travel or trade. These ancient trade routes clearly epitomised the idea of freedom of navigation and rules-based order. Recreating the open and free spirit of trade and commerce that existed in ancient times across the Indian Ocean would be of benefit for global trade and maritime Asia in particular. Should this not be our unique contribution to the new global order The spirit of maritime trade and commerce that is inclusive, plurilateral, stabilising and rules-based, and one which empowers the littorals and gives them their due place as direct stakeholders.
We are living in transformational times. The future generations depend on us to make the right choices. We can create a world where strategic mistrust and competition is allowed to reign. Alternatively, we can rise above rivalry and antagonism and work together, recognising that when we do so, we can derive greater benefits for the welfare of our people. Before us is a unique opportunity to create a fair, equitable and prosperous world that leaves no one behind. We should seize this moment.

JEDB to take legal action against Dilantha Malagamuwa
The Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) will take legal action against racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa.
This is for its loss of reputation caused by his media statements even after the Commercial Court and the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of the JEDB as Malagamuwa had failed to pay the lease of Monte Cristo Estate in Nawalapitiya.
JEDB Working Director T. Bevan Perera told at a media briefing yesterday that many media statements were issued that the estate was forcibly taken over by the JEDB.
Malagamuwa had filed a case in the Commercial Court asking for a interim injunction preventing the JEDB from taking over the estate. But the Commercial Court did not rule in his favour and rejected the request. The Supreme Court too rejected the case.
Bevan said the Monte Cristo estate was leased to the Central Hill Plantation in 2003. The Director Board managed it properly by paying lease to the JEDB and EPF and ETF to its employees on time. The Director Board was changed in 2010 and Dilantha Malagamuwa, his sister and a Japanese investor were appointed as new directors.
Thereafter, a conflict arose between Dilantha Malagamuwa and the Japanese investor and the latter had filed the case against Malagamuwa. Bevan said that since then the company was running at a loss and it could not pay the lease to the JEDB amd EPF and ETF for the workers. Around Rs.13.6 million EPF and ETF was not paid and around Rs. 15 million had to be paid to the Nawalapitiya Labour Office. A tea factory in the estate was also leased to a broker for Rs.32 million. Internal investigation by the JEDB revealed that State resources in the estate were misused by the management. The unions and estate workers carried out protests and the Cabinet approval was granted to take over it in 2014 but it was not taken, he said.
The JEDB Director Board in 2017 has decided to take it over and appointed its Working Director Bevan Perera as competent authority in this regard. On April 6, the JEDB has legally taken over it. Then Dilantha has lodged a complaint with the Police that Bevan Perera had threatened him. Dilantha gave evidence before an investigation team led by the DIG. He told them that he did not give any contact to kill any one.
The complaint has no mention about the persons who threatened him and the relevant telephone number. I will take legal action against him once the investigation is over, Bevan said.

Keep hands off the STF
At a recent interview of Minister Field Marshal Fonseka he had stated that a group of people had gone to Wilpattu with him when he went there as the Subject Minister. A media channel had accused him of keeping underworld figures as his bodyguards. The Police had started going after the latter since. He was certain that they are not involved in criminal activities at present.
It is strange that the Field Marshal did not make a move against the media channel that made the allegation. Furthermore his assertion that the people referred to were not involved in criminal activities at present is to say the least, Puerile. To the police, the prisons, the judiciary and even criminologists it is the criminal record that matters. Fonseka the seasoned, soldier, should have known that it is the Police that know best about criminals.
Fonseka had gone on to state that he had spoken regarding the above to the Minister of Law and Order Madduma Bandara and the latter had got down the DIG STF M.R. Latheef; and on the very same day Latheef had arrested one of these persons and another a few days later. Either Latheef was certain that Fonsekas men were in fact underworld criminals or the Minister of Law and order had ordered Latheef to arrest them!
The head of the STF whose integrity has never been challenged and whose intrepid leadership has become legendary in the decade we live in was not intimidated by the Field Marshalls behaviour. Had Latheef succumbed he would have forfeited his right to command the most respected unit of the Sri Lanka Police.
Politicians of all hues have today lost their credibility. They have even lost their senses. Worse still, idiotic buffoons of a local body want to sit on temperature controlled air cushioned super  luxury chairs that could titillate themselves; and it is shocking indeed to see unpatriotic and treacherous politicians striving their utmost to bestow legitimacy on the underworld.
Founding fathers of the STF
The STF was set up thirty five years ago to strengthen Sri Lankas security. The founding fathers of the STF President J.R. Jayewardene, his competent security advisor and only son Ravi, General Sepala Attygalle and Cyril Herath were men of vision. So were the early Commandants and their assistants who had excelled in their respective commands as senior officers of the Police. To mention a few that come to mind, Zerny Wijesuriya, Nimal Lewke, Lionel Karunasena, Nimal Gunatilleke, N.K. Illangakoon and Upali Sahabandu were officers of impeccable integrity endowed with knowledge and courage.
The STF of today owes much to these early leaders for the admirable standards they set. The foundation they built nearly four decades ago is so solid and firm that disruptive forces mainly in the form of power hungry politicians have begun to learn that the stones that they hurl at the STF have begun to boomerang with vigour to the elation and joy of the law abiding people who are deeply conscious of the role that the STF continues to play in national security and law enforcement.
My personal interest in the well-being and progress of the STF albeit in my thirty third year of retirement from the Police flows from the fact that I too may have made an iota of a contribution to the formation of this elite unit. Numerous were the occasions when I as the DIG Metropolitan sat at meetings very often at Braemar to fine-tune this fledgling organisation. A specific task I remember that was entrusted to me in confidence was to monitor the security, behavior, movements and contacts of the personnel of the Keeni Meani Services (KMS) a mercenary service of retired British Special Air Services (SAS) Commandoes that had been contracted to train the nascent STF of the Police.
The President and Ravi Jayewardene were aware of my proficiency in this aspect of security particularly because I had been the Director of intelligence and Director of Presidential Security prior to becoming the DIG of the Metropolitan Range. I had even travelled extensively in Europe, United States, India, Japan and Cuba with the President.
The signal factor that led to the birth of the STF is no doubt attributable to the realization in the early 80s that the Police that was facing the brunt of terrorist attacks culminating in the frightening attack on the Chavakachcheri Police Station on October 27, 1982 were woefully ill equipped and trained to counter terrorist attacks.
At the time, police stations were equipped only with a limited number of World War II Lee Enfield .303 rifles that had a mighty recoil and one or two short range Sterling Sub-machine guns. The enemys firepower was infinitely superior.
It was remarkable that this infant unit armed with modern weapons such as assault rifles, Sub-Machine Guns, buffels and sophisticated communications equipment with the training received from the retired British SAS Commandoes was by 1984 in a position to relieve the Army from their camps in Batticaloa. Resorting to its newly acquired unique operational strategies it was the STF that restored normalcy in Batticaloa. With less than a thousand men the STF was able to achieve this against almost the entire might of the ruthless LTTE.
It is regrettable that in the much publicized, important post war national commemorations of war heroes under Presidential patronage the silent but highly commendable role played by the STF has not received the recognition it deserves. But it can take pride and solace in the fact that due to the solid traditions of courage and fierce independence and unparalleled standards of discipline and competence it has today become the most respected and feared adjunct of the Sri Lanka Police.
Underworld and the Narcotics business
After the war on Terrorism ended nearly a decade ago while some War heroes as well as soldiers of fortune are digging drains, repairing roads and levelling garbage heaps, the STF as its primary police function is fighting another war no less important than against Terrorism. The underworld and the Narcotics business both thriving more often than not with the blessings of politicians have become the most dangerous threats to the nation.
Not a day passes without confrontations of the STF and underworld characters invariably enjoying the protection of politicians, becoming newspaper headlines! These have become the most obnoxious blots in the character of the government.
Admittedly, these are not as obvious and intense as during the last regime when for example a letter from the Prime Ministers office led to the release by the Customs of a Container that contained narcotics! Also during this time did not the President chopper his way to the residence of a politician to console him because the police had searched his house for narcotics
The ongoing efforts of the STF led by its commandant Senior DIG M.R. Latheef need to be appreciated and encouraged. Any act direct or indirect to dampen the enthusiasm of this spirited leader borders on treachery. Even the mere Calling up to implicitly or explicitly express displeasure at a bona fide arrest made by the STF in the pursuit of duty can be hurtful to this honest officer who is sincerely targeting the underworld, narcotics dealers and criminal cartels, the most dangerous peacetime enemies of the country.
Admirable traits of men need to be recognized. Was not the field Marshal admired and profoundly praised by the people when he was leading the forces to victory The dilemma of advancing troops was succinctly described by all and sundry as Johnny in front (referring to Johnny mines) and Fonny behind. Unquestionably it was Fonsekas much needed ruthless leadership that effectively put an end to desertions and self-infliction of battle wounds that were major obstacles to the march to victory. With ample justification Fonseka was acclaimed as one of the greatest Generals in the world.
Inasmuch as enemy cadres and would be deserters hated the guts of Fonseka, the STF Commandant has become the bane of the criminal world. Underworld figures shudder when the name Lathiffis uttered. This is the reason why the STF is admired by the public today. In any tricky situation even the government first thinks of the STF. It is unfortunate that F M Fonseka has lost his charisma totally after a combination of circumstances dragged him into the cesspit of politics.
Once in politics even men of honour and integrity are in keeping with the prevailing political culture compelled to associate and go out of the way to please rowdies, ruffians and criminals. This scum may be good at intimidating opponents and putting up election posters. They antagonize voters; and politicians lose the respect and regard of public officials. Many ministers in this regime have fallen into this predicament.
Not that this situation did not exist in the past., The police including the STF was indeed humbled and IGPs and Commandants rendered idle spectators in the face of lawless behavior and unbridled arrogance by scum such as Soththi Upali, Baddegane Sanjiva, Chandi Malli, Wambotta etc. who had the protection of even the highest in the land!
Today, it is obvious that politicians are becoming increasingly dependent on narcotics dealers, underworld characters and crooks to fund their election campaigns. The countrys law enforcement agencies particularly the incorruptible STF have become the only impediments to the galloping march of corruption. The top of the political hierarchy and Party leaders have brazenly and shamelessly turned a blind eye to MPs receiving Cash Cheques from Arjun Aloysius even after they admitted having done so! Can a prudent public expect these same leaders to act any differently if MPs admit having accepted cash cheques or even cash or gold from hard core underworld narcotics dealers presently in death row actively carrying on the business with accomplices outside
Politicians of this nature and those above them who by their silence and inaction condone corrupt deals have forfeited their moral right to be in any way critical of law enforcement agencies particularly the STF that is relentlessly going after the underworld criminals.
Law enforcement agencies
Not many moons ago, on Friday April 6, 2018 to be precise, in an article by me in the Daily News, Keeping Police Morale High, referring to a Senior Ministers (Not the Field Marshal) attempt to brow beat the STF Chief I wrote: Not many weeks ago concrete evidence emerged proving the connection of politicians to the underworld. Did not a senior minister attempt to brow beat the STF Chief for attempting to arrest a notorious underworld criminal Perhaps the minister was unaware that the incumbent STF head is the most respected senior officer in the Police today.
Standing on a solid foundation, for thirty five years, the STF consisting comparatively of a few has done much for the country. It is only of late when the countrys politicians have buried themselves neck deep in a cesspit of corruption that this pride of law enforcement agencies has begun to face the slings and arrows of the outrageous abuse and misuse of power. But the goodwill and reputation it has earned for its unparalleled integrity, honesty and character the nation can expect (with apologies to Tennyson)
Ministers to come, AndMinisters to go; ButThe STF to go on forMany more decades to come
Field Marshal Fonsekas latest outburst against Latheef who is doing so much for the country keeping the underworld in check calling him a Bull in a China Shop is not only outrageous and offensive but most uncharitable. Discouraging the STF will certainly lead to the triumph of the underworld!

Lanka to re-introduce visa free entry
Sri Lankan authorities are reviewing a proposal to reintroduce the visa free entry policy for SAARC countries and a few other selected countries in a bid to promote tourism, Minister of Tourism and Christian Affairs, John Amaratunge said yesterday.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said that this move will be a major boost for tourism and the Prime Minister is working on this matter.
Sri Lanka offers on arrival visa only to Singapore, Nepal and the Maldives at present. Earlier, the island provided on arrival visa to many other countries, similar to the policy introduced by Singapore. However, that decision was halted eight years ago. Visa free arrival is now offered only to visitors from Singapore, Nepal and the Maldives and these countries also offer on arrival visas to Sri Lankans. Explaining the latest initiatives to increase the number of tourists to the island, Amaratunge said the Palali airport would also be opened to Indian airlines in a bid to woo more travellers to visit Jaffna and then move out to other areas. We are looking at inviting smaller aircraft less than 100 passengers each from India to use the Jaffna Airport which will be upgraded to meet international standards. A joint investment of over Rs 1.2 billion from both India and Sri Lanka will be made for this soon.
The Minister said that the domestic airline taxes too would be reduced soon to enable scheduled domestic operations to take place from Jaffna to other domestic airports in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka tourism will also talk to the Minister of Civil Aviation in a bid to offer better prices for ground handling and fuel at the Colombo international airport.
Minister said that they will also request SriLankan airlines to reconsider some of their overpriced fares to region including Bangladesh.
Minister Amaratunge added, the Ministry of Tourism has requested the Finance Ministry to formulate a mechanism to charge tax from some of the online operators like Airbnb who sell local rooms including apartments for foreigners and take the income overseas while local hostellers pay high taxes.
Minister Amaratunga noted that the successful promotion on CNN and the planned branding and marketing campaign in November will bring more high-end visitors to Sri Lanka. We are also on the verge of launching several campaigns in markets with high potential, and we are grateful that a Sri Lankan property ws selected to this prestigious list and put Sri Lanka on the world map.

Ministry decides to re implement MRR
Ministry of Tourism has decided to once again implement the Minimum Room Rate (MRR) regulation for Colombo City Hotels due to surge of demand from high end hotels said Minister of Tourism and Christian Affairs, John Amaratunge.
He said that earlier they decided to remove this barrier allowing the market forces to decide the hotel rates. However since there are a lot of objection for this we have now decided to temporally implement the MRR again. We observed that there would be unwanted issues if we abolish this MRR.
Minister however said that they will closely monitor if there are violations in MRR and if they find such irregularities they will penalize the hotels. In the first instance of a violation we will suspend the Liquor license for six months and take more similar steps. (SS)

Lankan asylum seeker dies in Australia
A asylum seeker from Sri Lanka has died at Logan Hospital, south of Brisbane, Australia after his life support was switched off.
The 45-year-old was admitted to hospital last week after attempting to take his own life.
He reportedly fell into a deep depression several weeks ago after his asylum application was initially rejected.
A subsequent suicide attempt left him brain dead, with his life support switched off on Sunday.
Refugee advocate Ian Rintoul said the man arrived in Australia in 2014 after being on Nauru since 2012, and leaves behind a wife and four children in Sri Lanka.
This asylum seeker is another casualty of deliberately harsh policies to break people who make asylum claims, Rintoul said.
They are denied natural justice and have been subjected to unacceptable delays, and denied legal help.
Rintoul said the man had been brought to Australia under a Gillard-era arrangement with a group of refugees on Nauru, where they would be brought to the Australian mainland - but their asylum claims would begin from scratch regardless of their progress.
It is understood refugees in that cohort began to have determinations on their claims delivered from 2017. Rintoul said the delay in processing is resulting in many people who might have been assessed as genuine refugees having their applications denied because of changes in their home countries, with a number of Sri Lankan Tamils having their asylum claims denied recently.
Its very contentious this question about how much (Sri Lanka) has changed since they left and how safe people are.
The Department of Home Affairs in Australia has been contacted for comment.

Making the grade
Paisley the dalmatian got an honorary mortar board and diploma for helping her owner graduate from university.
Casey Bruno, 22, has struggled with depression and anxiety for most of her life. Thankfully, Paisley the dalmatian pup came to the rescue.
For the past two years, Casey and Paisley have been inseparable. When Paisley entered her life, Casey says that everything changed and she credits her service dog with helping her meet her boyfriend and best friends.
Despite her ongoing battle with mental health issues, Casey graduated from the University of Central Florida in August with a degree in veterinary medicine.
She admits that this achievement may not have been possible without the support of her canine companion.
Throughout university, Paisley would spend the majority of the day by Caseys side in lectures and seminars.
Paisley is trained to sense when her owner is going to have an anxiety attack, and would nuzzle into Caseys side instinctively, comforting her and calming her down.
Casey decided that her pup needed to be honoured at graduation, and made Paisley her very own graduation cap.
The pair showed off their matching mortarboards in a super cute photoshoot.
Casey said, If I didnt have her [Paisley], I dont know where Id be  honestly.
Since shes been with me through all of this, I came up with the idea for her to have her own cap. I knew I wanted a paw print on mine to associate with me wanting to be a vet, so I thought it would be cute to have a handprint on hers.
It represented how I was dedicated to her and her dedication to me throughout college.
The University of Central Florida even presented the adorable service dog with her own diploma.
Casey continued, I would owe pretty much my [whole] graduation to Paisely. Shes broadened my horizons and allowed me to do thing I never thought Id be able to do. Shes definitely given me my entire college experience and I wouldnt change any of it for the world. You cant be mad, sad, or frustrated when shes right next to you because shes such a happy dog  shes so in touch with other peoples emotions. Anxiety is a big issue for a lot of people, and having a service dog has let me open up to people and realize things can get better, and that I can do anything I put my mind to.
Paisley continues to support Casey in her day-to-day life as her constant companion.

Freedom of Expression under the Sri Lankan Constitution
Meeting general welfare of a democratic society
Article 15(7) of the Constitution permits restrictions by law or emergency regulations in the interests or national security, public order and the protection of public health or morality or for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others or of meeting the just requirements of the general welfare of a democratic society. Article 14 (1) (a) of the Sri Lankan Constitution guarantees to every citizen the freedom of speech and expression including publication. Apart from the above the exercise and operation of these freedoms are subject, by virtue of Article 15(2), to the following restrictions.
(a). Racial and religious harmony, public morality etc.
The Penal Code provides for the punishment of any person who injures or defiles a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class (section 290), does any act in relation to a place of worship with intent to insult to religion (section 290(A), disturbs a religious assembly (section 291), utters anything with intent to wound religious feelings (section 291(a)), or does any act with intension of outraging religious feelings by insulting a religion or religious beliefs (section 291(B)).
(b). Parliamentary privileges
According to the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act the following, inter alia are punishable as breaches of parliamentary privileges: willful publication of a false or perverted report of a proceeding of Parliament or Committee thereof, misrepresentation of a speech made by a Member in Parliament or a Committee, or a publication, report of a proceeding that has been prohibited by Parliament or a Committee an publication of a defamatory statement reflecting on the proceedings and the character of Parliament or concerning any member in respect of his conduct as a member.
(c) Contempt of Court  Article 15(2) permits restrictions be placed on the freedom of speech and expression in relation to contempt of Court. In the matter of a rule on De Souza, concerned a false and fabricated statement concerning a trial before the Supreme Court published in Ceylon Morning Leader. The Court held that the publication was deliberate and willful, holding the Court to odium and an undue interference with the administration of justice.
(d). Defamation
Section 479 of the Penal Code defines defamation as follows:
Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by or visiable representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm or knowing or having reason to believe such imputation will harm the reputation of that person, is said, except in the cases hearinafter excepted, to defame that person.
(e). Incitement to an offence
While incitement to an offence can be punished, mere advocacy or abstract teaching of the use of force cannot be prohibited. Incitement may be committed by given advice, encouragement, persuasion, threat or pressurizing.
(f) National Security and Public Order
The Penal Code, Police Ordinance, the Official Secrets Act and the Sri Lanka Press Council Law are among the statutes that permit restrictions on freedom of speech and expression in the interests of national security and / or public order. Emergency regulations in force at various times have permitted the restrictions of the freedom of speech and expression in a number of ways. These dealt, inter alia, with prevention and restriction of publications, censorship, closure of printing presses, restrictions on distribution of publications, affixation of notices.
As the above recitation of recent decisions from the Supreme Court show, there appears to be a developing trend among them to use Article 14(1) (a)  the right to speech, expression and publication  as a hub around which several interconnecting rights are spun. Freedom of expression is easily declared than enjoyed. For the vast majority of the people it is a question of resources. The right to publish is not enough; the ability to publish is essential.

Ocean Governance crucial for countrys future: Sagala
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, highlighting the topic Ocean Good Governance, said Sri Lanka was engaging in initiatives with regional players who had economic stakes in the Indian Ocean.
He was addressing the third Indian Ocean Conference in Vietnam, yesterday morning.
Sri Lanka looks to further integrate with the world by undertaking reforms to facilitate trade, while encouraging productive foreign investments, the minister said.
Sri Lanka has a vision of what the country would to be in the world today. It is re-positioning itself to optimise its relationship with its neighbours and other partners in order to leverage its geo-strategic position and become the hub of the India Ocean, he added.
Highlighting Sri Lankas position on the matter, Minister Ratnayaka said, Sri Lankas strategy is to leverage investments to boost its industries such as tourism, expand its manufacturing base, and safeguard its main exports such as garments and tea.
The Indian Ocean played a critical role in driving global economy, and it would play a more important role in future, he added.
The Indian Ocean is central to deciding our common global future. The shared nature of the Indian Ocean needs to be recognised and it is in our common interest to care, protect and develop this shared space for mutual benefit, the minister said.
He said, Maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean is a prerequisite for the development and growth of the region. It is the collective responsibility of the countries in this region and beyond, to ensure that the Indian Ocean is better managed, safe, productive and resilient through Oceanic good governance.
The issues around the Indian Ocean were complex and required concerted effort by littoral states to address the issues and take advantage of the opportunities that the ocean presented. At present, there were multiple Indian Ocean organisations and forums; however, in terms of achieving effective regional cooperation, there was still a long way to go, the minister said.
He inquired, Therefore, what would be the most suitable regional architecture that would focus on key issues and provide necessary perspective of sub-regional dynamics that would drive a coherent and overall policy on ocean governance
We may need to consider a multi-layered approach in terms of division of thematic responsibilities as well as sub-regional interests, within an overarching Indian Ocean framework of shared values and principles, he said, There is no perfect fit on what regional architecture works best for such a ocean space. There are issues that can be addressed as a wider Indian Ocean community, and there are issues that can be dealt with more meaningfully at a thematic level or sub-regional level. It is about taking forward all these strands of activity within an architecture based on shared values and principles founded on the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Minister Ratnayaka said, In my view, it is high time for us, the littoral states, to be the masters of our own fate.
There should be increased coordination, participation and engagement by littoral states in determining how affairs are run in the Indian Ocean.
Proper regional cooperation could help achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. A single-minded focus on national strategies and actions had diverted attention from critical regional actions needed to promote energy, food, and water security-related SDGs; strengthen environmental sustainability, address climate change, and prevent natural disasters, he said.

Outstanding magazine journalism
The 37th issue of a once in the two-month literary journal from North Central Province (August-September, 2018) has just arrived from Padihal Publication, 52, Thurukaragama in Kahatagasdigiliya. The name of the journal is Padihal and is edited by a Peradeniya University Tamil Honours graduate, Wasim Akram. It has 54 pages.
This issue contains very readable material for serious readers.
Originally from Lanka Lekshmanan Murugapoopathy living in Negombo was driven to be an expatriate in Melbourne, Australia. While contributing to Australian Tamil Literature, he has not forgotten his routes in Lanka where he served as a journalist for the Virakeasari. He continues to write about Lankan writers from Australia. He is a creative writer and a humanist.
For instance, L. Murugapoopathy has written a very useful informative article on Vanniakulam whose research on the Tamil dialects in Lankan Tamil fiction stands as an outstanding work.
Sabri M Shafie from Puwelikada has sent a rhythmic poem on his childhood. Aiyman records literary events in the Anuradhapura district. We come to know how Tamil is flourishing particularly with the Muslim community in the district. S. Gnanarasas ethical verse is a good reminder for all of us when human values are no more respected. Alex Paranthaman has written a moving story based on the situation in the Vanni district. Seyin Thambi Ziam from Kalmunai has written a lovable romantic poem.
R M. Naushads (N A Theeran) novel Naddumai which won the first prize in a competition organized by an Indian Tamil literary magazine and bare comments in the passing of his short stories related by Jeffrey Haasan.
Two poems by N Karunakaran, who writes poetry of distinction and also his own viewpoints on contemporary local politics also adorn this issue.
Maana Makeen reminisces on the late N S M Ramiahs (a pioneer hill country writer, whose Short Stories were well received) radio plays over the then Radio Ceylon.
There is a note on a website known as Norhtsri.com which is the first one to function in Anuradhapura.
MC Razmin analyzes the concept of ethnic-relations Vis a Vis the Sinhala Novel. The writer is also a Tamil Honours graduate from the University of Peradeniya.
Mihinthalae A Farris writing from Kaddukkeliyawa thinks that some Tamil Proverbs are misinterpreted by some. Maranello's U. Nizars, poetry book is mentioned in the journal.
Belarus writer Svetlana Alexi ichs interview in English is rendered in Tamil by Ibnu Aiyeesha and finally, there is a short story by Nachchiatheevu Abu Nuhaa.
All in all, this journal is a pointer that Lankan Tamil Literature is not produced only in the North, East, Central Hills and the West, but also in the North Central, North Western, and Southern Provinces too.
Unfortunately, the Sinhala and English readers do not know anything about the literary activities.
A majority of Sinhala people do not know the actualities of the Tamil and Muslim communities living in the North, East, South East, Uva and the central hills. Likewise, most of the Tamil people living in the above areas do not know anything about the actualities of the Sinhala people. We live in watertight compartments and think of damaging politics only.
Literature and the Arts are some ways to communicate and understand as each other as mere human beings. Language has become a barrier.
Unfortunately, because of the hurried Sinhala only, and the Tamil only in education, a vast majority of younger generation instead of love is prompted by hate.
This state of affairs negates the idea of a Sri Lankan identity.

Over 150 deaths caused by bus drivers since Jan
During the past seven months of this year, 151 persons died after being knocked down by passenger buses. Private buses accounted for 116 deaths and SLTB buses for 35 deaths, National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said yesterday.
Most of these accidents occurred on the Colombo - Puttalam road, Colombo  Kandy road and Colombo  Dambulla Road.
In contrast, 260 persons died after being knocked down by passenger buses in the first seven months of 2017, Dr. Kodagoda said.
He said most private bus drivers are not well trained and disciplined. Many drivers are found to be drunk while driving.
Dr. Kodagoda said imposing heavy penalties and fines on bus drivers is not sufficient to reduce road accidents, but steps should be taken to train drivers.

As we sit through episode after episode of Mahacharya Yavvanaya TV series, we tend to develop a certain bond with some of the characters. They just standout like a candle in a cave, and their actions and accomplishments impart a certain holistic kind of inspiration. They each teach their own life lessons, in their own unique ways, even if it isn't directly implied.
When episode by episode goes by, they occupy our hearts and minds with their brilliant lifestorylines. Intentionally or unintentionally I do learn a lot and apply them to some extent in my routine since I am also in my pathway to become a Professor in Entrepreneurship very soon.
Mahacharya Yavvanaya one of the most edutainment TV program to have ever made, that has influenced a lot of peopleespecially students those who thinking thriving in a particular field is merely impossible.
The best and most powerful lesson every episode of Mahacharya Yavvanaya have ever given is to Never give up as theres always a way, even if you are in jail or someone is about to take away everything youve worked for in life, theres always a way out even if sometimes you have to touch the grey areas.

Physicists finally observe elusive Higgs decay
Six years after tracking down the Higgs boson, the subatomic particle that confers mass on matter, physicists said Tuesday they have at long last witnessed it decaying into tiny bits called bottom quarks.
The predicted decay was observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) famous for the Nobel-capped discovery of the Higgs particle in 2012, Europes CERN physics lab announced. During the early preparations of the LHC, there were doubts on whether this observation could be achieved, the ATLAS scientific collaboration said of the elusive interaction now documented at the massive particle accelerator. Because Higgs bosons themselves are hard to find, and other particles also break up into bottom quarks, it has been difficult to track down those attributed specifically to Higgs decay.
Researchers say the long-awaited observation serves as further verification of the Standard Model of physics -- the mainstream theory of the fundamental particles that make up the Universe and the forces that govern them.
Under the model, developed in the early 1970s, quarks and leptons are the most basic building blocks of matter.
There are six types of quarks, of which bottom quarks -- also called beauty quarks -- are among the heaviest. -AFP

Promoting Entrepreneurship Education Outward Management Faculties in Lankan Universities
Srinath DissanayakeDepartment of Commerce and Financial Management Faculty of Commerce and Management StudiesUniversity of Kelaniya.
In practice, entrepreneurship is recognized exclusively within business. Provided that an entrepreneur is someone with lots of energy and he/she can get things done, it would be nave to think that entrepreneurship is only related to business. However, Sri Lankan University educational disclosure about entrepreneurship is largely shaped by this restricted code and entrepreneurship education has been an avenue only for management students. Confining entrepreneurship education only to management faculties truncates its meaning and hinders the relationship between management and culture. Therefore, there is an urge to unleash entrepreneurship education outward from management faculties.
The prime argument for expanding entrepreneurship education beyond the management faculty lies in its practicality. Annually management faculties do produce graduates, as do the other faculties. What is observed in management faculties, is that management students are better prepared technically and have other professional credentials for narrow functional roles in companies.
Even departments which produce graduates specializing in entrepreneurship experience the same. Personally, to me, it is not controversial that management graduates lack in entrepreneurship careers per se, as ones decision in venturing out depends purely on her/his intention. In fact, evidence claims that most entrepreneurs are not trained and educated in management faculties.
Therefore, the question arises, why we confine entrepreneurship education to management faculties alone Mostly, entrepreneurship education is limited only to management faculties, as entrepreneurship has been reduced to innovation and management. Holistically, widening how we perceive an entrepreneur would provide an answer to this question. In addition to the above definition of an entrepreneur, we have to recognize that entrepreneurship as a process through which ideas become enterprise that produce value. It is how ideas affect peoples lives. In this line of thought, existing management curricular in entrepreneurship requires some changes too.
Apparently, entrepreneurship education, perhaps generally, does not reflect the centrality of entrepreneurship in Sri Lankas progress. Curricular in entrepreneurship focus on formation of business. Advocates claim that entrepreneurship curricular should target why one should venture out, rather than how to venture out. By the same token, entrepreneurship education can extend beyond business education (i.e. curriculum) to a way of thinking; a way of thinking that stimulates how to approach problems, how to interpret and how to discern.
In this way of thinking, we can look at any human activity and discern how entrepreneurial it is. How does it benefit others to create value Advocates identify focusing entrepreneurship education as a basic category of understanding and analysis. Further, no management faculty can or should promise all graduates specializing in entrepreneurship will become an entrepreneur. It is nave thinking like that.
With this growing rationale of expanding entrepreneurship education, advocates suggest, intellectual entrepreneurship as a mechanism providing an intellectually authentic foundation facilitating cross-faculty and university entrepreneurship. Intellectual entrepreneurship is based on classical rhetoric and has vision-based education in viewing academics as change-agents.
Having realized the need to inculcate entrepreneurship for non-management students, cross-faculty and university academics may sit at the same table discussing ways and means for introducing entrepreneurship in their respective disciplines. This process would be the first stage in unleashing entrepreneurship education beyond management faculties.
Extending entrepreneurship education to other faculties requires some other important considerations as well. Scholars suggest that entrepreneurship education curricular seldom borrows concepts or theories from disciplines other than management. One of the most prominent scholars in entrepreneurship, Joseph Schumpeter, emphasized decades ago that most innovations emerge from the creative combination of existing knowledge.
Therefore, curricular in entrepreneurship can or should be reinforced by cross-disciplinary contents. This cross-disciplinary nature would assist students to build bridges between academia and the real world, as well as between themselves and their future professional development.
The liberal arts faculty would be the first avenue to grow entrepreneurship education apart from the management faculty. Liberal arts and management have lot in common. Each discipline requires creativity and vision in bringing ideas to life and whether one is a musician or a leader, without passion he/she has got nothing.
However, practically speaking, obstacles exist in implementing entrepreneurship course units in other disciplines. Introducing additional content requires the existing to be restructured. Due to accreditation requirements, many students in state universities, have only a few electives available beyond their undergraduate core curricular.
Nonetheless, these limitations do not imply we should stop striving to have entrepreneurship added into a broader curricular. On the other hand, confronting authenticity in delivering entrepreneurship to non-management students is inevitable. That is, do these programs, classes and activities reflect value creation that entrepreneurship advocates expect In addition, talking entrepreneurship in economic terms can be professionally threatening to the arts faculty. These perceptions should be brought forward at the table.
The apparent issues in extending entrepreneurship education to non-business students can be avoided to a large extent by using a constructivist approach to learning methods. Mostly, the university arts curricular is behavioristic in nature. Advocates suggest the need to implement a constructivist mode of education to stimulate how students think. Constructivist approaches change more than what students know, they change how they structure that knowledge. Scholars claim that the constructivist approach in entrepreneurship education makes the case that entrepreneurship education can have a significant, positive impact on learning.
There is a claim that knowing a lot about entrepreneurship is hardly sufficient to make one a successful entrepreneur, that knowing a lot can even be dangerous.
Therefore, in attempting to induce the change from behavioristic to constructivist, educators should help learners to move from a more novice mindset toward a more expert mindset as entrepreneurs. Clearly, it is a state of mind that learners move from, from being novice to expert thinkers. Personally, I do not see the value in a learner cramming the definition of who is an entrepreneur taught in class. Clearly, it is valuable, but the constructivist approach inculcates who is an entrepreneur in the learners mind. Therefore, we need a better understanding of what course (curricular) activities influence what cognitive changes.
To conclude, as entrepreneurship educators, we have to realize that there is a quest to unleash entrepreneurship education outward from management faculties. Though presently entrepreneurship education is reduced to management related disciplines alone, there are possible avenues to revitalize its potential. Entrepreneurship education certainly has a legitimate place in, for instance, the study of psychology, science, sociology, music, nursing, education or even mathematics.
To nurture our students education and for the centrality of Sri Lankas progress constructivist learning practices of entrepreneurship should dominate over behavioristic content. We must go beyond teaching facts and teach students to think like an entrepreneur. It is about more than what students know, it is about how they structure knowledge.

Santani Resort Worlds Greatest Places says TIME
Santani Resort Kandy, the first hotel to be featured in Time Magazine, will invest US$ 40 to 50 million to build two hotels and a villa project in Sri Lanka and overseas.
Founder and CEO of Santani Vikum Nawagamuwage said they have acquired a 70 acre land adjoining their hotel in Kandy to build villas and offer it to investors. We will manage it and offer a rental to owners, he said.
The consortium of investors will also look at building two additional hotels in Sri Lanka in rural areas and also one overseas. We will invest around US$ 40 to 50 million for this and may look at raising capital through the Stock market.
He also said that they invested US$5 million for Santani three years ago and recovered the investment in 18 months maintaining a70% occupancy and marketing the property around US$ 400 per day.
Time Magazine, one of the oldest and most reputed publications in the world, has featured this Sri Lankan luxury resort in its Worlds Greatest Places list published last week.
We have received unprecedented international recognition since opening the hotel a year and a half ago, but to be featured on Worlds Greatest list by TIME is really a great honour.
Minister, John Amratunge said, Santani has achieved more international recognition than any new hotel and the fact that a Sri Lankan property made it to the list, while regional competitors such as Thailand and Indonesia have no properties listed, is an achievement for the country, and this will bring additional global attention to Sri Lanka.
Santani which is located in Kandy is one of the only eight Asian properties featured on this prestigious list. This is also the first time a Sri Lankan entity has been featured in any TIME magazine list.
This is the first time a Sri Lanka entity has made it to any of TIME Magazines acclaimed lists, said Chairman, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Dehan Senviratne.

## Title: Serena surges into second round as Halep toppled at US Open

Serena surges into second round as Halep toppled at US Open
Nueva York, Tuesday: Serena Williams made a triumphant return to the US Open on Monday, launching her bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam victory with a straight-sets win as top-seeded Simona Halep made dubious history with a first-round exit.
Williams, who counts six US Open titles among her 23 Grand Slams, can match Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 majors with another title at Flushing Meadows.
She missed last year's edition as she gave birth to daughter Olympia on September 1, but showed every indication she's ready to make up for lost time in a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Poland's Magda Linette.
"I think I'm getting there," said Williams, who turned up the heat on a steamy New York night that opened with a gala celebration of the US Open's 50th anniversary.
"I love opening for Serena Williams," Grammy-winning singer-song writer Kelly Clarkson told the crowd before she launched into her anthem "Stronger".
The spotlights were still blinking when Williams, in a black outfit featuring asymmetrical sleeves and a tulle skirt, took the court.
The 68th-ranked Linette held her own in the early going, but Williams gained the only break she needed in the first set in the seventh game and rolled from there.
She didn't face a break point in the 70-minute match, firing 23 winners and wrapping up the second set in less than half an hour.
"I feel pretty good," Williams said. "First match of a Grand Slam is always good to get through."
Williams' path may have been eased by Kaia Kanepi's stunning upset of world number one Halep, who became the first top-seeded woman to lose in the first round of the US Open.
It was the kind of Grand Slam history Halep could have done without as she tried to expunge the memory of her first round loss to Maria Sharapova at Flushing Meadows last year.
But the Romanian, who broke through for a first Grand Slam title at the French Open this year, had no answer for Kanepi's power.
The Estonian fired 26 winners to Halep's nine, cutting the rallies short and remorselessly punishing Halep's second serve.
"I thought I just have to be aggressive and try to stay calm," said Kanepi, whose run to the quarter-finals last year is just one of her six trips to the last eight in majors.
"I cannot say much about this match, just that I didn't really feel the ball," French Open champion Halep said. "But also, she played really strong and pushed me back, so it was tough."
As Halep pondered why she has been unable to produce her best tennis in New York -- a semi-final run in 2015 notwithstanding -- big-hitting Kanepi was feeling right at home in the Big Apple.
"I love playing here in New York, I have always loved it," she said. "I like the atmosphere in the tournament and in the city. I like the weather -- humid and hot."
While Halep is no longer in her path, Williams could face another early test -- a possible third-round clash with 16th-seeded sister Venus.
Venus, a seven-time Slam winner, outlasted another former champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3.
Neither Williams sister was willing to look too far ahead, Venus noting that Halep's ouster was proof of just how dangerous any opponent can be.
"There are no easy matches," she said. "The higher you're ranked, the more that people come for you. It's just a chance for them to just hit out."
Defending champion Sloane Stephens encountered late resistance but held on for a 6-1, 7-5 victory over Russian Evgeniya Rodina.
Stephens, seeded third behind Halep and Caroline Wozniacki, looked to be cruising with a 3-1 lead in the second set.
But unseeded Rodina had other ideas, turning the tables to take a 5-4 lead before Stephens reasserted herself.
"I just tried to stay calm and play my game," Stephens said.
Elsewhere on the opening day, seventh-seeded Spaniard Garbine Muguruza advanced with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over China's Zhang Shuai.
Two-time Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka, a former world number one now ranked 80th in the world, defeated Viktoria Kuzmova 6-3, 7-5 to st up a meeting with Australian Daria Gavrilova, who steamrolled Sara Sorribes 6-0, 6-0. AFP

The shift caused by 19A
President Maithripala Sirisena, on Monday, elaborated on the virtues of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which drastically curtailed the powers of the Executive. When JRJ introduced the new Constitution in 1978 leftist leaders such as Dr. N.M. Perera and Colvin R. De Silva warned it could be the death knell of democracy and faulted JRJ for ushering in a Bonapartist rule. Others called the new Constitution Gaulist, derived from the French hybrid system. Whatever it was, most agreed that the Executive Presidency, as it was constituted, allowed for too much power to be concentrated in a single individual which would leave room for abuse. Time was to prove how true these perceptions were.
Delivering the keynote speech at the inauguration of the 4th Asian Stakeholders Forum (AESF-1V) in Colombo, on Monday, President Sirisena said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has strengthened the country's democracy and vowed to fulfill the mandate received by ensuring democracy and holding free, fair and independent elections. The President noted that Parliament was weakened due to the excessive powers vested with the Executive Presidency, under the 1978 Constitution.
The 19th Amendment reduced those Executive powers enjoyed by the previous Presidents of the country, he said.
True, recent history is replete with instances of how the Executive ran roughshod over parliament. Although public finance should come under Parliament this was observed in the breach. A classic example was the Divi Neguma fund which was vested under Basil Rajapaksa outside the supervision of Parliament. The country's first lady Chief Justice had to pay a heavy price for ruling against this move, being stripped from office by way of an impeachment that was ratified in Parliament by a kangaroo court read Parliamentary Select Committee.
Under the Executive Presidency Parliament was made a rubber stamp and the Prime Minister was given little or no leeway in deciding on matters of State. A tight leash was kept on MPs and inducements dished out where necessary to make them fall in line. Undated letters of resignation were obtained from MPs, with the sword of Damocleus hovering over them. Parliaments composition was changed ad nasusam due to the unlimited resources at the command of the Executive enabling him/her to buy over loyalties of MPs. This was seen in full measure in 2008 when Mahinda Rajapaksa succeeded in getting 18 members of the UNP to decamp to obtain the two thirds majority needed to ram through the18th Amendment to make him President for life.
The 19th Amendment, while still retaining with the Executive sufficient powers to deal with emergencies, particularly where it concerns national security, is today sans the overbearing clauses that restrained the smooth functioning of Parliament. To begin with, it did away with the provision that empowered the Executive to dissolve Parliament just two years into its tenure. This has now been extended to four years, a mere one year short of the full term of Parliament. This will now give Parliament ample opportunity and leeway to operate with that degree of freedom which otherwise would have tied the hands of the legislature in implementing progressive policies for the benefit of the masses.
However, what was glaringly evident was the way created by the 19th Amendment for the holding of free and fair elections. The President recalled during his speech how stones rained on him while he was addressing a campaign rally and also how one of his election stages was set on fire. But this climate was brought to an end with the establishment of the Independent Elections Commission under 19A, as was amply evident during the Feb.10 LG elections which was so free and fair that the ruling party, which is ordinarily expected to triumph, suffered a severe reversal - testimony to the freedom and independence enjoyed by the masses under the truncated Presidency.
Ditto for the judiciary. The President said his government strengthened the independence of the judiciary, adding that a recent survey on the independence of the judiciary shows that Sri Lanka ranked among the highest in the Asian countries.
True, the judiciary today is unfettered, as demonstrated by the inordinate delay in trying those high profile corrupt elements in the previous government, which no doubt had a negative fallout on the government at the LG poll. In contrast, the county's war winning Army Commander was court-marshalled in double quick time and thrown in the slammer. On the other hand rapists and criminals close to the Rajapaksas mysteriously had their cases struck off the files of the Attorney General's Department.
What is more, the Special Presidential Commission probing the bond matter went to the extent of summoning the Prime Minister of the country to testify, while a powerful minister was given a roasting by the State Counsel at the hearings- a scenario which would have been unthinkable under Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Hence, if we are to echo the President's sentiments, the 19 Amendment has effected a virtual sea change in the country's political culture, ensuring freedom and independence for the people.

Singapore emulated Sri Lanka in the past  FM
Singapore took many examples from Sri Lanka several decades ago, Singapores Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said.
The Singapore Foreign Minister said this when he met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his delegation for bilateral talks at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Hanoi, Vietnam on August 28 morning.
Although some tried to spread ideas likely to mislead people by creating myth and fear, a large majority of people aspired for jobs, income avenues and a high living standard. As such, Singapore always followed a policy catering to majority welfare, Minister Balakrishnan said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Singapore which took examples from Sri Lanka in the past was spearheading a large scale forward march in the development field while Sri Lanka had suffered a serious economic and social setback as a result of implementing petty political objectives and personal agendas. The good governance government in Sri Lanka was trying to reverse this trend and transform Sri Lanka into the main focal point in the Indian Ocean.
Special attention was drawn towards present international political and economic trends.
Attention was also drawn towards studies underway throughout the world about the possible dangers created through a tribal and gossip society via social media networks. Ideas and views were also exchanged on possible challenges faced by Sri Lankas development efforts.
Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lankas Ambassador in Vietnam Hasanthi Dissanayake, Additional Secretary Saman Athaudahetti and Shashikala Premawardane of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were associated with the Prime Minister.

Soothing grounds
Colombo Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple is known as Kochchikade Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple. Further, it is often referred to as 'Kallu Kovil' meaning that this temple was built with granite. This is the only Hindu temple in Sri Lanka built by granite stones. This particular Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar Siva temple still depicts magnificent ancient Dravidian sculpture. Like all other important temples of the island nation, this particular temple was also built near the seaport. It is also located near the Indian Ocean, next to the Colombo seaport.
The famed Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple in Kochchikade is located in the heart of Colombo city. This majestic temple was built only with granite. It is replete with evidence of the ancient rich Dravidian architecture, and excellent craftwork of the sculptors. An important and noteworthy aspect is that most of these temples are built closer to the seaports of the country. For instance, Thiruketheeswaram temple was built near the seaport called Manthai or Mathotam. Thirukoneshwaram is located near the natural harbour of Trincomalee. Naguleswaram temple is also located near the Jaffna Kankesanthurai natural harbour.
Majestic temples
Similarly, Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple was built near the Colombo seaport. If we analyze the reasons as to why these majestic temples were built near the seaports, we would come to the conclusion that such seaports provide easy access for activities such as transporting the manpower and materials for construction purposes. Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple was also built near the Colombo seaport. It is believed that for the construction work of the temple, the labour force and the building materials were brought down from India. Hundreds of labourers and sculptors were engaged in the construction work. There is a tall impressive granite temple Kopuram and inside the temple, there are numerous decorative sculptures expertly and excellently carved on the granite temple pillars, granite temple walls and on the top of the temple roof.
For many centuries, Sri Lanka was under the foreign rule. During the alien rule, the native religions were neglected. Practising native religious activities were totally prohibited or partly prohibited to a certain extent. Due to the rigid attitudes of the rulers, all the native religions faced severe setbacks. Despite, all the difficulties and drawbacks the local population was vigilant about their own social, cultural and religious traditions. So, many Hindu temples were renovated and new temples were built all over the country. Island-wide Kumbabishekams took place at the newly built temples as well as renovated temples. Devotees were engaged in several religious activities.
At this juncture, it was generally felt that there was a need to have a Sivan temple in the capital city of Colombo. At this stage, Sri Ponnampalam Mudaliyar of Colombo too strongly felt the need to have a Sivan temple in Colombo. One day he saw a dream that strengthened his vision. He saw a pomegranate fruit and when he broke it he found a Siva Lingam in it. The dream further induced and strengthened his idea to build a Sivan temple in Colombo. As a result, Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple was built by Sri Ponnampalam Mudaliyar. He purchased a plot of land from Sir John Bawa II stone.
British period
At the time the land was full of coconut trees and a lot of buildings. He further purchased a 500-acre estate called Gampola estate at Natttandiya for the maintenance of the temple. This temple was administered systematically, according to Saiva Agama codes (Hindu traditional codes). The foundation stone for Sri Poonampalawaneshwarar temple in Colombo was laid by Ponnampalam Mudaliyar during the British period. Sri Ponnampalam Mudaliyar started the temple construction work in 1856 and the first Kumbabishekam took place in 1857. He undertook the temple work with full dedication, devotion and determination. Earlier this temple was built with bricks and calcium substance lime paste. Further, he established a legal trust to administer the temple. In 1873 the temple was renovated and another Kumbabishekam took place. According to the deed, the first male member of Ponnampalam Mudaliyar's family would be the legal heir to the temple administration. After the demise of Ponnampalam Mudaliyar in 1887, the temple administration was handed over to his elder son Ponnampalam Coomaraswamy. But due to the untimely demise of Ponnampalam Coomaraswamy in 1905, the temple administration was handed over to his younger brother Sir Ponnampalam Ramanathan.
He continued and carried out the temple work which was left behind by his late father and his late brother. He inherited the habits of farsightedness, dutifulness, dedication and self-confidence of his predecessors.
With the passage of time, Sri Ponnampalam Ramanathan replaced the bricks with granite. He brought down the granite from Veyangoda for the temple construction. Many people were doubtful and quite confused as to how he would implement this great project all alone. But he was determined to turn it into a majestic and magnificent temple. He felt that constructing a temple was not a short duration project. He further felt that building a temple was a long-term project. The temple building project should continue from century to century. But the people were doubtful how a huge temple could be built by a single individual. Yet, Ponnampalam Ramanathan built this Colombo Sri Ponnampalawaneshwarar temple by his own single-handed effort. To construct this temple, Sri Ponnampalam Ramanathan brought down builders and sculptors from South India. Initially, his building project was started in 1907 and it almost ended by 1912. The Kumbabishekam took place on 21st of November 1912.
Sacred tree
Theerthak Kenaru' temple well which meets the holy water needs of the temple.
Teerthak kerni or Teertha Thadakam (water tank) of the temple is known as Sri Swarna Pushkarani' (holy temple pond). And the temple is also blessed with its own special sacred tree known as Isthala Virutham.
This great temple was expanded and constructed by Sri Ponnampalam Ramanathan. Till today the temple duties are systematically carried out by the heirs of his generation. Because of this, up to this day, this particular temple stands as one of the outstanding temples in Sri Lanka. Numerous Kumbabishekams took place periodically according to the need and necessity. Recently a new Avudaiyal was installed (base of the Siva Lingham) at the Sanctum of the temple by the temple authorities. Following the installation, another Kumbabishekam took place on the 15th of July 2012.

Ioana Vanc
This artist takes playing with her food to a whole new level! Ioana Vanc is a Romanian architect, whose artistic food journey initially began through the use of chocolate bars, creating delicious images by breaking, crushing and shaping the pieces.
After some time, she took her skills to the proverbial next level, and I am so glad she did because her bite-sized pieces of mouthwatering art are truly incredible.
Creating art requires a great deal of talent and patience; and as you can imagine, using a spoon as a canvas requires all that and ten times more. Ioana has said that although she does use a larger spoon, it is no less of a challenge. However, she has said that her aim is for the public to enjoy her art as much as she enjoys creating it (and eating it after, no doubt).
She not only has themes that range from animals to holidays, but she has also created some fantastic geeky art (embedded below). Some favourites include art from movies such as Star wars, Batman and Frozen that feature famous characters like C-3PO and R2-D2, Yoda, Olaf and many more.

SriLankan launches new Ready to Fly on-time initiative
SriLankan Airlines yesterday announced the launch of its new Ready to Fly! programme to enhance its customer service by providing increased punctuality levels of its flights around the world.
Issuing a press release, SriLankan Airlines requested the co-operation from passengers for its new on-time initiative by boarding flights promptly.
SriLankan Airlines asks all our customers to help us to help you and be Ready to Fly by arriving at the departure gate at least 40 minutes prior to the scheduled time of departure. Our new Ready to Fly! initiative is the result of feedback from a wide circle of customers. Not surprisingly, an on-time departure is one of the most important expectations of all our guests, the press statement stated.
In order for an aircraft to depart on time, the airlines team works hard on all aspects of pre-flight preparation - this includes closing the doors in advance of scheduled departure time and making sure that the aircraft is Ready to Fly. To achieve our Ready to Fly target, the departure gates will be strictly closed 20 minutes prior to the time of departure. Any guest arriving after this time will not be permitted to board the aircraft and their checked-in baggage will be removed from the flight. The best rule of thumb is to arrive early to ensure adequate time for pre-flight processing and any other personal needs such as shopping or dining, the statement added.

Sustainable livelihood and income generation opportunities
The dependence on the government especially on one person and one family mentality to obtain employment and other favours to scale up the social ladder will be brought to an end with the Enterprise Sri Lanka program coming into fruition and create sustainable livelihood and income generation opportunities, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne told journalists at a press conference last week.
He said it is time to put an end to the dependence and begging attitude that pervaded in this country for decades where the government was made duty bound to provide jobs to youth who were either left out from university admission or school drop-outs.
Youth instead of seeking the mediation of politicians will now be able to embark on a project of their own to display their skills and excel in their professions even to reach global heights.
Opportunities for youth
Our youth have been following the practice of seeking political and bureaucratic favours for over 70 years and it is a total disgrace to the country which should have graduated to the next stage of economic growth by now. It is a shame to cow down to politicians whom the media has branded as possessing low educational qualifications, Wickramaratne said.
The minister recalled the day when he came home first in a car and how the people in the neighborhood called him a businessman similar to the calibre of those who evade paying taxes and take people for a ride.
However, he said entrepreneurs have not been given the due place in this country and thats why the present government stepped in to recognize the indispensable role played by entrepreneurs in the growth trajectory of a country. Entrepreneurs could solicit zero interest rate loans up to 15 lakhs while the government will bear the interest component.
Concessionary loans
The Riyasaviya and Divisaviya are some of the concessionary interest payment loan schemes offered by the government to bring out the talents of youth into occupations that will brighten up their lives and the economy of the village.
Youth who are taking the first steps into entrepreneurship unlike in the past need not have to panic over collateral that dissuaded them for years from venturing into an occupation of their own to make a living for their families. The bank and the government will share the risk of lending which deterred banks and other lending institutions to provide funds for self employment schemes, the Minister said.
However, according to the minister the Sri Lanka has only around 2,30,000 entrepreneurs which is less than three percent of the total workforce of the country compared to Vietnam which has over 19 per cent, Malaysia over 27 per cent, Bangladesh 11 per cent and China 7.5 per cent of the workforce.
Gamperaliya
The Enterprise Sri Lanka program is to help youth discover their innate skills which have enormous potential to create world renowned entrepreneurs.
The Gamperaliya village re-awakening program goes hand in hand complementing the Enterprise Sri Lanka program, Wickramaratne said.
He said the Gamperaliya program which kicked off in Kurunegala, Vavuniya and Mannar districts will be launched in other districts as well to support those have no helping hand to get their enterprises going.
Renovation of rural tanks, lakes, roads, schools, hospitals provision of sanitary facilities to schools and houses will be undertaken through the Gamperaliya program.
According to the Minister, over 50,000 families do not have permanent roofs while a large number of households are still left to live in the dark.
We will provide electricity, playgrounds and sanitary faculties to all households and schools that lack these facilities, Wickramaratne said.
System in place
The government through the Enterprise Sri Lanka program proposed at the last budget aims at disbursing Rs. 60,000 million through state and private banks to potential entrepreneurs while allocating another Rs. 5 billion to reimburse the interest subsidy to banks. The program comprises 15 loan schemes covering agriculture, fisheries and SME enterprises.
Clarifying the clause on the import of waste to the country under the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) misconstrued by politicians, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha De Silva said the status quo on the import of waste under the SLSFTA will remain and that the notion of bringing down municipal waste, plastics, chemical, human waste and scrap mental is totally wrong. Sri Lanka or any other country for that matter cannot control import and export through the imposition of duties.
Controlling imports could be done only through non tariff barriers (NTBs). We did not permit the import of coconuts under quarantine laws of the country.
Those who make a hue and cry now about importing waste under the Singapore free trade agreement did not do a damn to change the clause approved by the Cabinet under Mahinda Rajapaksa in the proposed Pakistan FTA, the Minister said.
NTBs are trade barriers that restrict imports or exports of goods and services through mechanisms other than the imposition of tariffs. NTBs make the form of import quotas, subsidies, customs delays, technical barriers or other systems preventing or impeding trade. According to the World Health Organisation NTBs comprise import licensing, rules for valuation of goods at customs, pre-shipment inspections, rules of origin (made in).
He said neither Sri Lankas 20 million population waste could be exported nor Singapores five million peoples waste could be imported under the SLSFTA. The GATT 1994 agreement states specifically the rules prohibiting the import of solid waste.
When asked by journalists whether the Minister could give a guarantee that import of waste will not be permitted under the SLSFTA he said waste will not be imported to the country under any circumstance.
China banned the imports of waste early this year making other countries rethink about recycling. Before the ban, China was the first resting place for around half of the worlds metal, plastic and paper recyclables.
The SLSFTA was signed on January 23 this year after nearly 18 months of negotiations.
The agreement includes goods and services, investment, government procurement, e-commerce, intellectual property rights and telecommunication.
Trade between Sri Lanka and Singapore has crossed the US$ 1 billion mark. Sri Lanka was Singapores seventh trading partner couple of years ago with trade in goods to the tune of US$ 1.14 billion accounting for around 4 percent of the countrys total trade.
Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said the Sri Lankan rupee is gradually stabilizing as many other currencies and this would help ease the pressure on the foreign exchange.
If you look at foreign currencies many have depreciated even more than the Sri Lankan rupee. The Thai Baath has weakened by 5.5 per cent, the sterling pound by 7.7 per cent and the Pakistan rupee by 10.77 per cent.
We cannot say it has to be at this rate or that rate. Market conditions should decide it, the Minister said.
The value of the Rupee has weakened by 5.44 per cent against the US dollar during the first six months of this year.
The rupee which stood at 110.95 cents to the dollar in 2010 rose to Rs. 152.85 cents by 2017 and currently is at Rs. 161 compared to the Greenback.

These petitions were filed by two former officials of the Disaster Management Center (DMC) seeking a writ order to quash the recommendations made by PRECIFAC dated November 27, 2017.
The PRECIFAC inquiry had recommended to institute legal action against former Disaster Management Center (DMC) Director General Leonard Ravindra and its deputy manager Hiripitiyage Nishantha under the Bribery Act for allegedly misusing state funds under the guise of renovating 77 tsunami and multi-hazard early warning towers.
The two petitioners Leonard Ravindra and Hiripitiyage Nishantha had named Presiding Judge of PRECIFAC Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, other members of the Commission , Director General of the Bribery Commission and several others as respondents.
The petitioners further sought an Interim Order staying Bribery Commission from taking any further steps against them under the Bribery Act.

Artygalle murder - Final Part
What happened to KotElawAla in prison
Death of Francis Artygalle and birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics: Scandalous murder; and the sensational trial 112 years ago is the true story of emergence of Senanayakes, Kotelawalas and Jayewardenes in Sri Lankan Politics, the source that financed their activities, and also the concealed hostility, enmity and rivalry for preeminence among the three families that formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy for many decades that commenced during the time of this saga and reached its peak in 1952, enduring up to the end of last century.
The first act in his master strategy would be the immediate surrender with the gun at the police station. Piloris alias Pila took no chances; he increased the pace of his brisk walk until he reached the sentry at the gate to the Police Station. The unarmed sentry a Malay cop manning the gate seeing a man rushing in with a gun took to heels screaming for help and warning the other two policemen on night duty. Piloris thought it was unwise for him to carry the gun and walk inside, he left it at the small hut and cried, Sir, Sir I am Piloris for two policemen armed with rifles to approach the door, with the third guarding the rear entry. He told them that he had shot someone absolutely unknown to him, and divulged the identity of the men who contracted him, also that he assumed that they planned to bump-off him at a lonely spot en-route which he was asked to follow after the shooting. The police acted fast; SP Colombo Dowbiggin visited the scene and directed investigations.
Francis Dixon Artygalle succumbed to injuries on the following day. The police acted in quick pace to apprehend and arrest the cousins Singhoni Perera and Baron Perera within hours and was taken to the victim in hospital for identification. Francis the dying fatality recognised Baron as the person who spoke to him seconds before the tragedy on the previous night. In a smart move the seriously wounded young Francis summoned an attorney to make his last will. It was a short and sweet statement where he allocated his share of the heritage to two of his sisters, Mrs Leena Jayewardene and younger one Ellen who later became Mrs Senanayake by marriage, and nothing for the eldest sister Alice Kotelawala. Ellen who married a Barrister named F R Senanayake, a brother of DS, the first Prime Minister. FR was the father of RG Senanayake, a Cabinet minister who served in both UNP and SLFP governments. The families of the three brothers-in-law of slain Francis Artygalle formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy inspiring the scribes of the day to coin the soubriquet, Uncle-Nephew-Party in English and in Sinhala, by the leftist elements in politics as Unge-Nedeinge-Pakshaya.
Kotelawala using his extensive police knowledge planned and rehearsed the crime balancing the pros and cons of options available until he and Singhoni were contented with the final strategy. John set sail to Japan on a business engagement, or was it to be out of the island during the murder and make an excuse for himself is the million dollar question yet remains unanswered. He had sailed to Japan and was out of the island when the tragedy occurred. He had gone there in October to further the interests of the Ceylon-Japan Trading Company. His clerk notified him of this occurrence.
Senanayakes and Jayewardenes
On January 24, the Hitachi Maru bringing Kotelawala arrived in the Colombo Port in the early hours of the morning for the CID sleuths to go on board the ship. John Kotelawala was getting dressed to go ashore when J. H. Daniel, Assistant Superintendent of Police after reading out charges arrested John and took him to the Fort Police Station first and from there to the bungalow of the City Police Magistrate, J. F. R. Pereira for the relatives of Kotelawala to respond promptly. They retained Advocates Donald Obeyasekara and G. S. Schneider instructed by Mr. Williams and moved for bail. Bail was refused and Kotelawala was remanded till the 30th; the action of Magistrate from his private bungalow was challenged by Obeysekara, for Dowbiggin to intervene that wherever a Magistrate documented proceedings that place was a court, even if it were an unsheltered open space.
Bail was not granted as there was immense pressure from the Senanayakes and Jayewardenes on authorities sending the ex-policemen brother-in-law to remand prison. (The beginning of enmity) Kotelawalas popularity as a policeman created a big uproar in the environment. Crowds gathered in hundreds throughout the route to Hulftsdorp from Welikada on February 28, 1907, when he was taken to courts. Being the president of powerful carters association the membership gathered to cheer him. When the non-summary recordings were held by Mr. Macleod people assembled in large numbers and it was considered more sensible to hold the proceedings in the premises of Welikade Jail. An Assistant Superintendent appeared in the Court premises and announced to the people that future hearings would be confined to the Welikada Jail.
Kotelawala supporters then gathered at Campbell Park until the non-summary proceedings were terminated at the end of the March. From Magistrates courts the case was transferred to the Supreme Court, where Kotelawala requested for English speaking Jury. There it was found that John Kotelawala had a strong motive to eliminate his brother-in-law Francis Artygalle for personal reasons. Evidence placed before courts stated that a section of the Kahatagaha mines in Dodangaslande managed by him was once forcefully acquired by Artygalles men. Kotelawala visited the place along with a Police party and arrested two men who trespassed his property and from there they proceeded to another mine in Maduragoda.
A large gathering of Artygalles men who anticipated his arrival attacked them. The policemen and the others who had followed him ran away leaving Kotelawala and one sergeant. Kotelawala and the sergeant sought protection in a house. Only through the intervention of a mutual friend of both parties Kotelawala and the sergeant managed to flee.
John Kotelawala, the former defiant policemen took this beating seriously. He was in utter shame and anger, a man who always went forward to meet a man and never had hid for fear before in his entire life. As evidence recorded he is said to have observed that Francis Attygalle would not exist long. Kotelawala made an entry at the North Western Province Government Agent F. G. Tyrolls office of what transpired.
John K was detained at Welikada prison, in fact the same place he earned a special assignment during his early years with police as Prison Teacher in recognition of his outstanding performance.
Arrival of Indian Counsel
Influenced by Jayewardenes and Senanayakes, all leading local lawyers refused to defend Kotelawala. Hence the Kotelawala family along with Johns wife Alice, had to hire English lawyers from India. Eardley Norton and his Culcutta colleague, Thornhill arrived by the Tucoryn boat and were residing at Galle Face Hotel. They appeared in Supreme Court in charge of defence of John Kotelawala and Singhoney Perera two of the accused. A large number of people watched their arrival at the jetty, and the gentlemen were met on board by T F Garvin, E R Williams and P G Cooke the accused junior proctors and Martin Kotelawala, Johns brother.
As the hearings continued, especially after Pillas evidence the experienced ex-policeman John was convinced that he had little or no chances. As he was prepared well ahead with the connivance of a known jailor, to meet such a situation, the two packets of Arsenic compound was passed on to him. Did John Kotelawala commit suicide or as his relatives believed was he poisoned inside the remand prison by the rest of the Artygalle families, the Jayewardenes and the Senanayakes remains an unsolved mystery.

## Title: What humans  want most

What humans  want most
What is power Where exactly lies power Who is the most powerful person What is the most powerful state in the world Can power be sustained all throughout ones lifetime These are some of the common questions raised by the people around us. Most of those questions were addressed by the well known British philosopher and essayist Bertrand Russell (1872  1970) as far back as 1938 in a well-written work titled Power, a New Social Analysis.
The work came to be so popular that six editions came to be printed within one decade. On re-reading the work I found that the contents are more modern than one seems to assume taking the time gap in which it is written. The work triggers off from the concept of the impulse to power, followed by a series of philosophical interpretations to such issues as leaders and followers, the forms of power, priestly power, kingly power, naked power, revolutionary power, economic power, power over opinion, creeds as sources of power, powers and forms of governments, power and moral codes, power philosophies, the ethics of power and taming of power etc.
Human desires
Initially, as Russell points out, between man and other animals, there are various differences. Some intellectual and some emotional. One of the chief emotional differences is that some human desires unlike those of animals are essentially boundless and incapable of complete satisfaction with this as at the outset Russell takes the reader to realms of the social structure of his day that was torn between world wars. He culls an example from the history of kings, queens, ministers, statesmen, chieftains, rulers and their lackeys, interpreting the various rules and their functions as related to power.
He tries to explain the power systems the man has acquired in order to safeguard his own protection as well as dignity. The wonder is that as a philosopher cum pacifist, Russell shows signs of a daring critic of the power structure which he was surrounded. Despite passing mere sweeping judgments Russell attempt to clarify his standpoint as a social thinker whose voice is fresh for all times.
As such, as a conclusive measure he says that out of the infinite desires of man, the chief is the desires for power and glory. This paves the way for steps taken by the humans either for their well being or for their own disaster. Russell tries to explain the power impulse as twofold: explicit in leaders; and implicit in their followers. This is followed by an interpretation.
Courage and sagacity
When men willingly follow a leader, they do so with a view to the acquisition of power by the group which he commands, and they feel that his triumphs are theirs. Most men do not feel in themselves the competence required for leading their group to victory and therefore seek out a captain who appears to possess the courage and sagacity necessary for the achievement of supremacy.
It looks as if Russell has not left any stone unturned in the search analysis of power. He maintains that power is a characteristic of the men who are causally important. As such, the love of power is extended into our main categories that go as priestly power, kingly power, revolutionary power and economic power. Followed by the interpretation of each of the categories, Russell tries to explain the sense behind power and moral codes and power philosophies devoted mainly to the communicative factors that lay embedded within it. As Russell observes the power of priests is more obviously connected with morals than any other form of power. In Christian countries, as he states virtue consists in obedience to the will of God and it is priests who know what the will of God commands. There is a well-known dictum that goes as knowledge is power.
Perhaps Russell maintain the meaning of the dictum as taking into account four significant factors: power lying within a particular unit of execution, power over the members of an academic faculty who are constantly in search of knowledge, the power disseminated by a particular group of members as a conclusive measure pertaining to a particular area of study and the power of learning that over-pervades the existing pattern of thinking.
Naked power
Russell coins a new term: naked power. That seems to be limited to ones own way of obtaining a new form of power.
As the beliefs and habits which have upheld traditional power decay, it gradually gives way either o power based upon some, new belief, or to naked power, to the kind that involves no acquiescence on the part of the subject.
With this view, some people over the years have exhibited ones own power in a limitless manner, that denounces the powers. One of the most interesting interpretations is embedded in the chapter on revolutionary power. Russell takes into consideration four categories: early Christianity, the Reformation, the French Revolution and Nationalism, and Socialism and the Russian Revolution. By the elaboration of each category, the reader is made to know how the revolutionary power had been rooted in the countries that gave root to each revolutionary power.
The power of a stable state, as well as the power of the welfare measures in a country, depends on the economic power. Russell observes that the economic power, unlike military power, is not primary but derivative. Within one state, it depends on the law. In international dealings, it is only on minor issues that it depends on the law but when large issues are involved it depends upon war or the threat of war. It has been customary to accept economic power without analysis and this has led in modern times to an undue emphasis upon economies as opposed to war and propaganda in the causal interpretation of history.
Through the pages in Power, Russell comes closer and closer as a thinker than a mere teacher. All in all, Russell seems to believe that it is not ultimately by violence that men are ruled but by the wisdom of those who appeal to the common desires of mankind for happiness for inward and outward peace, and for the understanding of the world in which, by no choice of our own, we have to live.
This, I felt, is the type of book that needs more attention to local planners of education. Each chapter leads to a penetrative insight into the well of power and how it should be understood.
The structure of the work is not at all high flown, perhaps meant to be ready by the average literati.

Withdrawal of family report for Cabinet consideration
A proposal to withdraw the Family Background Report which is required by women going abroad to work as housemaids has been submitted to the Cabinet, Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.
The number of housemaids who go abroad illegally has increased as a result of the new rule requiring a Family Background Report. This situation has badly affected the security of most of the families, said the Deputy Minister.
According to the Deputy Minister, the Ministry plans to implement a special programme to ensure the security of the families of housemaids.
We are always advise housemaids to register at the Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) before leaving the country since there are several benefits for them and their families, he said. The FEB will never let the mother of children below five years go aboard.
We firmly believe that it is our responsibility to ensure the protection of children as well as the women who go abroad as housemaids, he said.

Pelpola Vipassi Thera yesterday said.
The people of Japan always appreciate his noble task. Japan was about to divided into several parts and it united back because of the former Presidents speech, the Thera said.
The Thera was addressing a media briefing in Colombo.
The Thera said discussion are now underway with the Japanese government to include JR's speech into Japanese school textbooks.
Former President told that the hatred cannot be won by hating them and kindness is the only way to win over the hatred. "We all must support Japan to regain her sovereignty," the former President had told, the Thera recalled.
Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera is in Japan over 40 years striving to enhance Japan-Sri Lanka links.
The Thera said the International Pelpola Vipassi Buddhist Temple and Peace Centre in Gunma in Japan educates the Japanese people about this historic speech.
The Thera said Sri Lanka seems to be under the Chinese control but it should not become a Chinese colony. "Sri Lanka has obtained many loans from China. We have talented people and experts. What we lack is proper plans. Japanese people do not receive anything free. They know how to get maximum from their limited resources, the Thera said.

The infected waste (clinical waste) issue of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) will be solved shortly, NHSL Director Dr.K.Wickramasinghe told the Daily News yesterday.
According to Dr. Wickramasinghe, the institution which handles the task of removing infected waste from all state hospitals faced an internal administrative issue recently and as a result, it was forced to limit the daily infected waste removal from all state hospitals and not only from NHSL.
But, the institution removed infected waste daily from all state hospitals including the NHSL and it is not true to say that the waste had not been removed for a month. There was a limit to the amount of daily removal that was able to be removed and as a result, a part of the waste collected inside the hospital, he said. Chemicals were added to the waste remaining inside the hospital in order to maintain hygiene, and the institution has promised promised to clear the remaining clinical waste within a few weeks, Dr.Wickramasinghe said.
Meanwhile, more similar institutions/systems are to be selected to handle the job and a solution will be given for the issue tomorrow or the dayafter, he added.

Suddenly to Akashs astonishment, his intended bride and main dancer of his troupe Anora starts avoiding practices. Being tied up with dance practices and wedding arrangements Akash makes a desperate attempt to communicate with his love.
Anoras reluctance to meet with him and talk to him keeps Akash in a state of utter confusion. This distraction and Anoras unavailability in dance practices lead Akash to create misunderstandings with sponsors and organizers of the dance fest. Sweeny another potential female dancer in the troupe becomes the successor to Anora. Yet her performances do not impress Akash. In the meantime Anora reveals a secret to Sweeny. Anora tells, she is undergoing a sex change and is feeling dejected. She also tells her friend, she is shy to face the world.
Without knowing Anoras dilemma, her leftist grandfather (W Jayasiri) keeps telling her about the change took place in Russia with the leadership of V Lenin for the betterment of the federation. Anora eventually undergoes a sex-change surgery done by a compassionate doctor (Mahendra Perera) and becomes the male, Chathura.
Yet the love Akash and Anora had for each other still lingers. How will they face this situation The film tells everything. The film has one executive producer and five assistant producers.

ASCG initiates innovative gravity sewer system for Colombo
With Sri Lanka experiencing a significant growth in infrastructure development coupled with increasing tourist arrivals, the local office of Anhui Shuian Construction Group Co Ltd (ASCG) recently held a project completion event for its innovative gravity sewer system at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo.
ASCG, a leading China-based enterprise focusing on general contracting of construction works and integrating commercial investment, real estate development, hospitality, tourism, scientific incubation, factory building leasing and international businesses, will lay new sewer lines to cater to the new developments with no dig (micro tunneling) technology for newly-built and upcoming hotels based in the citys Slave Island area.
Micro tunneling is a modern tech that is new to Sri Lanka when it comes to constructing sewers and ASCG has taken up the Colombo Municipal Council sewer project as its entry point to sustainable development in the country. This sewer technology will immensely benefit the large scale hotel developments in the area.
With the enormous support by the Deputy Municipal Commissioner, Eng. Lalith Wickramaratne, Directors of Engineering Division, Eng. Nihal Wickramaratne and Eng. Salim including others, ASCG through challenging difficulties and unforeseen congestions was able to successfully complete a micro tunneling project on time to Shangri La Hotel Colombo which was opened immediately after its construction.
The pipe jacking by micro tunneling involved pipes of different sizes and materials. The pipes used were Vitrified Clay jacking pipes up to diameter 600mm and Reinforced Concrete jacking pipes up to diameter of 1200mm.
Eng. Nihal Wickramasinghe, speaking at the event, said It was a difficult task considering the site conditions, especially without sufficient details of underground structures inside the army camp along Baladaksha Mawatha.
During the micro tunneling process the machine even struck a concrete pile foundation which we thought was a draft foundation. It was really a highly challenging task and I take this moment to thank ASCG for all their efforts to complete this.
ASCGs motive in Sri Lanka is to share and merge modern technology in China with locally available ones to implement projects in the best cost effective and sustainable way.
With a registered capital of RMB 560 million and a competitive edge in the global construction marketplace, ASCG today has around 16 immediate subordinate departments including IT, survey and design, investment management, overseas business development amongst others.
ASCG has been granted by Chinese government the super grade qualification for general contracting of water, hydro power and building works and grade-I for general contracting of municipal works. The group has been certified as class-I for safety standardization and rated by China Construction Industry Association as an AAA-Credit enterprise.
With its corporate philosophy honesty, fine works, initiative, innovation and social contribution, ASCG consistently pursues its development strategy of reform to advanced development, innovate operation and to drive lean management, strengthening its construction initiatives throughout China and heading to the world.
ASCG will continue to forge ahead with determinations, continuous innovations, excellent equipment, state-of-the-art technologies, scientific management and utmost sincerity to cooperate with all sectors of society to share win-win developments and target for fruitful achievements.

Asian markets rise after US-Mexico deal but early gains pared
Asian investors extended a rally on Tuesday (Aug 28), tracking another Wall Street record as they cheered a fresh trade deal between the United States and Mexico - ending one row picked by Donald Trump that had rattled global markets.
The agreement raises hopes the North American Free Trade Agreement, rejected by the White House soon after Trumps election, can be salvaged after Canada rejoins talks on Tuesday.
The pact was described by the US president as a big day for trade and it sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh all-time highs, while the Dow broke 26,000 for the first time since January.
Mizuho Securities said in a note to clients that investors are monitoring the US-Canada negotiations and the impact on US-China trade talks.
Mondays agreement comes after officials from Washington and Beijing held talks last week aimed at easing trade tensions that have seen them hit each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars worth of goods.
While the meeting did not achieve any breakthrough, the fact it took place was seen as a good sign. Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at OANDA, said dealers were in a festive mood as the deal removed one major hurdle that has been haunting North American investors for months. He added, Markets are revelling in any trade positive, after all, a deal is a deal. Channel NewsAsia

The Committee of Administrators (CoA) chief Vinod Rai on Monday said that BCCI elections will be held in next 90 days now that the Constitution has been adopted.
"BCCI elections will happen in 90 days and that's the deadline we have given ourselves. The moment the new body takes over, the COA will leave. We would do exactly what Justice Vikramjit Sen did (handover reins to DDCA's elected body)," Rai said.
"We have tried to ensure total transparency in the functioning and decision making process of the BCCI," Rai said.
"There are queries in Supreme Court and although I have an interpretation but I will not comment on it," Rai added.
Rai termed one of his big achievements as getting a pay hike for international as well as domestic cricketers. "Now players can raise invoice and payments would be directly credited to their accounts," Rai said.

Between goal and accomplishment
Head Boy of Mahinda College Galle Kushan Lakshitha understands that a well -organized mind and a well- organized life is the path to success and peace. Perfect Prefects features Lakshitha who believes that discipline is essential for progress.
When you take a Head Prefect he/she must have all-round personality. If he/she is good at sport and does not have discipline then he or she is unsuccessful. If he/she is good at studies but has no discipline then he/she is unsuccessful. If he/she is good at both sports and studies but has no discipline then he/she is unsuccessful. But if he or she is disciplined then he or she has what it takes to succeed. So ideally the Head Prefect need to be good at sports and studies but being disciplined is the most important facet of the personality. Definitely, the importance of studies must be instilled in a student and extracurricular activities are necessary, providing the child with the necessary soft skills to help him survive in the world, said Lakshitha.
Self-discipline
Lakshitha also stressed that there has to be self-disciplined. And by being self-disciplined you need to put your life in order. Because if you do not put your life in order then the first thing that suffers is your family and then the next thing that suffers is your work.
In society, there is a need for discipline. If you take a country, society and family there has to be a certain standard of discipline and it needs to be a high standard of discipline. If there is a deterioration when it comes to discipline then the system falls apart. The family environment must be positive because families build nations. Do the right thing in life and love your country, explained Lakshitha.
Lakshitha is appalled by de-humanization. This is particularly upsetting because we are all human. There is very little respect for each other in society.
There is a lot of discrimination in society and some people are forced into places or situations that are degrading. The poor are marginalized and sometimes the sick are abandoned because of their condition in life. This is especially saddening to me because they need to be helped. We need to take notice of them. We need to stop fighting and start healing, elucidated Lakshitha.
Youth strength
Lakshithas message to young people is to make something of themselves. He encourages young people to love their parents and take care of their parents.
Always keep away from doing wrong. Keep away from bad company. Learn right from wrong. Distinguish right from wrong. Learn about lifes lessons. This may sound simple but in actuality it is difficult. A country can only prosper with the strength of its youth. You need to love yourself and you need to love your country. Do the right thing in life and stop pointing fingers at others and change yourself, said Lakshitha.
He maintains that his goal in life is to be a citizen that can be of use to the nation. His goal is not to be glamorous. What he wants is to be educated and lead an ethical lifestyle. He also commented that he would like to earn his bread and butter by being a lawyer.
There is a way to behave in public. You need to respect other people as human beings. You need to maintain goodwill amongst people and yourself. At the end of the day I want to be educated and known as someone who does the right thing in life, explained Lakshitha.
He is possessed of an inquisitive nature and has the bravery to discover.
Powerful knowledge
I have self belief and I am sensitive. I also have a lot of curiosity. I want to know how things work and why things work. I believe that knowledge is power. I have this great hunger for knowledge and I feel that you need to understand the world around you, explained Lakshitha.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, the former KGB agent and intelligence officer is a key figure in international politics. His presence on the world stage has one of great impact.
One world leader I admire is Russian President Vladimir Putin because he does not let anything interfere with his priorities. He carries on his family life and political life and does not mix these two. He does not let external forces shake his resolve. He does what he has to do. I also admire cricket sensation Kumar Sangakkara because of his versatile personality and his great cricketing feats, said Lakshitha.
When faced with a particularly challenging situation, Lakshitha will examine every possible outcome, scenario and eventuality. He will then come up with the ideal plan.
When solving a problem or encountering a difficulty I usually want to cover all my bases. I will normally ask advice from someone who is more senior to me, stated Lakshitha.
One attribute of Lakshitha is the fact that he is in no way disheartened by society. He has seen the positive side of society. This trust in society has enabled him to go forth with confidence. He has encountered people with the milk of human kindness. He has security and he trusts.
Courageous strength
When I first entered Mahinda College there was really nothing that stood out about me. However, Mahinda College brought out the hidden qualities in me and my hidden potential. I owe a lot to Mahinda College and my parents. I have received strength and encouragement from people, added Lakshitha.
Lakshitha commented that when you are a Mahindian you are instantly recognized. People know that you have skill and character. He proudly points out, that when you say you went to Mahinda, people expect great things from you.
Mahinda College celebrates 126 years this year. School life has been a joy and been immensely beneficial to me. I have learnt how to interact with people. I have learnt how to carry myself confidently. I have learnt to express myself with assurance. I am forward and can talk to anyone in society. I am not intimidated, pointed out Lakshitha.
A passionate cricketer and a keen follower of the game, Lakshitha looks forward to the big match between Mahinda College Galle and Richmond College Galle. This gives him a swell of pride.
Watching the match is such an exhilarating experience. Being a student of Mahinda gives me such great pride and happiness when I am at this event. Being the head prefect of the school is special because I do a lot of work willingly for my school since I love it and it gives me such pleasure. I also want to say that I get a lot of satisfaction helping people in society, added Lakshitha.
Lakshitha also never fails to acknowledge is Principal Gamini Jayawardane for the unwavering support given to him. He would also like to thank his master in charge Chamara Roshan.

Bolt struggling with football pace, but working hard
Gosford, Tuesday: Sprint superstar Usain Bolt admitted Tuesday he was struggling with the tempo of professional football but is working hard to raise his fitness levels ahead of his first trial match this week.
The eight-time Olympic champion has been given an opportunity by Australia's Central Coast Mariners to fulfil his dream of a soccer career and has stepped up his training regime since hooking up with the A-League club last week.
He was put through his paces with the rest of the squad at a more intensive session at the team's base in the town of Gosford, 75 kilometres (47 miles) north of Sydney, on Tuesday. After some warming up and a jog around the pitch, he took part in ball drills and while his passing was fine, he was slow to get the hang of the movement required.
The 32-year-old's lack of football fitness was also evident and he appeared to tire quickly, resting more than his teammates.
Bolt admitted to struggling with the constant stop-start of football, more used to a quick fire sprint on the athletics track before winding down. AFP

Bubbly magic to the fore
Magicians being a rare breed mesmerize masses with their unimaginable talents. They bequeath true-believers all around the world with enchanting entertainment.
World renowned magician David Copperfield had the capability to make the Statue of Liberty vanish for a few seconds before the very eyes of thousands of onlookers.
Stan Lee the creator of Marvel comics has not forgotten the marvels of magicians when creating his superhero characters. Stan created Dr Strange and gave him hypnotizing and mesmerizing powers that could match with the powers of any other comic book superhero.
The art of magic is believed to have originated in China. However it is now more popular in the western world. The concept of magic has evolved, usually being defined as a technique for bringing about changes in the physical world through the force of one's will.
Voodoo and witchery that involves the occult is known as black magic and is quite contrary to natural magic.
Natural magic became popular among the educated and upper classes of the 16th and 17th centuries.
The magical world of Babla
Babla is a young Bangladeshi magician who has migrated to Sri Lanka. This bubbly person aged 29 has a gamut of magical talents in his kitty.
His lifes story is touching. Babla has craved to become a magician from his childhood.
I was born in Chittagong, Bangladesh. When I was small, a carnival of magic was held in our village. I didnt have money to visit this carnival. Since I was denied of admission to the premises, I watched mesmerizing acts of world famous magicians through a hole in the vast tent they had out up, says Babla.
Bablas father has helped him to learn the art of magic from veterans afterwards.
Babla now has an academy at Maharagama where he teaches the art of magic to not only youngsters but to professionals from diverse fields such as doctors, engineers, lawyers, architects and artistes.
Magic is a captivating art. One has to develop the personality to become a persevering magician. The presenter in a magician should have the power to keep an audience intact, he says.
This art has a twofold pathway. Magic is one path and the other path is Hypnotism and Mesmerism. Making people believe what we want them to believe is the core of the subject, Babla adds.

Christie, Minions send Asian Games hosts into raptures
JAKARTA: Jonatan Christie ended Indonesia's long wait for the Asian Games men's badminton gold medal on Tuesday as Bahrain won the first major title in athletics' new gambit, the 4x400 metres mixed relay.
Christie sent the home crowd into raptures as he upset Taiwan's sixth-ranked Chou Tien-chen 21-18, 20-22, 21-15 to become Indonesia's first men's singles champion since 2006, before ripping off his shirt in celebration.
The 20-year-old's surprise win capped a memorable run for Indonesia's men after Anthony Sinisuka Ginting knocked out world champion Kento Momota and Olympic gold-medallist Chen Long en route to bronze.
I did not expect that I can win a gold at the Asian Games. Actually there are a lot of good players here and I never expected that I could come out as a winner, said Christie.
Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo and Marcus Fernaldi Gideon, nicknamed the Minions owing to their stature, rounded off the party as they won an all-Indonesian final against Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto 13-21, 21-18, 24-22.
In a celebratory atmosphere at the badminton stadium, Sukamuljo and Gideon collapsed to the floor as their opponents' final shot went wide to settle a tense final game.
Once-dominant China failed to win a singles badminton medal for the first time in 38 years, but otherwise it was another productive day for the Olympic heavyweights.
China passed 200 medals early in the day and they finished with four golds in track and field, including Xie Wenjun's come-from-behind victory in the 110m hurdles.
Xie, 28, capitalised on a late stumble by Taiwan's Chen Kuei-ru to claim China's ninth straight win in the event, before revealing he had received special instructions from Chinese hurdling great Liu Xiang.
Before the match, before I went to Europe, he gave me special instructions. I really thank him, said Xie, who also won the sprint hurdles in 2014.
But it was Bahrain who took the honours in the Games' inaugural mixed relay, a new venture which will feature at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. India were second, nearly four seconds behind.
It's the first time I've raced with girls! said Bahrain's Abbas Abbas.
As the dust settled on day 10, China were on 97 gold medals, more than double Japan's 43, with South Korea on 32 and Indonesia on 24.
Kurash, bang, wallop
Earlier, Saudi Arabia ended their wait for their first gold medal of the Games when they won equestrian's team jumping event.
Hong Kong's former Olympic bronze medallist Sarah Lee Wai-sze successfully defended her keirin title, becoming the first woman to win four track cycling golds at the Asian Games.
China's supreme table tennis players won their 10th women's and men's team golds as they kicked off their latest bid for a clean sweep of the sport.
Chinese 14-year-olds Zhang Jiaqi and Zhang Minjie -- who was celebrating her birthday -- became the 2018 Games' youngest winners, in the women's synchronised 10m platform.
Cao Yuan and Xie Siyi also won the men's synchronised 10m platform as China extended its perfect record of winning both events five times out of five at the Asian Games.
After complaints over the judging in Monday's pencak silat, in which Indonesian athletes won all six golds, Uzbekistan cleaned up in kurash, another martial art making its debut.

Controversy over the SWRD statue
There had been several letters in the press and news items in the electronic media on the sale/lease of lands to the Chinese. One such is the outright sale of the most, precious, scenic, strategic, valuable land which was once the Head Quarters of the Sri Lanka Army at Galle Face and also where the statue of the most respected and honoured political leader, the founder of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) S W R D Bandaranaike stands.
It is very strange, politicians of the SLFP and also his two daughters, Chandrika and Sunethra, who have vowed to carry out SWRD policies, have not made vehement protests when this outright sale was negotiated.
Does this mean the hotel Shangri la owners of this land will make this statue a tourist attraction He was a political leader who ushered in a different political culture embracing the common man.
Is Sri Lanka so poor that she has to sell this land to feed her people Whatever it is, it may be too late to cancel the sale or negotiate for a long-term lease, as the company which has purchased has started constructing this luxury Hotel.
Under the circumstances, it is best to relocate the statue in a prominent place in the city, unless of course, the sale includes the Statue as well.

COMBANK FOCUSES ON ENSURING CHILDRENS FUTURE - SANDRA WALGAMA
Decades after it pioneered a savings product for minors, the Commercial Bank of Ceylon continues to devote attention to developing products for children, a segment immensely important to the long-term vision of the bank.
Today, childrens accounts represent a substantial percentage of the banks account base and play a noteworthy role in keeping its CASA (Current Account- Savings Account) ratio, one of the healthiest in the local banking sector. In this interview, Commercial Banks Deputy General Manager, Personal Banking, Sandra Walgama elaborates on the banks focus on children.
Excerpts of the interview:
Q: There seems to be growing emphasis in Sri Lanka on banking products for children. How does Commercial Bank view this trend
A: Commercial Bank has always considered children a very important segment, both in terms of the products it offers as well as in terms of its corporate social responsibility initiatives. We in fact pioneered the savings product for children with the Isuru Minors Saving Plan in 1991. It is a unique savings product and is one of the best performing products in its category, having evolved over the past 25 years. Banking products for children continue to receive a lot of attention at Commercial Bank, because we believe in its potential and the fact that they build a very worthy customer base in the future.
Q: What products does the Bank have for this segment
A: The Isuru Minors Savings Plan is one of our principal savings accounts for children. It is a product that has been periodically improved with the addition of new features. Earlier this year, we launched Isuru VI, increasing the guaranteed amount receivable to Rs.8.8 million, when the child turns 18. Another equally popular childrens account is the Arunalu Childrens Savings Account, which is linked to a scheme that rewards high achievers at the Year 5 scholarship examination each year.
Q: What makes these products special
A: Lets look at the Isuru Minors Savings Plan first. It covers the period from birth to majority  age 18  and offers parents two savings options  a monthly deposit scheme or a lump sum deposit scheme, whichever suits their financial capacity. Under the lump sum deposit scheme, the guaranteed amount the Bank will pay, when the child turns 18, depends on the age of the child at the time the account is opened. Parents may deposit between Rs.5,000/- and Rs.1 million at any time between the day the child is born and the childs 10th birthday. A deposit of Rs.1 million at birth will guarantee the child a payment of more than Rs.5.7 million at the age of 18.
Under the monthly deposit option, the guaranteed amount depends on factors such as age of the child, agreed amount of the monthly deposit and the deposit period. Account could be opened for children between the ages of one day and ten years, and parents may choose to save between Rs.500/- and Rs.20,000/- (in multiples of Rs.500/-) a month, for five or ten years. A 10-year savings plan opened at birth of a child with a monthly commitment of Rs.20,000/- will guarantee a payment of Rs.8.8 million, when the child turns 18.
For parents who wish to save for their children, these figures are attractive, but what makes Isuru Minors Savings plan extra special is the fact that the Bank undertakes to pay the final guaranteed amount when the child turns 18, even in the event, the monthly deposits being interrupted due to the untimely demise of the depositor.
Q: And what are the unique features of the Arunalu Childrens Savings Account
A: The distinguishing feature of the Arunalu Childrens Savings Account is its cash rewards scheme for high achievers at the Year 5 scholarship examinations. Every year, Arunalu account holders have the opportunity to win cash prizes from the Bank if they are placed first, second or third at the national, district or school levels at the scholarship examination. This is intended to inspire young students and emphasise the value of good education.
The Bank pays up to Rs.450,000 to the top three scorers island-wide at the Year 5 Scholarship examination usually held in August every year, if they are Arunalu account holders. On this basis, the student or students placed first will receive up to Rs.200,000/-. Similarly, students placed second in the island will receive up to Rs.150, 000/-, while those placed third will receive up to Rs.100, 000/- .
Even if there are multiple winners within the top three ranks in the country, Arunalu rewards all such winners on the above basis. Additionally, Arunalu account holders ranked 1stin their respective districts at the examination receive up to Rs. 50,000/-, and account holders who are placed first, second and third in their schools receive cash prizes of Rs.10,000/-, Rs.7,500/- and Rs.5,000/- each respectively.
Q: How successful have these products been
A: They have been extremely successful and very popular among parents. Today childrens accounts represent about a tenth of our total accounts and we feel there is potential for further growth.
Q: What are the factors that have contributed to the success of these products
A: First and foremost, these products appeal to the instincts of parents. The next important factor is trust. Since these are long term products, parents look for a bank that is stable and trustworthy, and in those aspects Commercial Bank stands out.
The rates of interest and the final guaranteed sum are also important factors. Added to all these factors are the features, which are improved periodically as the products and the market evolves.
Q: Given the features of the banking products for children, are they profitable/sustainable for the bank
A: Yes they are. Our Childrens savings products represent a win-win for the parents and the Bank. Additionally, from the Banks point of view, childrens accounts are our future adult customers, so building a relationship with this segment makes sense.
Q: How do you see these products evolving in the years ahead
A: Childrens banking products will continue to thrive and the Bank will continue to look for exciting and innovative new features to add on to this product range.

Commission must be empowered to decide on polls calendar - PAFFREL
The Independent Election Commission should be empowered to decide on the election calendar, Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference to wind up the two-day Asian Electoral Stakeholder Forum in Colombo yesterday, Hettiarachchi said the Election Commission must be strengthened to decide on the time frame of elections, without passing the responsibility to those who are in power.
When we look back at the past 10 years, it is obvious that all the successive rulers conducted elections when the atmosphere was most advantageous to them.
The former Government was in the habit of holding the elections under several stages while this Government seems to be delaying the elections. Consolidating power is their priority. This is the bitter truth.
That is why we stress that the Election Commission must be given the power to decide on the election dates, he commented.
The members who attended the Forum adopted the Colombo Pledge at its end to promote and defend electoral democracy in Asia. About 300 participants from 45 countries took part in the gathering that provided a platform to share experiences and best practices relating to election transparency and integrity. The event was organized by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka and the Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL).
Hettiarachchi, who is also the General Secretary of the ANFREL, said holding timely elections to a specific election calendar is a key point included in the Colombo Pledge.
Responding to another question, he said the Election Commission has already paid its attention towards introducing an advanced voting system to assure the voting rights of all citizens, especially the disabled people and those who obtain residential treatment in hospitals.
He further pointed out even though all the stakeholders agree in principle over giving voting rights to Sri Lankan expat workers, numbering to over two million, there are practical problems in going ahead with that proposal.
Many of our workers are in Middle Eastern countries and it is questionable as to how many of them can come to the Sri Lankan Embassy to exercise their franchise. Besides, how can we ensure the freedom of the voter We have to gradually develop a system where we can address these issues and allow expat workers to vote freely, he commented.
ANFREL Executive Director Chandanie Watawala and Election Commissioners Prof. Rathnajeevan Hoole and Nalin Abeysekara also spoke.

Dairy farmers in Kataragama, Tissamaharama, Lunugamvehera and Thanamalwila urge the government to appoint native doctors at village level to treat their cattle.
Several dairy farmers said that they have to undergo untold hardships when their cattle contract diseases.
"A veterinarian's office is around 25 kilometers away.We have to hire a vehicle to take the animal.Medicine prescribed by vets is very expensive and we have buy them from pharmacies," farmers said.
In case of native doctors they visit the sick animal and prescribe medication prepared from barks, roots and leaves in the jungle and are comparatively cheaper than medicine prescribed by the veterinarians.
Most dairy farmers can afford this native treatment.If the government takes action to appoint native doctors for villages, dairy farmers will benefit, they said.

Enterprise Sri Lanka an initiative to empower the nation: Siyambalapitiya
Had significant initiatives been taken by preceding governments, the country could have been heaven by now, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said that yet, none of them were implemented properly to empower the public.
"But Enterprise Sri Lanka initiated by the Good Governance Government is not just a loan scheme, but an initiative to empower and provide facilities to entrepreneurs," he said.
The minister was addressing a ceremony held to grant loans to underprivileged clients of the People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon branches in Rambukkana, to develop their enterprises.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said,"The governments elected in the country after its Independence, introduced projects not to put the country in the labyrinth of chaos. However, had they had been properly implemented for at least five years, the country could have benefited."
Enterprise Sri Lanka would be implemented in parallel to the
Gamperaliya programme, he said, "This would empower the courageous. The world moves forward because of courageous people."
Minister Siyambalapitiya said, "We always take risks to help the nation as it is our responsibility as the government."
He said that one of the main issues faced by entrepreneurs, was obtaining loans from banks.
"They require lands as collateral," the minister said, "But today, the issue is that there are only 20 percent of clear deeds in the country."
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that the interest rate of the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme was low, and that it was designed for everyone, from three-wheelers driver to graduates.

Get your stress out with a laugh
YWCA of Sri Lanka is a pioneer as early as 1882 in creating safe spaces for young women embarking on educational and professional pursuits away from their sheltered lifestyles. The womens facilities at the National YWCA Headquarters in Rotunda Gardens Colombo 3 was initiated to provide various facilities for aspiring young women in the 1970s at subsidized rates. The present estimates of women of all ethnicities, religions, and economic strata who have walked through YWCA Hostel portals are over several thousands, while the demand for young womens safety is still significantly high. Between then and now the Hostel capacities have outgrown the increasing demands. Maintenance and refurbishment have become urgent. It is in keeping the vision of safe spaces for young women that we have organized a fundraiser to renovate and scale up facilities.
The fundraiser, Wilson Gunaratnes famous play Charitha Atak, will be staged on September 8 at the Bishops College Auditorium at 6.30 pm, where the main actor will portray eight different characters, which is how the play gets its name, Charitha Atak. Tickets for the show are available at the National YWCA of Sri Lanka and the Bishops College Auditorium.
The headquarters of the YWCA of Sri Lanka is located in Colombo in the heart of the city, with easy access to most Universities, Colleges, Businesses and Government Offices.
The land was gifted to the YWCA by Iranganie Peiris and the building was erected in 1976. The National YWCA building which is 45 years old comprises of three stories and houses the Office of the National YWCA, a Peace Room (for prayer and meditation), a Safe Space for Women (offers services to those in need of guidance in combating violence against women and HIV/AIDS), a Cafeteria and Kitchen, Hall and Board room, Hostel, and rooms for transient guests.
The hostel facilities in the original building were for only 75 students. Due to the demand for safe and affordable accommodation, the hostel now has a total of 170 hostellers. With this comes the need to repair and refurbish the 45 year old building.
Further, the building was designed by the renowned Architect Geoffrey Bawa. Therefore, it is of great architectural and historical value, enhancing the need for its refurbishment and maintenance to preserve its architectural design and historical significance.
The YWCA was initially founded in England in 1855 by Emma Roberts and Mary Jane Kinnaird and has its roots in a prayer group for women. Soon the Association established its first hostel for young women going out into the world and the first female training institution was founded shortly thereafter. The Colombo YWCA was born when Emily Kinnaird visited Ceylon in 1882 and met a group of women with similar aspirations.
YWCAs were soon formed in other major Ceylonese cities such as Kandy, Galle, Panadura and Jaffna.
The National YWCA of Sri Lanka is affiliated to the World YWCA in Geneva, Switzerland, is the mother organization of 22 local Associations spread throughout the country, and is an Approved Charity No.103586 by Gazette Notification of February 22, 1952.
The YWCA, by its very constitution, recognises the equal value and inclusivity in Gods eyes, of all human beings without distinction of any kind and more particularly advocates against discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language, gender, political opinion and so on.

Government abolished fascist rule: Rahuman
The government had laid the groundwork to take persons involved in corruption to task by amending laws, setting up an Anti-corruption High Court and Independent Commissions, Parlimentarian Mujibur Rahuman said yesterday. He added that two High Courts would be set up soon as well.
The Special High Court would take up the Rs.41-million fraud case against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, MP Rahuman said.
He said that the times to come were crucial, and that certain forces would attempt to bring back fascism that thrived during the Rajapaksa regime. Highlighting former minister Basil Rajapaksas statement on abolishing high courts, Rahuman said the Rajapaksas and their henchmen were intimidated by such establishments because they were corrupt.
If their hands are clean, why should they be afraid of courts They can come and give evidence, and if they are not guilty, they will be free,  he said, The reason why they are afraid of this establishment is because they are guilty.
The MP urged the public not to allow such politicians to regain power as they would destroy the milestones reached by the Good Governance Government. He added that the present governments jurisdiction was independent, unlike the previous regimes.
During the Rajapaksa regime, the Attorney-Generals (AGs) Department was controlled by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Chief Justice (CJ) was appointed by him. At present, important posts such as the CJ, AG, and Inspector General of Police are appointed by a constitutional council, as provisioned by the 19th Amendment to the constitution. All these contribute to the independent system we seek to establish, he said.
At present, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa could get an order preventing his arrest. Such an action was not possible for Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka during the Rajapaksa regime. Hence, it is evident that the government had created a setting for independent operation of the jurisdiction and other government institutions, he added.
MP Rahuman said the present government was not influencing investigations being conducted into the Treasury bond issue.
Asked if President Maithripala Sirisena had shown any interest in making former President Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister, MP Rahuman said that the President would not consider it.
Highlighting the Provincial Council elections postponement, MP Rahuman said they were ready to hold the election according to the previous electoral system, if the new system was yet to be amended.
Asked if a group of United National Party (UNP) backbenchers were ready to support the Joint Opposition, MP Rahuman said no backbencher would support the JO.
