A/L results not filled by SAITM graduand
The SAITM graduand who requested registration from the Sri Lanka Medical Council left the space allocated in the application for A/Level results blank, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Speaking at a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the student requested the SLMC registration after the Supreme Court judgement and then the SLMC informed her to forward an accurately filled application.
So far this student has failed to submit the accurately filled complete application for SLMC registration. She has not filled the box for A/Level results. What we can gather is that she wants to avoid filling this box in the application, Dr. Aluthge said.
Applicants need to fill an application accurately and completely to obtain the registration of the SLMC which registers all MBBS doctors.
Any person needs to pass the Advanced Level Examination in the Science stream to study for the MBBS degree.
No MBBS doctor can practice without SLMC registration, he said.

Affectionate felines
These beautiful creatures have a rare quality that we humans would do well to cultivate: a large capacity to receive affection. When a lovely cat saunters our way, its not easy to resist the impulse to stroke him or her, even when its not so wise.
Feeling Received
One reason we may love to stroke these adorable creatures is because the rhythmic action of stroking their velvety fur feels good. It focuses our attention, as happens in meditation. But Im convinced theres more to it than that.
I believe that a major reason we love cats is because of an uncanny ability that few humans possess: they register our tactile presence in a deeply felt way. They really know how to let us in! Theyre right there in the delectable moment receiving our touch.
Delighting in our physical presence, they may begin to purr and perhaps roll on their backs, exposing their vulnerability.
Their gift to us is that they receive us deeply, without any troubling cognitions or disturbing memories of less savory moments, such as when we forgot to feed them or clean their litter box. They let all of that go. Theyre just here with us right now.
Power of healing
Research has shown that cats can be very healing for us. A 10-year research study suggests that cat owners were less likely to die of heart attacks than people who have never owned one. The latter group was 40 percent more likely to die from heart attacks and 30 percent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease. Other studies confirm that cats can lower our blood pressure and release dopamine and serotonin, which reduce stress and improve immune functioning.
Cats can also help release oxytocin, which is associated with the feeling of being in love. As we know, love heals, and perhaps an important aspect of this healing is the bonding created by their ability to receive us deeply.
If youre fortunate to have an affectionate cat in your life, notice how he or she receives your affection.
How do you feel inside when youre being deeply received Be a cat. Get out of your head, take a deep, easy breath, and be mindfully present with how it feels in your body to receive a hug and affection from a loved one. Whether from a cat or human, letting in love just might heal you.

Apple unveils new iPad Pro and Mac computers at NYC event
NEW YORK - Apple Inc launched its new iPad Pro, MacBook Air and Mac mini at an event in Brooklyn, New York City, offering long-awaited updates to some of its popular devices.
The tech giant unveiled what its calling the biggest change to the iPad since its inception eight years ago. The new design eliminates the home button, pushes 11-inch and 12.9-inch Liquid Retina displays to the edges of iPad Pro, and integrates Face ID to securely unlock iPad.
The Silicon Valley firm also updated its high-tech stylus, the Apple Pencil. The Pencil now magnetically attaches to the tablet to charge wirelessly, and has touch gestures for switching between digital drawing tools on the iPad.
Other features of the tablets include a new USB-C connector, Gigabit-class LTE, and up to 1TB of storage enabling powerful mobile workflows for creative pros.
The new iPad Pro is a huge step forward for powerful, creative, mobile computing, said Philip Schiller, Apples senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
The new MacBook Air comes with a 13.3-inch, edge-to-edge retina display, as well as Touch ID that allows users to unlock the device, make payments and log into apps.
At 2.75 pounds, MacBook Air is a quarter pound lighter than the previous model, and also a bit thinner and smaller.
Apple revamped the keyboard and track pad, too, and upgraded the microphones and speakers for better audio.
In addition to the Macbook Air, Apple announced a new Mac mini, a desktop computer that connects to an external monitor.
With quad- and 6-core processors, up to 64GB of faster memory and blazing fast all-flash storage, the new Mac mini works five times faster than its predecessor, Apple said.
Both the new MacBook Air and Mac mini are made entirely of recycled aluminum, while all those new products unveiled at the event are available to order Tuesday and will arrive on Nov 7.
Apple usually launches its new products in fall, a few weeks ahead of the United States traditional holiday shopping season.
In September, the company unveiled its new iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR at an event on the new campus at its headquarters in Cupertino, northern California.

Army adopts Capstone Doctrine
The Sri Lanka Army added another milestone by releasing its Capstone Doctrine, during a brief ceremony at the Colombo Army Hospital auditorium on Tuesday, presided by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
The Capstone Doctrine encompasses theory, history, experimentation and practice and lays down guidelines with which the organisation is expected to function in keeping with ground realities and regional and global developments of the times. It also provides the military with an authoritative body of statements on how military forces conduct operations and provides a common terminology for use by military planners and leaders.
The doctrine, produced by the Army think-tank, Army Training Command (ARTRAC) at Diyatalawa, was initiated by the Army Commander in close collaboration with Senior Officers at the ARTRAC, commanded by Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi.
A comprehensive presentation on the newly-authored Capstone Doctrine and how it has been put into words was presented to the audience by ARTRAC Brigadier Strategy and Doctrine Brigadier Nanda Hathurusinghe, who has been one of the heavyweights behind the realisation of the project.
Today, the Sri Lanka Army reached a new milestone with the Army doctrine compiled with principles and examples from experience and operations. Doctrine is not just what is thought or what is published or what is believed. It is an approved set of principles and methods intended to provide large military organisations with a common outlook and uniform basis for action, the Army Commander said.
In the past 30 years, the Army was trained and organised to fight as a professional Army to defeat what we call the most ruthless terrorist organisation in the world. Our practices have become our principles. Our military practices and operations were not based on principles or doctrine. But it was purely on standing order procedures or SOPs. How military activities and operations are directed, mounted, commanded, executed sustained and recovered are covered in the Doctrine, the Army Commander said.
Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, and Army Health Services Director General Major General (Dr) Sanjeewa Munasinghe, and senior officers were also present at the event.

Be wary of misinformation  campaign - Information Dept. DG
Government Information Department Director General Nalaka Kaluwewa releasing a statement yesterday asked that people be wary of a campaign to mislead the general public through false and inaccurate information, being spread on many media platforms.
As several measures are being taken for the benefit and stability of Sri Lankas political and economic environment, it is important that the public act with national unity in mind and understanding for the good of the nation, he said.
The Director General explained that certain groups and organisations were trying to weaken national unity by spreading fake and misleading news via social media, websites, and other media to build certain opinions which are baseless.
By spreading such false rumours, they are trying to create conflicting opinions, to cause political instability, and create tension in various places among the people.
The government asks the people that they not believe news or information without any proof or confirmation from an official source.
It is the responsibility of the Department of Government Information to provide the people with the governments official news and we are continuously working to ensure that the people receive, verified information in a timely manner, Kaluwewa further stated.

On the beach with canine pal
Beach days can be a blast when you bring along a canine pal or three, but taking a dog to the beach requires some preparation, know-how and a little common sense -- or should that be canine sense
Anything that can harm you at the beach can also harm your dog, such as sunburn, riptides, jellyfish, broken glass, sharp shells and aggressive dogs. But a beach day isn't supposed to be about doom and gloom. Having a great day is easy when you know how to prepare for and prevent any potential mishaps. Read on for best safety tips to help you and your pal find fun and relaxation together in the sun, surf and sand.
Temperature threat
Warm summer temperatures at the beach can pose a threat to a dog's health. Make sure that your dog has a shady retreat under a beach umbrella, tree or picnic bench. Bring plenty of fresh, cool water and a doggie bowl. Offer refills liberally, making sure that the water does not get hot in the sun.
Remember that the sand can be scorching on sensitive paws, so provide a blanket or towel for your dog's comfort when he takes a break from romping in the surf.
Recall command
The key to off-leash fun at the beach is having a solid grasp on the recall command -- meaning that your dog comes to you when you call him, every single time. Teach this skill at home, and if your dog still has questionable recall skills, the beach is a great place to work on this critical command around lots of distractions.
Place your dog on a long leash (also called a long line, about 20-30 feet -- 6-9 meters -- long), available at most pet retailers. While at the beach, call your dog and give him a treat and praise every time he returns to you. You can let him play with a ball or toy for a reward as well. Use his name only for something good, like coming back to you for a treat or toy, not for scolding him.
Allow off leash
Allow your dog off leash at the beach only when you are reasonably sure that the recall command has become a good habit -- and always keep treats on hand.
While your dog is having his carefree splash in the sea, keep an eye out for beach hazards -- learn more about what to watch for on the next page.
The beach is fun, but it does come with hazards, such as ingesting questionable objects (and even ocean water), cuts and scrapes and even the potential for drowning.
Take first Aid
Bring a first aid kit with you in case of cut paws or jellyfish stings. Include cotton balls, ammonia (for stings, dilute with water before applying), peroxide and bandages.
If your dog is a puppy, hasn't learned to swim well or is a brachycephalic or a short-legged breed, consider giving him a doggie life jacket to wear so that he doesn't overtire himself in the water. Always supervise any dog while he's in or near the water and be cautious of rip tides, sharks and deep water.
Salt water on a dog's skin and paws can be irritating, so a fresh-water rinse before leaving the beach or shortly after arriving home will help keep your dog comfy and his skin and coat healthy.
Finally, for your own peace of mind, bring a thick blanket and plenty of towels to line the car seat where your dog sits for the ride home. Your dog will probably fall asleep on the way home, your own reward for a fun, safe, happy beach day.

BROAD RELIEF FOR ALL SECTORS
The newly appointed Prime Minister and Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday directed authorities to implement a series of concessions for the public and local entrepreneurs in a bid to boost economic growth and bring down the cost of living.
This relief package for consumers and concessions for other sectors of the economy will be effective immediately.
A Government news release issued yesterday said the President and the Prime Minister and Finance and Economic Affairs Mnister have raised concerns regarding the serious setback in the economy reflected in the persistently low growth rates during the last 3 years along with the rising cost of living.
The Prime Minister is of the view that ill-conceived economic and financial policies of the previous Government have led to this situation by marginalising local entrepreneurs, industries and domestic production, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs said in a media statement. The Government also expects to reduce its expenditure with the rationalisation of Cabinet ministries as reflected in a lessor number of ministries and reexamination of capital expenditure programs. Accordingly, the government is confident that the primary surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP and the budget deficit of around 4.9 percent of GDP that have been targeted for 2018 could be achieved in support for further fiscal consolidation to provide economic stability. The measures for further consolidation of external trade and payment transactions are also being examined to provide much needed stability to the exchange rate.
As 2018/2019 Maha cultivation season has begun with extremely favorable weather throughout the country, the economy is set to get a new revival as all hydro power reservoirs and irrigated schemes have reached full storage capacity to generate electricity, provision of drinking water and water for cultivation. The Government thinks that this is the best opportunity to prepare the country to get the maximum benefit from agricultural production. At the same time the consumers are saddled with high cost of living. In this background the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs has given directions to implement several initiatives to revive the economy, it added.Accordingly, the commodity prices will be reduced with immediate effect. Given the impact of fuel pricing on all strata of the society specially those engaged in transport, agriculture and fisheries sectors, price of Petrol (Octane 92) and Auto Diesel will be reduced and Lubricants including the 2T lubricants used in three-wheelers and small agricultural engines by Rs.10 per litre.
A guaranteed price scheme will be introduced for Paddy, Onion and Potatoes produced locally by our farmers. Accordingly, Special Commodity Levy will be raised during harvesting period to protect farmers through remunerative guaranteed prices. As potatoes and B-Onions are being harvested, SCL on potatoes and B-Onions will be maintained at Rs.40 per Kg. In order to mitigate the impactof adverse weather conditions which resulted in farmerslosing their livelihood and becoming heavilyindebted, interest and the penal interest incurred by farmers and small Paddy Mill owners on loans up to a maximum of Rs.50 million, from all Commercial Banks during the past 3 years, will be written off in full and will be borne by the Government.
The maximum threshold on Loan advances given by Samurdhi Banks to Samurdhi beneficiaries to support their livelihood activities will be increased by Rs.10,000.
The adverse impact created by high indirect taxes will be mitigated by simplification of VAT and NBT. The VAT threshold will be increased from Rs.12 million per annum to Rs.24 million per annum. The threshold for the VAT liability of wholesale and retail sector also will be increased from Rs.50 million to Rs.100 million per twelve months providing benefits to small traders and businesses.
The VAT rate applicable on the import of Sawn Timber will be reduced to 5% to support the local Construction Industry.
VAT on import of fabric will be exempt providing benefits to the small and medium garment manufacturers. The thrust of these initiatives are to encourage production and simplify the tax system. It will certainly help households with additional income in their hands. The proposed changes to the tax system will also encourage inward remittances and savings. The President and the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs have directed the implantation of the above policy measures. The necessary Gazettes for the aforementioned tax related proposals will be issued immediately.

PRESIDENT WANTS PEACE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
President Maithripala Sirisena has made a request to the trade union leaders not to leave room for any untoward incidents in public institutions and maintain peace in them.
We thank the president for stressing the importance of peace.
To develop the country, we must improve our industries, improve our agriculture, improve our exports and various other things. To do all this we must have peace in the country.
During the past thirty years, we have not done enough to develop our country. The main reason for this is that we did not have peace in the country.
Peace and order is very important for the development of our economy. Peace and order affects our economic stability. Peace helps in maintaining social order and political stability.
Because all of life is interconnected, our fear, hatred and anger decrease the peace in the world, whereas our love, joy and gratitude increase the peace. Peace is important to all human beings.
Peace is not absence of conflict. It is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.
Forgive others because not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.
If you want peace, you do not talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.
Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can only be achieved through understanding.
Peace as we all know is very important in our lives and it is essential to our overall well-being. However this is something that has regrettably, eluded us for years in this world.
It has been hindered by war, conflicts and disagreements throughout human history, which has left our world and the many people in it in a deplorable, emotional and physical state. This should not be the case.

ComBank sponsors math support  program for Mullaitivu Schools
Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently sponsored a math support program benefitting 130 students in four schools in the Mullaitivu area in collaboration with the Sasnaka Sansada Foundation which conducted the program.
Aligned with the Banks education-centric corporate social responsibility agenda, this two-day residential programme titled Sasnaka Sansada Ganitha Saviya was conducted in line with the essential teaching concepts of the Ministry of Education.
Students from Sampath Nuwara National School, Kalyanipura Vidyalaya, Paranagama WewaVidyalaya and Ehetugaswewa Vidyalaya in which there is a dearth of mathematics teachers, were part of this math support programme.
Conducted in response to a request made by the Maths branch of the Ministry of Education, the objective of this programme was to increase the level of achievement of the students and motivate them, thereby positively affecting the examination results of these schools, in which there is an 80% fail rate in mathematics at the GCE Ordinary Level.
The Math Lab concept was launched in 2015 by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon to stimulate and develop the mathematical and analytical skills of school children in Sri Lanka. Inspired by the results achieved by the Math Lab concept pioneered at the Miyenakandura government school, Passara, by former teacher and innovative learning materials designer Hengodage Dharmasiri, the Commercial Bank initiative has so far benefitted approximately 5,000students across the country.
Sasnaka Sansada, the organising body of the recent math support program, is a forum of professionals in a social service organisation committed to uplift talents, develop skills and the giftedness of the children of Sri Lanka. Its Sasnaka Sansada Ganitha Saviya initiative is a successful national program aimed at reducing the level of failures in the Sri Lankan syllabus and improving the level of achievement in the mathematics field. In the past year, it has launched 150 math programs across Sri Lanka.
Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets; Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon and a Microfinance company in Nay PyiTaw; the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake; and Italy, where the Bank operates its own money transfer service.

DFCC Performs Creditably Despite Headwinds
DFCC Bank, the largest entity within the group recorded an increase in Profit before tax and Profit after tax of 11% and 1% respectively compared to the previous corresponding period after adjusting for the exceptional gain from sale of Commercial Bank equity shares reported in the previous period, despite substantially higher impairment and taxation provisions.
However, the reported Profit before tax of LKR 3,792 million and a Profit after Tax of LKR 2,530 million reflects a decline of 13% and 26% respectively compared to the corresponding period in 2017 after the exceptional gain is accounted for.
The Group recorded a profit before tax of LKR 4,036 million and profit after tax of LKR 2,693 million for the nine months ended 30 September 2018 as compared to LKR 4,377 million and LKR 3,391 million respectively, in the comparative period in 2017.
The Bank recorded a healthy growth of 22% in Net Interest Income to LKR 10,020 million from LKR 8,228 million mainly as a result of the net portfolio growth of LKR 40,725 million in loans and receivables year-on-year and the prudent management of asset and liability re-pricing. The overall net interest margin (NIM) improved from 3.6% in 2017 to 3.8% by end of 3rd quarter of year 2018, based on the total assets of the Bank.
Further, a growth of 28% was recorded in fees and commission income to LKR 1,422 million from LKR 1,110 million in September 2017.
Total Operating Income increased to LKR 11,609 million compared to LKR 10,638 million in the comparative period.
DFCC Bank continued to penetrate the market by extending its branch network, conducting extensive business promotions including a new savings campaign, and by investing in innovative products and IT system modernisations that have contributed towards expanding delivery channels and improving service deliverables. The Bank has added seven-fledged branches to its branch network during the nine months period. This largely contributed to the increase in Operating Expenses to LKR 4,870 million from LKR 4,190 million (16%) in the comparable period.
The impairment provision during the period increased to LKR 1,898 million compared to LKR 1,017 million in the comparable period. However, recovery processes are being rigorously pursued to minimize any actual losses that may arise from such exposures.

Ebert Silva Holidays mark Founders Day
A series of CSR and religious events will be today, by family members and staff of Ebert Silva Group to mark the 86th Birthday Remembrance of the founder, Ebert Silva, a legend in Sri Lankas travel and tourism industry.
Born on November 2, 1932, Nomis de Silva, father of Ebert Silva founded a passenger transport company in the early 1920s and later named it after his eldest son as Ebert Silva Omni Bus Company Limited. It was his fathers untimely death in 1953 that compelled young Ebert Silva to take over the reins of the company and become one of the youngest entrepreneurs of the bus company era.
At a decisive turbulent juncture in Sri Lankan history in 1953, Nationalization took place and the 36 bus companies that were in operation were also nationalized to form the Central Transport Board.
Enduring the excruciating loss of the Omni Bus Company to nationalization which occurred almost overnight, Ebert Silva nurtured the Touring Company which he incorporated as a young 22 year old to cater to the then emerging market - Tourism.
Ebert Silva was a passionate lover of motor vehicles that led him to have a unique and rare collection of vintage and classic motor cars.
As young entrepreneur Ebert Silva initiated many tour packages to less seen and travelled places in the island and was among the first to introduce package tours to promote places of historic and scenic importance in Sri Lanka.
With roots going as far back as the 1920s, the Ebert Silva brand stands out with its time tested contribution being interwoven with the long history of the islands transport and tourism industries. Well after 9 long decades today, his vision has also contributed the tourism industry with its first ever open deck city sightseeing service in Sri Lanka, a distinct feature in every leading tourist destination around the world. The service was launched in 2010 under his guidance and is operated by Ebert Silva Holidays in collaboration with Sri Lanka Tourism.
In recognition of a lifetime of committed contribution to Sri Lankas travel industry he was honored with the Presidential Award as a Legend in Sri Lankas Travel and Tourism in 2009.
Ebert Silva will be remembered with deep love and honour and gratitude by the family and staff marking his 86th Birthday Remembrance, said Rajini de Silva Mendis Chairperson, Ebert Silva Holidays Ebert Silva Properties and Ebert Silva Foundation.

The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) in collaboration with the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Mumbai, India organized a Production Process Improvement and Market Penetration Programme for 10 export ready SMEs identified under 2000 New Exporters Development Programme, coinciding with Annapoorana  World of Food India 2018 from September 26  October 2, 2018 in Mumbai, India.
The EDB is implementing a national programme to nurture 2000 new entrepreneurs to become exporters during the period 2017 - 2022 at regional level. The main objective of this programme is to encourage domestic enterprises to invest in export industries to achieve the overall export target of US$ 28 billion in 2022.

Ending the tax burden
The assurance given by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was sworn in as Finance Minister on Wednesday, that the people will no more be subjected to excessive taxes, would be welcomed by all citizens irrespective of political affiliations. Assuming duties at his Ministry, Premier Rajapaksa said that in the light of the high Cost of Living (due to excessive taxes) the Government will provide relief to the public. He noted that both direct and indirect taxes have caused a complex situation.
It goes without saying that a Government cannot run a country without taxes. It is through taxes that the salaries of Government teachers, the Forces, Government doctors, public pensions, etc. are paid. In short it is through public taxes that the entire administrative machinery is run. However, taxing should be rational and imposed in a manner that would not burden the public. The previous regime levied taxes willy nilly with even essential items being subjected to unconscionable taxes. This is exactly what Premier Rajapaksa is seeking to redress by levying taxes in a way that the people will not feel the pinch - mala nothala ron gannawa (taking the sap without trampling the flower), as the local idiom he quoted would better explain.
The PM, who was Finance Minister for the entire duration of his ten year Presidency, it may be recalled, never imposed harsh tax measures that would have made a dent in the home budget. He ordered the immediate removal of the fuel tax imposed on electricity bills which was becoming unbearable to the people. One can rest assured, therefore, that he would similarly ease the COL burden which at present has become unbearable.
Typically, Premier Rajapaksa has also laid firm emphasis on reviving local industries which were allowed to go into wrack and ruin by the policies of the UNP which traditionally promoted foreign enterprises. The PM also spoke of reducing unwarranted imports so that the people would once again turn to local products which anyway they had survived on for centuries. The drain in foreign exchange due to across-the-board imports contributed largely towards the current economic crisis. The uncontrolled imports of items that are locally produced in abundance also dealt a body blow to the vegetable and fruit farmer forcing them to destroy their crop for want of a market.
The Premier said that since everything is imported the local farmer had been unfairly treated. In future priority will be given to local products by which the country would be made self-sufficient to give the local farmer more opportunities.
The PM is only too aware that the bulk of the massive vote which the SLPP received at the February 10 Local Government election came from the farmers and the rural community in general who were ignored by the UNP. Hence, the emphasis he has laid towards uplifting the rural economy through the development and upgrading of rural industries which had been allowed to wither away.
The Premier was also insistent that all sectors have to play an active role in resurrecting the economy from the dumps to which it had fallen.We have to implement an economic policy which could improve all sectors, including exports, tourism and foreign employment. Local and foreign investors would have to play the key role in this process, he went on to emphasize.
Motorists, nay the entire public, no doubt, will applaud the move by the Prime Minister to scrap the
mila sootheray, the so called price formula devised for petroleum by the former Government which became the butt end of many a joke to most. The recent periodic fuel price hikes, no doubt, had a major bearing on the COL and also the price of domestic LP Gas which even drove up the price of a plain tea of those doing the hard grind. The public will expect the Premier to grant them some relief on this score by reducing the prices of fuel and Gas whenever there is a drop in the World Market prices.
The Prime Minister, in his address, vowed to offer relief covering all segments of the public. Among those who will look up to the Premier for relief, no doubt, will be the pensioners and retirees of the private sector who depend on their terminal benefits such as the EPF for their survival. Disproportionate taxes are levied by commercial banks by way of the debit tax for withdrawals.
These folk depend solely on their savings for their medical and other needs that arise in old age. Newspapers in their readers columns often publish the lamentations of these sections who served their country well for decades and are now in the evening of their lives. They would be ever grateful to the Prime Minister if some form of relief could be offered to them in this regard. There are also complaints that the special interest rate offered to senior citizens for deposits totaling Rs. 1.5 million under the former regime is not being paid by some banks. This too should be looked into without delay.

Exciting month of Test cricket on the cards:
England can rise to second place with series win over Sri Lanka
The sports traditionalists will have one eye on Asia where seven of the worlds proud Test playing countries will not only try to establish their dominance over their respective rivals, but will also aim to improve their rankings in the MRF Tyres ICC Mens Test Team Rankings.
Bangladesh will play host to Zimbabwe and the Windies in a two-Test series each, England will travel to Galle for first of the three Tests against Sri Lanka, while the United Arab Emirates will be the stage for the three-Test series between Pakistan and New Zealand.
Virat Kohlis India leads the Test team rankings, but only 11 points separate second-ranked South Africa from seventh-ranked Pakistan. This means there could be movement in the middle of the pack, depending on how the four series pans out.
Bangladesh can move ahead of the Windies in eighth place but to make that happen, they will have to win all the four Tests; England can rise to second, but will have to win the series; Sri Lanka can move ahead of fifth-placed Australia, but will have to win all the three Tests; New Zealand will rise to second irrespective of how Sri Lanka-England series ends if they sweep the three-Test series against Pakistan; while Pakistan can move ahead of Australia if they win 3-0.
Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson and James Anderson of England will be the highest-ranked Test batter and bowler, respectively, who will be in action in the ICCs pinnacle format this month.
Williamson is presently ranked third in the MRF Tyres ICC Player Rankings for Test Batsmen, but England captain Joe Root is narrowly behind him in fourth position.
Dimuth Karunaratne of Sri Lanka is his sides highest-ranked batsman in seventh position, Azhar Ali is Pakistans highest-ranked batsman in 15th spot, Mushfiqur Rahim is Bangladeshs highest-ranked batsman in the absence of Shakib Al Hasan, while Brendan Taylor is Zimbabwes highest-ranked batsman in 46th position.
The Sri Lanka versus England series opener in Galle will be Rangana Heraths 93rd and final Test. The left-arm spinner had made his debut at the same venue against Australia 19 years ago and will enter in his final Test as his sides highest-ranked bowler in seventh place. With 430 wickets, he is his countrys second most successful bowler after Muthiah Muralitharan.

Ford Motor India drives  into profit zone
Ford Motors Indian unit swung to profit in fiscal 2018 after reporting losses for almost a decade, as cost reduction efforts and improved capacity utilisation, after making the country an export base, started paying rich dividends.
Ford Motor India posted a profit of Rs 526 crore in fiscal 2018, compared with a loss of Rs 521 crore the previous year, it said in a filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The company that entered the Indian market in 1996 previously posted a profit in 2009. The turnaround in the Indian operation happens at a critical time when the carmaker is battling a slow down in China and margin deterioration in its home market of the US.
The change has been triggered by adoption of what it called the Emerging Market Operating Model, which led to a structural cost reduction of more than 37% in the past few years, coupled with increased capacity utilisation.
. A 16% jump in export volumes to 1.8 lakh units, along with increased domestic volume, drove the companys total sales growth to 15% in FY18 to 2.7 lakh units. Revenue for the year rose 23% to 22,049 crore, as against a 33% growth in fiscal 2017.
A five-year plan defined by the US-based automaker a couple of years back places significant emphasis on strong brands, right products, competitive costs and effective scale to boost its emerging market business.
To build brand, the company focussed on busting the feeling of high cost of ownership to bring in right products, suited to the requirements of Indian buyers with strong contribution from its local product development centre. In FY18, Ford claimed it had the youngest portfolio of products in the country which helped its domestic sales.
Ford also focussed on building competitive cost by using more locally sourced components, parts commonality and delivering effective scale by aligning production to demand and leveraging exports to driver capacity utilisation.
Localisation levels increased to more than 85% of components in FY18 from 75% a few years ago.
Ford India said it is committed to building a sustainable, profitable business in India, which continues to be one of the worlds fastest growing markets for passenger vehicles.
Reviewing the strong performance of FY18, the directors report filed with the ministry said the company was continuously pursuing the strategic objective, which contributed to improved business performance and turnaround in operations.
In order to accelerate cost reduction and rationalise the investment in new products, Ford entered into a memorandum of understanding in FY18 with Mahindra & Mahindra, which will allow the company to expand its product portfolio in the market at lower cost and through the partners strong local know-how. The deal will also help it reduce cost on parts sourcing. (The Economic Times)

## Title: GARFIELD SOBERS the greatest

GARFIELD SOBERS the greatest
We take wing to far away Barbados in the West Indies to tribute the greatest cricketer ever given to the world of cricket by the Almighty and rightly named GARFIELD ST. AUBURN SOBERS.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s the mere mention of the name SOBERS brought awe to cricket fans all over the globe. It instilled fear in the cricketers who were going to front up to him in the game. And nonetheless awe and admiration.
SOBERS was a once in a life time cricketer that the world was fortunate to see and will ever see. He was from dream world. He was the greatest all rounder born to this planet. As a stylish left hander he could pummel any fierce attack.
Twinkle toed footwork
His footwork was twinkle toed packed with strokes, some even innovative and once ball kissed bat, it would leave fielders planted as the ball skimmed the turf and to the boundary or over it. Blades of grass, it is said with poetic license, would bow in obeisance.
His bat was like a magic wand in his hands. He could make the ball once it strikes his bat to caress it gracefully with jet power and pilot it to any place on the field or over it. It is said that many bowlers shied to bowl at him.
As a bowler he could make the ball do his biddingbowling varieties with the new ball  seam, swing, slow ones, and when the ball has lost its sheen to bowl spinners that spun like tops into the batsmen, away from the batsmen and breach their defence and sound the death knell of batsmen.
Blinding catches
As a fielder he possessed a quick eye and in any position he fielded he would grab blinding catches, dive and save certain boundaries. And batsmen would not dare steal runs when he had ball in hand, because his throws were spot on to the wicket or over the bails to the wicket keeper to do the rest.
As captain he was flamboyant and a gambler. To see drawn games was anathema to him and he would gamble by giving the opposing team a tempting chase able score for victory and most times performed the miracle by giving his side victory.
Sri Lanka during its infancy in the Test game had the good fortune of signing him on as coach thanks to the indefatigable President of cricket of that time Gamini Dissanayake and the power behind the throne in that era in former Ceylon all rounder Abu Fuard.
Given a free hand
SOBERS was given a free hand. He immediately injected the all important win at all costs to the cricketers under his tutelage. He introduced the dash and daring and the cricketers who had the good fortune of his influence still talk in awe of his methods that were brilliant.
At a cocktail party Fuard introduced me to the great man. It was a learning experience talking cricket with him and he recalled his early days and love for the game that made him the colossus that he was in world cricket. Any other lesser mortal would love to caw about his petty deeds, but not SOBERS. He was simple, unassuming and ever ready to help and talk cricket.
SOBERS was due to travel to Kandy with the team and when I told him that he would love the scenic beauty there and what he would like to do first, putt came the reply, of course he was poking fun   I will grab a damsel. And a loud guffaw ensued. That was SOBERS for you.
Good fortune
Sri Lankan cricket fans had the good fortune of seeing the emerging star in action at the Colombo Oval in 1961 when a few of the stars of that fantastic West Indian team led by Sir Frank Worrell played a team of locals named the DAILY MIRROR X1 which match was organized by the Managing Director/Editor Felix Goonewardene of the TIMES OF CEYLON.
SOBERS walked in to bat sporting a pair of dark glasses to a resounding cheer by a full house and he did not disappoint. Although playing a short knock, he showed the immense potential playing some exquisite strokes all round the wicket.
It was with similar strokes that he pulverized the Australian bowlers in that epoch making Test series which saw the first tied Test in the games history in the 1960/61 series down under which brought cricket alive with two of the attacking captains that cricket has seen and yet to see Sir Frank Worrell and Richie Benaud. Both greats are sadly no more.
First padding up
SOBERS was born on July 29, 1936 in Barbados and wore his first pads at Bay Street Boys School and he immediately began to show class and with every game his natural talents began to surface. GARY was one of six children born to Shamont and Thelma Sobers. Calamity struck the family when they lost their father in a shipwreck and GARY was just five years old.
The Calypso and cricket mad fans who noticed the talent in him as a 15-year old playing in the Barbados Cricket League predicted a great future for him. As his recognition grew he was selected to play for Barbados against a touring Indian side at the age of 16 and impressed capturing 6 for 142 with his cocktail like deliveries
SOBERS stepped into what the game is all about Test cricket  as a 17-year old at Sabina Park against England and left his mark taking 4 wickets and making 14 not out and 26. On a tour of England in 1957 Wisden Cricket Almanac showered praise on him and he repaid that praise with a double hundred against Nottinghamshire which county he was to play for later.
Stunned the cricket world
SOBERS stunned the cricket world when as a 21-year old he scored 365 not out against Pakistan in a Test at Sabina Park, thus becoming the youngest to score a triple hundred. In doing so he erased Englands Len Huttons record of 364 made against Australia which stood for a long time.
When I toured Pakistan with the Sri Lanka team on their inaugural tour in 1982 and at a tea party hosted by that reputed Pakistani cricket writer Qamar Ahmed, I met left arm spinner Nasimul Ghani and in conversation and talking about SOBERS record breaking knock he confided in me that SOBERS was out a couple of times. But the umpire fearing the hostile and boisterous West Indian crowd who were baying for SOBERS and not wanting to be lynched refused to raise his finger.
Sobering influence
SOBERS was lucky to come under the sobering influence of Frank Worrell one of the three terrible Ws  the other two being Clyde Walcott and Everton Weekes. Worrell had a big influence on his game and it showed as his career gathered momentum.
SOBERS had the misfortune of losing his dear friend and another mauler of opposing attacks Collie Smith when the car driven by him met with an accident in England in 1959. That misfortune stirred the devil in him as he began to put many opposing attacks to the sword and his phenomenal deeds saw him win the Wisden Leading Cricketer of the Year eight times.
Once in a game playing for the Rest of the World against Australia he smashed a magnificent 254 which the great Sir Donald Bradman classed as one of the greatest exhibitions of batting ever seen in Australia. SOBERS also became the first batsman to hit six sixes in an over when playing for Nottinghamshire he thrashed Malcom Nash of Glamorgan in a county game.
Married to an Aussie
SOBER is married to an Aussie Prue Kirby and has two sons Mathew and Daniel and a daughter Genevieve. SOBERS was knighted by Queen Elizabeth 11 in the New Years honors list when she visited Barbados in 1975.
The great SOBERS played in 93 Tests scoring 8,032 runs and capturing 235 wickets. In the 383 first class matches he played he scored 28,000 runs taking a record 1000 wickets. There are many more records to his credit but lack of space does not permit me to list them all.
I have been to the West Indies covering cricket and watched in awe the many lovely beaches and to hear the happy go lucky calypso singers who do not seem to have a care in the world.
The Trinidad calypso king Mighty Sparrow has coined a song Sir Garfield Sobers which was a big hit. There will never be another SOBERS.

The Sri Lanka Handball Federation was established in 2008 and the game is gradually gaining popularity in the country with the three forces Army, Navy and Air Force taking part regularly in handball matches.
The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme was set up in 1989 to promote sports tours between the two countries and to mark its 30th anniversary these tours have been arranged for early 2019.
Two handball players from Germany Elina Gansweith and Kevin Cordshagen are the co-cordinators of the tours by German handball teams to Sri Lanka and are taking great pains to make the tours a success.

The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has been issuing International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) since 2007. GOSL has maintained an unblemished record on servicing of its debt obligations timely, including ISBs, since independence.
ISBs issued in January and April 2014 in United State Dollar (USD) 1,000 million and 500 million, respectively, are due to mature in January and April 2019 according to a release by the central Bank.
The Government has already made pre-funding arrangements for meeting the maturing ISB obligations in 2019 through proceeds of divestment of non-strategic assets and funding through syndicate arrangements.
While exploring an ideal window to further access international capital markets, GOSL and Central Bank of Sri Lanka have already initiated necessary actions to further diversify international market based foreign funding sources to jurisdictions outside conventional Eurodollar ISB issuances.

Holiday heaven
Following Lonely Planets recent declaration of Sri Lanka as the worlds top destination for 2019, more travel publications and writers are discovering the joys of Sri Lanka. The following article by travel writer Jill MacNabb appeared in a New Zealand publication:
Named Lonely Planet's top country to visit in 2019, Sri Lanka is suddenly the hottest current travel destination in the world.
There's a multitude of flight options from New Zealand - most with only one stop in Australia or elsewhere in Asia - so it's fast becoming very accessible for Kiwis.
With beaches, jungles, ancient cities and a rich history all coupled with friendly, accommodating people and some of the best food you'll eat anywhere on the planet - you should definitely be adding this beautiful country to your bucket list.
Here are some of the key things to enjoy while you're there.
One of the great things about Sri Lanka is that you can chase the summer and good weather around it.
Mid-year is the best in the east, with the surf spot of Arugam Bay being a favourite. It's a long strip of golden sand lined with relaxed hotels, yoga spots and good restaurants.
It's busy but calm, hippy but refined and a great spot to meet other travellers. A short tuk-tuk ride takes you to other quieter surf spots such as Peanut Farm and Whisky Point, and to even more tasty food spots in Pottuvil.
In the south of the country, Unawatuna and Mirissa are renowned surf spots, and the smaller beach of Talalla is touted as one of the most beautiful beaches in Asia. It would be very easy to spend weeks beach-hopping here.
This is a country that takes a long time to navigate by road, so the train network is a lifeline for many locals. It's also very handy for tourists when travelling to certain areas.
The trains are cheap and packed to the rafters - if you're after a fully authentic experience, don't miss a train ride.
The most renowned is the road from Ella to Nuwara Eliya, which passes through a landscape of rolling hills and tea plantations, usually paired with dark clouds threatening to thunder at any moment. Its atmospheric and absolutely stunning.
You can book in advance, but it's just as easy - and much cheaper - to buy a second-class ticket on your day of travel for the equivalent of around $3.
Taking in the sunset in the capital, Colombo, is one of the 'must-dos' when visiting Sri Lanka, however, the locals actually take the train south from Fort station in the city to Mt Lavinia to enjoy it.
It's a packed ride at the end of the day, but the 20-minute trip is well worth it. If you like, you can stop in at the Mt Lavinia hotel (literally on top of the railway station) for a drink on the terrace to take in the beautiful views as the sun sets.
Sri Lanka is fascinating to explore for its variety of religions and cultures. Over two-thirds of the population is Buddhist, with a large proportion of the remainder of Hindus, plus an even split between Muslims and Christians.
Most towns have large Buddha statues and there are stunning temples in all the major cities, including the colourful and trinket-filled Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo.
The most famous of all the religious artefacts in Sri Lanka is one of Buddha's Tooth Relic, housed in a beautiful temple in the royal palace complex of the bustling city of Kandy. Whilst you don't actually see the Tooth Relic (it is far too sacred for that), many religious people travel to Sri Lanka for this one experience.
Sigiriya, often called the 'eighth wonder of the world', is an ancient rock fortress situated in the centre of the country, which served as a Buddhist monastery for centuries. You can climb the rock itself, or summit the close-by Pidurangala (formerly also a Buddhist temple) for unmatched views of Sigiriya and the surrounding valleys.
I'd recommend both climbs in one day: Pidurangala for sunrise and Sigiriya for sunset.
It's not something you might have realised, but Sri Lanka is the best place in the world outside of Africa to go on a safari.
There are multiple National Parks in the country, each with its own unique grouping of animals and landscapes. You can spot elephants, monkeys, water buffalo, a huge variety of birds and even leopards if you're lucky.
Uda Walawe in the south is better for elephant spotting, and Yala in the east is the best place to see leopards. As an extra bonus, Sri Lanka has also become known as the foremost country in the world to see the formerly elusive blue whale in its natural habitat.
Sri Lankan food is slowly becoming more of a staple in other countries, but it's nowhere near as popular as it should be for how yummy it is.
It's most similar to that found in southern India, but each region has its own unique dishes and specialties. The north favours hotter and spicier flavours, while southern delicacies tend to be more subtle and complex.
The country is filled with delicious vegetarian dishes, tons of coconut, and some of the best seafood you can eat anywhere.
Some of my favourite dishes include hoppers, which are paper thin rice pancakes with various meat or vegetable fillings, kottu roti - a chopped flatbread mixed with eggs, meat and spices - and lampreis, which are banana-leaf wrapped mixes of rice, curry, egg and pickles.
Be sure to try them all. It's also a great idea to take a cookery class and learn how to make them for when you get back home and have those flavour cravings.
I highly recommend Sri Lanka as a holiday destination - it is one incredible country.

Indias ranking likely to be improved in  World Bank Ease of Doing Business index
The World Banks latest Ease of Doing Business ranking, expected to be released today evening, might hold good news for India. Having catapulted 30 places in the 2018 edition of the rankings, the buzz is that India is set for an encore.
Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu had hinted at big improvement in Indias ranking in a press conference yesterday. You will be hearing a better news about India improving parameters on ease of doing business. We already have improved substantially. We will make the formal announcement tomorrow with the World Bank [releasing its report], he had announced yesterday.
On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much, during his two-day visit to Japan. I have always kept ease of doing business as my priority. India was at 140th position in the ease of doing business ranking of the World Bank when we took over the responsibility of the government in 2014. Now India has reached 100th position and we are working towards better ranking, said Modi. The government had reportedly set a target of making it to the 90th rank on the list in 2019 and the 30th rank by 2030.
The current government is not alone in its optimism. We have indications that Indias ranking will improve in the Ease of Doing Business index, a person familiar with the matter told The Hindustan Times on Tuesday, without commenting on the likely new rank.
The World Bank index ranks 190 countries on the basis of 10 indicators, namely starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering a property, getting credit, getting electricity, trading across borders, resolving insolvency, enforcing contracts, protecting minority investors and paying taxes.
The optimism of an improved ranking this year too stems from reforms like the Goods and Services Tax, launched last July, as well as initiatives that India has taken in categories such as construction permit, starting a business and trading across borders. In its 2018 report, the World Bank had excluded the impact of GST as it only covered the period from June 2, 2016 to June 1, 2017.
Furthermore, in August, the Parliament had passed a bill to amend the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016, finally treating home buyers as financial creditors, which is also expected to boost Indias latest ranking.
Last year, India had jumped 30 positions to become the top 100th country in the index and the World Bank had said that the country was one of the top 10 improvers in the years assessment, having implemented reforms in 8 out of the 10 indicators. (Business Today)

Jadeja spins India to  series-clinching ODI win
Thiruvananthapuram, Thursday: Ravindra Jadeja starred in India's nine-wicket series clinching win over West Indies after the tourists were skittled out for just 104 in the fifth one-day international on Thursday.
West Indies won the toss and elected to bat in Thiruvananthapuram but collapsed, surviving just 31.5 of their 50 overs under overcast skies to register their lowest ODI total against India.
Jadeja claimed four wickets with his left-arm spin as India romped to their target in 14.5 overs to take the five-match series 3-1.
The second game was a tie.
It is India's sixth successive ODI series win on home soil.
Opener Rohit Sharma, who smashed 63, and skipper Virat Kohli, who made 33, put on an unbeaten 99-run stand as the hosts raced to their target before the sun had set in the day-night game.
"It was a clinical performance. Credit has to go to the bowling unit, pitching the ball in the right place," Kohli said after the win.
"We wanted to bowl first anyway and we got lucky. We were surprised West Indies batted," he added.
Fast bowler Oshane Thomas bowled opener Shikhar Dhawan for six but the wicket proved just a hiccup in India's march towards an easy win.
Jadeja set up the convincing victory after returning figures of 4-34 from his 9.5 overs. Jasprit Bumrah combined with pace spearhead Bhuvneshwar Kumar to get two West Indies batsmen in the first two overs. Bumrah bowled Shai Hope for zero.
Marlon Samuels tried to steady the innings with counter-attacking boundaries but he fell to Jadeja's spin for 24.
Jadeja also trapped big-hitter Shimron Hetmyer lbw for nine to rattle the West Indies middle-order.
Skipper Jason Holder top-scored with 25 to raise hopes of a West Indies fightback but the rest of the batting folded.
Young paceman Khaleel Ahmed also made his presence felt for India, with two key strikes including the wicket of Holder.
Jadeja, who was named man of the match, polished off the West Indies' tail and India did not need the customary break after end of the first innings to get past their target.
Kohli was the man of the series for his 453 runs in five matches including three centuries and a highest score of 157 not out.
The prolific run-getter became the quickest to 10,000 ODI runs in his 205th innings in Visakhapatnam ODI that ended in a tie last week.
"To get runs as captain always gives me confidence. It won't happen all the time, but when I'm going, I want to keep going longer," said Kohli.
"I don't play for awards, just to impact the series and help the team win."
The two sides now head to Kolkata for the first of three Twenty20 internationals on November 4. AFP

Lankan detainee tortured in Maldives: Amnesty
Amnesty International, on Tuesday, condemned the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of a Sri Lankan detained in the Maldives, saying he has been beaten and tortured.
The rights group said the prisoner, who was charged almost three years ago for knowingly taking part in a conspiracy to murder President Abdulla Yameen, had also been denied a fair trial.
Lahiru Madhushanka has suffered vicious police beatings, prolonged solitary confinement and beatings with cables that caused him to temporarily lose hearing in one ear, Amnesty stated in its report.
From the moment he was arrested, to his interrogation, to his imprisonment and his trial, his family and lawyer say he has been subject to a catalogue of serious human rights violations, including torture, that need to be independently investigated, the statement said.
Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnestys South Asia research director, said the case raised alarming questions about the Maldivian justice system and how the authorities treated detainees.
It is also a test for the Sri Lankan government, which has only provided limited consular services and failed to adequately respond to the desperate appeals of Madhushankas family and ensure a fair trial and humane detention conditions for him.
Madhushanka was arrested in October, 2015, on a different charge, with the assassination charge following months later. His remand hearings and interrogations were in Dhivehi, which he does not speak of, and he was not given legal aid.
In July, Amnesty accused prison authorities of breaking the law and expressed concern over his possible loss of eyesight. Authorities were also accused of coercing him into following Islamic practices and barring him from following his Buddhist faith.
Madhushanka was in the Maldives for a job as a driver that fell through, the rights group said.
The job had been arranged by another Sri Lankan, who was in contact with a group close to ex-vice president Ahmed Adeeb who was convicted of plotting to assassinate Yameen.
No human being should be treated in this way, Dissanayake of Madhushanka said, All the more reason why a thorough investigation should promptly be launched by the Maldivian authorities.
She said,The new president of the Maldives, who will be sworn in next month, must ensure that all prisoners are treated humanely and tried in courts where justice is worthy of its name.
The Maldives Independent contacted police and prison authorities for comment on the Amnesty report, but there was no response at the time of going to press.

Lankan IT companies must focus  on AI, data science
AI (Artificial Intelligence) and data science will be a point of focus globally for IT companies and Sri Lanka should also look for opportunities in this segment, said Chairman, SLASSCOM, Jeevan Gnanam.
Globally this segment is growing very fast and it will be close to a trillion dollar industry by the end of next year. The global markets are changing, hence this would be a huge opportunity for us to be relevant and be prevalent in this opportunity, he said.
Gnanam pointed out that if they need to have revenue of USD 2,400 per person, 16,000 people need to join the IT industry. However the local education curriculum does not support new trends in IT. This is the biggest challenge we face, he added.Accounting for the fact that 7,000+ degree holders leave from public and private sector universities, the future needs of the developing world could not be met. Therefore SALSSCOM had initiated programs along with public and private sector universities island wide to provide knowledge on new trends related to IT sector. Data science and AI are more known as a knowledge distribution tactic. Currently SLASSCOM s export industry sums up to USD 1.2 billion and they have a mandate to increment it to USD 1.6 billion. He said that increasing IT exports is the best way out to control the depreciating of the rupee.
The Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) will be organizing the first- ever SLASSCOM AI Asia summit. It will be hosted by The Kingsbury, on November 7 from 8.30 am-5.30 pm.
GIZ, a German Development Cooperation focuses on carrying out bilateral cooperation agreement along with the German and Sri Lankan government. GIZ had been long partnering with SLASSCOM to support their development and innovative schemes. SLASSCOM is a strong rival of the future development of the country which is an essential change, said Randhula De Silva, from GIZ.
She further highlighted that one of the main reason for them to join with SLASSCOM was to bring international experts to Sri Lanka to assist in the local development.
The AI Asia Summit 2018 which is organized by SLASSCOM for the first time will be a great opportunity for Sri Lanka to understand and cooperate AI aspects in their work. The main outcome of this summit would be the National AI policy. The key international speakers include Timothy Kooi, Head of Data Analytics at DHL Asia Pacific, Yasantha Rajakarunanayake, Senior Director Technology, Media Trek, Adam Easton, CEO, SimCentric Technologies, James Shanahan, Founder and Principal, Boutique Data Consultancy, Rukshan Batuwita, Applied Machine Leaning Scientist and Chrisantha Fernando, Senior Research Scientist, Google DeepMind.

Law course based on Harry Potter
Potterheads take note! A law university in Kolkata is offering a new course on Harry Potter which will encourage students to explore legal aspects of J K Rowling's fictional world and its many real life lessons.
The course titled "An interface between Fantasy Fiction Literature and Law: Special focus on Rowling's Potterverse" will be offered as an elective to 4th and 5th year students of the B.A LL.B (Hons) programme at the National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) in Kolkata.
The course, designed for the winter semester by Assistant Professor Shouvik Kumar Guha, attempts to serve as a breather from the orthodox law school curriculum.
"This course is meant to be more of an experiment. It will take both me and the students out of our comfort zones," Guha said.
"In law schools, people get a very specific set of subjects. The curriculum revolves around the hard letter of the law, case laws etc. Given the fact that this course lasts about five years, students also get bored," he said.
Students will learn to apply legal principles in a completely new scenario, and understand how things will work through insights into a wizarding world constantly under government surveillance. Given the many societal, legal and political changes, including the slew of landmark Supreme Court judgements, law students need to learn to adapt and respond to events unfolding around them, Guha said.
"I could have designed the course based on our real political situation but it is not necessary that all my students will share my political leanings," he said.
Guha decided instead to turn to a fictional universe, which would not create political controversies but help students learn to apply their legal knowledge to a completely alien set of scenarios.
According to a statement by NUJS, the Harry Potter series vividly exposes the limitations of laws and institutions.
In Potterverse for example, The Ministry of Magic uses its representatives to torture children for daring to tell the truth, and imprisons or even executes its citizens without the benefit of due process of law.
Its infamous prison Azkaban is designed to drive inmates to despair and suicidal tendencies without any hope of reformation.
In numerous instances, the wealthy control and influence government policy.
Freedom of the press in Potterverse is curtailed, and the major newspaper 'The Daily Prophet' is used to spread propaganda.
The series thus provides a unique platform for students to reflect and compare the legal situations with their own government. The course aims to cover legal traditions and institutions, crimes and punishments, economy, politics, contracts in the Potterverse.
Guha says his assignments to the students would be very creative in nature, and hopes that some of the works can eventually be published.
"I was introduced to Potterverse in my tenth standard. Since then I have read the books multiple times. I am familiar with each and every line of all the seven books. So it will come to me naturally," said Guha, quipping that he probably knows Harry Potter literature better than Company Law.
Classes for the course are due to start this December.
This is not the first time in India that a professor has turned to the magical world of Harry Potter to pique student interest. Rashmi Raman, a former student of NUJS, first started a Potterverse-centric elective law course at the Jindal Global Law School in Sonipat in 2012.

Live life with no regrets
Drug abuse and addiction is a serious problem in our Society with more and more youth coming under its influence. Main reasons for drug addiction are unhappiness, lack of inner strength and poverty, which combined with the availability of drugs, set the horrible trap for the youth and senior citizens of Sri Lanka. The Daily News spoke to some key figures in society as to how we can tackle the problem of drug abuse.
Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Consultant Psychiatrist, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Director, Centre for Combating Tobacco (CCT), Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and Chairman, Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) Sri Lanka, Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya MD (Psychiatry) pointed out that it is not just the brain that is addicted to drugs, it is the person. It is not just a brain disorder, but a bio-psycho-social disorder, like any other mental illness. The biology of brain, the psychology of the person and the social circumstance around the person are important in predisposition for and precipitation and perpetuation of this disorder, again like in any other mental illness.
Withdrawal effects
Drugs dont do much to the brain if taken once. What you then experience is called intoxication. However, there is a significant psychosocial component in intoxication. However, when the drug is used again and again the brain learns to adjust to the drug. Then the brain can tolerate higher doses of the drug. This usually happens with daily drug use, sometimes more than once a day. At this stage, if the drug is withheld, the brain function becomes abnormal since now the brain is used to function normally with the continuous presence of the drug. These are called withdrawal effects. Drug use at this level is what is called addiction or drug dependence. However, even before dependence develops, the drug use is associated with significant negative physical and psychosocial impact, explained Rajasuriya.
Rajasuriya went onto explain that whenever drug availability goes up there are more people using it and level of use going up in current users.
We know for sure that if heroin is not available in an area, we hardly find heroin users there. Whenever government and Police genuinely crack down on drugs, more people present to our clinic asking help to stop drug use. Drug use is commoner in people who are poorer and have had psychosocial adversities, however, it is not yet clear if that is why they use drugs, stated Rajasuriya.
Societys role
Rajasuriya further added that parents, schools and responsible civilians have a huge role to play in the battle against drugs. They need to make children assertive and independent, not obedient, timid, unwise victims to be used by drug suppliers. Teach them the truth about the widely held untrue beliefs-the myths. The vulnerable children are the ones who are timid and cannot resist pressure from others. Those who may appear very strong may also be vulnerable if they are victims of myths. Availability of drugs is another major factor. In some houses alcohol and cigarettes are available at home. There are mini bars at home!
All drug users start off with cigarettes or alcohol or cannabis. Unless we reduce demand and supply for these, we wont be able to reduce other drug use. Children of poor families where mother is in Middle East and children of affluent families both are vulnerable, said Rajasuriya.
Department of Social Service, Social Service Officer Jayantha Premalal, points out that lack of information, lack of spirituality, lack of confidence and poverty spell doom for some youth.
Our younger generation do not have a complete understanding of drugs. When someone introduces this to their lifestyle and they get addicted. Some parents do not have the time to pay attention to their children because of their hectic lifestyles. As a result the children are not guided properly. Some young people do not have common sense and they are not knowledgeable. They do not realize that drugs are highly addictive, said Premalal.
If most of these young people are into drugs, then the power of our labour force is reduced. If young people are mentally and physically disabled then that becomes a huge problem. If they are not healthy enough to be employed that becomes a serious cause for concern.
Self-confidence
Self-confidence is another factor that determines whether if you are strong enough to say NO to drugs. You meet a drug pusher in the playground and he or she asks you to try it out or maybe your peers encourage you to try out some drugs and you do it because you want to fit in. It all depends on how strong you are.
Building up a young persons self-confidence is equally important. If they have self-confidence and are aware of the danger of drugs they can say NO to drugs. They can reject drugs. They understand that drugs are unhealthy, explained Premalal.
We know drug abuse destroys families and households because the financial situation in a home suffers. The harmony and peace within a home is destroyed and shattered. Domestic violence may even take place. If the father takes drugs, the unity and well-being of the family is undermined. If children start to take drugs then again the wellbeing of the family is under threat.
Another deterrent to drugs is leading a virtuous life. If there is spirituality within a household that will protect everyone from the danger of drugs. Then there is less chance of someone in that household using drugs, pointed out Premalal.
Another factor is who young people look up to There are so many celebrities who use drugs. Young people watch them all on television and think to themselves that they would like to be like that celebrity. However if they have proper role models in life then they can reject drugs. If we have positive role models in life then again that acts as a deterrent to drugs. If there are proper examples in society then children can look up to them and lead a moral life.
Drug abuse leads to poverty because once you get addicted to drugs then to satisfy yourself you spend more and more money trying to obtain drugs and before you realize this sad truth you are in the depths of poverty. However, poverty also leads to drug abuse since due to the abysmal state of their lives, drug users look for a release  to cope with the stress of poverty and the unhappiness in their lives.
The main problem with poor people is lack of education - lack of opportunities. This is where the availability of programmes at schools to raise awareness about drugs is so important. There is also the environmental and genetic factors. If the father is in the habit of using drugs then the child is vulnerable. The child may be predisposed to drug addiction. If the environment around someone is also unstable, then that too might lead to the person falling into drug addiction, said Premalal.
Professor Emeritus, University of Peradeniya, Kalinga Tudor Silva presented the case against drugs from a sociological aspect.
The breakdown of the family, emergence of a peer culture supportive of substance abuse, development of drug peddling as a livelihood and as part of organised crime, and lack of social control over some individuals are among the better known factors involved. In addition to these factors, the post-war context may also be responsible in that breakdown of law and order situation. Use of drugs as a profit making activity by certain groups of fighters as well as members of armed forces is evident in narco-terrorism widely reported in Latin American countries and the social breakdown associated with war-related population movements and the like, stated Silva.
Silva pointed out that drug abuse has multiple impacts including disruption of family life, disruption of education and livelihoods, promotion of related misconduct such as sex work and involvement in crime in order to sustain substance abuse. Implication of law enforcement persons in drug related offences is another social impact of this issue.
Some studies indicate that youth from urban and semi urban backgrounds are particularly vulnerable when it comes to gang activities, availability of drugs and connections with organised crime. There were a few instances where social media has been used to attract youth to parties where drugs are used on a collective basis to get high and this is perhaps a new trend triggered by heavy infiltration of social media into youth culture in Sri Lanka, added Professor Silva.
Narcotics Bureau
DIG of Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) Sajeewa Medawatte, commented that the PNB is the premier drug enforcement agency in Sri Lanka. The PNB has a concept called PDPIR concept  Prevention, Detection, Prosecution, Investigation and Rehabilitation.
There are very capable officers attached to the Narcotics Bureau and we share information with all local law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies. We have links with the organised crime division and STF (Special Task Force). PNB, STF and Organized Crime Division are all working together. We have direct contact with United Nations On Drugs And Crime (UNODC) and National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) and foreign law enforcement agencies with which we have direct links. So we are conducting raids and collecting information and we are dealing with the prison system. We are all putting systems in place because the drug dealers and drug traffickers are also changing their way of doing things, said DIG Medawatte.
DIG opined that Drug users should be sent to the rehabilitation centres.
But in Sri Lanka unfortunately Drug Users are being sent to prison. Prisons being over crowded is a big issue. But what should be happening is that the abusers should be sent to rehabilitation centres and drug traffickers and dealers should be sent to prison. So the Law and Order Ministry is looking to change some laws.
We should separate the drug traffickers and the abusers. For drug abuse the punishments are very high in Sri Lanka. So first we need to identify what the drugs are. In Sri Lanka there are so many synthetic drugs. Mainly for Cocaine, Heroin and Cannabis, the punishments are very high. When it comes to drugs the demand and supply is very important. Our task is to reduce the supply. But so many agencies are looking to reduce the demand, especially the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board, (NDDCB.) But our task as PNB, is to reduce the supply. Drugs come from illegal sea routes and through the harbour and sometimes through the airport, explained DIG Medawatte.
Medawatte pointed out that the PNB has contact with the SAARC countries  the SAARC DRUG OFFENCES MONITORING DESK. They share information with all the SAARC countries.
From the Golden Triangle - Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar  we get Heroin, Cocaine, Hashish. We are getting most of the Heroin from Afghanistan through Pakistan. We need direct contact with all the other law enforcement agencies. We can implement our laws in our water areas only. If we want to exceed that we need to keep contact with the other international agencies  INTERPOL and DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). On information we do the raids, explained DIG Medawatte.
Medawatte pointed out that a mega project has now been launched with the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Law and Order. In high schools  government and private, they are starting a committee against drugs. More than 6,000 committees have already been established in the schools consisting of prefects, teachers, principals and old boys. There is a monitoring committee as well. That is handled by the OIC  Officer in Charge of that area. There is also a monk or priest. They are monitoring the system. Through that the drug situation will be controlled.
The police in Sri Lanka is working with the public and this system has proved to be the most effective anywhere in the world. Here information is smoothly transferred. Earlier PNB, STF and Organized Crime Division worked separately. But now we are working together. A combined effort, said DIG Medawatte.

Maha Sangha calls on former PM to leave Temple Trees - Thera
President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed a new Prime Minister in accordance with provisions of the Constitution. Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes refusal to vacate Temple Trees has led to an anarchic situation in the country, especially due to international pressure.
The Maha Sangha requests former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to bow out and leave Temple Trees immediately and help to safeguard democracy in the country, said Ven. Narandeniye Dhammavasa Nayake Thera, Deputy Chief Sanghanayake Thera of Dakshina Lanka of the Rohana Maha Sangha Sabha.
Ven. Dhammavasa Thera said President Sirisena had appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister in the interests of the countrys future. As such, the Maha Sangha expected Ranil Wickremesinghe to act as a gentlemanly politician.
He said President Sirisenas speech proved the amount of harm done to the country by the former Prime Minister. So it would be in the best interests of the country for the former Prime Minister to bow out gracefully. A vast majority of the people have the confidence that former President Rajapaksa has the ability to rescue the country and rebuild it. The fervent belief of the Maha Sangha is that as the leader who saved the nation from terrorism, Mahinda Rajapaksa had the necessary strength and ability to strengthen the economy and steer the country forward.

Maithri-Mahinda link will benefit country - Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera
The UNP leadership was insensitive to the problems of the country and its people and the Maithri-Mahinda link is expected to be beneficial to the country, the Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said. The decision taken by UNP Parliamentarians Vasantha Senanayake and Ananda Aluthgamage to join the government ranks is a commendable decision.
The Mahanayake Thera expressed these sentiments when Tourism and wildlife Minister Vasantha Senanayake and Deputy Minister Ananda Aluthgamage called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings.
Earlier, the Minister and the Deputy Minister visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and paid homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic before calling on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates and receiving their blessings.
The Asgiriya Prelate further said in his Anusasana that politicians should take decisions with the countrys best interests foremost in their minds. Asgiriya Chapter Lekakhadhikari Ven. Medegama Dhammananda Thera said the Senanayake generation had always rendered epochal service to the people without communal or religious bias. One should always act in a manner that will not blemish his or her character.
Member of the Asgiriya Chapter Karake Sangha Sabha and Trustee Muthiyangama Raja Maha Viharaya Ven. Muruddeniye Dhammaratana Thera in his Anusasana highlighted the need to develop the old Bogambara prison in a manner that would safeguard Kandyan culture.
Minister Vasantha Senanayake said earlier his hands were tied as the UNP leadership did not allow him to render a commendable service. He was confident that the Maithree-Mahinda combination would be beneficial to the country.
He said he rendered some valuable service when he was Wildlife Minister in the 100 day government.
Perhaps that would have been the cause which denied a ministry post subsequently. Although several people succeeded him as wild life Minister they had failed to render any worthwhile service.
Deputy Minister Ananda Aluthgamage said the President and the Former Prime Minister had not held a joint Parliamentary group meeting for two years.
Ranil always acted on his own without any respect to the Presidents wishes. Aluthgamage said Ranil always took decisions with a coterie of his friends who were not peoples representatives.
Earlier the Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter in his Anusasana said no solution had been found so far to the Elephant-Human conflict. This has taken a toll on both human and animal lives.

Nations Trust Bank records resilient performance
Nations Trust Bank closed the nine months ending September 30, 2018 with a post-tax profit of Rs.2, 918 million with standing multiple challenges as witnessed across the industry with increasing non-performing loans, tightening of liquidity and moderating credit growth which particularly hindered the performance for the quarter.
The Bank realigned its resources in a timely manner during the quarter with absolute focus on managing impairment provisions and bottom line growth whilst consolidating growth in selective portfolios.
Net interest income increased by 31% mainly attributable to growth in volumes (Up by 26%) as NIMs stabilized and remained on par with the previous period. Interest income recorded a faster growth of 24% resulting from the increased growth in loan volumes and effective pricing of the loan book. Interest expense growth was lower at 19% due to the higher drop in cost of funds in comparison to the previous period. Nevertheless, the Bank noted a gradual rise in its cost of funds with the increasing interest rate environment which prevailed during the third quarter of 2018.
Non fund based income recorded a moderate growth of 16% with trade finance, syndication based facility fees and bancassurance fees contributing to a larger portion of the increase. Net trading losses dropped significantly during the period under review as customer and trading FX reported a higher growth rate coupled with the drop in the SWAP book and the resultant forward premiums.
Impairment charges for the current year increased as some portfolios of the loan book experienced cash flow stresses, which were also seen at an industry level. Bank NPL ratio stood at 3.71% from 2.29% reported in December 2017, mirroring industry trends.
Expenses recorded a growth of 19% which is partly due to investments made in technology, branding and people related skills development and employment engagement activities. Bank expenses pertaining directly to business volume growth were well managed at 10%. Notable increases are also seen in regulatory expenses.
On the digital front, the Bank has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve efficiencies thereby re-engineering the opex model with the digitalizing of branch processes, automation of operational processes through Robotic process automations and enhancing the digital footprint across the Bank; all of which have made a considerable impact in generating operational efficiencies.
Renuka Fernando, CEO/Executive Director said, Managing impairment has been a key area of focus for us during the past few months whereby we have reorganized our collection shops and hope to keep a close watch in the upcoming months and will continue to focus until the stress on selective portfolios stabilise.
Our digital transformation journey and investments in business transformational technology will continue to be pivotal strategic focus areas for us in the ensuing months. With the operating environment going through a turbulent phase, we remain focused in achieving our goals set for the year.

Nocturnal Wonderland
Juliet Coombe takes a walk on the wild side as the day gives way to night at Jetwing Lake, where a fantastic night safari has been developed, and she learns firsthand how the raptors cede their thrones to the night hunters the owls and the fruit bats come out to feed on the seasonal fruit.
The inter monsoon is a magical time to visit Jetwing Lake and enjoy the sunny tropical mornings and exciting inter monsoon rains, that create a spectacular series of giant waterfalls cascading off every roof top, cooling the day off, while also refilling the lake turning it into a wildlife hotspot at night. It is amazing just how many animals live off this incredible tank of water, in an area known as Rajarata the Kings country. I knew from talking to the naturalist we were in for a royal wildlife treat from all the exciting sounds of the night creatures. The cooling of the air encourages even the shy fishing cat, which the local villagers call the night fishermen of the lake, because they only come after dark to catch fish before vanishing back into the bushes with a swish of their tails. As dusk falls and the stars come out the night orchestra commences with the noisy frogs croaking serenades, puffing out their sacs to the fullest to find a mate, mixed up with Cicadas singing and Grey Slender Lories calling from the dry  green ever mixed forests around the hotel.
After having a short explanation by the naturalist about how to behave on the night wildlife walk, and most importantly how to use the torches with red filters only, and to avoid turning the white light on as it will frighten the animals away. One little person testing their torch settings out on the lawn looked so scary and ghost like that it nearly scared me into not heading out into the great unknown. However an evening with naturalist Nayanapriya Vijaya Bandara is not to be missed. Armed with a refillable water bottle, torch, cameras and notebook in hand we headed off across the lawn, where on some days you will see black nape hares the size of rabbits running high speed across it. At first we looked for eyes in the bushes and trees and tried to follow the sounds of the frogs gribbiting, which proved very successful as we came across several of the six varieties that live on the edge of the lake. Watched by the silhouette of several birds of prey overhead our red lights picked out one of the Collared Scops Owl (Otus lettia) in the hole of a tree, only to discover on closer inspection it was a rather twisted branch that had broken off at a strange angle.
Behind one bush we found a huge Termite mound made from three hundred thousand to one million termites and I learn that they live underground as a colony and create termite hills like the bees do when they create a hive. This interesting red muddy mountain range has open holes to the sky and like a chimney works as a cooling air ventilation system keeping the busy worker termites cool. The colony like the bees is run by a queen who is surrounded by huge numbers of worker termites, who are the producers of the red mud mounds, which we see above ground, and that the local villagers use to build their houses and stoves from as it is so strong and resilient. In the breeding season the queen termite flies out after the rains with the males following closely behind in a swarm, and this is good food for many of the hundreds of bird species in the area like the Swallows and Brahminy Kites that love to snack off them. Snakes and lizards make the cool termite mounds their homes during the heat of the day, only coming out at night to feed on rodents and insects. Lots of snakes have been seen on the walks including the cobra, but we do not sadly see a sneaky snake on our sojourn just lots of hanging branches that look like them in the darkness. I however do spot a common lizard, monitor and some fascinating stick insects.
The birding trail around the lake also includes seeing the national bird the jungle fowl pecking away at the ground, egrets sleeping on the lake branches of the trees, cormorants, herons, bitterns, brown fish owl and hawk eagles. The night safari depending on the weather usually goes around the lake first, where you can see six species of frogs including Hylarana gracilis frog and small tree frog. -Pseudophilautus populariswith the voice sack that makes the shrilling night call to attract females. Some evenings you will see owls like the Brown Fish Owl and Indian Scope Owl. The naturalist guide Bandara has yet to see an elusive grey Slender Lories even though he hears their calls most evenings. The security guards however have seen these clown like monkey creatures and have lots of fun stories about them and the local snakes. Only the night before Bandara found a cat snake by the SPA building, which is an exciting way to end any night safari.
Farmers who need the water for their buffalos and household chores often see cobras around the lake at night coming to eat frogs and insects while they are tending their herds. If an animal has a problem the village community will take care of it before releasing it back into the wild like a giant squirrel, which is currently being looked after. Bandara explains as a lizard scuttles overhead that there are three types of lizards in the area and the green common garden one most usually seen during the night walk. Some groups are lucky enough to come across Mouse-deer (Moschiola meminna) and Panglins with their scales up, which is really exciting. The lake has local carps and small little fish, which are very tasty for the night scavengers. They also look for rodents from the paddy fields and this makes it a great hunting ground for the night owls. Other tours have seen the palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and even a bat.
For me the highlight of the tour which takes just over an hour in a figure of eight from the lake to the back of house buildings, ending in the car park by reception where you can see the Brown-headed Barbet bird (Psilopogon zeylanicus) in the hollow of a Damunu tree (Grewia damine), which produces a small round berry. In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as "Polos Kottoruwa". It nests in a suitable hole in a tree that it will often excavate out to lay the eggs. Both male and female will take it in turns to incubate the eggs and they often communicate with each other using their Kuk-ra, kukra calls. I was lucky enough to see by torchlight a baby Barbet looking out of the hole with its mouth wide open waiting for its mum to return with wriggling worms or even a tasty lake fish.
Besides seeing the nesting birds feeding their young by the moonlight, it is also fascinating to watch the peacocks strutting their stuff up a tree at night time, the very same tree branches that the lake Pelicans occupy the following morning. Another wonderful birding experience, which you can enjoy while eating your breakfast in the open air restaurant overlooking the lake, and just think as you tuck into your toast and coffee, who or what is watching you in return.

This new route will be serviced by Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft which has been designed to offer exceptional performance, flexibility and efficiency. Configured with 162 seats in a two-class configuration: 12 in business and 150 in economy with significant enhancements across both cabins, the MAX aircraft is an example of Oman Airs commitment to continually upgrading its products and services to deliver guests satisfaction.

One black box recovered from crashed Indonesian jet
INDONESIA: One black box from the crashed Lion Air jet has been recovered, the head of Indonesias National Transportation Safety Committee said Thursday, which could be critical to establishing why the brand new plane fell out of the sky.
The devices record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations and could hold vital clues to the cause of the deadly accident.
We found one of the black boxes, Soerjanto Tjahjono told AFP, adding that it was not clear whether it was the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder.
The Boeing-737 MAX 8, which went into service just a few months ago, plunged into the Java Sea off Indonesias northern coast on Monday, killing 189 people, just 12 minutes after taking off from the capital Jakarta for Pangkal Pinang city.
The single-aisle Boeing plane is one of the worlds newest and most advanced commercial passenger jets.
Data from the plane -- the engine, all the instruments -- are recorded there, said aviation analyst Dudi Sudibyo told AFP. If there is an anomaly, some technical problem, it is recorded there too. Images from the crash site showed two divers swim to a support vessel and place an orange-coloured device into a plastic tub, which was then carried onto the boat.
Despite the name, the two black boxes are in fact bright orange with reflective stripes, and all commercial planes are obliged to have them on board.
Authorities picked up the boxs signals below the waters surface on Wednesday, but were unable to get to the device immediately because of rough seas and strong currents.
The treasure trove of information black boxes provide helps explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts. They each weigh seven to 10 kilograms (15 to 22 pounds) and can survive as deep as 6,000 metres (almost 20,000 feet) underwater or an hour at 1,100 degrees Celsius (2,012 degrees Fahrenheit). To make them easier to find, they are fitted with a beacon which can emit a signal for one month. Dozens of divers are taking part in the massive recovery effort along with helicopters and ships, but authorities have all but ruled out finding any survivors.
On a Jakarta dockside, grief-stricken relatives sifted through clothes, wallets and other retrieved personal effects, as authorities sent body parts to hospital for DNA testing.
Forensic experts identified Jannatun Cintya Dewi as the first victim of the crash Wednesday evening.
The 24-year-olds coffin arrived in her East Java hometown Sidoarjo Thursday, draped in a green and yellow cloth and inscribed with Arabic writing and carried through the neighbourhood by pallbearers.
Dewis mother collapsed and had to be carried into their home, while friends and relatives wiped away tears as the casket was laid in a freshly dug grave sprinkled with flowers, a bowl of fruit and two palm branches at one end. Aviation experts say it is too early to determine what caused the accident.
But Lions admission that the aircraft had an unspecified technical issue on a previous flight -- as well as the planes abrupt nosedive -- have raised questions about whether it had any faults specific to the newly released model, including a speed-and-altitude system malfunction.
The accident has also resurrected concerns about Indonesias patchy air safety record which until recently saw the countrys carriers facing years-long bans from entering European Union and US airspace over their safety records.
Lion Air has been plagued by safety woes and customer complaints over unreliable scheduling and poor service.

## Title: Prelude to 1956 General Election

Prelude to 1956 General Election
The infamous speech by a junior minister in the UNP government that vernacular teachers can afford to live with a lower salary as they did not eat cheese or ham-bacon like refined, extraordinary teachers in the English medium, cost them heavily with Sinhala educated middle class voting en masse for Bandaranaike, while Tamil teachers voted for Federal party. The schools then had been categorized language-wise as Sinhala and English. Teachers in English schools were placed on a higher scale compared to the rest, compelling the aggrieved to agitate for parity.
Language policy was keenly committed on the stage. For the first time in countrys history communal feelings among the different communities was deliberately instigated by Sinhalese politicians for gaining political advantage. The move was spear-headed by the SWRD Bandaranaike led SLFP campaign in 1956. The consequences of this campaign contributed to the flare-up, decades later to a civil war.
UNPs response to salary anomaly of Sinhala teachers
The UNP government of John Kotelawala in 1956 had been fast losing strength. Poor economic performance, neglect of rural masses, Kotelawalas elitist style of governance contributing to it. The general mood back in 1956, had fashioned a proper atmosphere for taking strong actions against religious and social injustices to village folk. A neglected lot who expected a change in society were a number of intelligentsia such as non-English speaking teachers, Ayurvedic practitioners, peasants and Bhikkus who were brought up under conventional local culture.
The people had been eagerly waiting to grab an opportunity for social transformations and restructuring. Almost all top posts of the plantation industry were packed with well-paid Europeans. A minority of English educated affluent Sinhalese and Tamils descending from high-class families in Colombo and Jaffna were absorbed in to positions of the public sector, which was considered a matter of pride. The living standards of the people was far below the satisfactory level. Withdrawal of rice subsidiary in 1953, which the ordinary masses considered their birth right, poor health conditions, inadequate housing, messy education, unemployment made the situation worse. In his report to the UNP annual sessions, Sir Ukwatte Jayasundera, the party secretary stated, Everything is ready to face the election, we have adequate resources, and the backing of the bureaucracy, with the men, machinery and necessary spirit. He said, Sir John, is an undisputed leader, terror of the idler. The Matara Local Government polls and the Buttala and Aluthnuwara by-election victories gave them confidence. This prompted Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala to dissolve the Parliament an year ahead of scheduled date early in February 1956.
Bandaranaikes new party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party championed a popular socialist platform, promised to make Sinhala the official language. The UNP who hitherto defended the rights of Tamil speaking minority, mader the biggest blunder by changing its stance in early 1956 to fall in line with SLFP. Bandaranaike responded with a smart slogan; Sinhala only in 24 hours. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party campaigned for parity of status between Sinhala and Tamil, with both to jointly replacing English as the official language.
The Tamil parties supported the Marxist in claiming parity of status or to keep English as the official language. Bandaranaike was passionate in forming an alliance with the Bhasha Peramuna of W. Dahanayake and several independent groups like IMRA Iriyagolla, T. B. Subasinghe who came forward to extend their support. SLFP entered into a coalition with a group of small parties that included Philip Gunawardens VLSSP forming the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) on February 21, 1956 under the leadership of SWRD Bandaranaike, the defected former UNP second-in- command.
Addressing a rally on the eve of election, PM Kotelawala said, the UNP is the only party that can implement Sinhalese only but in implementing this programme still ensure justice and fairplay for all communities, as it has built up traditions of tolerance and fairplay. The MEP on the other hand, has within its ranks fanatical and dangerous ultra-nationalists who will plunge this happy country of ours into a communal strife and discord.
New language policy
Bandaranaike having realized that it was impossible to defeat UNP without the support of left parties took the initiative to open negotiations with major opposition groups to reach a consensus on a no-contest pact. Tamil MPs and Cabinet Ministers demanded Sir John to review its new language policy to no avail, since it was suicidal to the UNP at the impending General Election. They did not falter to accuse Sir John Kotelawalas UNP government with linguistic bias and tendered their resignations. Under Sir Johns premiership 1952--1956, the space between the UNP and the ordinary people widened. He failed to evaluate the emergence of economic, language and cultural revival movement.
At one point Sir John declared that he would continue to be the Prime Minister even if he won only 10 seats in the parliament. The opposition did not hesitate to point out that Sir John had already admitted his defeat and accused him of planning a fascist coup.
In the North and parts of East the campaign was centred on the Federal Party [established in 1949 by S. J. V. Chelvanayagam as a breakaway group of Tamil Congress-TC] and TC led by G. G. Ponnambalam. The reason for this division was GGs decision to enter D. S. Senanayakas Cabinet. In 1952 only two Federal party members entered Parliament, but the Tamil Congress secured four seats out of seven. However, by 1956 the FP became more popular and it emerged as the most powerful Tamil Party. The Federal Party used this opportunity to convince Tamils on the harmful effects of Sinhala Only official language.
There were many differences in political interests between Muslims and Tamils. Muslims at the time considered that Tamils enjoyed more privileges in the educational sphere than the Muslims. M. A. Abdul Majid the independent candidate for Kalmunai declared his support to Bandaranaikes party and he openly condemned Federalism. A. H. Macan Marker, an independent contestant for Kalkudah opposed the Federal Party. However, the Muslim factor was not so dominant during the election time of 1956. The majority of Muslims was in favour of the Sinhala Only Policy.
The majority of the daily papers were sympathetic to the UNP except one Sinhala daily.
The Eksath Bhikku Peramuna led by dynamic Buddhist monks, Ven. Yakkaduwe Pragnarama Thera, Ven. Walpola Rahula Thera, Ven. Baddegama Wimalawansa Thera, Ven. Henpitigedera Gnanasiha Thera of Ratnapura and Buddharakkitha of Kelaniya were the leaders of the Bhikku Peramuna. They presented an action programme shortly before the election to Bandaranaike advocating:
Implement the Buddhist Commission Report; promote the revival of our arts and craft; take steps to make Sinhala the official language of the country; bring about a fair distribution of wealth; promote Ayurveda and all other aspects of our national heritage and the return to a simpler way of life and refuse government assistance to all institutions that promote communal disharmony or which destroy peace and equality among the people.
The MEP had a setback when two members of Parliament, Bernard Aluvihare, grandfather of present two UNP junior ministers, and a former Secretary of the party and H.B. Tenne left the party shortly before the handing over of nominations for the 1956 elections to contest on the UNP ticket and lost the seat. In fact Matale was the first result to be announced.

Sampath Banks Wewata Jeewayak  program gives life to dilapidated tanks
Sampath Bank recently handed over the renovated Ambagaha Wewa in Anuradhapura Districts Kahatagasdigiliya and Dhanyawa Wewain Polonnaruwa Districts Divulankadawala, Medirigiriya to members of the local communities.
Thusitha Nakandala, Deputy General Manager Branch Banking, Sampath Bank PLC presided over the ceremonial handing over of the tanks on October 30, along with government officials, members of the local farmers associations, other representatives from Sampath Bank and members of the respective villages.
The renovated Ambagaha Wewa and the Dhanyawa Wewa will serve as a rich source of water for the over 170 farming families cultivating paddy on about 152 acres of land across the two districts where the farming is largely dependent on functioning irrigation systems.
Spearheading such a comprehensive sustainable development project, Sampath Bankhad adopted a tripartite approach in association with the Irrigation Engineers Office of Minneriya, the Department of Agrarian Development of Anuradhapura and the members of the communityto renovate the two tanks under the Wewata Jeewayak initiative, its flagship CSR program.
Commenting on the initiative, Lalith Weragoda, Assistant General Manager Human Resources, Sampath Bank PLC, said, Proper and functioning irrigation systems remain the backbone of sustainable agricultural development in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. Historically, Sri Lanka was well known for its sophisticated irrigation systems and technical know-how. Hailing from that proud tradition, farmers in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa can still rely on the tank systems to source water all year around to cultivate paddy.
Following the official handing over of the renovated tanks, the two local Farmers Associations Sakvithi Farmers Association, Ambagaha Wewa and Divulkadawala Bedumela Farmers Association will assume the responsibility of maintaining and preserving the tanks under the guidance of Sampath Bank, the Department of Agrarian Development, Anuradhapura and the Irrigation Engineers Office, Minneriya. Having undertaken several similar projects in the past under the WewataJeewayak initiative, Sampath Bank will be monitoring the progress of these two projects while continuing to support many more in the years to come.
Sampath Bank seeks to provide a viable solution to the catastrophic water shortage that the countrys dry zone has been experiencing through the Wewata Jeewayak programme by restoring damages to tanks caused by improper maintenance. Providing farmers in the area with access to a year-round supply of water to cultivate paddy during both the Yala and Maha seasons, the Bank hopes to minimize the hardships theyface due to insufficient harvests.
Contributing to economic stability of the communities, the Wewata Jeewayak programme helps safeguard the livelihood of agrarian entrepreneurs and their future generations by supporting the rise of more advanced and economically viableagro-based industries. It also plays a significant role in protecting the neighbouring eco-systems, preserving their bio-diversity and delivering longstanding benefits.

Samsung Electronics posts record quarterly earnings in Q3 on solid chip demand
SEOUL - Samsung Electronics, South Koreas tech giant, posted its record-quarterly-high earnings in the third quarter thanks mainly to solid demand for memory chips, the company said.
Samsungs operating profit reached a new high of 17.6 trillion won ($15.4 billion) in the July-September quarter, up 20.9 percent from a year earlier.
It surpassed the previous high of 15.6 trillion won tallied in the first quarter of this year.
Revenue gained 5.5 percent over the year to 65.5 trillion won in the quarter. It was slightly lower than the record high of 66 trillion won logged in the fourth quarter of last year.
The ratio of operating profit to revenue, which gauges profitability, was 26.8 percent in the September quarter.
The high profitability was attributed to brisk sales of memory chips. Samsungs chipmaking unit posted 13.7 trillion won of operating profit on revenue of 24.8 trillion won.
Both the operating profit and the revenue of the chipmaking division were the highest readings in Samsungs history. The divisions ratio of operating profit to revenue surged to 55.1 percent in the quarter.
Despite the strong chip sales, concerns remained about the excessive dependence on the chipmaking business in making profit. The chip divisions operating profit accounted for 77.7 percent of the total in the third quarter. Global prices for memory chips turned downward recently, casting a shadow on Samsungs fourth-quarter earnings.
Samsung also forecast its fourth-quarter earnings would decline on a quarterly basis on the slowdown in the global chip industry.
Uncertainties lingered over trade conflict among major economies, which could weaken global trade and negatively affect the exporters of South Korea, including Samsung.

Hotel mix-up leaves SLC in quandary
Second cricket Test to go ahead  at Pallekele
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) are unlikely to move the second cricket Test between Sri Lanka and England from Pallekele despite a hotel mix-up that has left them looking for an alternate hotel to accommodate the two teams.
SLC had booked 78 of the 104 rooms available at the Earls Regency Hotel which is a short distance away from the Pallekele International Stadium for both teams and support staff for the second Test match that commences on November 14. However the hotel have since taken bookings from a large number of UK-based tour groups and are now unable to honour the original booking.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva told the Daily News: We do have a problem issue there with the rooms but we are in the process of sorting it out. We should know by today (Thursday). There wont be any change to the venue of the Test.
We are negotiating with the hotel to have the rooms released to us failing which we have to look at some alternate arrangement in Kandy itself, said De Silva.
Speaking further De Silva said, I think there has been some miscommunication. They claim that they didnt receive the letter which was sent by Sri Lanka Cricket but we have sent a purchase order and they have shown us the rooms. We did a complete check in April. People from England also went there and they inspected and selected the rooms and all that.
Asked why the hotel did not honour the booking De Silva stated: That is what we expect but they have a problem right now. The travel agents are also putting a lot of pressure on them because they also have made the bookings. So there is a double booking. We are trying to sort it out without trying to find fault with each other, failing which we might have to look at some alternate arrangement.
De Silva said that there are a few hotels around that SLC were looking at alternatively.
Lets see whether we can resolve it today (Thursday). We are looking at another hotel today we hope that it will be okay. Then we will go ahead with it.
Attempts to contact a representative from the hotel or Aitken Spence Hotels proved futile.

Sharp rally in Bourse
In a growing sign of market and investor confidence in the latest political developments, the Stock Market rose sharply by 2.70 percent and crossed the 6,000 bar yesterday.
The Bourse has shown an upward momentum in the last few days, indicating a positive reaction by investors to changes in the political landscape. The All Share Price Index (ASPI) closed yesterday at 6,114.13 showing a 2.70 percent increase. S&P SL20 liquid stocks ended a sharp 4.66 percent higher, up 143.58 points to 3,227.66. The Market turnover was Rs. 1.5 billion. This was considerably more than the daily average of Rs.789 million this year.
Reflecting the positive sentiments, the bourse ended in green mainly due to the contributions by big cap JKH and DIST, recording a near two months high and the highest intraday surge since June 2012. ASPI witnessed a continuous upward trend during the day reaching an intraday high of 6,123 prior to close the day at 6,114, gaining 161 points.
Both turnover and volumes have increased while nearly 29 percent of turnover was derived from HNB. A net foreign outflow was witnessed with moderate foreign participation but this was offset by heightened activity by local investors.
Many Stock Market analysts said the Bourses performance indicated that investors were confident of seeing political stability with the formation of a single-party Government. Many analysts and investors were also taking note of the new Finance Ministers first speech at the Finance Ministry where he outlined the new Governments economic vision. Yesterday, the Colombo Stock Exchange was also buoyed by indications that Parliament could be reconvened earlier than expected. Analysts expect even bigger gains next week.

SLC Chief Financial Officer remanded till Nov. 15
The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Sri Lanka Cricket Piyal Nandana Dissanayake, who was arrested for the alleged financial fraud, has been remanded until November 15, by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
Piyal Nandana was arrested on October 22, following a complaint lodged by the SLC to the Inspector General of Police.
The arrest of the Sri Lanka Cricket CFO is related to an alleged financial fraud, which was unearthed last September.
He had managed to successfully thwart the fraudulent attempt to transfer US$. 5.5 million of the SLCs Media Rights sponsorship funds, which was due from an international Media Network, to an offshore account.
The SLC had cited CFO Nandana as the prime suspect who had claimed that his e-mail account had been hacked and requested for the transfer of the money to an off shore account. He was sent on compulsory leave.
The money was one of the three tranches coming from the Sony Picture Networks for broadcast rights of the England tour.
The Magistrate fixed the next hearing for November 15.

Sony eyes record profit as  gaming hits boost earnings
The Japanese electronics firm raised its annual profit forecast to 870bn yen ($7.7bn; 6.0bn), up 30% from estimates given in July.
The upgrade comes after strong sales in its Playstation division drove revenues in the second quarter.
Gaming also spurred a strong rise in operating profit at rival Nintendo.
IDC gaming analyst Sam Reynolds said both Japanese firms had posted impressive earnings based on the strength of the gaming market.
He said Sony could credit strong sales to the quality of games on the platform which include bestsellers God of War and Spider-Man, while demand for Red Dead Redemption II has also been high.
Mr Reynolds said the gaming market was less competitive than Sonys home entertainment businesses, an industry that had faced substantial pricing pressure over the last decade and aggressive competition from South Korean and Chinese rivals.
Along with gaming, Sonys movie unit and music business also supported profits during the second quarter and helped offset challenges in its mobile division.
Operating income for the period was 239.5bn yen, the firm said in a statement. (chinadaily.com)
