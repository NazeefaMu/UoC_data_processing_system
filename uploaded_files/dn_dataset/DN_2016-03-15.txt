Bangladesh humble Oman, enter World T20 Super 10s

Tamin Iqbal hit the first century of the World Twenty20 as Bangladesh beat Oman by 54 runs to secure the final place in the Super 10s. Tamim made an unbeaten 103 off 63 balls - his maiden T20 hundred - and Sabbir Rahman a rapid 44 in a total of 180-2.
Oman, whose target was revised first to 152 in 16 overs then 120 in 12 after rain in Dharamsala, laboured to 65-9.
As winners of Group A, Bangladesh join India, Australia, South Africa and Pakistans group in the next phase.
Tournament newcomers Oman, who beat Ireland in their opening game, can take considerable credit for finishing second in a group containing three teams above them in the T20 rankings.
Earlier, Ireland finished bottom of Group B after losing to the Netherlands by 12 runs in a match reduced to six overs per side by rain.
Four of the six games played in Dharamsala were affected by the weather. BBC

Big step forward

As is the pattern with 'The Divergent' movie franchises based on popular young adult novels, the final book is being split into two separate films. As is also usually the case, the films have been arriving one per year, but the last chapter, Ascendant, slated for a 2017 release, recently suffered a setback, losing its director. That situation has now been rectified, however, as The Age of Adaline's Lee Toland Krieger has been earmarked for the job.
Given the timeline, Summit Entertainment needed to move quickly after Robert Schwentke decided not to re-up for The Divergent Series: Ascendant, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, that's just what the studio did. The trade reports that Lee Toland Krieger is in talks to helm the final film in the profitable young adult franchise.
Lee Toland Krieger may only be 33-years-old, but he already has a lengthy list of projects to his credit. He wrote and directed the Indie drama December Ends in 2006, but it was really the comedic drama The Vicious Kind, which starred Adam Scott and J.K. Simmons, that put him on peoples' radars. That film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival that year and even earned Krieger an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best screenplay. He followed that up with the well received Celeste & Jesse Forever, which starred writer Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg, and the era-spanning The Age of Adaline last year. That was his biggest project to date, but The Divergent Series: Ascendant marks an even greater step up in scope and scale. It will be interesting to see what he makes of this opportunity.
Robert Schwentke decided to depart from The Divergent Series after directing the second chapter, Insurgent, and the upcoming Allegiant. Though those films, as well as the first, have been reasonably successful at the box office, Schwentke stepped away because, after doing two films in the saga back-to-back, he needed a break and wanted to spend more time in Los Angeles, with his family, rather than journey back to Atlanta for another go round.
Set in a dystopian near future, The Divergent Series stars Shailene Woodley as Beatrice "Tris" Prior, a young woman who takes on an over-simplified system of government that sorts citizens into a series of Factions based on their dominant personality trait. Allegiant is poised to rip this world open in a big way. Up to now, the vast majority of the action has taken place in a walled-in Chicago, but the action from this point onward exposes a whole lot more on the outside that Tris and her friends will have to deal with.

New Zealand stun India
New Zealands spinners became unlikely heroes on Tuesday, leading their side to a stunning 47-run victory over favourites India in the World Twenty20 opening group match in Nagpur.
The Kiwis stumbled to 126 for seven after electing to bat first, but their slow bowlers bamboozled India who could manage just 79 runs in 18.1 overs -- their lowest ever score in T20 cricket on home soil.
Their previous lowest score at home was 92 against South Africa in Cuttack last year.
The spin trio of Mitchell Santner, Nathan McCullum and Ish Sodhi combined forces to keep New Zealands unbeaten T20 record against India intact -- the Kiwis have now won five T20s in six meetings.
Man of the match Santner (4-11) bowled exceptionally well on a slow track to register the best bowling figures by a New Zealander in T20 cricket.
There was a bit of spin out there, they bowled well to keep us to 120, that was below par, but we got stuck in and Im delighted with the win, said Santner.
India, who have been firm favourites to win the title, were never in the chase after losing their openers early and, with the exception of Virat Kohli (23), none of the Indian batsmen could come up with any answers to the inspired Kiwi bowling attack.
Kohli, during his 27-ball stay, offered some resistence on a slow track, but the introduction of Sodhi spelt the end for the star batsman.
Chasing a wildish leg-spinner, Kohli was caught behind as the packed stadium was stunned into silence with the writing clearly on the wall.
Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni then tried hard to dig India out of their hole but his valiant run-a-ball 30 made little difference in the end.

SLC appoints Disciplinary Committee

Sri Lanka Cricket is disappointed to note the negative and misleading comments made by former Chairman of the Selection Committee  Kapila Wijegunawardene, in the wake of the appointment of the new Selection Committee headed by Aravinda de Silva.
Wijegunawardenes statements are inaccurate, misleading, and defamatory, and furthermore are of the nature to cause grievous injury to the moral of the Sri Lanka Cricket team, currently intent on bringing home the ICC World Twenty 20.
In view of the above, Sri Lanka Cricket has appointed a three member independent panel, headed by Palitha Kumarasinghe PC to review the said statements and comments and make recommendations to Sri Lanka Cricket on the appropriate disciplinary action to be taken if any.
Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to reiterate its confidence in the vision and strategy of the new Selection Committee, under Aravinda de Silva, and is most enthusiastic to note the imminent positive developments that will take Sri Lanka Cricket to the next level and beyond.

Sri Lanka wins 15 medals ahead of Rio Paralympics

DUBAI: Anil Prasanna Jayalath Yodhapedige and Amara Indumathi Lallwala Palliyagurunnanselage Karunatilleke emerged as Sri Lanka's golden duo at the inaugural IPC Athletics Asia-Oceania Championships in Dubai.
Karunatilleke produced another sensational performance outclassing her rivals in the women's 200m T44/47 final with a personal best of 27.89 on the final day of the competition in Dubai on Saturday.
"I'm happy to come to Dubai and to win two gold medals in the first Asia-Oceania Championship. It is a big achievement in my life.
I was confident of winning after the training and guidance I received from my coach," said the 29-year-old who has qualified to the Rio Paralympic Games after winning the 400m T47 title in Dubai in her maiden international appearance over this distance after opting to skip the 100.
Para Asian Games medallist in Incheon in 2014, Karunatilleke was the cynosure of all eyes as she cantered to victory with spectacular ease over Thailand's Pagjiraporn Gagun (T46) 29.14 and Iran's Zahra Shamohammadi (T47) 30.70.
"My previous best in 200 was 28.52. I wanted to improve my timings. It was a new experience as T20, T44 and T46 categories were combined. It was a challenge but it was not a problem for me since I was focused on winning," said Karunatilleke who is employed as an industrial engineer at MAS Holdings.
Second in a family of five from Moneragala, Karunatilleke who has deformity in her left hand from birth is certainly a future star for Sri Lanka together with Jayalath who pocketed four medals to be among the top medal winners at the inaugural IPC Asia-Oceania Championships.
Jayalath reigned over Asian Para Games champion Atsushi Yamamoto of Japan for the second time in Dubai to clinch a golden double on Friday.
The 30-year-old won the men's 100m T42 to add to his 200m title and declared he was to improve his winning time of 12.62 as he prepares to go for gold at this year's Paralympic Games.
Sri Lanka finished in sixth position from among 24 countries bagging a total of 15 medals, including six gold, four silver and five bronze medals.
Iran topped the final medals table with a total of 23 gold, 10 silver and 7 bronze. China finished second with 16 gold, 9 silver and 5 bronze. India (12-10-9) was third and Japan (8-6-11) finished in fourth place.
Sri Lanka's only Paralympic medallist Pradeep Sanjaya vowed to get back into form before Rio after finishing third in the 400m T47 won by Iran's Ahmad Ojaghlou (50.09) while India's Sandeep Singh (50.67) took the silver.
"I'm not happy with my performance in Dubai. There are five months to improve before going to Brazil. I'm trying to run under 49 and hoping to win a medal in the Olympics," said Sanjaya who anchored Sri Lanka to a gold medal in the 4 x 100m relay in this Championships.
"I'm trying to do my best by training hard for the Olympics and to win another medal," said Sanjaya, 30, who is attached to the Sinha regiment in Ambepussa.
Buddhika Indrapala who bagged three bronze medals on his international was a revelation.
"I trained for the past one and half years to produce these results. I want to improve my skills further and bring glory to Sri Lanka," said Indrapala who achieved personal bests on his way win bronze in the 100m (13.41), 200m (27.50) and long jump (5.08).
"I'm hoping to training and qualify for Rio," said the 28-year-old Lance Corporal in the army who hails from Mihintale.
Ajith Hettiarachchi also won a gold medal, winning the 100m T44 in 12.30 on his international debut men's 100m T42 final powering past India's Manoj Baskar (12.47) and Thailand's Suthit Thailand Uamsamut (12.52).
"I'm very happy to win a gold medal in the first international appearance. I hope to qualify for Rio," said Hettiarachchi, 41, a member of the gold medal winning Sri Lanka relay team who is an Army sergeant from Gemunu regiment.

Style over substance

Chiseled and handsome men, buxom and obedient women, scary monsters and opulent palaces are in abundant throughout Alex Proyas' Gods of Egypt.
The story is simple but too many subplots make it complicated. Bek, a thief with a heart of gold, doubts the nobility of the Gods. Despite the fact that they are 12 feet tall, bleed gold, and transform into humanoid beasts in combat he is fearless towards them because they resemble humans in appearance. Meantime celebrations are underway since God Osiris will be passing his crown as King of Egypt to his son Horus.
This does not sit well with Osiris' brother, Set. He attacks the coronation and as a result Osiris is killed and Horus is blinded and banished. The people of Egypt become slaves under their new king and Bek sees Horus as the only way they could be freed from tyranny. Backed by his partner, Zaya, Bek hatches a plan to restore Horus sight and help him take over leadership.
Another noteworthy factor about Gods of Egypt is that the movie does not shy away from borrowing from other ancient epics. Ancient mythology is moulded to fit the structure of a contemporary superhero framework. This is evident in the manner the Gods transform themselves to resemble something between Ironman and the Transformers.
Ancient epics
The Gods are reduced to a level in which they resemble snobbish brats as they fight over the fact that who gets to control Egypt.
The stunt choreography fails to impress. They look like they were pulled out of a video game, and not a good one. The shots are cut rapidly and one almost wonders if Proyas too decided that nothing interesting has been captured on film so that it is best to wrap up the episodes.
There are a few instances when the movie entertains. However style overcomes substance and logic at times. The CGI just isnt that good. Digital effects get a bad rap when compared to practical effects.
Entertaining diversion
Though Nikolaj Coster-Waldau isnt likely to be the latest action hero, he carries the film off as well as he could have possibly managed. Chadwick Boseman is an entertaining diversion as Thoth the god of wisdom, and Gerard Butler too does well as the villain. Brenton Thwaites is not significant in his role.
Compared with the male roles the women have been shabbily treated in Gods of Egypt. Courtney Eaton exists solely to be a damsel in distress. Elodie Yung, as the goddess of love, Hathor, hardly has anything interesting to do. Both exist more to give the story a go ahead rather than add any substance to the tale.
Despite making creative movies like The Crow and Dark City in the 1990s Proyas latest addition to the cinema scene has not got anything new to offer. If you are a diehard fan of the Clash of the Titans style of movie genre, then this might be your cup of tea. Otherwise this will get more yawns rather than laughs out of you.

Unfit Malinga spills the beans on his selection

A half-fit Lasith Malinga was on the flight to Kolkata on Monday with faint hopes of being fit to play in his countrys opening ICC World Twenty20 fixture against Afghanistan on March 17.
Malinga did not leave for India with the Sri Lanka team as he was undergoing treatment for an injured left knee which according to him has to take its own time and heal.
The injury which Malinga described as a bone bruise is according to medical experts a traumatic injury sustained from a forceful impact during sports, accident or a direct hit. It is characterized by a severe pain that can last for weeks or months and the best way to help the healing process is to rest, support and protect the bone or joint involved and to apply conventional treatments for trauma.
This is a bone injury that cannot be operated or treated medically. I am having only some injections (not pain killers) to make it heal. The only remedy for it is rest, said Malinga at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday while waiting for his flight to be rescheduled after it was delayed due to a technical fault.
Malinga was travelling on the direct flight from Colombo to Kolkata on Mihinair. The flight which was originally scheduled for 6.30 am finally took off at 3.30 p.m.
Spilling the beans on his forced selection to the team Malinga said that he had informed the selection committee headed by Kapila Wijegunawardene as well as the one headed by Aravinda de Silva not to select him for the Asia Cup or the World T20 as he was not fully fit for the two tournaments.
However the two selection committees went ahead and picked him apparently on his reputation as being one of the leading fast bowlers of his kind in the world. He is in fact the leading wicket-taker in the World T20 tournament with 38 wickets from 31 matches and overall has taken 382 wickets in all levels of T20 cricket.
Why do the selectors want to pick a half fit bowler like me when there are other fit bowlers around Malinga asked journalists who were on the same flight with him.
In the Asia Cup, Malinga played in the opening game against UAE, took four wickets and won the match for his country but at great cost because he aggravated his injured knee and was out for the rest of the tournament.
Subsequently on the teams return Malinga stepped down from the Sri Lanka T20 captaincy to give himself time to recover from his injury. Angelo Mathews was subsequently selected as captain to replace him as captain for the World T20.
I will practice in the next few days with the team and see how my knee is taking up the pressure. If I dont feel any pain I will play in the opening match, but if not it is a decision for the selectors to make, said Malinga who admitted that he feels a slight pain in his knee when walking.
Malingas progress according to Sri Lanka Cricket sources will be monitored by the team physio Steve Mount and he will train with the team before a final call will be taken on his fitness.
