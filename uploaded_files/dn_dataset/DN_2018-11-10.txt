Slashed telco levy from today
The decision of the Government to slash the telecommunication levy from 25% to 15% will be operational from today (10).
The reduction of the Telecommunication Levy will be operational on both land (ground phones and mobile phones). However, the Nation Building Tax and the Value Added Tax will remain unchanged,Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions Deputy Director Indrajith Handapangoda told the Daily News yesterday.
He also said that it was on Wednesday that the TRC had intimated the reduction of the Levy which was to be implemented with immediate effect.We are now writing to all Telco operators, both fixed and mobile and will be operational from Friday, he said.
Sri Lanka Telecoms General Manager (Corporate Strategy) Prabath Ambegoda said this was a very progressive move for the benefit of the telecommunications industry, which was the fastest growing industry globally.
He said it would be only the Telco Levy which would be reduced by 10% while the NBT and the VAT would remain.
Responding to a question what the benefit would translate to, say on a Rs. 2500 invoice, he said that on an invoice of Rs. 2500, there would be a reduction of around Rs. 200 which will be around 8% with the 10% reduction of the Telecommunication Levy.
Dialog Axiata Group Managing Director and CEO Supun Weerasinghe said they too will be passing the reduction benefit of the Telecom Levy to the subscribers, in both Fixed and Mobile categories.He said total taxes which earlier amounted to around 49% , would now be reduced to around 37%.

Australia beat South Africa to end losing streak
Adelaide, Friday: Australia snapped a seven-game losing streak to beat South Africa by seven runs in the second one-dayer in Adelaide on Friday, keeping the series alive and boosting their battered confidence.
Set 232 to win, the Proteas could only manage 224-9 in their 50 overs, leaving the series tied at 1-1 with the decider in Hobart on Sunday
The hosts, who were thrashed by six wickets with more than 20 overs to spare in the opening match, dug deep with their bowlers getting them over the line.
Marcus Stoinis was the pick with 3-35 off his 10 overs, including the crucial scalp of David Miller who hit a stubborn 51.
Adelaide has been a happy hunting ground in the past for Australia.
In fact, their last win came at the oval nine months ago against England, before the reigning world champions were knocked for six by the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March.
Their form slump since had been characterised by batting collapses and they again struggled to compile a big total with some tight South African bowling putting them back in the pavilion for 231.
But with Mitchell Starc returning to new-ball duties after a short-lived experiment with Nathan Coulter-Nile in Perth backfired, the attack did its job.
Starc got a reward in his third over, with Adam Zampa getting under a catch in the deep to end Quinton de Kocks night.
Aiden Markram and Reeza Hendricks were looking dangerous as they pushed the score to 46, but they needlessly attempted a third run from a clip off the pads to midwicket and Markham was run out.
Six balls later and Hendricks was also in the clubhouse, getting an outside edge off Josh Hazlewood to give Australia hope.
And when Heinrich Klassen fell to Stoinis to leave the Proteas on 68-4 the crowd came alive, sensing the miserable run could be over.
Faf du Plessis and Miller set about building a 74-run partnership before Pat Cummins got a breakthrough with the South African skipper dragging the ball onto his stumps on 47.
Miller dug in as partners fell to grind out a gutsy 51 before he was given out lbw on a review decision and the South African tail failed to wag. Australian skipper Aaron Finch stressed beforehand the need to go back to basics and build partnerships, and he and Travis Head tried to set the tone after being sent into bat. But Heads aggressiveness cost him and he was trapped him lbw for eight. That brought Shaun Marsh to the crease and he quickly got into his groove.
He and Finch knocked up a 50 partnership before Marsh, on 22, got a thick edge off Rabada and de Kock took the catch.
Finch built a composed 41 before he was deceived by a Dwaine Pretorius delivery and chopped the ball onto his wicket.
The explosive Chris Lynn was in Twenty20 mode when he smacked 18 off the first four balls of a Rabada over before he pushed his luck too far on the fifth, mistiming a hook and was caught.
With wickets falling, Alex Carey worked hard to make 47 before becoming Rabadas third victim. AFP

Battle against Sena intensifies
The Agriculture Ministry has already taken measures to control the spread of crop-destroying caterpillar known as Sena (Fall Armyworm - Spodoptera frugiperda), reported from three districts including Ampara.
The spraying of pesticides was started in the three districts and the Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed officials to provide funds for the purpose without delay.
Farmers were made aware about the pest and warned to be vigilant on the caterpillars in their crops by the ministry.
The farmers were instructed to inform the Agrarian Officer of the area or the Ministry via 1920 or 081-2388316 if they suspect that their crops have the pest.
Female caterpillars lay eggs more often and spread fast.
The pest was noticed for the first time in Nigeria and it has spread now across the Asia. The pest was spotted in India three months ago.
The FAW is a highly invasive species due to its ability to spread and reproduce quickly. The female wormlays over 1,000 eggs during her lifespan. Its larvae damage the crop, and the adult moths move in the direction of the wind, reaching up to 100 km a day.
The moth has dark gray, mottled forewings with light and dark splotches, and a noticeable white spot near the extreme end of each. Newly hatched larvae are green and move in a looping motion.
The larvae are smooth-skinned and in light tan or green and they have three yellow-white hairlines down their backs. Full-grown larvae are about 1-1/2 inches (38 mm) long. The face of the mature larva is with a white inverted Y.

After AB de Villiers 360-degree batting:
A bowler comes up with 360-degree bowling run-up
Cricket has become a batsmans game over the years and it has become paramount for the bowlers to churn out variations in order to curb the batsmen from unleashing their range of strokes on the cricket pitch. Recently, a spinner from Botswana by the name of Mmoloki Mooketsi came up with an action where he took a couple of small steps before sending down the ball.
The world has also been a witness to some indifferent action at the international circuit. Former South Africa spinner Paul Adams used to twist his entire body while bowling. A decade ago, Sri Lankan fast bowler introduced a delivery where the ball was delivered from a side angle owing to which it was difficult for any new batsmen to read him in the initial stages.
Even the current Indian team has Jasprit Bumrah, who doesnt have a conventional bowling action. Recently, another such bowling action hit the scenes. In a domestic match in India, a left-arm spinner turned his entire body around while bowling. From the video, it seemed as if hes a fan of the Proteas great AB de Villiers, who is popularly known as Mr. 360 degree.
Also, it was surprising how despite having the peculiar action, he bowled it with sheer accuracy. The leather pitched on and around the middle and leg stump and the batsmen made a forward push to pat the red cherry straight to the short leg fielder. This happened on day three of an under-23 CK Nayudu Trophy match between Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in Kalyania, near Kolkata, where UPs left-arm spinner Shiva Singh sent social media into meltdown. Singh, who was part of Indias U-19 World Cup-winning team last year, completed a 360-degree turn while bowling his delivery, leaving the on-field umpire Vinod Seshan declare the ball dead.
The wicketkeeper and the close-in fielders came towards the umpire to get more clarity on the reasons behind its illegitimacy.
The umpire remained unfazed and clearly suggested to the bowler that such an action isnt permitted. Moreover, he also asked the players to carry on with the game.
MCCS VERDICT
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which lays downs rules for international cricket worldwide, was asked to deliver its verdict on whether the ball can be deemed legal or not.
According to the law published in the Lords website on Thursday, it does not dictate what a bowlers run-up should look like.
It states:
Under Law 21.1, the bowler must state his/her mode of delivery, which seems to have been left arm round the wicket in this case, but does not state how conventional the bowlers approach should be.
Law 41.4 states:
41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he/she is preparing to receive or receiving a delivery.
41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call.
The law only states if an offence is made to distract the batsman, rather than the batter actually getting distracted. Another point made by the law is for the umpire to decide if he felt the action was done in order to distract the striker.
The law goes on to add that only if 360-degree twirl should be part of the bowlers run-up for every delivery, then can the umpire step in to deem if the action was done to distract the batsman.
If the batsman is distracted, he can withdraw from his stance and if the umpire does feel that the bowlers action was done purposefully to distract the batsman, then Law 41.1 will be followed and a penalty of five runs is awarded. - cricketcountry

A close battle for supremacy can be expected when CR & FC lock horns with giant killers CH and FC in their opening game of the 2018/19 Dialog A Division inter club league rugby tournament today at CR grounds at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4.00 pm.
Going by the two teams CH has the edge hence will have a definite chance of coming on top over CR as they have a heavy set of forwards as well as a speedy three quarter line and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
CH led by third row forward Yoshitha Rajapaksa also will have a definite advantage when it comes to the halves combination of former St.Anthonys College Kandy sensational fly half Samuel Maduwantha and ex Wesley College scrum half Avishka Lee are very much faster than CR & FC halves combination.
The Maitland Crescent boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today's game and if their speedy three quarter line delivers the desired results today, then it will be a daunting task for the CR & FC outfit led by Kavindu Perera. But they will be countering their attack to pull off a much needed victory in the end.
Last year It was the CH and FC outfit which won both the first round as well as the second round games against CR & FC.

A full audit should be conducted before the commencement of work at the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry, newly appointed Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Chamal Rajapaksa said.
Assuming duties at his Ministry in Colombo yesterday, he said that an audit should be conducted on the work carried out by the ministry, including media reports published on various alleged malpractices in the Ministry.
An independent full audit should be conducted, Minister Rajapaksa said.
Minister Rajapaksa pointed out that a modern hospital constructed at Hambantota with Dutch assistance three years ago is still not in operation.
This hospital building has become a nesting ground for bats.
I went to see a patient receiving treatment at the Galle General Hospital but could not find the location of the patient after walking here and there for a long time.
I had to jump from one flight of steps to another staircase to enter the hospital building, Minister Rajapaksa said.
 These flight of steps are very steep which could be a great hindrance to the aged and infirm. An old person runs the risk of falling and getting injured while climbing the stairs. I visited another hospital to see a cancer patient and it looked like a Bootha Guhawa (haunted den), the Minister said.

Culture clash looms as England face All Blacks
London, Friday: "Styles make fights" is usually the talk of boxing promoters but it could prove true of England's long-awaited clash against world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.
England coach Eddie Jones has often insisted that trying to play the All Blacks at their own running from deep, passing game is a recipe for defeat, with the Australian championing the traditional Red Rose strengths of a powerful forward pack and solid set piece.
And All Blacks coach Steve Hansen accepted there was more than one way to win a game.
"Southern hemisphere rugby -- there's a lot of talk about Super Rugby, it's very free-flowing with a lot lot of tries scored, but in this part of the world, maybe because the environment is different, the weather is different, there is a necessity to play a tighter game," said Hansen.
"I'm certainly not bragging about it," added the former Wales boss.
"We have natural athletes who want to run and carry the ball and pass the ball."
The experienced Jones also knows the virtues of adaptability.
It was a trait England, then coached by Stuart Lancaster, showed in the last of just their seven wins over the All Blacks six years ago when, leading 12-0 at the break courtesy of four Owen Farrell penalties, they ran in three second-half tries through Brad Barritt, Chris Ashton and Manu Tuilagi in a 38-21 triumph.
Dashing wing Ashton is now set to make his first Test start in four years but the injury-prone Tuilagi's long wait for an England recall has been delayed again by a groin problem.
'Farrell doesn't play in a dinner suit'
Fly-half Farrell has found himself in the spotlight after escaping any action for a seemingly illegal shoulder charge in the closing stages of an unconvincing 12-11 win over South Africa at Twickenham last weekend with which England launched their November campaign. But former Wallaby and Japan boss Jones insisted Farrell required the kind of protection referees routinely afforded by match officials to Ireland No 10 Jonathan Sexton. "If he was Sexton then we'd be able to complain about him, but because he's Owen Farrell he's allowed to be hit late," said Jones. He's tough so he gets up and he plays.
"He's a tough rooster, a warrior. He puts his body on the line, he doesn't play in a dinner suit."
Ashton, 31, who came off the bench against the Springboks, has scored 19 tries in a 40-cap England career interrupted by suspensions and spending a season with French giants Toulon. AFP

Delhi bans trucks as megacity chokes
INDIA: Delhi authorities have imposed a three-day ban on trucks entering the worlds most polluted major city as its 20 million inhabitants wheezed in the toxic annual winter smog.
With levels of air pollution classed as hazardous, the restriction on the nearly 40,000 medium and heavy lorries that enter Delhi every day was imposed late Thursday.
The transport ministry said that vehicles carrying food and other essentials were exempted, while appealing to private owners of diesel sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to leave their cars at home.
Delhis air quality typically worsens in winter, as clouds of smoke from farmers fires billow into the city and mix with industrial and traffic emissions to form a noxious cocktail.
On Wednesday night Delhites largely defied a court order and set off an immense barrage of smoke-spewing firecrackers to celebrate the major Hindu festival of Diwali, sending pollution levels soaring.
On Friday, levels of particulates 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter, the most harmful to human health, peaked at 845, according to the US embassy website that monitors air quality independently.
The hazardous figure is roughly 33 times the World Health Organization safe limit of 25 and health experts advise people to stay indoors or use masks for protection.
Vehicles on Delhi roads generate roughly 20 percent of these tiny particles in air, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream and which are linked to chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease.
Authorities in the previous years have rationed private car use and imposed shutdowns on industrial units and coal-run power plants, as well as taxes on lorries to discourage them from using Delhi as a transit route. Delhi was among 14 Indian cities that figured in a list of the 20 most polluted cities across the globe this year issued by the WHO.- AFP

The State Minister was speaking on the statement released by the European Union, calling for Parliament to have a vote on the Prime Minister.
He added that these actions of the EU can in no way be acceptable to a sovereign nation.
The European Union has no power to take action against the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and it is unfortunate that a foreign entity is thus interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation.
The opportunity to interfere thus has been granted through the invitation of individuals like former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mangala Samaraweera and Malik Samarawickrama, he said. The Minister further added that it was shameful to see such countries interfering with the independence of a sovereign nation and that the Government was and will always only act in accordance with Parliamentary procedures, tradition and its own Constitution.

The much-awaited ICC Cricket World Cup is only six to seven months as the ten participating teams will be fighting it out for the silverware. Australia are the defending champions who are currently struggling in the 50-over format with the bans on their top cricketers. All the teams are looking to build the team ahead of the event and every match is going down the wire.
Meanwhile, the ICC ran a poll recently asking the fans about the possible winner of the tournament and England have come out on top with the flying colours.
As many as 41.23 percent people thought England, led by Eoin Morgan, will win the World Cup which, if they do, will be their maiden triumph. Looking at their form at the moment, the Brits who are also the hosts of the tournament are certainly the favourites to clinch the title. They are on a series winning spree at the moment and recently won the ODI series in Sri Lanka in their own den. It will be interesting to see if they will be able to live up to the expectations. In this race, Pakistan were the second most favourites to win the World Cup next year in the United Kingdom. They received 25.37 percent of the total votes and the fact that they won the Champions Trophy in the same country in 2017 is giving them an edge. Though the Men in Green werent up to the mark in the Asia Cup, they are certainly a force to reckon with. As far as India are concerned, they found support from 21.19 percent of votes and they were the third favourite team among the ten which will battle in the mega event. However, none of the other teams were even considered much by the fans as less than 5 percent of the fans felt that they will perform well in the World Cup.
Surprisingly, Australia were the fourth with 3.86 percent votes while the likes of South Africa, New Zealand and Windies followed them. - India.com

Farmers complain of subsidized fertiliser shortage in NCP
Farmers in the Anuradhapura district are facing a scarcity of subsidized fertiliser in the market.
Farmer organisations in Galenbindunuwewa, Wilachchiya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Horowpothana, Ratmalgahawewa, Medawachchiya, Rambewa, Seeppukula etc. have complained to authorities that some fertiliser dealers were demanding the farmers to buy six bags of urea sometimes instead of issuing a bag of MOP or TSP at subsidised rate of Rs. 1,000 (earlier Rs. 1,500) per 50 kilogram.
Referring to the issue, Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said there was no such scarcity in the district.
The farmers are facilitated to buy fertilizers such as Urea, MOP and TSP from the 41 agrarian development centres at the subsidized rate of Rs. 500 per 50 kg bag for paddy.
We have made arrangements to distribute 40,000 mt of fertiliser for cultivating a minimum of 125,000 hectares.
The problem is pertaining to the fertiliser sold at Rs. 1,000 per 50 kg bag (earlier Rs. 1500) in the open market without any restriction.
It is reported that in some instances, fertiliser traders are forcing farmers that MOP and TSP fertiliser is issued only to those who bought more Urea fertiliser.
Also, there are complaints that some fertiliser dealers are still continuing to sell the subsidized fertiliser at the old rate of Rs. 1,500 per 50kg bag ignoring the present rate of Rs. 1,000.
Somawansa told the fertiliser secretariat officials and the 675 agriculture research and production assistants to probe into the unwarranted fertiliser business and take action against offenders. Meanwhile, Fertiliser Secretariat Director Ajith Pushpakumara discussed with farmer organization representatives, representatives of the authorized fertiliser distribution companies such as Baurs, CIC, Dimo, Helysetc and fertiliser traders at the Kahatagasdigiliya agrarian development center, recently.
Farmers urged the Director to make arrangements to distribute the Rs. 1,000 fertiliser subsidy through the 41 agrarian development centres in addition to the market.
At present, only paddy farmers are issued fertiliser at the rate of Rs. 500 per 50 kg bag through agrarian centers.
Also, farmers demanded that the Lak Pohora and commercial companies too be authorized to deal in marketing the Rs. 1,000 fertiliser subsidy.

The North-western Province Agriculture Department warns farmers to be vigilant of the presence of the invasive Fall Armyworm which is the larval stage of the Fall Armyworm Moth (Spodoptera Frugiperda).
They warned farmers to contact the Agriculture Officers in the area for further instructions.
Northwestern Agriculture Director W. A. Seelaratne said the moth, known for its large-scale invasive behaviour during the larval stage, affects nearly 100 varieties of crop, especially maize.
It has migrated from Africa to India and from there to Sri Lanka.
It is reported that cultivation in Anuradhapura and Rajanganaya in the North Central Province and Thambutta and Gampola in North Western Province have been affected by the advent of the worm.
Seelaratne said sugarcane, green gram, fruits and other crops are food for the Fall Armyworm. He added that the moth can fly even 100 km easily and spreads across the country easily. It was reported from Africa in 2016 and from India in May this year.

Giroud heads Chelsea past BATE, Rangers lose thriller at Spartak
Paris, Thursday: Chelsea booked their place in the Europa League knockout stage as Olivier Girouds first club goal of the campaign gave Maurizio Sarris men a 1-0 win at BATE Borisov, while Rangers lost a seven-goal thriller against Spartak Moscow.
Giroud ended his 11-game goal drought this season by giving Chelsea a 53rd-minute lead, and the Premier League giants held on despite BATE striking the woodwork three times in the match.
I was hoping to score soon because I came back late from the World Cup and I was lacking maybe a bit of efficiency and luck but you always need to keep working hard and keep the faith and thats what happened tonight, France striker Giroud told BT Sport.
The Londoners moved six points clear of Hungarians Vidi at the Group L summit and remain unbeaten in 17 matches since losing the Community Shield to Manchester City in August.
BATE started strongly and came within a whisker of taking an early lead as former Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb teed up Dmitri Baga for a long-range strike which crashed against Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalagas post.
The visitors quickly started to monopolise possession, but despite seeing over 70 percent of the ball in the first half, they failed to even manage a shot on target against a well-drilled BATE outfit.
But Sarris men were much improved after the break and Giroud, who also scored twice for Arsenal against BATE in the Europa League last term, broke the deadlock by meeting left-back Emersons cross with a firm downward header.
The hosts almost levelled just five minutes later, as they hit the woodwork for second time in the match when Nikolai Signevich diverted the ball onto the crossbar.
BATE coach Alyaksey Baha, the older brother of midfielder Dmitri, was left holding his head in his hands after Aleksey Rios blazed an even better chance to equalise over the bar.
There was still time for BATE to hit the post again, as right-back Rios brilliant dipping volley beat Kepa but bounced to safety.

Govt. ready to take up any challenge against UNP
If the UNP was ready to try their luck at an election, then the current government was ready too and both parties could agree and come to a decision, said the Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha.
Otherwise when Parliament is convened on the 14th, we will show the majority and are confident of it. At yesterdays group meeting, the President and Prime Minister stressed that as a government with the cooperation of Parliament, we would forge ahead. The President would not go back on his decision for sure, he said.
He pointed out that if the President and the Prime Minister could not sit at one table and take policy decisions together, then the country would go into chaos. But today, the President has appointed a Prime Minister that he could work with and together, the government would bring the country back to the path of prosperity. We have the support of the majority of the people which had been displayed clearly, he said with confidence.
On the issue of the 19th Amendment, he said that it was not endorsed by a referendum, but only a 2/3rd majority in Parliament. Now the UNP is going crying to the International Community seeking their support. But while they do so, we have taken oaths and immediately commenced our work.
When asked when the new government intends to hold Provincial Council elections, he assured that within a period of 2-3 months Provincial Council elections would be held and prove what true democracy was. We are currently making all the arrangements for that. The previous government failed to hold PC elections due to their inability. But we have the ability and we are not afraid, he said, adding that if they are unable to do it under the new system, the PC elections would be held under the old system. No matter what, he assured that the elections would be held within the next 2-3 months.
During the past, the country was plunged into a crisis on several instances. I must say clearly, that even after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the Executive Presidency still holds the power to allocate the ministries to ministers. The previous regime have been trying to indicate to the International Community that Parliamentary activities are being carried out according to the Westminster structure. But, it is their own president, J. R. Jayewardena who changed that in 1978. Through the 19th Amendment, all that happened was a minor reduction of those powers. Many legal experts have expressed their views in this regard.
Premajayantha noted that the President was still the head of State, Government and the Cabinet. The President still has one year and two months left in his term until January 2020. Hence, if the President was unable to work with Ranil Wickremesinghe for the remainder of his term and there was no policy compatibility, then what was his option In fact, he had made several requests to other leaders in the UNP, but they had turned a deaf ear, he said, adding that he had no other option, but to go to the next best option.
When the Cabinet is dissolved, then the President holds all relevant subjects under him and distributes these subjects by appointing Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers in accordance with provisions of the Constitution.

ICC World Cup 2019: One impact player for each team
The biggest and the most prestigious tournament in cricket history, the ICC Cricket World Cup is scheduled to begin on May 30 next year in England. Hosts England will be up against the Proteas in the inaugural game of the high-intensity tournament. Defending champions Australia will begin their title defence on June 1, when they face Afghanistan at Bristol.
The preparations for the mega-event have already started. Experimentation amidst the teams has been common in the past few months as all the teams are trying to get their team composition in order. The ten countries featuring in the 2019 World Cup are Australia, England, South Africa, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indies, and Afghanistan.
England are the favourites to win the tournament whereas Asian giants such as India and Pakistan are not too far behind. Almost all teams have figured out their probable squads albeit all of them have a few concerns going into the World Cup. For India, their main concern is their unsettled middle order.
All the ten teams will have a player they could rely on, one that could create significant impact in the tournament. Some of these choices may be obvious but some might be surprising, on this note, let us take a look at one impact player from each team whose performance can turn the tables in his team's favour:
PAKISTAN - SHOAIB MALIK
Pakistan's most experienced campaigner Shoaib Malik will bid adieu to international cricket after the World Cup next year. Malik made his international debut in 1999 and has been serving Pakistan since then. The all-rounder was an integral part of Pakistan's squad in their 2009 T20 World Cup triumph, he also played a vital role in Pakistan's 2017 Champions Trophy victory.
Pace bowling has always been Pakistan's forte but their struggles with the bat are well known to all teams. Malik provides stability in the middle order as he plays the role of an anchor coming in to bat at number four or five. His ability to take on the spinners makes him a permanent choice for the role. The side led by Sarfaraz Ahmed have some wonderful and fierce pacers in their ranks but their main concern is their batting.
To solve their batting issues, Malik is one of the most important batsmen in the line-up. Pakistan will have high hopes from their veteran superstar as he aims to take Pakistan to victory one last time in the World Cup.
BANGLADESH - SHAKIB AL HASAN
The rise of the Bangladeshi tigers has been incredible in the last few years. Since the 2012 Asia Cup, Bangladesh has learnt the art of winning matches and their all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has played a dominant role in all their victories. Shakib has led Bangladesh to victory on many occasions, he will be vital to Bangladesh's chances in the World Cup next year.
The 31-year-old's contribution with both, bat and ball, is significant. In 192 ODIs, Shakib has scored 5482 runs at an average of 34.92. He has also scalped 244 wickets in the meantime, he has the ability to dry up runs in the middle overs, he creates pressure on the opposition with his much-needed dot balls in the middle overs of the innings.
His injury in the Asia Cup weakened the Bangladesh line-up albeit they managed to give India a scare in the final of the tournament. With Shakib Al Hasan in their ranks, Bangladesh can aim to create a few upsets in the tournament. The all-rounder will be their most important bet in England next year.
AFGHANISTAN - RASHID KHAN
Afghanistan's recent teenage sensation Rashid Khan led his country in the World Cup Qualifiers where they defeated West Indies in the final to lift the Qualifiers trophy. Rashid garnered the attention of the cricketing world after his exploits in T20 cricket, later, he was picked by the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL.
His consistent performances in the IPL helped him to make a name for himself. On the back of these performances, Rashid earned a spot in the Big Bash League(BBL) and the Carribean Premier League(CPL). Recently, the 20-year-old has worked on his batting and has transformed himself into a valuable all-rounder.
Afghanistan are equipped with plenty of batsmen in their line-up but their main bets will be their spin twins, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Zadran. Rashid has picked up 118 wickets in 50 ODI innings with best figures of 7 for 18. The leg-spinner has changed the course of Afghanistan's cricket and he can further help his country to create some upsets in England next year.
NEW ZEALAND - KANE WILLIAMSON
New Zealand's skipper Kane Williamson is one of the best batsmen in the world currently. With his leadership skills, Kane has helped the Blackcaps to glory in plenty of games in the last few years. He bats at number three for New Zealand and plays the anchor role, his exploits make him one of New Zealand's most dependable batsmen.
Williamson has featured in 128 ODIs in which he has amassed 5183 runs at an average of 46.7. His statistics are even better in England, Kane has played 10 ODIs in England in which he has scored 588 runs at an average of 65.33 with his highest score being 118. His solid technique is well suited for English conditions.
The 28-year-old will have the responsibility of guiding New Zealand to their first World Cup victory. The New Zealand skipper will have an opportunity to prove himself as a batsman and as a leader when the Blackcaps take the field against Sri Lanka in Cardiff on June 1 next year.
INDIA - VIRAT KOHLI
This, unarguably, is the most obvious and easiest choice amongst all others. India's skipper Virat Kohli is the most vital player for India's chances. India's over-dependence on the top three batsmen is visible as their main concern is their unsettled middle order. India's solution to all these problems is one man, Virat Kohli.
Recently, Kohli became the quickest batsman to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals. He reached the milestone in 205 innings whereas Tendulkar reached the milestone in 259 innings. The 30-year-old has scored 10232 ODI runs at a breathtaking average of 59.8. In 18 ODIs in England, Kohli has added 677 runs at an average of 52.08.
On the recent England tour, Kohli rewrote his England horrors as he negotiated bowlers like James Anderson, Stuart Broad with sheer ease. The change in his technique was evident as Kohli got the better off the England pacers. The 2019 World Cup will be a test of character for the modern day master, he will look to lead India to glory as India take the field against South Africa in their first game on June 4.
ENGLAND - JOS BUTTLER
England's wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler has held the finisher's role for a long time. England has one of the best batting line-ups in the world and that is evident from their recent ODI scores. The English side led by Eoin Morgan posted 481 versus Australia, they surpassed their own record of the highest team total in ODIs.
Buttler's role becomes even more crucial with this aggressive batting line-up. On a few occasions, Buttler had the responsibility of preventing an English collapse, on some occasions, he had the responsibility of attacking at the back end of the innings in order to score some quickfire runs.
Butter has played 122 ODIs in which he has scored 3176 runs at an average of 39.7. The most impressive thing about his statistics is his strike rate of 116.98. Buttler's prowess will be important for England as they play the World Cup in their home conditions. The wicketkeeper-batsman will be England's most important bet. Alongside him, England will rely on players like Ben Stokes, Joe Root, and Moeen Ali.
AUSTRALIA - MITCHELL STARC
Mitchell Starc took the cricketing world by storm when he arrived on the international scene. Starc made his debut in 2010, he had a slow start to his international career but Starc produced some serious pace as he joined the list of the best Australian fast bowlers. Injuries acted as obstacles for Starc but the left arm pacer dodged all those obstacles to be a standout performer for Australia.
In the 2015 World Cup in Australia, Starc picked up 22 wickets in 8 matches as he emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament. He earned the man of the tournament award for his heroics, due to this, the Michael Clarke led side went on to lift the World Cup. Starc has picked up 141 wickets in 73 ODIs with the best figures of 6 for 28 which came against New Zealand in the previous World Cup.
Starc has played three ODIs in England in which he has picked 11 wickets. In the 2019 World Cup, the southpaw will look to improve his statistics further. A weakened Australian side would depend on the 29-year-old to produce his magic.
WEST INDIES - CHRIS GAYLE
Chris Gayle made a comeback to the Windies squad recently. The team from the Carribean has been struggling off late. The two-time World Cup Champions West Indies had to play the World Cup Qualifiers to qualify for the 2019 World Cup. They suffered a defeat from the hands of Afghanistan in the final of the tournament but a top-two finish guaranteed them a spot in the World Cup.
Chris Gayle returned from the tournament where he scored 165 runs in six innings with the highest score of 123. Gayle's average of 27.50 was nominal but his top order flurry provided Windies with a decent start. Gayle has scored 9727 runs in 284 ODIs, he averages 37.13 with a strike rate of 85.83. The southpaw opted to stay out of West Indies ongoing series against India albeit he is available for World Cup selection.
The 2019 World Cup is expected to be Gayle's last major international tournament. He would be responsible to provide a good start to the Windies. In England, Gayle has scored 953 runs at an average of 39.71. Windies would be dependent on Chris Gayle to get off to a good start.
SRI LANKA - ANGELO MATHEWS
Angelo Mathews, one of the unluckiest cricketers to have taken the field. Mathews emerged on the international scene in 2008, he is a handy all-rounder who can bowl medium pace and can bat anywhere in the middle order but injuries have troubled the former Sri Lankan Captain off late.
Currently, Mathews is not a part of Sri Lanka's squad but he is one of the most important players for the Island nation. The 31-year-old has featured in 203 ODIs in which he has scored 5380 runs at an average of 42.36. He has also picked up 114 wickets in ODIs. He can swing the ball in English conditions and can play the anchor's and finisher's role with the bat.
Mathews has scored 599 runs in England, he averages 54.45 with the bat in those conditions. He can be the all-rounder Sri Lanka needs to be contenders for the World Cup. The Asian side has had a horrible time in the last two years, in order to turn it around they need Angelo Mathews to fire from all cylinders.
SOUTH AFRICA - IMRAN TAHIR
Recently, South Africa was taken aback by the sudden retirement of their star batsman, AB de Villiers. Despite AB's retirement, the Protean fans have something to cheer about. The South African side is currently on a tour down under, the South African bowling line-up is heavily equipped with bowlers. Their bowling line-up consists of bowlers like Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Lungi Ngidi and Imran Tahir.
On the back of their fantastic bowling, South Africa can reach a long way in the tournament next year. Protean leg-spinner Imran Tahir can prove to be a match winner for the rainbow nation. Tahir has scalped 151 wickets in 89 ODIs. In England, the 39-year-old has played 4 matches in which he has only picked up 5 wickets. He would look to better his statistics when he takes the field in England next year.
Tahir will have the job of restricting the opposition in the middle overs of the innings. He will be South Africa's main man in England. The Proteas will face hosts England on May 30 to begin their World Cup campaign.

Theft of 336-sovereign gold jewels:
Lankan nabbed in India
Indian police recovered 336 sovereigns of gold chains and solved seven major burglaries with the arrest of a Sri Lankan refugee, P. Sivarajan, 41, of Anaiyur, India.
Indias Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham said on Thursday that three special teams were formed.
Major burglaries that led to the theft of over 450 sovereigns of gold jewels were reported in S.S. Colony police station limits alone in the last 11 months.
The police were able to get some images of the burglar through closed television camera networks.
Inspector of Police (Crime- S.S. Colony) M. Arunachalam, said the images were shared with other teams and one of their men found Sivarajans photograph matching them.
During a vehicle check, the police identified him and tried to stop the two-wheeler he was riding. But he managed to escape. However, the police had more clues with the registration number of the vehicle.
On November 4, he was caught at 1 a.m. during another vehicle check at Karimedu. There were about 60 burglary cases against him in 1990s after he reached India from Sri Lanka as a refugee. He was in jail in 2007-08. Later, he started to sell fish on the roadside and after he made some profits, set up his own shop, the Inspector said.
However, when he wanted to expand his business, he ran short of money. His friend Ravi alias Bullet Ravi, 58, of Villapuram had advised him to get back to burglaries to make quick money.
He wanted Sivarajan not to have any partners and strike locked houses alone, the Inspector said.
Sivarajan would go around areas along Dindigul Bypass Road and look out for locked houses. This, he used to do during late night when he comes out to buy fish at the Karimedu market.
As the market opens for business after midnight, he will venture out an hour early and look for locked houses, Arunachalam said.
Before going back to the market, he had struck seven houses and made a good fortune.
He carried simple tools such as screw drivers and rods in his motorcycle.
The burgled jewels were handed over to Ravi, who used to sell them or pledge them for Sivarajan.

England thrash Sri Lanka by 211 runs to take 1-0 lead in series:
Legend Herath bows out on a losing note
GALLE, Friday  All good things must come to an end and so it was with Rangana Herath, the greatest left-arm spinner Test cricket has produced who ended his 19-year international career at the end of the first cricket Test against England at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
The match did not end the way Herath would have liked - with a win for Sri Lanka, but it was the reverse of what happened. England trounced Sri Lanka by 211 runs inside four days to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
It was Englands biggest win over Sri Lanka since beating them at Lords by 137 runs in 1991, their first overseas win in 14 Tests since beating Bangladesh at Chittagong in 2016 and their first at Galle.
The entire Lankan team would be ashamed of themselves that they could not send a man who had bowled his country to innumerable number of victories on a high - with a win in his final Test match.
Nevertheless Herath was given a big send-off with his wife and two kids present on the podium where he received a commemorative coin, a couple of trophies and a shirt in appreciation of his services to Sri Lanka cricket. Herath took time at the end of the presentation to walk around the ground and thank his fans who have been supportive of him throughout his career. No doubt he was a great servant of the game, a humble cricketer and a gentleman to his finger tips.
Herath ended his career with a tally of 433 wickets (avg. 28.07) from 93 Tests finishing eighth in the all-time list equal with England fast bowler Stuart Broad who has played in 123 Tests.
The match ended when Herath in his final Test innings was run out for five and Sri Lanka chasing a daunting target of 462 folded up for 250.
It was another dispirited and spineless display of batting that saw Sri Lanka lose the Test. There was a lack of discipline and the shots the batsmen got out to, to say the least was appalling.
The top five batters had no excuse for the way they gifted their wickets to the England spinners who were made to look unplayable on a surface that was not doing much to cause any discomfort. All what was needed was for the batsmen to knuckle down and play a dogged innings to which none of the batsmen showed any capabilities of doing. The batters lacked tenacity to fight it out in the middle and gifted their wickets to strokes they would regret watching on replays. The second innings batting replicated their first innings when they were dismissed for 203.
An opening partnership of 50 was the best Sri Lanka could offer when a stand three times as much was needed. The top five batters all got starts but none managed to convert them into big ones as Player of the Match Ben Foakes and Keaton Jennings had done for England.
Sri Lanka were of course handicapped by the groin strain suffered by the captain Dinesh Chandimal who showed that he was clearly in discomfort when he could not stretch far enough to get to the pitch of the ball from Jack Leach and had his stumps rattled for one. It will be a big blow for Sri Lanka if they are to lose him for the rest of the series.
Angelo Mathews returning to the national team after being dropped for the ODI series on fitness grounds made twin half-centuries but that was not sufficient for a player of his experience and calibre when a big innings from him was required. Kusal Mendis reminds one of Aravinda de Silvas early days. Just as when he seemed to be on top of the bowling he threw away his wicket trying to be too extravagant.
Of the 19 Sri Lankan wickets that fell to bowlers only two were claimed by the quicks Anderson and Curran the rest were consumed by the three England spinners Jack Leach, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali who ended up with match figures of 8 for 137.
The day was enlivened by an English streaker running across the ground as soon as England had won. The second Test starts at Pallekele on November 14.

A new dawn for North and East
While the protracted conflict affected people in all parts of Sri Lanka, it was the North and the East that suffered the most. This was more or less the theatre of war for 30 long years, until the war ended in May 2009. The North and the East remain among the least developed regions in the country, though vast strides have been taken in the last 10 years in terms of social welfare and infrastructure development.
President Maithripala Sirisena, himself hailing from the North Central Province where some of the villages came under frequent attack by the LTTE, understands this situation rather well. Hence his decision to appoint a Presidential Task Force with the objective of expediting development activities which were deterred by the protracted conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in order to uplift the living standards of the people in these two provinces.
With the latest political developments, the President will have the fullest support for his mission from the leader credited with ending the conflict  none other than Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who as President initiated many development programmes in both provinces after 2009 including the reconstruction of the Northern Railway line and the road network. It is also heartening to note that the TNA has pledged its fullest support to these endeavours despite certain policy differences.
Appointing a Task Force is certainly not the end of the matter. As an astute leader, the President knows all too well that constant monitoring is essential to get the work done. This is why he regularly meets the multitude of task forces which have been assigned different tasks. It is in this vein that he met the Presidential Task Force on Northern and Eastern Province Development this week to review its accomplishments during the last two months. This Special Presidential Task Force will look into the development activities now in progress in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and plan new projects to be implemented in these two provinces.
Lauding the work done so far, the President invited all parties to join hands with the Task Force to continue its programmes. The President said he is determined to fast track this programme in these two provinces and all parties should carry out their responsibilities by joining this programme.
As the President clarified, the authorities have eschewed the usual top-down approach to development (where decisions are made in AC rooms in Colombo sans peoples participation) in this instance. Instead, the planners are listening to the people and getting an idea of what their priorities are. Thus all new projects in the two provinces are being implemented based on priorities and feedback of the people living in these two provinces. For example, special focus was laid upon the provision of potable water to the people in the two drought-hit provinces.
While infrastructure development in the two provinces is vital and must go ahead at a faster pace, it is even more important to address the psychological wounds of war. To its credit, the Government has rehabilitated nearly 11,000 former LTTE cadres who are now engaged in vocations that benefit the society. De-mining is mostly complete and many families have since resettled in their own lands. Many of them have gone back to their previous livelihoods such as fishing and agriculture.
It was also revealed at the Task Force that the releasing of the lands occupied by the Security Forces in the North and East is in its final stage. They have reviewed the progress of the programme of releasing these lands by end of December 31 as directed by President Maithripala Sirisena. It was disclosed that 79 per cent of government lands occupied by the Security Forces have been released to the relevant state agencies while 90.2 per cent of private lands held by the Security Forces in these two provinces have been released. These released lands included areas of religious, economical and educational importance in these two provinces. This is a noteworthy achievement and we hope that the release of the remaining lands will be expedited in line with the Presidents directive.
The Task Force has also discussed widening the scope of opportunities available to local and foreign investors in the two provinces. Now that the two provinces infrastructure facilities are almost on par with the other provinces, more investors can be directed to the region to set up their ventures. The Government should also encourage the Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SME) in the two provinces.
Despite the advent of peace, many foreign tourists are still somewhat reluctant to visit the North, though the East is doing rather well from a tourism perspective with destinations such as Trincomalee and Arugam Bay. The Governments new tourism promotion campaigns should focus more on the North to get more tourists to visit the area.
The North and the East have the potential to make a major contribution to the countrys economy. The people in both provinces are resilient and determined to make up for lost time. The authorities should lose no time in granting their fervent wish.

November 6, 2003  when a golf course helped to repair a Test match pitch
The West Indies team led by Brian Lara toured Africa in 2003/04 for full-length bilateral series against Zimbabwe and South Africa. Windies first faced Zimbabwe in two-match Test series which was followed by a five ODIs. The hosts elected to bat in the first Test hosted by Harare that began on November 4th. Zimbabwe were three down for 58 and were further 154/5 into the second session. Middle-order batsmen showed some fight as Craig Wishart and Stuart Matsikenyeri scored 47 and 57 respectively.
Tatenda Taibus unbeaten 75 helped Zimbabwe to finish the first day on 284/6. He added only ten runs to his overnight total before getting out but skipper Heath Streak (127*) handled the Windies bowlers along with Andy Blignaut (91). The pair added 168 for the 8th wicket to help Zimbabwe finish on 507/7. West Indies ended the day on 11/0 before 36 minutes were lost due to bad light. The third days play was set to begin half an hour early (9:30 am local time) to make up for the lost time on the 2nd day.
HOLE IN THE PITCH
The players were warming up just before the scheduled start while the ground staff were rolling the pitch. During this time, Zimbabwes Trevor Gripper hit a practice ball straight on to the pitch where the roller was doing its job. The operator rolled it over the ball that produced a dent in the pitch. The hole was about an inch deep at short of a length to a left-hander from the City (southern) end of the ground.
The dent could be dangerous as the ball pitching on it could fly anywhere. Fortunately for the ground staff, there was the Royal Harare Golf Club adjoining the ground. They borrowed an auger from the golf course to replace the damaged portion on the pitch. Robin Brown, the HSC groundsman and a former Zimbabwe opener was in charge of operations.
He first tried to replace the dent with the portion of the pitch behind the stumps as it will be hard and drier than anything from the golf course. The process turned out to be successful and cleaned up the area to make the pitch look like how it was at first place. After an inspection, the match referee Gundappa Viswanath gave the green signal for the play so did the West Indian captain Brian Lara. The play on the third day began 121 minutes after the scheduled start of play.
A THRILLING FINISH
Wavell Hinds and Daren Ganga made 79 and 73 respectively as Windies moved well at 179/2. However, a six-wicket haul for Ray Price saw the Caribbean side collapse to 335 and concede a 172-run first innings lead. Zimbabwe made efforts to score quickly as they were reduced to 94/4 by end of the fourth days play. They added 106 runs in the 21 overs on the final day morning to set a target of 372 in 83 overs for the visiting side.
Price once again troubled the West Indians who were three down for 38 in 15 overs. They were further reduced to 103/5 with another 44.2 overs left in the game. Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ridley Jacobs added 68 runs for the 6th wicket but more importantly, the duo batted out 20.5 overs. Chanderpaul was dismissed on 39 and three more wickets followed him. The Windies stood at 204/9 with another 11.5 overs to go.
Jacobs, with an unbeaten 60 off 139 deliveries, stood 181 minutes at the crease to save the Test with the No.11 Fidel Edwards who faced 32 balls for his one run. After holding on a thrilling draw, the Windies sealed the Test series by defeating the hosts in the final Test in Bulawayo by 128 runs.
The five-match ODI series was also a closely contested one which was also won by the visiting side. In the series decider, Chris Gayle struck an unbeaten 75-ball 112 after claiming a four-wicket haul.

Over 113 MPs will support government - SB
Highways and Road Development Minister S. B. Dissanayake said he is confident securing the support of over 113 MPs before Parliament reconvenes on November 14.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department yesterday after assuming duties as the Chief Government Whip.
The minister, observing that they already have the support of 104 MPs, said the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress led by Rauf Hakeem and All Ceylon Makkal Congress led by Rishad Bathiudeen will support them.
Though MP Manusha Nanayakkara joined the UNP, we will win him back. We are in talks with him. The UNP has the support of only 98 MPs. We could easily get the support of another three UNP MPs, but we held back because there was opposition from our party. We believe that the JVP and the TNA will not vote in favour of the UNP, he said.
The Minister said there is no law to say that a vote to prove Parliamentary majority is compulsory when Parliament reconvenes. If Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is so keen on knowing who commands the majority, we can line up our MPs near the Speakers Office in Parliament. However, we will not let him flout the Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions in the main chamber on November 14, he said.
He said the UPFA would create a broad alliance to contest future elections.
He said the Parliamentary Elections would come only after September 2020 an d the Provincial Council Elections and Presidential Elections would precede the General Elections.
The Minister said the forming of new Government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister was a fulfillment of the peoples aspirations as visible on February 10 Local Government polls. He said the country has no constitutional crisis.

People should uphold my decision - PM
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that the people should be given an opportunity to uphold his decision to change the present political scenario.
I believe that my decision to change the present political scenario should be tried in the court of the people. They should decide whether my decision is right or wrong, the Prime Minister added.
He said that his government will receive an impetus to reverse the countrys course from anarchy, if people approve his decision to change the present political setting.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the book launch titled Sri Lanka Arthikaye Thewasarak Pragathiya Saha Agathiya authored by International Trade and Investment Promotion Minister Bandula Gunawardena at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute yesterday.
He said that he was called upon to accept the country at this crucial juncture as the country was heading towards anarchy and the countrys assets were being sold for a song. There wont be a country, if I refused this proposal and excised restraint, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister added that the countrys assets would have been sold for a song to foreign countries, if he had waited without accepting this proposal to take over the country.
President of Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna Professor G L Peiris and Minister Bandula Gunawardena were present.

## Title: Political re-convergence a boost for Russia-Sri Lanka ties

Political re-convergence a boost for Russia-Sri Lanka ties
The political development in Sri Lanka is a re-convergence of our President Maithripala Sirisena and the new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. This is a re-convergence of the broadest political forces which among other things have the same strong friendly views towards the Russian Federation and the President of Russia. And those who have been displaced are those who have residues of Russophobia and Sinophobia, said Sri Lankas Ambassador to Russia Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka addressing Russian officials in Moscow.
He was briefing them about the political changes in Sri Lanka.
The text of Ambassador Jayatillekas speech:
I am honoured to represent my country in the Russian Federation at this point of the worlds history, and may I assure that the sentiments of the people of Sri Lanka stand with you in this complicated moment in global politics and world affairs. It will be a mistake from my part, if I do not speak a few words about the complex situation in Sri Lanka, which you may be curious about, and even may be concerned about.
It is not difficult to understand what is happening today in Sri Lanka if you look at it from the point of view of your own experience and the experience of the world at least from the 1990s onwards. From your own experience you know that there were certain tendencies that prevailed in Russia in the 1990s, which were going in a certain direction but the Russian people decided to make a course correction and to return to the path that is mostly suited to the national and the state interests of Russia.
We have been going through a similar experience ourselves. And now there is a moment of political complexity, even political tension, political struggle between these two tendencies that you experienced in the 1990s and at the dawn of the twenty first century. We are seeing in Sri Lanka today certain efforts on the part of certain players, which remind us of what happened during the so-called coloured revolutions, and the so-called Arab Spring.
Policy prescriptions
And we are unhappy at some of the voices we hear from our friends in certain parts of the world because there are very clear policy prescriptions made from certain capitals of the world. There are some who actually have media conferences, way across the oceans and tell us, tell our elected President, what he should do and when he should do it. But since we live in the time where there are voices which tell your President what should be done in your country, we are not surprised that there are those who try to tell us and our elected President what we should do in our country. These are the same voices. Sri Lanka will not allow itself to be drawn in to an attempt to retain a declining global hegemony.
We hear voices of our friends saying that the views of the elected representatives should be heard but these voices forget that the highest elected representative in our country is the executive President who would be elected by the country as a whole and can take the office if he or she has over fifty percent of the vote.
The President visited Russia last year and had a very successful meeting with President Putin, whom he had made it publically known was his favourite world leader. I must acknowledge the role of my predecessor Dr. Saman Weerasinghe, who is with us this evening and who made that meeting possible, and it was a success.
Move forward
I must also make a fundamental point that this re-allying is actually the re-convergence of our President and the new Prime-Minister. This re-convergence is the re-convergence of the broadest political forces which among other things have the same strong friendly views towards the Russian Federation and the President of Russia. And those who have been displaced are those who have residues of Russophobia and Sinophobia.
I am very convinced that anything that has been retarding the pace of our agreements and bilateral cooperation will now be removed, and once this crisis is settled, we can move forward in accordance with agreements we have signed at a much faster pace, and with greater political cohesion. We are very grateful as a people, and a state, that the Russian Federation at this moment, and any other moments, has never told us what to do in our own country. Russia always respected us, and helped us protect our national independence, our national sovereignty, our territorial integrity, and our unity.
At one level this evening gathering is conventional, traditional event which the first presentation I am hosting since the presentation of the credentials to President Putin. But we decided very clearly to have this event on November 7 for a very specific reason. The reason is that whatever is ones ideological orientation and sympathy may be, history cannot be forgotten. And we, in Sri Lanka, are deeply grateful to Russia for more reasons than one. Those friends of mine, who are here today, and who served in Sri Lanka, would know the emotional ground with which Russia is regarded in my country.
Russian contribution
I served as Ambassador in France, and France is quite rightly proud of its contribution to human thought. But as a political scientist by training, I know that Russia has contributed a great diversity of ideas in every field related to human thought. And this contribution has not been purely ideological, purely intellectual; the Russian contribution has been translating its contribution into action. And November 7 is one of the most important days in the modern human history, so that is the reason why we have chosen to have this celebration here.
The contribution of Russia, which we in Sri Lanka recognize, was far before and beyond November 7, 1917. We are very conscious that if not for the major predominant role played by Russia and the Red Army in defeating the fascism, countries such as ours, would not have achieved independence through the weakening and the collapse of the old colonial order. Few peoples of the world, few nations have contributed so much to humanity in the impact beyond their borders, as has Russia. This is why we shall always be grateful to Russia.
Im particularly proud and happy to be here this time for another reason. Apart from Russias contribution in terms of ideology and in terms of affecting the worlds history, there is at least one, if not more, area of the contribution (and I do not speak about science and technology because it is not a lecture), but in terms of the role of individual leaders in the worlds history, youve made a great contribution. For my generation and preceding generations of my father, my grandfather, Russia is identified with at least two great leaders. And now, we in the Global South, and humanity in general, are thankful that you, the Russian people, have chosen the third such leader.

President should dissolve Parliament: Gammanpila
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila said yesterday the President should dissolve Parliament using the powers vested with him under 33 (2) C of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the PHU office.
Gammanpila said the dissolution of Parliament is the only solution for the crisis created by Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya.
'The Speaker says he cannot accept the Prime Minister appointed by the Executive as the head of the Legislature and he can only accept the former Prime Minister as the head of the legislature. It means that there now is a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature on the appointment of the Prime Minister,' he said.
Only the general public holding the sovereign power and who voted for two parties to come into power can resolve this issue. So Parliament should be dissolved and the authority to decide the Prime Minister should be given to the people of the country, the MP said.
The 19th Amendment brought in 2002 sought to remove the powers of President to dissolve Parliament and make provisions that the President can dissolve Parliament only on the basis of a resolution passed with a simple majority in Parliament. But this was challenged in the Supreme Court by several petitioners and the Supreme Court gave a ruling that it should be approved by a two thirds majority in Parliament and approved by the people in a referendum.
The Article 70 of the Constitution says the President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of members, he said.
He said that when amending Article 70, the section 33 (2) C was introduced in the 19th Amendment in 2015 in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court and added that the prevailing provision of the Constitution was 33 (2) C. According to that, In addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or imposed on, or assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written laws, the President shall have the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.
The MP said that there should be a reason for mentioning Presidents powers to dissolve Parliament in two places of the constitution. So the Article 70(1) shows how a President should act in a general situation and generally the President cannot dissolve Parliament without a two third majority. But the Article 32(2)C shows how the President should act when there is crisis and in such situation, the President has powers to dissolve Parliament.

Alleged misappropriation of public property, vehicles:
Rajitha gives up official vehicles, but dissuades others
Convener of the Truth Seekers Movement and Attorney-at-Law Premnath C. Dolawatta yesterday lodged a complaint at Police Headquarters against ministers of the former regime for the alleged misuse of official vehicles and properties under their purview. So far, only former Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had given up his official vehicle conceding to the fact that he was no longer a minister.
According to Dolawatta, the complaint was lodged over the misuse of the government properties including the luxury vehicles which are still being used by many former ministers.
He emphasised that the misuse of government owned vehicles by the former Ministers were reported daily in print and electronic media outlets.
The Convener of the Truth Seekers Movement said that the continued use of such vehicles and occupying office held by these former ministers was a serious offense under Section 386 and 388 of the Penal code of Sri Lanka.
This is also a violation of the Public Properties Act. He advised that drivers those who were still working under former ministers should hand over the government vehicles to the relevant ministries.
It is learnt that the former Minister of the Yahapalana government Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had already handed over all the vehicles which was issued to him when he was in power.
The Convener of the Truth Seekers Association further said that by handing over these vehicles to the relevant ministry, former Minister Rajitha Senaratne is conceding to the fact that they are no longer in power. Yet Dolwatta said that the former Minister was dissuading other ministers from handing over their official vehicles or from giving up office at these government offices.
He added that by lodging this complaint, he expects that the former Ministers those who were allegedly involved in misappropriation of vehicles and public property, will be severely dealt with according to the law.

Singapore FTA will be revised : Bandula
The Free Trade Agreement with Singapore would not be hastily abolished, but would be revised to prevent any harmful impact on local entrepreneurs, International Trade and Investment Promotion Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department yesterday, after assuming duties in his Ministry.
He said the report of the five-member Committee headed by Colombo Universityformer Vice Chancellor and Emeritus Professor of EconomicsW.D.Lakshman, is expected within another week. We will consider this report and the Supreme Court judgment on it.
After consulting the opinions of experts, I will present a Cabinet Paper to revise the FTA with Singapore, he said.
He noted that he had asked his Ministry Secretary to seek a report from the Customs Director General on the current status of lifting import duties on over 4,000 items listed in the FTA.
He added that the FTAs with Thailand, Bangladesh and China, which had already been prepared, would be subject to a careful study prior to inking them.
Outlining his future plans in his new ministerial portfolio, he stressed that his approach would be entirely different to that of his predecessor Malik Samarawickrama, adding that local producers would be given prominence over foreign investors.
However, he said that none of the on-going projects would be suspended in haste, adding that the new Government would not act in an arbitrary manner as the previous Government did when they suspended the Colombo Port City.
He said that he would propose an investment promotion package to private sector local and foreign investors to protect them and to provide them special incentives. He said this package would be available to those who invest in projects approved by the Finance Ministry. He said this budgetary proposal would provide unprecedented incentives to local producers.
He also came up with the proposal to set up 5,000 export processing villages to boost exports within a short period. Agriculture and industrial products with a permanent market would be processed in these villages. Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia follow such a system and a similar effort was made by former Trade Minister Lalith Athulathmudali, he explained.
He also said that certain imports would be regulated, adding that the tax policy would also be revised. He said close ties would be maintained with India, China, the US and Korea.

TNA should be neutral
Tamil National Peoples Front Leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam yesterday urged the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to be neutral without being partisan to either side for the sake of Tamil people in the North and the East.
He said the present developments taking place in the country is part of a geopolitical scenario and the TNA should not get into this tangle.
Ponnambalam was of the view that the TNA should not think of the benefits of the party hierarchy when a decision is taken with regard to the present situation in the country.
The TNA should not focus on the retaining of the Opposition Leader post or security given to TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran at this stage. They should think of their community and their well being, he said.
He added that the Tamil National Alliance made many pledges to the people in the North and East during the last Presidential and Parliamentary elections but the party failed to deliver them.
Ponnambalam added that the Tamil people in these provinces will not support the TNA at future elections as they failed to keep the promises given to the people.
The people in these provinces were stranded at the hands of the TNA and the Tamil people should not be drawn into this muddle which is a result of geopolitical scenario, he added.
He added that the TNA must be neutral at this juncture, if it actually wants to solve the burning issues of the Tamil people. Being partisan to either side will not help the Tamil people but a few members of the TNA hierarchy.

## Title: US Divided: Democrats win Congress, Trump keeps Senate

US Divided: Democrats win Congress, Trump keeps Senate
Change has come to American politics and governance. The midterm election this week gave the Democrats a majority in the Congress, while the Trump led Republicans retained control of the Senate. The midterm election held two years after Donald Trumps election as US President, is considered a referendum of President Trumps governance in the past two years, and did show a turn of the public against President Trump, in what was a very divisive election in the United States.
The new challenge to Donald Trump comes from the Democrats controlling the Congress, which is a major change from when the Republicans controlled both the Congress and the Senate since Trump won the presidency in 2016. The results and the big rise in the number of voters in a midterm have shown the Americans using the ballot box to express their democratic opposition to the Trump presidency.
The Democrats can now question and object to the legislative plans of President Trump, with many questions being raised on the Republican policies on economic affairs, money bills, and seek better medical facilities to the people.
However, by retaining control of the Senate, getting a few more seats there, President Trump will have the facilities to appoint new judges to the Supreme Court, a matter which certainly influenced the poll after the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh as a member of the Supreme Court.
Despite the large Democratic gains, President Trump remained proud at the record of the poll, especially of the Republicans having control of the Senate. Most Republican candidates to the Senate who were openly supported by President Trump won the race. In one of the most divisive polls in the country, the message of Trump on racism, anti-immigration, and what is being seen as white nationalism has stressed importance in the American thinking. This is cause for great satisfaction to President Trump, who saw his supporters remain with him, and a sharp increase in supporters of Trump policies.
It is significant that Trump did not campaign on the success of his economic policies. He was silent on the rise of the economy, the increase of the employment with a continuing fall of unemployment, which would be very encouraging to the average US voters. Instead, he campaigned on racism, anti-immigration, and the overall right wing policies that were opposed to the policies of his predecessor in office, President Barack Obama.
Womens role
The role of women in the politics in the US has made significant progress with at least 100 women being elected to the member House of Representatives. The Democrat control of the House will lead to checks and balances on the policies of the Republican Presidency, and more constitutional controls on presidential actions. A record number of women were elected to Congress as an unprecedented number of female candidates ran for the first time, marking an all-time high for the number of women in the legislatures.
The poll saw the election of the youngest woman, two Muslim women and two Native American women to the Congress. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29 years, the youngest elected to US Congress, is one of the biggest stars in this election. She describes herself as a democratic socialist, she defeated a long-time Democratic Representative in the party primaries. She won the race to the New York Congressional District with over 75 percent of the vote.
Another significant win for women and the Democrats was 36-year-old Ilhan Omar, a Muslim refugee born in Somalia, grew up partly in Dadaab, one of the worlds largest refugee camps in Kenya, and then moved to the US with her family, when aged 14, in 1995. The mother of three, who was elected to the State Legislature in Minnesota in 2016, and then ran for the Congress from the Democratic Party. This will be the first African-American Muslim refugee woman to be elected to the Congress.
The other Muslim woman elected to Congress is the Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib, endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, a rising left-wing group that also includes the youngest women elected from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Another big change was the election of two Native American women to the Congress. A political novice Sharice Davids, is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, won from Kansas and would be the States first Native American Congresswomen. She is also the first LGBT congressional representative.
Another Native American to win, also Democrat, is Donna Shalala from Florida. A former Health and Human Services secretary in the Clinton Administration, stood on a platform for common-sense gun reform, support for higher education, environmental protection and affordable healthcare. Her strong campaigning said that, until every child has a fair shot at a higher education and unless this heartless administration is held accountable for their numerous injustices, we will not stop.
President remains strong
President Donald Trump remained strong with the Republican control of the Senate, and gaining more seats too, although Democrats won control of the Congress. He was clear that the midterm election was a referendum on the record of his work. He has said that his name is on the ballot, to show how much the election is based on his policies. He took credit for the victory of the Republicans who he supported, and mocked those who lost for not taking his support by stating they refused his embrace. The Republican winnings were largely in white areas, helping fuelling in the divisive campaign, which sees America sharply divided on race, religion and immigrant people.
He was hugely involved in the poll campaign, and in the last two weeks went to the campaign rallies of a few candidates who were supportive of his policies, and many of them won re-election to the Senate. Trump ignored the success of his economic policies in the past two years and instead pushed the fearful message about immigrants, in keeping with his agenda in the presidential campaign. He made repeated warning of the would be refugees coming in what is called a caravan approaching the US from South America, coming from Honduras, San Salvador, Nicaragua coming through Mexico.
Trump gave emphasis on what was called migrant invasion, warning people that the bedraggled caravan of asylum seekers is a coming invasion, and ordered US troops to the US-Mexico border. His comments were often nakedly racist, and also sought to frighten voters on future threats to security. A significant slogan by Trump in his campaign was If you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow.
He also showed little concern about the toxic effect of his continued rhetoric in the campaign, which many critics say fuelled the recent parcel bomb attacks that were directed at leading Democrats, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former vice president and the CNN TV service, and philanthropist Michael Soros. It is significant that during this increasingly heated campaign that a Jewish Synagogue in Pittsburgh was attacked by a man using guns, killing 11 Jewish persons. He also said of the need to abolish the birth right citizenship, where children of foreigners who are born in the US are entitled to citizen under the Constitution.
President Trumps feeling of success, and his understanding of a new tough approach in politics and approach to the public was seen in the Press Conference he gave at the White House, after the poll results were coming in. He was boastful of the victory in the Senate, especially in the States where he campaigned. His anger in the political developments was clearly displayed in the manner in which he verbally attacked the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who asked some questions, by repeatedly and forcefully asking him to sit down, and give up his microphone. After that open and ugly clash as a meeting with the media, the White House pass of this correspondent has also been withdrawn. The White House reporters have already condemned the decision to bar Acosta from the White House.
Another important result of the middy-term election is the removal of the US Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who was one of the first key personalities to support Trump in his presidential campaign, the questions raised by the removal of the Attorney General is what action the President would take to possibly stop the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, on alleged Russian action to support Donald Trump in his presidential poll.
It is a largely divided America that will be active after this election, with major changes taking place in the increased participation of the people in midterm voting.
It will also see the impact of the new role of women, especially educated women, in the politics of the US, as well as the increased role of the racial minorities, Black Americans, Latin Americans and Asian Americans in the politics and governance of the country. Donald Trump remains President, and has already stated his decision to run for the presidency in 2020, with the same Vice President, Mike Pence. The American politics will be of increased interest globally in the coming weeks and months.

We are hoping to build on Galle win - Root
GALLE, Friday - Englands victorious captain Joe Root said that his team will want to build on their victory at Galle and there was still room for improvement.
Its not just us, like were the only side that struggles away from home. Its very difficult to win Test matches abroad now. I think that makes it even sweeter when you do come to a very difficult venue, like Galle, and manage to win games. Hopefully we can build on this and its not just a one-off for us. We can go to Kandy with huge amounts of confidence and look to still improve and get better, said Root.
The win was very special. We played some really good stuff. We were consistent throughout the four days. That partnership between Jos and Foakesy was vital after lunch and from that point on we were pretty much in control of things. We said we were going to do things slightly differently at the start of the series and weve really backed that up and given ourselves a really good chance to go to Kandy with a lot of confidence, he said.
We had some clear plans about the way we were going to approach this game in particular on this surface. To see them work, to see the hard work leading into the game pay off, is great. The way we played in the summer was a sign of this team moving forward and weve really backed that up in this performance. The challenge will be to be really consistent. - ST

We didnt play smart cricket  coach Hathurusingha
GALLE, Friday  Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha put down Sri Lankas defeat by 211 runs to England in the first cricket Test at the Galle International Stadium to his team not playing smart cricket.
It is very disappointing the way we got out. Getting out to the traps they set. They need to understand how they are going to get you out and then bat accordingly. It is not that you are given a free license to play shots regardless of the situation. You need to understand that, said Hathurusingha at the post-match press conference.
When you play Test cricket you need to understand how people are going to get you out even in club cricket. You cannot come to international cricket and learn that. I have not seen that before. This tenure I am seeing it. Prior to this people were more intelligent. If you are playing against turn and getting out it is sad. The opposition looks like they are playing with school kids, he said.
Hathurusingha said that where everything went wrong for Sri Lanka was in the first session of the opening day when England were five down for 113.
If you look at the first day, until lunch we were top of the game having taken five wickets for 100. But after that, the way they batted, they took the game away from us. From thereon we were chasing the game. In Test cricket, especially on wickets like these, it is very difficult to comeback. Our first innings batting was poor.
They outplayed us in all three departments of the game, said Hathurusingha.
The pitch I agree was a not the traditional Galle wicket. We cannot blame anyone. It is the weather. Wickets like this the toss plays a big part. We expect the wicket here usually to turn from day one and little bit quicker. This is very slow turn. A bit disappointing but you cannot put the blame on the pitch. We didnt play well.
CHANDIMAL DOUBTFUL
Giving an update on Dinesh Chandimals groin strain Hathurusingha said that if was a grade one and it will take 10 to 14 days. It will be touch and go for the second Test match. The danger for us is that if he is not 100 percent fit, he may not play. We have to look at a replacement or standby player for him.
KUMARAS SUSPENSION DISAPPOINTING
Hathurusingha said that fast bowler Lahiru Kumaras suspension for the entire Test series two days before the start of the first Test was disappointing and certainly a distraction.
This is not the first time. It has happened in the past. I dont think they have taken any action. At least now a leadership group is taking action and standing up for that. Its not me. The team leadership group took the decision, said Hathurusingha.
They are not going to tolerate moving forward whether it is going to affect us or not. We are going to control things that we can control. Everyone is going to behave in certain ways. Performances can go up and down.
The behaviour you can control. It is disappointing two days prior to the Test match. We expect higher standards if you are playing for Sri Lanka and they know that.

## Title: Why is Sri Lankas 7s mens rugby on the decline
## Supertitle:

Why is Sri Lankas 7s mens rugby on the decline
Opinions aired by some rugby writers on the countrys status of sevens rugby is a mere ruse as they have apparently been taken for a ride by Sri Lanka Rugby officials.
When the officials without a proper analysis say that the national sevens team has peaked to the extent of winning a medal or a trophy at an international tournament, one needs to put them into correct perspective having ascertained its bona fide to ensure that the readers are not deceived. It is equally important for the officials to act responsibly and not use the media as a prey to convey a wrong message to the readers. Given below are details of the overall tally of the 3 leg Asian rugby sevens series 2018 so that the readers can have a better understanding to make their own judgement.
The rugby fraternity is disgruntled and disappointed the way the national team performed at the recently concluded Asian Rugby Series.
Firstly, Sri Lanka Rugby needs to focus on the Asian region instead of competing at top international level. Have we overestimated ourselves or not assessed the reality Sri Lanka is not competitive at international sevens due to many reasons, largely because, unlike most of the top rugby unions, we are not pertinacious in incorporating power, strength and speed into our system even to a satisfactory level.
Saw how Philippines powered their way and outplayed Sri Lanka in the scrums, rucks and on the restarts to secure the third place in the final of the recently concluded Asian Sevens legs in South Korea and Sri Lanka. The rugby history of Philippines compared to Sri Lanka was established many decades after us
Look at the manner in which Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines, South Korea and even China got the better off their smaller made opponents during contact situations. Max Denmark, the 19 year old (former Hong Kong under 19 captain and No. 8) who played on the wing hand-off Danushka Ranjan and scored twice and kept us wondering whether the tackler (Danushka Ranjan) would recover after hitting the deck so hard It was the combination of strength, power and speed altogether. Rugby Unions look for giants and the sooner Sri Lanka rugby understands that, the better it will be. Players like Omalka Gunaratne and Dinuk Amarasinghe are the true prospects. Power and strength is the emerging trend in world sevens rugby.
Did we have a professionally qualified High Performance personnel like Inthi Marikar working full time with the sevens squad with a time and action program before the Asian Games and Asian sevens series rugby tournaments held this year
We need to understand that a team cannot perform well by fielding aging players even if they have the experience given the limited breathing space and minimum time for recovery.
The score margin for and against Sri Lanka in the second half is evident that Sri Lanka is lacking in its strength and conditioning levels to withstand the entire game and the two- day tournament which includes at least three games per day and three a piece.
We also need big players like Omalka Gunaratne, Anuradha Herath, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, Shenal Dias (ex Peterite now in USA), Shehan Lema Pathirana, Dinuk Amarasinghe, Nivanka Prasad, Sajith Saranga and Jehan Seelagama to name a few.
Regret to note that some of the players in the squad did not match at least the minimum stature of the making of an international player. Sri Lanka must start looking for big players who have time for rugby and would be eager to represent the country - it should be their number one priority. The question also arises whether the present rugby authorities have plans to give enough international exposure this year to the national players. Affording such opportunities is a learning experience to perform better and this is the only way out to narrow the gap between Sri Lanka and the top teams in reaching the target.
Going back to the final scores lets see the gap on the points difference between the top two teams Japan and Hong Kong vis-a-vis the other teams. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, our points difference against the two top teams Japan and Hong Kong is between 15 to 20 points way too much. Therefore our strategy should be to narrow this gap which in turn enable us to turn tables on the other teams.
The other fact is about decision making on the field. Rugby is a complicated game where the exact positioning of players at any given time on the field can change.
Every player has to make so many decisions in a fraction of a second. But we feel our national players have the speed but very little ability to make the right decisions on the field. We saw how time and again Sri Lankas smallest players were trying to compete against the bigger opponents at this years Asian Games as well as in the Asian Sevens Series. The results were really disastrous at such times!
Sri Lankan Rugby must give the players a life, a way of making a living out of the sport. Otherwise we are in danger of losing players. A player of the caliber of Sudarshana Muthuthantri fits the spot. He has the brain and brawn and always takes the right decisions on the field.
More years of rugby is left in him and the best of his is still to come. He must be earmarked and chosen to lead the team on the longer run.
Coming back to the Asian sevens series tournaments, we feel that there is no proper structures in place, and to perform at this level has now become a Herculean task.
Just because we won the Championship in 2016, doesnt mean that we can defend the title anymore. The ground situation has changed so drastically.
To start anew, our target should be to be within the top three at the Asian rugby sevens circuit.
At the last Sevens series held in South Korea and Sri Lanka; Philippines and China won the Plate Championship, respectively. Analyzing the performances, next year, the contested by teams such as South Korea and Philippine will be vying for 3rd place while the Plate Championship would be strongly contested by teams such as UAE and China. Hence Sri Lanka can contest to secure 7th spot competing with Chinese Taipei in an 8 team participating tournament.
Rugby sevens has brought about so many opportunities that some rugby playing nations are focusing on this short format of the game because they see it as a way forward.
At present, Sri Lanka sadly lack the vision to improve their stakes on sevens rugby. This is just one side of the coin. On the other side of the coin is the rapid progress made by other teams over Sri Lanka. We just cant reverse back the clock to 2016 and compare the past with present.
The main factor which is pulling rugby to shambles at present is the very poor management mainly due to the lack of a proper system or synergy to channel the energies to take rugby to the next level.
Against the present backdrop, can Sri Lanka rugby get within the three top teams in the Asian sevens circuit Nobody can simply ignore or wait without arguing the reality that the Sri Lanka sevens rugby is faced with.
When Sri Lanka came into the cup championship finals twice against mighty Hong Kong at the 2016 Asian Rugby sevens Series - mind you in foreign soil (Hong Kong and South Korea) under previous Sri Lanka rugby boss Asanga Seneviratne and High Performance Director Inthi Marikar (who has vast, experience and knowledge about how the game is played in New Zealand) we all got carried away thinking that rugby can live in the past laurels without getting to better planning and organization.
Some dreamt of Sri Lanka going on to win the Cup, but it was not to be.
Since the brains behind stepped down in July this year our national sevens rugby team has fallen to the lowest since 2012 placing sixth in South Korea and even getting beaten by Philippines who were ranked way below us in the previous year in 6th spot, in the Plate finals.
The time is ripe for the rugby authorities to realize the impending disastrous state of affairs and put their act together to come out with a more comprehensive strategic plan to compete with Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines, China and UAE with special emphasis given to the physical stature in the selection of players.
Our focus at present on Asian rugby circuit is fading away.
Lets refocus on rugby and get ourselves to a paradise of the wise lot not fools. The truth does hurts, but it has to be told.

Kandy SC know that only a victory will keep them in the hunt for the league title for the 20th time in 24 seasons. It all points to a battle between the forwards and the halves. The Airmen will depend heavily on their forwards to deliver the goods, they have some superb forwards who are expected to dominate in the loose, they are also like to obtain a major share in the loose rucks and second phase attack. For Kandy SC it is going to be their three quarters who should pave the way, they have one of the best halves combinations. With good ball coming their way the standoff should set the line in motion at every turn as they have some speedy runners and good thinkers of the game. Dinka Peires will handle the whistle.
