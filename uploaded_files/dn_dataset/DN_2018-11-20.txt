JVP protecting Ranil Wickremesinghe
The JVP which set Parliament on fire by hurling bombs in the august assembly has created a bigger conflagration in the country by setting up political parties against each other, Government Co-Cabinet spokesman and former State Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He said the JVP was fully responsible for the turbulence experienced in Parliament today.
Speaking at a press conference at his Aniwatte residence, Rambukwella said the JVPs hand in the present political crisis was clearly evident from its boycott of Sundays party leaders meeting summoned by the President. The JVP which championed the cause of Parliamentary traditions and norms, Standing Orders, the Constitution and law and order, has breached the same norms through its present behaviour aimed to protect Ranil Wickremesinghe and his political gang, he said.

NCM against Ranil taken up after two weeks
The no confidence motion against former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was handed over on March 21 and it was taken up for the debate on April 4, which is two weeks after the date of handing over, but the no confidence motion (NCM) against current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was handed over on November 14 and the `vote was also held on November 14, 10 minutes after the motion was handed over. This very clearly shows how biased the Speaker is, doctors, medical students and their parents said.
There was no debate like the debate held for the no confidence motion presented against the former PM. No proper vote was taken, they said.
A no confidence motion was handed over against former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake on August 3, 2017, but it was not taken up for the debate until he resigned from his post.
Another no confidence motion was handed over against former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on March 24, 2016, and it was taken for the debate on June 9, 2016, which is after two-and-a-half months and not within two weeks or two minutes, they said.
A no confidence motion was handed over against the former Health Minister on August 24, 2017, but it has not been taken for the debate until now. We see a very clear act of discrimination and bias here.
We are not fools and we do not forget history in two weeks time as stated by LTTE Leader Prabhakaran, they said.

Tax on imported milk powder needed to boost local industry
Fisheries, Aquatic Resources and Rural Economy Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said a tax of Rs. 250 should be imposed on imported milk powder to promote local dairy milk farmers and the local dairy industry.
I insisted that more tax should be imposed on imported milk powder to protect dairy farmers and the local dairy industry. The tax on imported milk powder reduced to a meagre amount of two percent, he said.
The minister was addressing the Dairy Farmers Summit at Shalika grounds in Narahenpita on Friday, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. Thousands of dairy farmers representing over 2,000 dairy milk farmer societies participated.
President Maithripala Sirisena presented cheques to beneficiaries of the Social Welfare Fund of Milco company. Hundreds of farmers facing various problems are given relief through this fund established by the Milco company.
The minister said the rate given to dairy farmers produce should be increased after a tax of Rs. 250 is imposed on imported milk powder. He added that this type of measure will provide relief to dairy farmers.
A better rate should be given to dairy farmers for their products using the CESS tax, he added.
The minister added that local companies producing packeted milk power using local dairy milk should be given concessions to augment their produce.
They should be given an impetus to promote their production. Some media institutions are in the habit of promoting multinational companies producing packeted milk products and they do not want to promote local companies involved in the industry, he said.
He urged dairy farmer families not to support parties that do not recognise the services rendered by them at forthcoming elections.
Dont support any political party that fails to recognise you in their election manifestos at future elections, the minister added.
He said imported milk powder lacks nutrient components although multinational companies are highlighting their nutritional value through massive advertising campaigns using artistes, cricketers and prominent figures in society.
He said more people are using imported milk powder and this has led to increase Non-Communicable Diseases in the country.
New hospitals are being constructed and medical implements are being provided to hospitals to treat patients with NCDS, Minister Zoysa.
He added that imported milk powder contains melamine, radioactive particles and animal fat.
A former Health Ministry Secretary, who announced that imported milk powder contained melamine, later said melamine is not included in imported milk powders. However, this Secretary in question, joined a multinational company producing milk powder as an adviser after his retirement from government service, he said.
The minister commended the services rendered by Milco. He said the company has augmented its production and revenue too. Dairy milk farmers who provide fresh milk to the company are duly paid.
The farmers are well-looked after by the company. It provides guidance to milk farmers too, he said.
The company, a fully government-owned entity, collects more than 50 percent of dairy milk from farmers in the country and the companys success is entirely dependent on over 60,000 dairy milk farmers and 2,300 dairy farmer societies. The company has begun the construction of a new milk factory in Badalgama, Gampaha and operations will commence at the end of next year.
Provincial Ministers, Ministry Secretary Priyantha Mayadunne and Milco Chairman Zulfikar Cader were present.

Agriculture Ministry promotes Prickly Custard Apple
Sri Lankas first-ever cultivation zone of Prickly Custard Apple (Annona muricata) will be initiated in the Gampaha District tomorrow (21), on the instruction of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Through this programme, it is expected to promote cultivation of this fruit and deliver 200,000 saplings among farmers this year.
The Prickly Custard Apple is a healthy fruit which is capable of curing illnesses such as cancer. Therefore, farmers will be able to earn a decent income from this cultivation, Agriculture Ministry sources said.
Although it is less popular in Sri Lanka, the Prickly Custard Apple has a high demand in the international market and the local tourism industry. Annona muricata is also very popular for its ability to destroy cancer cells.
The Prickly Custard Apple also can control the LDL cholesterol level in the human body and thereby increase the HDL cholesterol level.
It has an ability to balance the heartbeat and blood pressure in the human body also. This fruit contains Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and fibre.
Considering these facts, the Agriculture Minister instructed officials to take further steps to promote this fruit and also cultivate it as an economic crop.

Answer script evaluation from December 23
Commissioner General of Examinations B. Sanath Pujitha, in a circular, stated that the evaluation of answer scripts of G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination is to commence from December 23.
About 541 coordinating centres are to be set up countrywide for the examination, Pujitha stated.
He had informed all school heads that admission cards of school candidates for G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination 2018 should be handed over to candidates without delay.
He said if school heads delay the handing over of admission cards, they are liable to face disciplinary action as they would breach the rules of the Department of Examinations.
The Department of Examinations had informed all school heads that schoolchildren sitting for the G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination from December 3 to 12 should behave decently at examination centres.
If they fail to do so or create disputes at examination centre premises, their candidatures would be cancelled and they would not be allowed to sit for public examinations thereafter held by the Examinations Department.
If candidates are found to have violated the rules and regulations of the Department of Examinations by way of committing misdeeds, malpractice and fraud, their results would be cancelled and results would not be issued to them.
School heads were informed that these instructions have to be conveyed to candidates immediately and parents too should be enlightened over the punishments imposed if students are proved to have violated the regulations.
R. M. Jayawardena, a senior head of a national school in Kurunegala, confirming these facts, added that 234 candidates who sat for the G.C.E. Examinations within the last two years faced accusations of violating rules and regulations of the Department and thereby, they were not issued their results as a punishment.

People should be aware of non-communicable diseases and the food they consume, he said.
Dr. Aslam added, we do not pay much attention to food. Due to the lack of physical exercises, people are diabetic, suffering from blood pressure, heart diseases and paralysis.
A large number of residents participated in the ayurvedic medical camp.

Cabinet approval sought to adopt National Trade Policy
International Trade and Investment Promotion Minister Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said that he would obtain Cabinet approval to adopt a National Trade Policy for the country.
He pointed out that such a trade policy will make any present or future Free Trade Agreement (FTA) including the existing Singapore- Sri Lanka FTA advantageous to the both member states.
The Minister made these statements to the media subsequent to an official meeting he had with the Government Medical Officers Association yesterday.
Speaking about the Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA, the minister said that an agreement has been signed illegally during the previous regime even when there is no a National Trade Policy in the country. By adopting a National Trade Policy, Sri Lanka would be able to reconsider the clauses and the conditions which are not friendly to the country, he added.
He said, currently, the agreement is only in English; therefore, they would print it in Sinhalese and Tamil also.
According to him, during the meeting held yesterday, the GMOA had requested him to prepare a list of persons who contributed to draft and bring this FTA, which he said is illegal.
The GMOA had requested him that those persons should be convicted as they had contributed for a national hazard.
When asked as to whether the Singapore side will agree to make changes to the agreement that has already been signed, the minister replied that they should do it.

External forces trying to create conflict - Prof. Tissa
Some external forces are behind the attempt to create a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature and bring the unpopular UNP government back to power, former Minister Prof.Tissa Vitarana charged yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing organised by the Socialist Alliance in Colombo, Prof. Vitarana said President Mithripala Sirisena had acted in accordance with the powers vested in him under the Constitution when appointing a new Prime Minister.
Prof. Vitarana explained that after the collapse of the coalition government, the President had tried to get a senior leader from the UNP as the Premier instead of Ranil Wickremesinghe and after the attempt failed, he had decided to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had wide support not only among Parliamentarians but from the people as well.
The former minister stressed that the best way out this political impasse was to hold a General Election and let the peoples sovereignty prevail.
Prof. Vitarana accused some Western nations and external forces of trying to aggravate the situation and create a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature.
He said the President had been absolutely correct when he called for a General Election and added that all Parliamentarians should support the move.
He said 6.2 million had voted for President Maithripala Sirisena and 5.8 million people had voted for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last Presidential polls and added that a government under the two strong leaders was the best way forward for the country.
Meanwhile, Socialist Alliance member Raja Collure said the UNP had no majority of their own and were depending on the JVP and the TNA for support in Parliament.
He also said that a General Election was the only way out of this political imbroglio.
Collure also criticised the behaviour of the Speaker during the recent turmoil in Parliament and added instead of protecting Parliament traditions and standing orders the Speaker had violated them.

Fertiliser subsidy to be upped to Rs. 45 bn
The expenditure incurred by the government on the fertiliser subsidy is expected to increase to Rs. 45 billion during the 2018/19 season since paddy lands coming under the plough will increase to more than 800,000 hectares, following the increased rainfall experienced recently, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.
The statement said 500,000 hectares were cultivated with paddy during the last Yala season. As all tanks and reservoirs have been filled up to 80 percent of their capacity following the recent rains, more than 850,000 hectares were being prepared for paddy cultivation this season.
Last season, 14,000 hectares of paddy land was left fallow due to irrigation and other problems. But all these lands were also been asweddumised following requests made by the Agrarian Services Department. The cultivation of subsidiary food crops such as sorghum, undu, soya beans and vegetables too in expected to increase considerably this season resulting in increased fertiliser use.
Another factor for increased fertilizer use was the reduction of fertilizer prices by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
A bundle of urea used for paddy fertiliser has been reduced to Rs. 500, a bundle of urea for subsidiary food crops has been reduced from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,000, and the price of a bundle of fertilizer mixture has been reduced to Rs. 1,100.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amraweera has promised to continue the fertilizer subsidy without interruption and offer all possible incentives to the farmer population.

A Fundamental Rights petition was yesterday filed in the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the Secretary General of Parliament and the Attorney General have no authority or power under the Constitution to summon Parliament in the absence of any order by the Supreme Court quashingthe proclamation of the President published in the Gazette dated November 9 dissolving Parliament. This petition was filed by former Parliamentarian Sarath Weerasekara through Attorney-at-Law Chandra Perera.
The petitioner named the Speaker, Secretary General of Parliament and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The petitioner further sought a declaration that Parliament cannot be re-summoned on the strengthen of the Interim Order of the Supreme Court dated November 13, 2018.
In his petition, former MP Weerasekara further sought an declaration that fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by Secretary General of Parliament and Attorney General.
The petitioner maintained that as Parliament has been dissolved by proclamation, the Interim Order staying the operation of the same cannot have the effect of the re-convening of Parliament, which continues to stand dissolved until the quashing of the said proclamation.
Therefore, summoning Parliament in disregard of the true meaning of the stay order of the Supreme Court and conducting proceedings therein as undissolved will lead to serious issues relating to the parliament.

Grim search for 1,276 missing after California wildfire
US: Authorities sifted through the charred wreckage of Californias deadliest ever wildfire on Sunday, searching for any signs of the 1,276 people now listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise.
The remains of 76 people have been recovered so far, 63 of whom have been tentatively identified pending DNA confirmation. Early on Sunday the blaze, which ignited on Nov. 8, was 60 percent contained, officials said, up from 55 percent.
Rain is forecast for the area this week, potentially helping douse the flames but raising the risk of floods and mudslides, adding to the misery of 46,000 people under evacuation orders.
Many refugees from the fire have taken up temporary residence with friends and relatives, while others have pitched tents or were camping out of their vehicles.
The death toll far surpasses the previous fatality record from a single California wildfire - 29 in the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles - and already ranks among the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century.
Eighty-seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August 1910. Minnesotas Cloquet Fire in October 1918 killed 450 people.
In Paradise, the flames moved so fast that some victims died in their cars in a chaotic evacuation as gridlock formed on the two exit routes out of town.
The Butte County Sheriffs Office said the list of the missing is compiled using information received from a special hotline, as well as emails and emergency-911 calls that came in during the first chaotic hours of the blaze.
Authorities said some of those listed likely survived but have not yet notified family or officials, either because they lack phone service or were unaware anyone was looking for them.
In Paradise, home to nearly 27,000 people before the Camp Fire struck, two forensic anthropologists for the University of Nevada, Reno, were helping firefighters on Saturday sort through the wreckage at a mobile home park for senior citizens.
Firefighters peeled back the metal sheet of a collapsed roof as the anthropologists picked up charred bone fragments, sorting them into paper bags.
Roger Fielding, chief deputy coroner with the Martin County Sheriffs Office, said each site was treated as a crime scene, with every step of recovery documented with photographs.
Our job is to pick up any items that might reflect who this person might be, he said.
Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents.
At the latest count, the Camp Fire had destroyed more than 12,700 homes and other structures, authorities said on Sunday.
Up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain is expected to fall from late Tuesday through Friday in the Sierra foothills, the National Weather Services Weather Prediction Center said.
Rain will also drop on San Francisco, helping to clear the air filled with unhealthy levels of smoke.
Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with the National Weather Services Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said the rain will be a one-two-punch.

Let saner counsel prevail
The general public no doubt would have heaved a huge sigh of relief at the news that the warring political parties had decided to allow for trouble free sittings of Parliament sessions. Political party leaders, with the exception of the JVP, on Sunday met President Maithripala Sirisena to decide on a way out of the current standoff and after some persuasion by the President had decided not to rock the boat when Parliament was to meet again yesterday, according to media reports. It is hoped that things would gradually quieten down allowing for Parliament business to proceed smoothly and without incident.
The recent incidents, as we have repeatedly been reminding in these spaces, had not only brought the Parliament into ridicule but also led to a near anarchic situation, with the country seemingly rudderless. It will certainly take a long time for Parliament, which is the fountainhead of democracy, to regain its honourable status and gain public acceptance. Not only that, the violent scenes in Parliament, which are given live coverage on television, no doubt has had a telling impact on the young with the danger that they too would think nothing of emulating their more illustrious elders in the August House of Parliament, who after all are our lawmakers. (A vernacular newspaper yesterday carried a cartoon where a group of schoolboys were doing just that). At the time of writing, Parliament sessions were yet to resume and hopefully all would go well.
President Sirisena had also prevailed on the UNP delegation to re-submit the No Confidence Motion and have it passed in the proper manner giving his assurance that he would abide by the outcome. In this connection he said although voice vote that was taken on Thursday was legitimate, on such a vital issue as a change of Government the more transparent course would be to have the vote via the electronic system or by name. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya can be of help in this respect. He should be accommodating and give a patient hearing to the voices of the Government side if he is to give the lie to accusations by the Government members of acting partially.
Of course, the President is fully justified in calling for a change in the mode of the vote which after all if for the very important business of retaining or ousting of the Government. The UNP, instead of clinging onto to the rule book, should demonstrate a degree of flexibility and accommodate the President's request. In fact both warring factions should be flexible and this is not an impossibility. Both Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and former PM Ranil Wickremesinghe are veterans and in fact the most senior politicians in Parliament today. They are well capable in leading from the front, and, if need be, reining in their more rebellious charges. The President can play the role of a neutral referee in this whole drama and be a guiding hand. He has already shown that he is keen to end the crisis by permitting the vote in an altered manner and accept the outcome. Likewise the others too should think of coming down from their high horses and getting done with the whole affair.
We say this because there is an urgent need for resolving the crisis and getting the country back on the rails. A budget has to be presented and financial allocations made for the ministries to function. Teachers, the police, military and government servants have to be paid their salaries for the ensuing month. Already work in Government departments are virtually paralyzed with no responsible officer wanting to stick his/ her neck out. Besides, the public at large are gripped by a sense of uncertainty as each passing day throws up a new development in the crisis. They are also, no doubt, seized with a sense of disgust of the breed called politicians and there is the very real prospect that polling booths at future elections being deserted. PAFFREL chief Rohana Hettiarachchi has already sounded a warning of this likelihood which if eventuate would sound a deathblow to democracy. Even Election Commissions Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya recently claimed that registration of young voters had dwindled drastically and almost pleaded with them to get themselves included into the election register. The situation is bound to have got worse now.
Hence, the importance of not letting the crisis to drag on any further. In this regard the intervention of religious leaders to resolve the current imbroglio is to be welcomed. According to media reports religious leaders, including the Ven. Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera and Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malkcolm Cardinal Ranjith have met President Sirisena and offered their patronage to end the ongoing political gridlock. His Eminence together with the Ven Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera met the President on Friday and told him to meet all parties and try to resolve the crisis and even offered to play a role in the matter. Perhaps, the calm and benign influence of religious leaders could prove to be the best antidote for healing the scars left by the bruising battles in Parliament.

Message of Prophet is oneof peace and harmony
I am pleased to give a message for National Milad-Un-Nabi Day 2018.
The Prophet Mohamed (Sal) was a messenger of the Allah to this world not only for Muslims but for all communities who lived in the world. He brought Islam to guide the people who lived in a trench of misdirection at that time.
The Prophet Mohamed (Sal) was given Islam to bring peace, harmony, brotherhood, understanding, reconciliation and the right path among the communities which lived at that time. These are the basic moral concepts of Islam.
Islam never assists any illegal activities or damages the property or economic, cultural, or historical identities of others. It is a responsibility of every Muslim to protect the dignity of other communities.
Muslims must live together with other communities peacefully in our motherland. We have to be a role model to others, only then we can build our nation as one of the best countries in the world.
If we follow Islam according to the ways prescribed in the Holy Quraan and Hatheeth of the Prophet Mohamed (Sal), we can overcome all the internal and external challenges to Islam successfully and we can develop a Global Muslim Society in the world. I pray for all to a have bright future.
M.L.A.M. HisbullahCity Planning and Water Supply Minister

Importance of Prophet Mohameds teachings, greatly felt today
The present society which is victimised by coveted interests of different parties can learn a lot from the life of the Holy Prophet Mohamed Nabi. He led a life of an ordinary man with the least requirements giving priority to practically following the teachings of the Dhamma.
It was the philosophy of life and righteousness of Mohamed Nabi that brought a fair government to the people in the Middle East where there had been tribal rivalries from which they suffered for many generations. According to the teachings of Islam, He is considered to be the last Prophet who was graced by God.
The importance of His teachings and life experience is greatly felt today when our country is facing a severe conspiracy that impedes our development for another couple of years, eroding the democratic rights, self dignity and freedom that had been achieved during the past three years. The time has arrived for us to follow His life and I take this opportunity to pay gratitude to the Muslim community that stands for a civilised and a peaceful society. I assure you that as the Government and as the United National Front we are committed to safeguard the confidence you placed in us. It gives me pleasure to wish Muslims around the world on the Holy Prophets birthday.

MPs not protected by privilege, impunity must be addressed  TISL
Transparency International Sri Lanka observed with shock and dismay, the behaviour of Members of Parliament over the past week, the organisation said in a statement yesterday.
TISL wishes to highlight that in law, Parliamentary privileges are not a cloak for criminal behaviour. TISL is also concerned by the behaviour of MPs towards law enforcement authorities on the premises of the Parliament, showcasing a pervasive culture of impunity and total disregard of the rule of law, the statement said.
TISL wishes to bring to the attention of the public and the relevant authorities, the provisions in law which enable action to be taken in such cases. Whilst the conduct of certain MPs as witnessed in Parliament on November 14, 15 and 16 amounts to blatant violations of the code of conduct adopted in April 2018, attempts to sabotage Parliamentary proceedings also constitute offences under the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.
The schedule of the Act clearly outlines that incidents of assault, threat, intimidation and disobedience, as witnessed over the past week, constitute offences under the law and are punishable by a sentence of up to two years.
TISL calls on the members of Parliament to petition the Speaker to use his statutory power to make a reference to the Attorney General on the conduct of errant MPs. It is based on this report of the Attorney General that legal proceedings can commence before the Supreme Court.
TISL feels it important to emphasise that the freedom from arrest of Parliamentarians is only applicable for what they have said and for matters brought before parliament by petition, bill, resolution, motion or otherwise. Any action of assault can give cause for legal proceedings to be initiated against a Member of Parliament.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekera said, The entire country watched with dismay as their elected representatives were reduced to acts of thuggery and intimidation. At this crucial juncture, it is imperative that all law enforcement agencies display independence and send a clear message to those who seek to disregard the law.
We are yet to see any action taken by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption regarding the complaint filed by TISL over allegations of bribery of members of parliament. We are mindful that complacency on the part of Law enforcement agencies will cause irreparable harm to public faith in the rule of law and the institutions of democracy, Obeyesekere said.
TISL calls on the President, the Speaker, the Chief Whips, party leaders and all members of Parliament to ensure that steps are taken to hold offenders to account and deter the recurrence of such behavior, the statement said.

Nation lauds Presidents move to establish order
The countrys clergy, academics, intellectuals, democrats, critics and civil organisation leaders yesterday lauded President Maithripala Sirisenas efforts at calming down the situation in Parliament after the meeting he held with leaders of political parties on Sunday.
Stabilising country is Presidents duty
Chamikara Weerasinghe
Foreign affairs analyst and critic Mohan Samaranayaka said the President had seen smooth sailing of Parliament yesterday because of his deliberations at the all-party conference held at the Presidential Secretariat with composure and patience at a time when the actions of the Speaker was under criticism.
Samaranayaka said, The President had called the leaders of United National Party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and other political parties and discussed the importance of maintaining the standards of behavior in Parliament, as well as the need to keep its traditions, the prevalence of Standing Orders and Parliamentary maxims.
He said the Speaker was absent at the meeting and added, It is not surprising that he is under pressure by more than one political party, in addition to hegemonic powers that have been breathing down his neck ever since he saw the Presidential Gazette appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.
The President may be hoping that this could give some respite to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to realise his duties. For the past few weeks he has been communicating to the world that he was taking action to stabilise the country, which is not his duty as the Speaker of Parliament but the duty of the President and the government, he said.
His duty is to ensure that the House is in order. The masses in the country are waiting to see that the Speaker will get his act together in future, he said.
However, Samaranayaka said, the UNP is unlikely to give up on their regime-change project, which they started with hegemonic powers no sooner than the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa defeated the LTTE in 2009, which involves the Tamil National Alliaces agenda to have a federal structure in the North and East by dint of a Constitutional change.

Nation should decide countrys leaders
Duminda Senarath
All Island Restaurant Owners Association Chairman Asela Sampath told the Daily News yesterday that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was misusing his powers.
He added that the countrys economy had crashed due the former Premiers unethical behaviour. People were amused by the conduct of Leader of the House, Karu Jayasuriya; it was clear that he favoured Wickremesinghe and his henchmen as he too, is a member of the United National Party, Sampath said. The only solution to the countrys current political situation was to hold a general election and let the nation decide who they wanted as their leaders, he added.
****
Speaker should be impartial
Colombo Municipal Councillor and Socialist Peoples Front Executive Committee member Ven. Galagama Dhammaransi Thera said that yesterdays parliamentary proceedings were peaceful as all parties agreed to follow the instructions given by the President.
The ven. thera added that the legislature is sacrosanct above all other institutions and that the Speaker, as the head of the institution, should play an impartial and transparent role in all its affairs.
He said that legislators seemed to have desisted from their arrogant attitudes and exercised restraints following the instructions given by the Presidents to party leaders on Sunday evening.
The conduct of members of Parliament showed the world that they wanted to reconcile with other parties to uphold democracy, as well as Parliamentary rules and traditions, he said.
****
Speaker created unnecessary crisis
Irangika Range
State Transport Minister C.B. Rathnayake said that parliamentary proceedings ended yesterday peacefully without clashes, as per the agreement at the all-party conference held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena last Sunday.
A fight broke out among rival MPs in Parliament during the past few days due to the partial actions taken by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, which is undemocratic. The Speaker acted in a manner which violates the Constitution, Standing Orders, as well as Parliamentary traditions, when taking up the no-confidence motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government.
The nation always rejected the Speakers unruly conduct, which later developed into a crisis. The Executive is above not only the Legislature and Judiciary, but also the Constitution itself. However, the Speaker always acted while neglecting this.
A crisis situation did not arise from the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. It was Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who crated an unnecessary crisis in the country, he said.
A clash was created between the Executive and the Legislature by exceeding the powers vested with the Speaker by the Constitution. But today, as per the agreement reached at the all-party conference, it has been proposed to appoint a select committee to consider the matter. That is democracy, he added.
****
MPs should show more restraint
Former Israeli and UAE Ambassador and one-time Consumer Affairs Authority Chairman Dr. Sarath Wijesinghe yesterday said that Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri managed to bring back the proceedings of the Parliament to the right track.I am pleased about the outcome of the proceedings of Parliament today by the Deputy Speakers efforts to bring back the proceedings to the correct track from the unpleasant happenings that took place during the past few days that tarnished the image of the country, Wijesinghe said.
He urged legislators and the Speaker to strictly follow the due process and the Standing Orders of the Parliament used only in exceptional cirucumstances.
It is unfortunate that a confused state arose due to the immaturity of institutions. The Judiciary too, should have been careful and foreseen the situation as we now go trough a crisis, and the Members of Parliament should show more restraint and be peaceful; we urge to await for the final decision of the court case, he said.
In the maze of the legal field, the interest and intention of citizens in holding democratic rights and values are to be respected by offering the freedom to elect representatives on periodic intervals, he said, adding that citizens should not be restrained from choosing the representatives; it was the general conscientious that it was time for Provincial and General elections.
It was time for professionals and the public to come forward to protect citizens rights, as well as to create a better future for all, he added.

Deputy Speaker set an example
Senior Counsel B. Manawadu yesterday said that Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri set an example by conducting the Parliamentary sessions in a peaceful manner while maintaining the rules and traditions of the August Assembly.
He said the clashes reported in the chamber for three days beginning from November 14, were not seen yesterday as the Deputy Speaker was in the chair.
He succeeded in maintaining the peace in the House, while also complying with Parliamentary rules and traditions, Manawadu added.
He said that the Sri Lanka Parliament had maintained its reputation and standards since 1947, adding that it became stronger with the adoption of the 1972 Republic Constitution. The peoples sovereignty was exercised by the National State Assembly, he said.
The Parliament always respected rules and traditions and also earned plaudits of vibrant democracies in the world, Manawadu added.
He said that this August Assembly was a place where scholars and experts aired their opinions on many subjects and formulated policies based on their farsighted visions to shape the countrys future.

UPFA has more MPs  Dinesh
The Speaker accepted that when the JVP and TNA members are taken out, the UPFA has more MPs in Parliament. Five MPs crossed over to the UPFA camp and three went to the UNP, but the UPFA has more MPs, Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He was addressing a media conference in Parliament yesterday. He said the Speaker did not attend the parliamentary session yesterday to endorse this matter. He simply avoided it and sent his deputy just to read a note and adjourn Parliament, he said, This is the true situation, but as the government, we will carry on with our duties, no matter what, he said.
After the party leaders meeting with the Speaker Karunaratne Jayasuriya (which is the Speakers full name as referred to by Dinesh Gunawardena), Gunawardena said that after a long discussion, the opposition wanted to move another resolution limiting the powers of the Finance Ministers expenditure and the resolution to be tabled before Parliament.
The opposition accepted that there is a finance Minister who is seated on this side - the Prime Minister. So, what are they trying to do Limit the expenditure and deprive the public servants of their salary, deny over 500,000 pensioners of their pension and other essential public expenditure due by the end of the month This motion has been handed over according to the standing orders. This is what the government has been striving to place before the speaker that he has to act according to the standing orders. Now they accepted that this can be taken up after five days. The motion will be handed over as they have done today, similar to the behavioural aspect of handing over motions, they had jotted down something and brought in to hand it over.
Now according to them, they are writing it down to be handed over to the Secretary General. When he accepts it, he will have to check if it is in accordance with the Constitution and sent to be placed in the order book which will be taken up after five days. November 29 has been proposed for this.
Gunawardena explained what took place in Parliament yesterday and said the Deputy Speaker came in, took the chair and read a message that the selection Committee sent according to the standing orders adjourned Parliament. It is clear that they have come back to accept the standing orders. This is the position that we took and we wanted the international community to know that we have standing orders of Parliament which we all have to abide by. We informed the Speaker yesterday that he has no power to appoint or dismiss a Prime Minister and that the sole power to do that rests with the President.
No matter how ever much he allows ad hoc resolutions to be adopted, it has no value. So, we are urging the Speaker to abide by the Constitution and the standing orders and recognise the government to conduct business of the house.
We will move forward on that basis. It is sad to note that the Speaker was available in his room, but did not sit in Parliament as he could not face its members.
The parliamentarians stood against the irregular and unlawful way the Speaker was behaving, he said. So, the Speaker could not face them, he said.

Speaker ignored Presidents orders - Wimal
The UPFA government members accused Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of challenging the orders of the President and creating a clash between the Executive and the Legislative.
They were addressing a press conference at the committee room 4 of the parliament complex.
Minister Wimal Weerawansa said the Speakers aim is to plunge Parliament into chaos through his defiance and create a situation where foreign forces could intervene.
By now the country knows that the Supreme Court issued a stay order on the gazette notification by the President to dissolve Parliament and hold a general election.
Against this background, the question has arisen whether it is legal to conduct parliamentary sessions. A citizen has taken the matter to court, to determine if Parliament could carry on with its activities when there is a stay order. It is under this a situation, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya convened Parliament without a proper agenda violating the Constitution and is adamant that he will not accept the Prime Minister and the government appointed by the President and has plunged Parliament into a conflict. We stress that the first respondent in the crime of putting Parliament into disarray and complexity is none other than Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, he said.
Weerawansa accused the Speaker of acting as a tool for Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Western countries that no other Speaker has ever behaved in the countrys history. Because of his shameful actions, the people were unfortunate to witness the drama that took place in Parliament over the past few days. Ranil Wickremesinge is holding onto Temple Trees and the Speaker is holding onto Parliament and trying to manipulate the situation to fulfill their sinister motives. In the history of Parliament, there have been governments with majority and those without. When the Executive, the President, appoints a Prime Minister, the Speaker has no authority to oppose that decision. This Speaker is trying to challenge the orders of the President and is trying to create a clash between the Executive and the Legislature, he said. They are trying to override the Executive and pave the way for international forces to interfere in the internal matters of this country.
He said that is why they constantly have to display their objection and resentment of such actions by the Speaker. He said that if the UNF is refusing to accept the government, then there cannot be an opposition, not Parliament. The Secretary of Parliament is a government servant and the other parliamentary staffs are State employees. They do not have the legal right to follow the orders given by the Speaker. As State employees, they are legally bound to adhere to the Constitution and the standing orders of Parliament. We earnestly request them not to comply with the unlawful orders and instructions of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker, he said. Due to the greed for power, the UNF is trying to use every possibility to cling onto power, he said..
The UNP claims to stop funding for the Prime Minister to run the country, but no one has the authority to stop it and the President has several other means to obtain funds if required, he said.

Speakers biased conduct will be brought before IPU, CPU - SB
The UPFA will complain to the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union (CPU) about the recent biased conduct of the Speaker, Minister S.B. Dissanayake said at a press briefing yesterday
From the time that President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the Prime Minister, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya acted illegally and unconstitutionally.
He does not have the power to endorse any no confidence motion or any such, the Minister said.
He said the Speaker can choose to cooperate with the President and the Prime Minister and work for the betterment of the country. If not, they would let the Speaker to do whatever he wants, and they would carry on with the government under the new Prime Minister.
Minister Dullas Alahapperuma said the UNP has notified that they would enter the field to bat their second innings on November 23.
He said that at a time when the country was in turmoil over the past few weeks, the media acted impartially in reporting the recent incidents and the government appreciated them. The core of this whole issue is the 19th Amendment brought about on vengeance. The main persons who were instrumental in drafting the 19th Amendment are TNA-MP Sumanthiran and Jayampathy Wickramaratne. They are behind the UNP, and they have two main intentions. One was to remove the Rajapaksas from politics and the other was to see how the powers of the Executive Presidency could be handed over to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said that what the people are experiencing today is the cracks and crevices of the 19th Amendment.

Monetary powers of PMs Office Secretary will be challenged - Rajitha
UNP MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the UNF and all others who voted in favour of the No Confidence Motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa had submitted a draft motion challenging the monetary powers of the Secretary to the Prime Ministers Office. It will be taken up in Parliament for debate on November 29, Senaratne said.
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said they have made this decision as a token of power that Parliament can exercise when a group claiming to be the government does not have a majority in the House and refuses to bow to vote of no confidence passed, not just once but three times in three days last week.
We have presented a motion from the group of 122 to stop the authorization to withdraw money to the Secretary to the PM since Parliament has total control over public finance under Article 208 and Article 48 of the Constitution, Parliament has approved a No Confidence Motion by operation of law the Cabinet stands dissolved. In view of that fact, we have given notice of this motion only to the Secretary to the PM. We have not taken step to lock other ministries, Sumanthiran said.
Senaratne said the UNF, TNA, and JVP at Party Leaders meeting offered vote by name and electronic vote to the UPFA group to show the majority in line with the proposal of President Maithripala Sirisena at the APC, but the UPFA turned down the proposal.
He said the UNF, who commands the majority in Parliament, will continue their struggle for democracy. Senaratne expressed his dissatisfaction towards the responsible parties who are ignoring the majority in the House and not trying to find a solution.
Senaratne and Sumanthiran were speaking at a press briefing in Parliament premises soon after yesterdays Parliamentary session without any major incident.
Sajith Premadasa, Rauff Hakeem and M.A. Sumanthiran addressed media at the press.
Sajith Premadasa speaking to media said that most of the politicians who are in this power struggle have forgotten the average citizen and the repercussions that they have to undergo due to this crisis situation.
They will continue this drama in the next coming weeks. One should give a higher award such as Emmy or Oskar to those acting in this drama. While these politicians are in a power struggle, what would happen to the general public, the ordinary citizen, the poor, to the one in hunger What would happen to projects such as Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya No one seems to be interested in these questions. Premadasa said.
Premadasa said that this is not a time to entertain personal agendas. This a trying situation where everybody needs to be selfless for the betterment of the country, he said.

JVP challenged UPFA to defeat motion seeking non-payments
The JVP yesterday challenged the UPFA to defeat the motion that seeks to prevent payments from being made by the Prime Ministers Secretary when it is taken up for vote in Parliament on November 29.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was speaking at a press conference in a committee room in Parliament following the adjournment of the House.
He said a vote by name would be requested for the motion. We call on President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to control their members in Parliament, so that we can go ahead with a vote by name. I bet some UPFA MPs will not turn up for this vote.
There is no Government or Opposition in Parliament now. There are only MPs who sit in either side. Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot use helicopters to come to Parliament and Ranil Wickremesinghe cannot occupy Temple Trees. Both are only MPs now, he said. The JVP Leader yesterday raised concerns over the transfer of IP Nishantha Silva from the CID and said it was an attempt to stifle vital criminal investigations on assaults, murder and abduction of journalists and 11 children. The motive behind the illegal capture of ruling power was to stall the on-going investigations into them, he said.
Anura Kumara condemned the attack on police personnel who entered the chamber on the orders of the Speaker with chili powder mixed water on Friday.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said he would produce his shirt stained with chili mixed water as evidence when an investigation commenced on the incident.
The JVP leader said Parliament has the powers over public expenditure as per the Section 148 of the Constitution and under those powers, the funds allocated by the Budget could be controlled by Parliament. It is under those powers we demand that funds for the PMs office should be cut off, he said.
JVP MPs Bimal Ratnayake, Nihal Galappaththi, Sunil Handunnetti and Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa were present.

Parliamentary proceedings conducted in a very peaceful manner - Political party reps
Political party representatives said that yesterdays Parliamentary proceedings were conducted in compliance with democratic and traditional norms with Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri in the Chair.
They said that yesterdays Parliamentary session was strife free and more peaceful than the sessions held on November 14, 15, 16 with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in the Chair.
They pointed out that the conduct of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is disgraceful.
Many legislators have lost confidence in the Speaker who is supposed to play an impartial and unbiased role in the Chamber, political party representatives added.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said that the Deputy Speaker succeeded in conducting the Parliamentary proceedings in a very peaceful manner as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was not in Chair.
Parliamentarian Ananda Kumarasiri managed to conduct the Parliamentary session in a peaceful manner while maintaining decorum as he had a good upbringing and schooling, he said.
Minister Jayasekara added that President Maithripala Sirisena focused on how Parliamentary proceedings are conducted in a peaceful manner while respecting Parliamentary rules and traditions at the All Party Representatives meeting that was held on Sunday, the Minister said.
The Minister added that the Parliamentary sessions conducted on November 14, 15, 16 with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in the Chair brought the august assembly to disrepute. He said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should be held responsibility for this situation.
The Speakers arbitrary decisions have led to the tense situation in Parliament, he said.
Meanwhile Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe thanked all Parliamentarians who helped maintain peace in the House following a request made by the President.

People have identified true and sincere politicians - President
True and sincere politicians have now been clearly identified by both intellectuals and the public today, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
It is important for an individual to display composure, patience, moral rectitude and a sense of discipline. People in politics who do not display these qualities are not politicians in the true sense of the word, the President said.
President Sirisena was speaking at the Presidential Awards for Scientific Publications ceremony at the Taj Samudra Hotel yesterday morning. The Ministry of Science Technology and Research and the National Research Council had jointly organised the awards ceremony for the 18th consecutive year this year.
The President said eventhough everyone engaged in the political field is commonly referred to as a politician, people have now identified the true and sincere politicians. President Sirisena said the difference between politicians and scientists is clearly evident during the present times. Composure, learning wisdom, maturity moral rectitude, discipline and humanism were high qualities reflected in the lives of scientists, the President said.
When one considered the present progress achieved in the economic development sector, the immense contribution made by the scientific community deserved the highest honour of the government and the people, President Sirisena said.
The President said he would urge scientists to lay more emphasis on the countrys problems during their research work.
Education and Higher Education State Minister Mohanlal Grero, National Research Council Chairman Prof. Janaka de Silva and Executive Officer Maneesha Rajapaksa were also present on the occasion.

At the commencement of sittings, the Deputy Speaker announced that a Selection Committee will be appointed to select MPs to Parliament Committees, which stood dissolved following the prorogation of Parliament. He requested all political parties to nominate members to the committee and send the lists to Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake as soon as possible.
Prior to the adjournment of the House, UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella requested the Chair to hold an investigation into the violent incidents in the Chamber on November 14, 15 and 16 which led to vandalism of public property.
The UPFA MPs shouted in disagreement.
The Deputy Speaker said that he would bring it to the attention of the Speaker.
The Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a Point of Order said the appointment of the Selection Committee must be done giving due recognition to the Government led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Parliament affairs are handled by the Government and we are in the Government now. We must get the majority in the Section Committee to run its affairs smoothly, he told the House.
Intervening at this point, UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera said the country does not have a Prime Minister or Government as at now as per 48 (2) of the Constitution. The Chief Government Whip S.B.Dissanayake at this point said a Section Committee could not be appointed if there is no Government. Therefore, let us proceed with this proposal accepting the fact that there is a Government, he added.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake pointed out that Speaker Jayasuriya clearly announced to the House on Thursday that the Government led by PM Rajapaksa stands dissolved after the passage of the No-Confidence Motion on Wednesday. It is not fair that the UPFA is requesting the majority of the Selection Committee when it lacks the majority of the House. The Selection Committee must reflect the current composition of members in the House, he noted.
The Deputy Speaker then adjourned the House till 10.30 am on Friday (23). The UPFA, UNP and JVP convened back-to-back press conferences in the Parliamentary complex following the adjournment of the House.
Parliament sittings limited to five minutes yesterday showing no signs of reaching a compromise to end the current political impasse.
After three days of highly contentious sittings, excitement had mounted when the House met at 1 pm yesterday with special security arrangements in the Parliament complex.
The gallery was closed to the public and representatives of diplomatic missions and only the media personnel were allowed in. Commenting on the conduct of the Speaker,Attorney at Law Premanath Dolewatte claimed that legal action should be instituted against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, as he has violated Criminal Law.
He said that the Speaker by his supportive action is tantamount to aiding and abetting the commiting of murder and provision of criminal law could be used if one ponders taking legal action against him. He also said that if the inquiries are going to be independent,charges should also be made against those who brought weapons to the Parliament.
The Speaker has acted against the law and if he does not follow the norms and traditions of the Parliament, he does so with the intention of coming foward as the Common Candidate at the next Presidential election, Dolawatte said.
He recalled that steps were taken to nail the Parliamentary seats as former Prime Minister John Kotalawala as a Member of Parliament had attacked another with a Chair saying the UNP is famous for misuse of public property.
Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his great appreciation and satisfaction for the agreement by all political parties represented in Parliament, to observe and follow the guidelines given by him, at the All Party Conference held on Sunday aimed at ending the political stalemate in Parliament.
Once the President appointed a new Prime Minister and formed a New Cabinet,by the powers vested in him in the Constitution and when some had moved to create tension within the parameters of Parliament, the President drew his attention to the emerging situation. Thus, the President conducted two meetings, one on November 15 and the other on November 18, with the Leaders of Political Parties represented in Parliament.
Addressing the two meetings held on the said two days,President Sirisena advised them to conduct Parliamentary sessions avoid conflicting situations and by conducting the affairs of Parliament with decorum, following the Standing Orders and observing the Parliamentary traditions.
Responding positively to the instructions and advice given by the President when the Parilament met yesterday, at the Party Leaders Meeting, they agreed to act in accoradance with the Standing Oders and if a No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister is to be tabled in Parliament, to do so following the Parliamentary traditions. They also agreed to avoid creating any crisis situation in Parliament.
The President had a very special word of thanks to All Political Pries represented in Parliament that acted in line with the guidelines given by him.

Prophet Muhammads teachings based on the noble concept of equality - President
According to the Holy Quran everything in the universe is created for a certain purpose.
The human race is also created to accomplish a certain purpose. Before accomplishing that purpose, Prophets descended to this world from time to time and the final one was the Holy Prophet Muhammad, states President Maithripala Sirisena in a message to mark Prophet Muhammads Birthday.
The message adds: The teachings of the Holy Prophet Muhammad was based on the noble concept of equality that one person is not superior of inferior to another by race, caste or colour. Every human being has equal rights, according to the Prophet.
There was an ignorant era in which the birth of a girl was considered a course and the female infants were buried alive after birth. Yet, before long Holy Prophet Muhammad was able to win the women the right to live.
The Prophet was opposed to exploitation of people and worked towards the freedom of the slaves. He said that the labourers should be given their remuneration even before their sweat dries away.
The way Holy Prophet Muhammad contributed towards the human values and humanity during an era of conflict is indeed exemplary to all of us.
On this day of the Holy Prophet Mohameds Birth Anniversary, I earnestly hope that the great vision of the Nabi, which carries the message of universal love for all beings will guide all of us in our day to day endeavours.
I express respect and well wishes to all the Islamic devotees in Sri Lanka and abroad on this important occasion, the Presidents message adds.

UNP fears General Elections: Ranatunge
Gampaha District SLPP Leader and Joint Opposition Group convenor Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge said he would challenge the UNP and the JVP to withdraw their petitions before the Supreme Court if they did not fear to face a General Election.
He said today, the vast majority of people are demanding a General Election wanting to elect Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister with a two thirds majority in Parliament.
Ranatunge was addressing a meeting of the Minuwangoda electorate SLPP Central Organisation at the Udugampola Reggie Ranatunge Memorial Hall on November 17.
Prasanna Ranatunge said, The political environment today is much different to the environment which existed when we first planned to convene this meeting. From the day Mahinda Rajapaksa lost the last Presidential election, people craved to bring him back to power again. We took to the streets on his behalf and led demonstrations and protest campaigns.
It was the people of Minuwangoda who requested to shun portfolios and stand by Mahinda Rajapaksa at all times. I have kept that promise without wavering.
Ranatunge said the convincing victory gained by the SLPP at the local government election gave the confidence that Mahinda Rajapaksa derive strength for his future victories.
Ranatunge said when the President highlighted the Central Bank fraud and the misdeeds of certain UNP Ministers, the understanding between the President and the UNP fell apart. Then an alleged plot to assassinate the President and the former Defence Secretary came to light with certain UNP names also being mentioned.
The subsequent political instability forced the President to appoint a person who had his confidence as Prime Minister. Since both Karu Jayasuriya and Sajith Premadasa declined the offer, he requested Mahinda Rajapaksa to accept the post as the Joint Opposition led by him was the main force within Parliament.
Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted the Prime Ministers post to settle urgent problems confronting the country, provide relief to the people and conduct a General Election as soon as possible.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should be held responsible for the present crisis in the Legislature, Ranatunge said.
JVP was acting like a pawn in the hands of the UNP. The JVP should be ashamed to co-operate with the UNP which murdered Rohana Wijeveera in cold blood and burnt his body.

WPC goes ahead with Budget sessions
Western Provincial Council (WPC) Chief Minister and Finance, Planning and Local Government Minister Isuru Devapriya presented the Financial Statement for 2019 at the WPC yesterday despite Central Government funds from the 2019 Budget being currently on hold.
This year, he said, was a significant year for the Council with the highest allocation of money allocated for development. This is notable given that next year the Council is set to face the Provincial Council elections.
The total estimated expenditure for 2019 is Rs 81,280 million, a 13 percent increase from last year. Of that Rs. 68,460 million (84.23 percent) is estimated to be recurrent expenditure and Rs. 12,820 million (15.77), capital expenditure.
The debate on the Financial Statement is expected to be taken up on December 4,5,6,7, 10 and 11.
Presenting the fifth Financial Statement of the Sixth Provincial Council and the fourth presented by him, Devapriya noted that this year was of special importance to him, as he stood speaking in the chambers of the newly constructed Western Provincial Council building. In previous years, the Ministers rented out a meeting hall at Wijerama Mawatha. I believe that members take honest delight in the fact that opportunity has been created for future Finance Ministers to present their budgets in a very dignified manner.
Whilst it is customary to have the Provincial Budget after the National Budget, this year, however, the Chief Minister noted that they had to prepare the Budget on the data relevant to Central Government grants obtained after discussions with the Finance Commission. We hope that there will not be any change in those numbers, he said.
Devapriya in his speech also remarked that when allocating provisions under the Provincial Specific Grants, largely problematic situations existed between the Central Government and the Provincial Council. The allocation of the capital required for subjects, which directly devolves to the Provincial Council and then to line ministries was a hindrance, he said, as they did not have the mechanism to implement projects.
Thus re-allocating these funds again to the Provincial Government after a lapse of half a year made the money unusable and the project non-implementable. The Finance Commission and the Treasury should take action with regard to this.
The highest recurrent expenditure for the WPC this year and next would be in the Health Sector where there has been a 101 percent growth in the amount allocated for Health Sector employees for Overtime and Holiday pay - they make up 98 percent of the Overtime and Holiday pay for all provincial government sector staff. In 2018, Rs. 2,575 million was allocated in the Budget and in addition, a supplementary Rs. 715 million was further requested to meet payments. In 2019, Rs. 5,186 million has been allocated for this purpose.
In addition, Rs. 3,500 million would be allocated for the Nearest School is the Best School project and they planned to establish 110 smart classrooms with 10 in each zone.
Similar to previous years, in 2019 too, the Education Department received the highest allocation of Rs. 25, 078,653 million, followed by the Health Services Department at Rs. 16,003,253 million and the Chief Secretarys Office at Rs. 15, 298, 355 million.
In contrast, the Probation and Child Care Services Department has only received Rs. 223,882 million, grouped among the departments with lower allocations.
