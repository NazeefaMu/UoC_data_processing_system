Aboard Trumps gilded jet, every seat is First-Class

US: As a few thousand people waited for Donald Trump to arrive for a campaign rally in an airplane hangar in northwest Arkansas on Saturday afternoon, the theme song from the 1997 movie Air Force One began to play.
In the cloudless blue sky, the billionaire businessmans jet appeared. It swooped past the hangar and disappeared as hundreds of phones recorded the spectacle.
Oh my God, there it is - wow! a middle-aged woman said, as she recorded a video she would later post on Facebook. A 66-year-old retiree wearing a camouflage-style campaign hat burst into tears at the sight and declared the plane more impressive than Air Force One. Two women wondered what Trump was saying onboard and if he even knew which state he was in on his whirlwind tour. Here we go, a dad said to his young son, who was sitting atop his shoulders. A young couple debated whether the lettering spelling TRUMP was gold leaf or just paint.
Given that personal wealth has dogged so many presidential candidates eager to connect with voters, a personal Boeing 757 jet is the sort of thing many politicians would hide as soon as they launched a White House bid - or would never own in the first place.
What does Trump do He flaunts his immense wealth and rolls up in Trump Force One at campaign rallies at small airports in eastern Iowa, the Phoenix suburbs and remote Arkansas. In a campaign so dominated by the businessmans personality and featuring few supporting characters, Trumps jet has quietly taken an outsize role.
The plane is Trumps gold-plated flying office and home, allowing him to commute from New York to early-voting states while his rivals have to travel in recreational vehicles, on commercial flights or, if they can afford it, chartered planes. Its his traveling reception hall, a luxurious place where he invites reporters for impromptu news conferences, potential endorsers hes trying to woo and, on a whim, Iowa children who wanted to explore.
The plane is opulent and over-the-top - and very, well, very Trump. It symbolizes his campaign promise to make the country rich again.
Early in life, the plane was far less richly appointed, joining the fleet of a low-cost Danish airline company in 1991. Three years later, it briefly moved to a company based in Mexico City, but soon after it was purchased by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The two spent more than 15 years together - until 2011, when Trump took possession and spent heavily on lavish renovations that are documented in a 3 1/2-minute video posted on You Tube.As a few thousand people waited for Donald Trump to arrive for a campaign rally in an airplane hangar in northwest Arkansas on Saturday afternoon, the theme song from the 1997 movie Air Force One began to play.

Hi, Im Amanda Miller, and Im standing inside Mr. Trumps luxurious, new 757, said Trumps receptionist, who was made famous by his reality game show, The Apprentice. Im here to give you an inside look at traveling Trump style.
The plane can accommodate 43 passengers, fly for 16 hours and can go more than 500 miles per hour, thanks to Rolls-Royce engines. Onboard: a wood-paneled galley, first-class sleeper area with oversize light-colored leather seats, dining area, main lounge with a 57-inch television screen and sound system of a top Hollywood screening room, VIP area, guest bedroom with a full-size bed and Mr. Trumps bedroom, which is decorated with yards and yards of gold silk.
Youll notice the seat belts, as well as everything else, are 24-carat gold plated, Miller says, as the camera zooms in for a look. The Trump family crest is also featured throughout the plane.
As Trump Force One landed Saturday in Arkansas and rolled up to the hangar, Brenda Cowden shook her head and said: Look at that. Look at it.
Cowden first saw the plane in the sky a couple of months ago in Dallas. She was visiting, and he was in town for a rally.
I was on the freeway, so I pulled over and shot a photo of the plane as it went over, said Cowden, a retiree who lives in Greenwood, Arkansas, and plans to vote for Trump on Super Tuesday because she said he will improve the quality of life for veterans like her husband. I trust him.
The door of the plane opened. Trump appeared, along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who endorsed Trump on Friday and, therefore, was allowed to travel with the Republican front-runner for a day - the same honour bestowed upon former Alaska governor Sarah Palin (R) and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. last month ahead of the Iowa caucuses. (Falwell marveled that Trump served Wendys burgers on board.)
The two men waved, descended a staircase and spoke to the crowd for more than an hour. Few could see either man on the stage, but most could see the plane - black and white with a bold red stripe and a windswept T on the tail.
Its the only thing I could see, said Jordan Baker, 27, of Rogers, Arkansas, who posed for a photo with the jet after the rally rather than trying to elbow her way through the crowd for the chance to shake Trumps hand.
Trump will often speak at length about his beloved jet, especially when its standing behind him, like a silently supportive life partner. He says its one of his only campaign expenses - unlike his rivals who have spent tens of millions of dollars on television ads, internal polling, fundraising and consultants. Trumps campaign reimburses his airline company, TAG Air, for use of the plane. Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission in 2015 show that the campaign paid TAG Air $2 million last year and another $537,436 in January.
Do you like the plane Trump said to cheers. Made in the United States. Boeing. Made in the United States.
The plane lingered on the runway for more than four hours. Long after the rally ended, Trump reboarded and invited a few local reporters onboard - warning them to not scratch his expensive woodwork. Late in the afternoon, the plane rolled away, headed to a rally at a hangar in Tennessee.

Attempt to sideline popular leaders: Dilum

Dilum Amunugama MP addressing the media in Kandy yesterday expressed disappointment over his removal as the SLFP organiser of the Senkadagala electorate in Kandy.
Amunugama said that there was an attempt to sideline popular leaders and appoint less capable ones in their place.
"Such attempts will only drive the party to defeat at future elections," he added.
Amunugama, a vociferous leader of the so-called joint opposition, said he had come to know about his removal through the media.
"I was not even informed about my removal. I came to know about this through the media. I am saddened and disappointed because I have always given my best to the progress of this party," he added.
Amunugama said he could accept his removal if he was replaced by a better performer and added: "I received 105,000 votes at the last general election and my replacement is one who contested for the provincial council polls and became third or fourth. You all can see who is more suitable".
The young Kandy district MP also noted that he had never hesitated to highlight the wrongdoings of the present government and questioned whether this fact was linked to his removal.
"If that is the case there is a serious question about democracy within the party," he added.
Amunugama said labeling those who criticise the wrong doings of the government as people of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was not correct and added that such politicians who highlight government's failures and wrong acts were only fulfilling the expectations of the people who voted for them.

CBK created rifts in SLFP - Dullas

SLFP Vice President and Parliamentarian Dullus Alahapperuma yesterday said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga created rifts in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
"She broke away from the party formed by her father," he said.
Dullas Alahapperuma added that former President Bandaranaike divided the SLFP on a number of occasions and her alleged involved in corruption and malpractices have been vividly described by journalist Victor Ivan in his book Chaura Rajina.
"If former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga continues to destroy the party, I will take a decision with regard to my party membership soon," he said

Dj vu!

Hollywood has given us talking toys, wooly mammoths, animals escaping from zoos and had reinvented fairytales so far. Therefore an animation based on a prehistoric family on the run from extinction does not come as a surprise.
However what does come across a shock is the dismal manner in which directors Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders have dealt with 'The Croods.'
The movie has nothing new to offer nor is it inspiring in any manner. Within 10 minutes into the film the story becomes highly predictable. Genuinely humorous moments are scarce and most of the time you are forced to watch scenes which seem to resemble a patchwork of incidents borrowed from previous animations.
'The Croods' revolves around a prehistoric family whose life is limited to the confined reality of their cave.
They spend their daytime hunting for food as a pack but when night falls Grug, the father and head of the family, rushes them off to the safety of their cave. The family shuns anything new and curiosity, which Eep, their teenage daughter has in abundance, is frowned down upon.
New world
When an earthquake strikes the area their cave is destroyed. The family meets Guy, a boy with new ideas and discoveries who convinces them that they have to leave their dwelling to prevent themselves from becoming extinct. Lead by him a new world opens before their eyes.
Guy and a friend

They encounter dangers which they have been hiding from in the past but soon learn that there is a brighter side to the story on their way to a distant sanctuary.
The Croods family reminds you of the Flintstones due to its prehistory setting but even the cartoon seems to be more attractively presented than this animation. The Crood family seems bizarre and grotesque rather than charming.
Unlikely pair
The robust and uncultured Eep, the heroine of the tale, makes us cringe. She is in stark contrast to the svelte and traditionally feminine princesses featured in Disney movies. Headstrong and spunky she is presented as a physically strong character.
However the fact that her love interest is slim and trim makes them an odd, mismatched and highly unlikely pair.
The story is too full of clichs to raise much interest.
For example we have the clash between the over protective father and the rebellious daughter which we witnessed in the last 'Ice Age' sequel. You cannot help wishing for time to pass quickly because at times 'The Croods' becomes a pain.
The only plus point about 'The Croods' lies in its 3D technology. The candy-coloured visuals and rollercoaster chase sequences lighten up the drab movie. Carnivorous flowers, turtles that can fly, flesh devouring birds and a vibrantly colourful sabre-toothed tiger project its creative angle but even those seem wasted as the movie itself does not have anything creatively new to offer. Some of the modern features in the movie backdrop seem to have been copied from successful productions like 'Avatar.'
Celebrity voices like Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds are part of the project. They do a commendable job in voicing the characters but even their star power cannot help the fate of 'The Croods.'
If you have nothing much to do with your time you might while away a few hours with the film. Otherwise 'The Croods' is just a waste of time and money.
It would be best if they let this one be buried in history.

Electoral organiser should obtain 75 pc of party vote or go - SB

An electoral organiser who cannot garner at least 75 per cent of the votes cast for the party from their electorate should vacate their electorates, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
The minister who was appointed as the new SLFP electoral organiser for Hewaheta said that he was happy to leave his former electorate Udunuwara as he could not fulfill this requirement at the last general election.
Dissanayake said that he was only able to get 10,000 votes out of 20,000 votes cast for the SLFP at the Udunuwara electorate. In contrast, Dissanayake said he had obtained 99.9 per cent of votes cast for the party when he was Hanguranketha electorate organiser.
The minister also recalled that during his tenure as the SLFP General Secretary, he was instrumental in bringing a regulation that party organisers who cannot garner 75 per cent of votes cast for the party from their electorate should resign.
Dissanayake said that as a politician who hails from Udunuwara, he was confident of gaining the upper hand for his party at future elections from the electorate.

FR against UPFA National List re-fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri and former Minister Tissa Vitharana challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament were yesterday re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court and two petitions are to be taken up again on May 6.
The Supreme Court yesterday directed the petitioners that the captions of the petitions be amended in line with the changes of the respondents cited in the petitions.
In his petition, former MP Somaweera Chandrasiri who is also functioning as the Vice Chairman of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) cited Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, UPFA General Secretary Prof.Vishwa Warnapala, its former General Secretary Susil Premajantha, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The Petitioner states the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties (MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP) and that the very inception the said Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner and all the decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all the constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajantha in his capacity as the Secretary of the said Alliance submitted a list of names including the Petitioners' for the national list.
He alleged that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala was subsequently appointed as the General Secretary of UPFA by the incumbent President without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
He stated that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with some the persons, who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be Members of Parliament.
He is seeking the Court for a declaration that he is entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament submitted according to the first list.
He is also seeking the Court to cancel and or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as members of Parliament.

Indian Army aspirants forced to take exams in underwear
They came to take an exam. They were asked to take off their clothes first.

In their underwear, hundreds of young men took an exam on Monday in Bihar's Muzaffarpur, for the post of clerk in the army.

Some 1,100 candidates were horrified as they reached the examination centre and were instructed to take off their clothes.

But they did what they had to. "The vest too," the examiners told them.

Army sources have been quoted by the Indian Express newspaper as saying this was done to save time on frisking so many people. Army Regional office director Colonel VS Godhara told the newspaper: "We conduct thorough frisking and ensure that candidates carry minimum external things to the exam centre."

In a state notorious for cheating - blatant and often aided by examiners and parents - officials decided that it was the best way to eliminate the possibility of scraps of paper hidden in clothes.

The candidates finally sat cross-legged on the ground in their briefs and used their thighs as tables for the one-hour test. Some complained they were cold, but they had no choice.

Last year, images of mass cheating involving Class 10 students made international headlines. Parents, relatives and others were seen scaling the walls of the exam centre to pass scraps of papers to students, unrestricted.

Leonardo DiCaprio finally gets his Oscar!

US: After four previous misses, Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar for his grunting, gruff performance in The Revenant.
'Making The Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world...climate change is real,' said DiCaprio as he used his acceptance speech to deliver a lecture on the environment. 'It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.'
'Let us not take our planet for granted,' he concluded. 'I do not take tonight for granted.'
While an advocate for addressing the threat of climate change, 41-year-old DiCaprio was reported to have taken six private jet flights in just six weeks in 2014. It may prove hard for the actor to justify the need to avail himself of more than $200,000 worth of private travel between LA and New York in such a short period of time.
He was then nominated for Best Actor (The Aviator) in 2004. He later earned a Best Actor nod for Blood Diamond in 2006. And most recently for the Wolf Of Wall Street in 2013.
Alejandro Inarritu took best director for a second straight year, a feat matched by only two other filmmakers: John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz. His brutal frontier epic The Revenant, which came in with a leading 12 nods and the favorite for best picture, also won best cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki. Renowned for his use of natural light in lengthy, balletic shots, Lubezki became the first cinematographer to win three times in a row (following wins for Gravity and Birdman), and only the seventh to three-peat in Oscar history.
Inarritu, the Mexican director of last year's best-picture winner Birdman, was one of the few winners to remark passionately on diversity in his speech.

Media should highlight political speeches of substance - Gayantha

The media has a significant role to play by highlighting political speeches of substance rather than giving prominence to mud slinging speeches, Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
The minister was speaking at a one day workshop at the Information Department on the theme Digital Media and Technology Enabled Society for the Parliamentary Journalists yesterday.
The Dean of the Moratuwa University ICT Faculty Dr.Lochandaka Ranathunga was the key-note speaker at the event organized by the Parliamentary Journalists Association.
Once I congratulated a MP in Parliament for the fine speech he made in the House, Minister Karunathilake said.
But, he told me that it was pointless in making such speeches in Parliament as the media does not give prominence to them. He also said if he had spoken in a derogatory manner against a MP, it would have been highlighted in the media, Minister Karunathilake said.
He added that plans are afoot to set up housing schemes in all districts for provincial media personnel. He also added that they to meet the journalists in North during the tour to Jaffna on March 25 to 27.
The minister further said that three houses are to be granted to the members of the families of the deceased media personnel in Jaffna. He added that the ITN, Rupavahini and the Lake House (ANCL) has promised to construct these houses while the Derana Institute promised to provide welfare facilities to those family members.
Moratuwa University ICT Faculty Dr.Lochandaka Ranathunga said that with the development of technology, digital news has surpassed the newspapers and the radio.
Referring to the statistics available upto 2012, Dr.Ranathunga said that 55 percent of the people watch television to get news. He added that 33 percent and 29 percent listen to radios and read newspapers respectively for news. However, the rate of getting news online has increased up to 39 percent within a short period of time.

Now Parliament under PRECIFAC probe

The Presidential Commission investigating Fraud Corruption, Abuse of Power State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has launched a broad investigation into alleged mass scale acts of corruption, fraud and misuse of state assets which had occurred in Parliament in the past.
Reports said waste, corruption and fraud committed ran into millions which were beyond estimation. For instance, a finger print machine purchased for over Rs. 10 million had been discarded after limited use.
Reports said that the machine had been discarded because it went out of order after a short use. The procurement of this machine had been done between January 10, 2010 and January 10, 2015.
No interest had been shown to get it repaired although it was a vital machine to record the visitors to Parliament for security purposes as well.
There had also been various acts of corruption and fraud involving the repair of the MPs' housing complex at Madiwela, granting of foreign scholarships to high officials and the purchase of building material and vehicles.
It is reported that former parliamentarian Lal Kantha had complained about various acts of corruption and fraud but the complaint had gone unheeded without any investigations into it.
PRECIFAC secretary Lacille de Silva said the Commission had launched an investigation following several public complaints received by the Commission.

Pradeepa and Geethika Nandasena create South Asian Games women's hockey record

Unknown to them and unknown to the hockey authorities two hockey playing sisters from the hill capital Pradeepa and Geethika Nandasena created a record which cannot be emulated at the 12th South Asian Games 2016 women's hockey championship played at Guwahati India this month.
They carved their names into the record books and this was the first time that a hockey championship for women was conducted and they became the first set of sisters to play in the championship and also for Sri Lanka in the South Asian Games.
The two sisters are products of Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Kandy, and they now represent the Sri Lanka Navy. They are so fair in complexion and reddish in the hot Sun that they could be mistaken for foreign girls. In fact this writer met Pradeepa for the first time when a girls team from the United Kingdom played in the hill capital. She was in her casuals and at the recorders table and I thought that she was a member of the visiting team and asked for the names of the goal scorers which she was unable to provide. More questions put an end to this embarrassment and said that she was from Sri Lanka. That was my first meeting.
Both sisters were coached by that veteran coach from the hill capital M A M Ashroff who was unlucky to miss the trip to Guwahati. He taught them the basics of how to handle the curved stick with aggression and skills from day one to the present. He is still their coach with the Sri Lanka Navy and no one could take this credit away from him.
The elder of the two sisters is Pradeepa Nilmini played for Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya at all age group levels starting off as a centre half and now plays as a right back. She captained her school in 2008 and also the Kandy Schools in 2008 and also the Central Province Schools at the National School Games.
Pradeepa was also a member of the Seetha Devi BV team which won many championship titles including the schools championship and the National School Games hockey championship for girls. She first played for Sri Lanka in 2009 at the Asian Games held in Thailand. Since then she has been an automatic choice to the national team.
In the year 2012 she played for the country at the Asian Games held in Singapore and also at the Asian Challengers Trophy held in Thailand in 2013 in which Sri Lanka became runners up. In the year 2010 representing the Central Province at the National Sports Festival she was adjudged the "Best Player of the Tournament" by the Ministry of Sports.
This was not the first time she had won the Best Players award as in 2009 at the Trinity Hockey sixes conducted by Trinity College she won this award for her school in the under 19 tournament for girls schools.
She has also represented the country at many international tournaments including the World League Championship. She has been playing for national champions Sri Lanka Navy since 2010.
The younger of the two Geethika Damayanthi two years younger to Pradeepa speaks little as if to say let my hockey stick do the talking. She occupies the berth of centre half often providing a challenge to her elder sister. She too played for her school at all age group levels and the senior team from 2005 to 2010, captaining the school in 2009 leading her alma mater to many championship titles including the National School Games and the Seetha Devi Sevens.
She played for the Kandy District Schools captaining it in 2009 and also the Central Province Schools and also ended up captaining it. She also played for the Sri Lanka Schools at the Junior Nationals and went on many tours abroad.
In 2012 she skippered the Sri Lanka Junior National team at Junior Asia Cup held in Singapore.

Removing persons who stood by party undemocratic - Bandula

It was current SLFP Chairman President Maithripala Sirisena who allowed the SLFP to contest the general election under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa and win it by criticising the unsound policies of the UNP. The removal of persons who stood by the party at that time from their electoral organiser posts can be seen as an action which was against the democratic principles existing within the SLFP, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was commenting on the shake up of SLFP chief electoral organiser posts carried out by the party.
Gunawardena said it was with the knowledge of President Sirisena that people like Prasanna Ranatunga and Dilum Amunugama played the opposition role in Parliament. He said President Sirisena was also aware of their opposition to the government's budget and their voting against it.
What they did in Parliament as members of the joint opposition was to counter the repeated attacks made by the UNP, he said.

Reprising Sparrow!

Johnny Depp's next most anticipated movie is 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5,' in which he will be reprising his role as the infamous pirate captain Jack Sparrow. In a recent interview, the actor talked about how he landed the role and also talked about his acting career.
Depp revealed that when he was first told about playing Jack Sparrow; the meeting only lasted about 37 seconds. The actor and his agent Tracey met with the executives of Disney for another project, but Depp was not interested in being a part of that movie.
After learning that Depp was not interested in the project being discussed, Dick Cook asked the actor if he knew about the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' rides. The actor said that he recalled the ride being one of his favourites as a kid and readily agreed to be a part of the movie.
Depp's agent, however, was not happy about the sudden decision the actor took in the meeting. The franchise, however, became a big hit globally and the actor will next be seen as Jack in 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5.'
The actor revealed that originally, the Jack Sparrow character was written 'as a swashbuckler who comes in and saves the day'. The actor went to a sauna in order to think about the character. The actor felt that it was important for him to go to a 'very hot place' and stay there as long as he could to get his 'Sea legs."'
"I toyed with the idea of what it might be like to live with some species of heatstroke that maybe didn't go away all that quickly," the actor said. The actor felt that being a pirate is more about "rum, sodomy and the lash."
While thinking about all these concepts, the character Jack Sparrow took shape in the actor's mind.
Depp has already finished filming his scenes for 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5.' The movie has been directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg and is slated to be released on May 26, 2017. www.ibtimes.com.au

S. Korea MPs push record filibuster into seventh day

KOREA: A record-breaking filibuster by South Korean opposition lawmakers entered its seventh day Monday in a bid to block a bill giving greater surveillance powers to the national spy agency.
The marathon filibuster began last Tuesday and is being hailed as the world's longest -- shattering the previous record of 57 hours set by Canada's New Democratic Party in 2011.
Twenty-five lawmakers from the main opposition Minjoo Party and Justice Party have now spent more than 140 hours taking turns to hold the main floor of the parliament.
The are demanding revisions to an anti-terrorism bill, pushed by the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, that would allow the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to collect a wide range of personal data -- including phone records -- on anyone suspected of posing a security threat.
President Park Geun-Hye has said the legislation is necessary to counter growing threats of terrorism, including from North Korea.
But opposition party lawmakers argue the bill would violate rights to privacy and may be used to monitor and crack down on political dissent.
"The law not only gives the NIS unprecedented, unconstrained power to spy on every detail of our lives without our knowledge but also violates freedom of expression," lawmaker Hong Jong-Haak said during a five-hour speech Monday morning.
The NIS had a notorious reputation in the decades of authoritarian rule before South Korea embraced democracy in the 1980s, and its modern incarnation has faced a series of scandals including election meddling.
Senior officials, including a former NIS head, were convicted of organising an online smear campaign against the liberal opposition candidate during the 2012 presidential poll won by Park.
Critics say freedom of assembly and expression have been significantly eroded in recent years, accusing Park, daughter of the late military ruler Park Chung-Hee, of slipping back towards authoritarian rule.

US eyes Syria aid deliveries as truced holds

SYRIA: The United Nations prepared to deliver aid to thousands of besieged civilians in Syria on Monday as a fragile ceasefire entered its third day largely intact despite accusations of violations.
UN humanitarian coordinator Yacoub El Hillo said the world body hoped to take advantage of the first major truce in five years of conflict to distribute supplies to an extra 154,000 people living in besieged areas over the next five days.
A successful truce would also create a more favourable backdrop for peace talks that collapsed in acrimony in early February as a Russia-backed regime offensive in northern Syria caused tens of thousands to flee.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura aims to relaunch the talks on March 7 if the ceasefire lasts and more aid is delivered.
The main opposition grouping Sunday described the ceasefire as "positive" but lodged a formal complaint with the United Nations and foreign governments about breaches.
"We have violations here and there, but in general it is a lot better than before and people are comfortable," said Salem al-Meslet, spokesman for the Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee.
Meslet said the opposition would like to see the truce "last forever" and that it was the "responsibility of the United States to stop any violations".
An HNC letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accused the Syrian regime and its allies of committing "24 violations with artillery shelling and five ground operations... in 26 areas held by the moderate opposition".
It said the breaches had killed 29 people and wounded dozens.
The HNC has said it did not receive any maps of areas included in the ceasefire or documents explaining the monitoring mechanism.
Syria's Al-Watan newspaper, which is close to the government, said Sunday that those maps were still being "kept secret".
The ceasefire does not apply to territory held by the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front.
The jihadists of IS last week cut the government's sole supply route to territory it holds in and around second city Aleppo.
After several days of deadly clashes, the army succeeded in reopening it on Monday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
At least 26 pro-government fighters and 14 IS jihadists were killed in the fighting around the town of Khanasser, the Britain-based monitoring group said on Sunday. Russia, which has waged a five-month bombing campaign to support Assad, accused "moderate" rebels and jihadists of nine ceasefire violations. But "on the whole, the ceasefire regime in Syria is being implemented," Lieutenant General Sergei Kuralenko, head of Moscow's coordination centre in Syria, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
In Damascus, student Mehdi al-Ani spent Sunday at his university's cafe with friends.
"Yesterday, we only heard two or three shells -- but I pretended like I didn't hear anything. The ceasefire will continue, God willing," he said.
In Aleppo, the Observatory reported some rebel rocket fire on government-held neighbourhoods early on Monday but no casualties.
Children strolled to schools in the city without hugging walls for fear of air strikes or rocket fire, an AFP correspondent reported.
"Our teachers used to forbid us from going out to the school yard because of the air strikes but today we went out and played," said Ranim, a 10-year-old pupil at a primary school in the rebel-held neighbourhood of Bustan al-Kasr.
The Observatory reported nine Russian air strikes on a town in the central province of Hama early on Monday but had no immediate word on any casualties.
Washington urged patience from all sides to give the truce a chance to firm up.
"Setbacks are inevitable," a senior US administration official said.
"Even under the best of circumstances, we don't expect the violence to end immediately. In fact, we are certain that there will continue to be fighting, in part because of organisations like ISIL (Islamic State) and Al-Nusra."
There has been no let-up in the US-led air campaign against IS since the truce went into effect.
The coalition said that on Sunday it carried out 12 strikes against the jihadists in Syria, four of them around the town of Tal Abyad on the Turkish border where IS has been attempting to regain territory from US-backed Kurdish forces.
