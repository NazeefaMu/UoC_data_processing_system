WORLDVIEW AND THE FREEDOM FROM SUFFERING
Joe Perera in his article On Life and Suffering rejects the cause of suffering as Karmic Retribution via Rebirth. He says, he wants to find the Unknown cause for human suffering.
May I suggest that he gets his Naadi Vakyam read. Just on the basis of your thumbprint, through the relevant palm leaf, they will tell all the intimate details of your life including your name, age, details of your family members etc. In a stunning revelation, a girl was told the exact path from her house to her boy friends home!! They even mentioned the names of two buildings on the way. They told where she will be born again and what her name will be. These revelations were recorded long, long time ago and kept in archives in South India.
On Joe Pereras comments on innocent girls being raped and murdered and culprits roaming with full freedom, I gave my analysis in an article which was published in the Daily News titled Thoughts on Seya and Vidya.
In this connection may I mention a remarkable statement made by Ramana Maharishi on an everyday incident. Apparently, a foreign lady came to see the Maharishi in His Ashram in Arunachala. She said, I am now in India.
Maharishi smiled and asked, Are you in India or is India in you!! Space does not allow me to state the enormous implications of Maharishis simple question. It provides a stunning worldview which to my knowledge has not been mentioned anywhere by anyone.
If I can end this article on a personal note to Joe Perera, it is to say that you have endured a terrible ordeal of mental anguish and sorrow. You know all too well what mental suffering is and I know what physical suffering is.
The solace to either form of suffering does not lie in the external world but within you. First you find the Kingdom of Heaven within you The key word is Within you. Ramana Maharishi has found this location as a pinpoint on the right side of the chest. I have confirmed it in my meditation. It is through this point that one gains access to the Universal Consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ananda) with the consequence dissolution of the Individuality which is the root cause of all suffering.

Colleagues mourn loss of a dynamic trailblazer in local journalism
The death of Chamara Lakshan Kumara, Editor-in- Chief of the Silumina and Resa, has come as a devastating shock for his colleagues and friends in both these newspapers and the wider media world.
Expressing their condolences, Resa and Silumina staffers said that his death has left a void that can never be filled. Following are some of their views:
****
Janaka Liyanarachchi - Chief Sub Editor, Silumina
I have known Chamara for the past 10 years. I first met him when he was working for Rivira. He was always a good and inspiring friend to me. He was the kind of person who questioned the existing system and principles and most importantly, he had broad ideas and views on every issue. Chamara had very deep thoughts and they were more than what we could ever imagine.
He was one of the finest editors with academic qualifications. He had the talent to cater to both younger and older generations. There was a drastic increase in the circulation of Silumina after he joined and we all rejoiced.
Chamara was given an official vehicle for his use, but he never used that.
He preferred taking the public transport and enjoyed mingling with people. As far as I know, he never misused his contacts or the positions he held.
****
Jayasiri Jayasekara - Chief Sub-Editor, Resa
I did not know Chamara personally before I joined Resa. He contacted me through one of my friends and asked whether I would like to join him to start a new paper. At that time, I had lost all interest in making a change through the media because in my experience the content of a paper depends on who runs it. But when I told Chamara about my perception towards the media, he immediately shook hands with me and said he felt the same.
It was Chamara and his determination to make a change that inspired me to get into the field again. After we started working together, I actually understood his potential. He was the strength of the paper. He always wanted to do something different and not what everyone else does.
Chamara had a vision to change the perception of people about religious and ethnic differences. Even though the paper is in Sinhala, he wanted to address all people irrespective of their religious and ethnic differences. He ensured that we published balanced articles. He asked us to work independently and give our best to the paper.
Especially, the Resa covered the Digana issue in a balanced manner and the Muslim Media Forum officially informed us that they wish to present an award to Resa for engaging in just and fair reporting. He is not alive to hear the news or receive the award.
I liked his approach and supported him in every way. He would have made a real change if he was alive for some more decades. I do not think anyone can fill the void left by him.
****
Thimbiriyagama Bandara - Features Editor, Resa
I have been in the media field for the past 30 years. I did know Chamara before by name, but only met him personally at the Silumina in 2015. Since then, he was a good colleague and friend to me.
He often would tell me that people could get more work from me and he never failed to use me to the fullest.
He was a rare kind of journalist who was vocal about his personal opinions and views. I did not refuse when he requested me to join the Resa.
Chamaras idea was to bring give a new perspective to the paper. Not all editors are good managers, but Chamara was a good manager and a great editor. I am very sorry to have lost him. Today the accountability of media is being questioned from all sides, but Chamara always tried to balance it and give the readers a new angle to see everything.
****
Ranjith Kumara Samarakoon - Deputy Editor, Resa
I worked with him only for one year, but we had a close relationship. A lot of characters come into our lives, not many people become close to our hearts though.
Chamara was one of them, he is one person I never want to forget in my life. Among many media personalities, Chamara was a true journalist.
He made a huge change in the Silumina and wanted bring a huge change among the community through Resa. I would say that Resa was synonymous with Chamara.
His dream was to bring the Silumina and Resa to a good position and win the trust of the people. I think he was the youngest editor ever at Silumina. It was his sacrifice and toil which gave Resa a unique identity. Chamaras life journey was quick and fast, but it was a remarkable one. He did everything possible in a very short period of time. He was a person who was dreaming of a long journey in the field of journalism.
****
Shivanthi Fernando - News Editor, Resa
I met Chamara Aiya when I joined Resa. Even though I did not know him personally before, I started reading his articles when I was at school. I have worked with many editors, but he was a very unique person. There was so much to learn from him.
When our news editor left recently, Chamara Aiya called me and asked whether I would also leave Resa. I assured him that I will not do that. But it was so unfortunate, he left everything and went before all of us.
I was shocked when I heard that he passed away. He had so many plans to improve the paper and bring it to a good position. Chamara Aiya started Resa in his own style, and it was totally new to us and eventually we adapted to it. He never forgot to encourage the upcoming journalists and lift them up.
****
M. Seneviratne - Head of Layout, Resa
Chamara approached me to talk about a new paper. I liked his idea and expressed my willingness to join. He is a very flexible person and he gave me opportunities to voice my opinions as well. He was a friend more than an editor to all. He was a good manager too.

A girl and a man were arrested by the Negombo Crimes Division for attempting to obtain a Rs. 10 million ransom from the girls father.
The 16-year-old girl and her 25-year-old boyfriend had gone to a lodge at Eththukal, Negombo on June 28 and had contacted her mother via the girls mobile and demanded a ransom claiming that she had been abducted. She had told the mother that if they complain to the Police, she (the girl) will be harmed. However, the parents had later complained to Negombo police.
The parent had eventually managed to negotiate the ransom and agreed to pay a million rupees. Later, police received a tip-off that the abducted student was abandoned at the Batapaththala area. According to police sources, upon hearing that the parent had complained to the police, the man had brought the girl on his motorcycle and left her at the Batapaththala area.

Damsel deciphered
The identical nature of all the portraits on the Sigiriya Mirror Wall led HCP Bell to believe that King Kassapa hired the services of one painter. That conclusion came to be a matter of dispute among local scholars including Professor Senarat Paranavitana. If we are to accept Bells opinion, Professor Paranavitana warns, it means that King Kassapa had used the rock cavity as a portrait gallery of the queens and princesses of his court.
According to Dr Raja de Silva, a former Archaeological Commissioner, the king commissioned a master artiste to paint innumerable females of a specified class in a certain coherent understandable theme and would have set about his work accordingly. When the stage was set for the actual painting process, the master painter and his atelier would have commenced work high up on scaffoldings erected by the prepared surface of the great rock.
Dr Benille Priyanka
The Sigiriya paintings, 19 in all preserved in two caves on the western rock face, were discovered over a century ago. The paintings are almost identical with women carrying flowers. If these women turned out to be court ladies for Bell, they were mere celestial nymphs for Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy.
In John Stills words, the whole face of the hill appears to have been a gigantic picture gallery... the largest picture in the world perhaps. The paintings that cover an area 140 metres long and 40 metres high are referred to in the graffiti. Professor Senarat Paranavitana deciphered 685 graffiti in 1956.
Deciphering the ancient text is a tough job. It explains why no one dared to resume Paranavitanas job. Not until Benille Priyanka undertook the job for his doctoral research in 2002. Dr Benille Priyanka has deciphered 400 new graffiti in addition to the Paranavitana collection.
Dr Priyanka received his MSc in Archaeology from the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology, the University of Kelaniya in 1992. He obtained the MA Degree in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures from the University of California, Los Angeles, specialising in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian Languages and Civilisations. He read for the PhD at the same University. In 2002, he was awarded the esteemed Chancellors Award for Postdoctoral Research in 2002 for his research on the hitherto undeciphered script of the Indus Valley Civilisation.
Dr Benille Priyankas attempt is to introduce new archaeological evidence for parallels of Sigiriya paintings  in its subject matter and motifs  from different regions of Asia. His observation is that these parallels hold a secular nature. Although he agrees with the conclusion that the Sigiriya damsels are court ladies, Dr Priyanka maintains that the same figures were drawn on the western rock face to portray them as celestial nymphs. Dr S U Deraniyagala, former Director General of Archaeology Department, identifies Dr Priyankas observations as thought-provoking. They compel the reader to look beyond the seas and re-think their perceptions on Sigiriya, Dr Deraniyagala notes.
I wanted to introduce new archaeological evidence which appears to be close to the subject matter of the Sigiriya paintings. This evidence comes from Persia, Siberia (Central Asia), Afghanistan, Northwest India and Sri Lanka covering a wide area of Asia. Much of this evidence is older than the Sigiriya Period (5th Century AD). It goes on to suggest that subject matter parallel to Sigiriya paintings have been popular in a wide area of Asia much before Sigiriya, Dr Priyanka notes.
Apparently, Sigiriya is a gigantic creation which has attracted a number of international artistic and architectural elements. Dr Priyanka has published two works, one slim and the other voluminous, to present these ideas. The two publications are titled Meanings of the Sigiriya Paintings: Based on Recent Archaeological Evidence and Recently Deciphered Records from the Mirror Wall at Sigiriya.
I noticed this new evidence for the first time in 1998 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) while I was researching for my PhD in archaeology. This evidence was contained in a number of journals and books. Some of these publications may not be easily available in Sri Lanka. This new evidence I hope will be helpful to get a better understanding of Sigiriya and its renowned paintings, Dr Priyanka adds.
With the permission from Archaeology Department, Dr Priyanka has included the 19 surviving paintings of Sigiriya in his publication.
****
The theory put forward by Dr Senarat Paranavitana is that King Kashyapa built Sigiriya to resemble the Alakamanda of Kuvera (Paranavitana 1961: 387). According to Hindu and Buddhist literature, Kuvera is the god of wealth. His abode Alakamanda was on the summit of Mount Kailash in the Himalayas. The heavenly abode Alakmanda in the sky is surrounded by lightning (vijju) and clouds (megha). So after a lengthy discussion of the paintings, Paranavitana proposed that the golden coloured damsels painted on the Sigiriya rock are symbolic of lightning (vijju), and the dark coloured damsels are symbolic of clouds (megha) surrounding the Alakamanda of god Kuvera.
These different points of view have contributed to the debate on the meaning and symbolism of the Sigiriya paintings. Both Paranavitana and Coomaraswamy have depended on literary evidence from Hindu and Buddhist literature for their theories on the Sigiriya paintings but not considered the archaeological evidence adequately on the subject.
Some archaeological evidence I have recently observed regarding the Sigiriya paintings appear to be helpful to provide a more pragmatic interpretation of the meaning of these damsels. This evidence concerns two main themes occurring damsel holding flowers in her hands accompanied by a handmaid.
The above-mentioned archaeological evidence is found from Persia ca 5th Century BC, Siberia in Central Asia ca 4th Century AD and different regions from northwest India ca 3rd  4th centuries AD. These areas are a part of a substantially large region of Asia. There is also one example from Sri Lanka found in a village named Kuttapitiya in the Palmadulla area (Ratnapura District). It is a carnelian intaglio found from a gem pit, dated to the 4th Century AD. It is also about 100 years older than the Sigiriya paintings. - Sigiriya paintings

Dissanayake challenges Rajapaksa to submit sworn affidavit
Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake challenged Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa to submit a sworn affidavit stating that he did not receive Chinese funds during his Presidential campaign in 2014.
The often spoken about subject these days is that Mahinda Rajapaksa received USD 7.6 million from the Chinese during the last Presidential election. Why would a Chinese company give such a large sum to Rajapaksa We never got such money. I ask you, our country was under British imperialism then, is it now under Chinese imperialism We do not wish any wrong on Rajapaksa. He worked for the country and helped finish the war. So we say, give us a sworn affidavit saying that you did not take this money, then we can trust you.
The minister said thus at a UNP pocket meeting held in Ragala.
The minister as the National Organizer of the UNP, spoke to the people about the challenges ahead for the party and explained that the UNP - as the oldest party in the country - has for the last 70 years created exceptional leaders.
The party does not revolve around one family. It is open for all and they can start from the bottom going up to the Presidency.
The SLPP is fighting among themselves over who should run for the Presidency; will it be Basil, Chamal or Gota; because they will not let any other, from outside of the family contest, he added.
But we have to come out of this tribal mentality. We will name our candidate when the time is right. We have jockeys who can win. We have jockeys from the upcountry- we have no problem. The Presidency is not limited to one family.
Last time, even with a weak electoral campaign, we were able to win 33 percent of the vote. As the National Organizer, my duty is to increase this to 40 percent. I admit there are certain misgivings among the UNP supporters. We need a programme to support our supporters. And we hope to do this in the near future, added the minister.

Diverse issues of the development drive
It is an accepted fact that at independence Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was called then had a stable economy, although there was much to be desired by way of structural reforms. Other countries looked forward to Sri Lanka as a model and aspired to reach its level of development. Today, seven decades later we see that halfway through they overtook us and we are aspiring to emulate them and reach their present level in the 2020s or by 2030.
Obviously, something had gone wrong somewhere. Nay, many things have gone wrong, apparently. This is an attempt to recollect some random thoughts concerning certain aspects of development that the writer had witnessed as a citizen during the last 60 or 70 years. Not being an economist or having any claims to the specialised knowledge they would be far more mundane observations.
What strikes at first is that we have failed to manage our economy to benefit from its early advantages- abundant material and human resources and rectify its shortcomings such as monoculture and low technology. While political changes were made slowly and reluctantly at first - Ceylonization and institutionalization - more radical steps such as nationalization and diversification of external economic relations came later. On the economic front changes were slower or non-existent with the continuation of the colonial structure and form.
Scientific approach to development
The lack of a scientific approach to development as well as the absence of planning is two more fundamental weaknesses that still persist to date.
The jumbo-sized Cabinet of Ministers with portfolios being duplicated or triplicated on the flimsiest excuse to suit personalities or political parties is a fine example betraying the unscientific understanding of development concerns of the country. For example, there are regional development ministries in addition to one at the national level. Ministers are saddled with portfolios that are as different as cheese from chalk.
Development at best is considered in bits and pieces. For example, it has been the practice to flood isolated regions such as Polonnaruwa or Hambantota and develop them fast and in certain respects prematurely whereas more backward areas remain unassisted. White elephant structures to enhance the egos of politicians are also a case in point.
Priorities have never been focused on scientifically.
Recently there was a news item that said that 57,000 computers in Mahindodaya Laboratories provided to schools have broken down and are lying unrepaired. Obviously, there was no plan to provide maintenance facilities, which the poor schools cannot afford on their own. This is another aspect of isolated development activities. While the building and initial equipping of them was considered a high political priority the maintenance of the institutions was not even an interest of the school or education authorities. Pragmatic and cost-effective ways are still possible using the already existing human and material resources at the command of the education authorities if they so desire.
This brings us to the need for a holistic approach to development. The economy is a complex of relations extending to diverse fields which are related to one another. Hence to separate them is artificial. They have to be considered in unison. For example, transport and education are two fields that exert an influence on agriculture. Similarly, it is connected to communications. The high price of vegetables and rice, for example, is partly due to high transport costs which demand structural changes in the transport sector. Nor is it independent of the level of technological development and human resource development.
National needs and priorities
This underlines the need for national planning. The institutions of national planning have been abandoned and the market is considered in blind faith as the ultimate arbitrator of everything. However, nowhere do the latter totally control an economy without state regulation in some sphere or other according to national needs and priorities. To put it differently, faith in market fundamentalism, a moribund trend under present-day capitalism is still fancied by our local Thatcherites and Reaganites.
It must also be mentioned that there has been a tendency to follow the example of Singapore or some other country. The problem is Sri Lanka has a different socio-economic background, resources and potential which demand a unique approach of its own.
It has been our misfortune to be deceived by Western definitions of developmental criteria. It was long believed that the GDP is a reliable index of development. It is not, especially in view of the human aspect that is overlooked by it. Statistical averages do not reflect realities on the ground. A high GDP could co-exist with an equally high inequality in the distribution of national wealth or income. Moreover, it has been observed that increase of GDP is accompanied by a higher concentration of income at upper brackets. For example, in Sri Lanka, the upper 10 per cent of the households earn as much as the lower 50 per cent does.
No development that does not guarantee equity in resource distribution and income could be considered perfect. The human element in development has to be counted. Development that cannot guarantee a minimum standard of living for the poor, a development the benefits of which do not reach the masses is worth the name development.
Futuristic vision
In this situation, various solutions are proposed. One is an appeal to retreat into a past golden age, often under pre-capitalist relations of servitude. It is impossible to go back. Mankind is on a progressive path of development albeit with its temporary periods of regression. That is how he has advanced from the Stone Age to nuclear age. From the club and axe to Super Computers and digital technology. Development needs not looking back but a futuristic vision.
Another popular slogan is that development begins at home and should start at home. This amounts to the society and the economy into infinitesimals with each unit being independent and guided only by the welfare of its own members. But the society of varied comprising various individuals and groups with diverse and even contradictory aims, objectives and interests. The mere addition of these individual development efforts would not produce a desired social development. Nor could it replace the class divisions and class struggle. It would only be a nave dream.
Only a vision that could ensure a minimum human living condition for the poor and marginalized sections of the population could be rationally termed development. This would require the development of altruistic principles of social co-operation and social goodness instead of self- interest and personal aggrandizement or the elimination of tanha, in Buddhist terminology.
With such an economic philosophy there will be no place for discrimination on grounds of race, religion, social status, gender etc. There will be peace on earth and goodwill among all men and women.

Education a weapon against poverty: Faiszer
Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha, addressing a programme held at the Sports Ministry's Duncan White Auditorium, said one of the main reasons for him to enter into politics, was to provide strength and guidance through education to underprivileged children in both cities and villages.
The event was organised in order to award scholarships to poor children through the Ape Daruwo scholarship scheme in honour of his 49th birthday which fell yesterday.
One-hundred and five children who had successfully completed their G. C. E. Ordinary Level Examination were awarded scholarships through the scheme which falls under the Faiszer Musthapha Foundation.
Minister Musthapha, addressing the children and parents, said, "My father succeeded in providing me with a sound education. However, my grandfather was a poor child from a rural village in Madawala. He used to say that he walked about seven miles to school on a daily basis and studied with great difficulty."
"In that era, it was a challenge for rural youth to practice as Attorneys-at-Lawyer at Kandy courts. However, my grandfather succeeded in becoming one of the most outstanding lawyers in the Kandy courts," he added.
The Minister said, "Today, two generations are enlightened because of my grandfather's decision. That is why I want to share something with you children. Education is the only weapon against poverty. Unfortunately, your parents think that they cannot move forward due to poverty. We can conquer the world through education."
"We are ready to give you a hand. I have great expectations to bring about change through politics. We provided scholarships through Ape Daruwo to 55 children and 45 of them had been qualified to enter into universities. We must give our children the opportunity as our children are capable," he said.
Former Sri Lankan Cricketer Roshan Mahanama also participated in the event and presented studens with certificates.

England hope different mindset will conquer penalty curse
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Sunday: England have projected this World Cup as a fresh start for a new generation but the teams record of failure in penalty shoot-outs may not be so easy to forget.
Penalties have been the death of England at six of the last 12 major tournaments and in that time, they have won only once, against Spain at Euro 96.
Gareth Southgates playing career was defined by the shot he side-footed into the hands of Andreas Kopke as England then lost in the semi-finals at Wembley to Germany.
I have had a couple of decades thinking it through, Southgate said last week.
His experience has informed his own approach now as coach, with a last 16 tie against Colombia to come on Tuesday and the possibility of penalties looming again.
Southgate was in the World Cup squad in 1998 under Glenn Hoddle, who believed shoot-outs were a lottery, impossible to replicate in training and therefore not worth any form of practice.
England duly lost to Argentina on spot-kicks and missed out on the quarter-finals.
If there is one thing Southgate has been determined to drill into the preparation of his players, it is that penalty shoot-outs are not decided by chance.
Its definitely not chance, Marcus Rashford said from Englands training base in Repino on Sunday.
Its a skill and every skill takes time to learn and to perfect. Its never a chance. Its just about being able to perform it with pressure.
England have been practising penalties since March. The players rehearse the walk from the halfway line as well as their shot. Southgate has deployed video analysts and psychometric testing to gauge his most reliable takers.
There have been occasions where you even tell the goalkeepers which way youre going so it has to be the perfect penalty, Rashford said.
Englands goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has saved five out of 30 penalties faced during matches, a similar record to his two back-ups, Jack Butland, whose record is four from 25, and Nick Pope, who is three from 13.
It is standard practice now for keepers to study their opponents habits, even if Pickford was left stumped when Tunisias Ferjani Sassi stepped up in Englands opening match.
The lad who scored it had never taken a pen before. I was struggling with where to go, Pickford said. I got fingertips on it and went the right way, which is promising.
Belgiums Thibaut Courtois has suggested Pickford, at 1.85 metres tall, carries a disadvantage but Colombias stopper David Ospina is even smaller at 1.83 metres.
England might take heart too from Ospinas record. In spot-kicks awarded during games, he has saved only three out of 38 and one in his last 15. In shoot-outs, he helped Colombia past Peru in the Copa America two years ago by blocking Miguel Traucos effort with his legs.
For England, half the battle will surely be mental. How heavy will the past weigh on the present
We cant change the past, its gone now, Rashford said.
All we can look forward to is what is in front of us and I dont think we ever think about that type of thing with England. It would put you on a bit of a downer.
We understand it but that record is definitely not something that is on our minds.
Rashford said he would be willing to put his hand up, as did Dele Alli when he was asked on Saturday.
Harry Kane, who slammed two penalties into the top corner against Panama, would certainly be one of the five, while Jamie Vardy, who takes them for Leicester, is an option off the bench.
Jordan Henderson, Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker could also be on Southgates list.
You have to control it, you have to own it, Alli said. Im confident in myself and whats meant to be will be.
Weve got to try to work hard on the penalties and we have been, were trying to own the situation, not let it own us. Its changed the whole mindset for us.  AFP

The coastline in Nintavur in the Ampara District is gradually being eroded.
People in Nintavur depend on fishing and agriculture for their livelihood. Coconut gardens, buildings, and houses are being destroyed day by day. Farming lands, especially for cattle farming and paddy and other crops, are filled with sea water.
The people of this area want relevant authorities to visit the places where erosion is being experienced to take measures to check this phenomenon.
People say that the construction of the Oluvil Harbour is the main cause for the level of erosion that is taking place.

Fairway Holding to invest Rs 4 bn in housing, leisure and aviation sectors
Fairway Holding will be investing a further Rs. 4 billion to build apartments, hotels and to develop the domestic aviation sector, Chairman Managing Director of the Group, Hemaka De Alwis told the Daily News Business.
He added that the company has already invested Rs. 1.8 billion for three projects namely Fairway Hotel Colombo Fort (which is now in operation), Fairway Galle Apartments and Fairway Hotel in Galle (20 apartment style rooms). The projects in Galle are scheduled to be opened at the end of this year.
We also have plans to build a 120-roomed hotel in Unawatuna for which we have obtained the land.
He said that he is upbeat on the islands current status of the real estate and tourism sectors. The trend will continue with the prospects of the Colombo Port City project. Referring to the present market trends for apartments, he said, I see better prospects in the mid-market for apartments as there may be an oversupply of high-end apartments.
In contrast, I see an increasing demand from the middle class for apartments below the price of Rs. 21 million.  Fairway has already invested in apartments in Galle (Aqua Vista which comprises a high-rise luxury tower with 20 floors comprising 120 units). Their latest project is in Kurunegala with an investment of Rs. 400 million. Soon we will stamp our Fairway apartment footsteps in other regions as well.
De Alwis commenting on the leisure sector said that they still see a demand for the US$ 60 a room bed and breakfast category especially in Colombo. Our first city hotel Fairway Fort is very successful as we see more yields in this segment.
We will invest over Rs. 1. 1 billion to build a similar hotel in Pettah near the City Traffic police building in Fort. This would offer 400 rooms on 14 floors and it would be branded as Minerva.
While offering luxury, we are also concerned about the budget traveler. Hence we are also building a tourist hostel in Fort with over 100 beds. We hope to sell a bed at the rate of US$ 30 per night, De Alwis said. He is of the view that Colombo needs more entertainment options. We have also acquired some entrainment establishments in Colombo and are in the process of turning them around.
The group is also looking at the opportunities to break into the aviation industry. We see a demand for a domestic airline to service the East and the cultural triangle. We want to get a 30-seater aircraft from the US on a wet lease and we will also include a stop over to Mattala airport to cater to Deep South tourists and entrepreneurs. Our plans for the aviation sector also include a flying school.

Falcao out to issue sharp reminder to England
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Monday: Robbed of his World Cup dream by injury four years ago, Colombia captain Radamel Falcao has at last realised his childhood dream and has a point to prove against England.
Falcaos nine goals in qualifying carried the team to a first World Cup for 16 years in Brazil before an ungainly challenge by a schoolteacher in the French Cup in January 2014 inflicted cruciate ligament damage and blew his career off course.
El Tigre (The Tiger) was one of the worlds most feared strikers. His $70 million move to Monaco from Atletico Madrid six months earlier was reportedly intended to be a stopgap for a season before he headed to Real Madrid, given the difficulties of directly crossing the divide in the Spanish capital.
Instead, Colombias all-time top scorer had to sit and watch alone in a Monaco apartment, completing his rehabilitation as his country went further than ever before at a World Cup.
James Rodriguez was crowned Colombias new golden boy as he won the Golden Boot with six goals and was only stopped by some robust Brazilian tactics in the quarter-finals.
In trying to rush back in time to make the World Cup in 2014, Falcao only put more strain on his body and ultimately prolonged his recovery time.
Despite doubts over his fitness, his reputation remained intact. Manchester United and then Chelsea were tempted to take a punt on paying his wages for loan spells.
In 41 games in England over two campaigns, though, the once-prolific Falcao scored just five goals.
There are times when one breaks down, he told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo of his time in England. There are difficult situations that one cannot contain and like any human being, I cried.
Only once back in Monaco and given a regular run in the team to find his fitness and form did the old Falcao return.
He scored 30 goals, leading a prodigiously talented group of youngsters, including Kylian Mbappe, to beat big-spending Paris Saint-Germain to the French title in 2016-17 and to the Champions League semi-finals.
Its all about confidence and having a regular run in the team, Falcao told UEFA.com. A footballer never forgets how to play football. Im convinced that game time, matches, was all I needed because ultimately no one forgets how to score goals.
England defender Gary Cahill has seen Falcao at his best and worst. Cahill was on the receiving end of what the Colombian describes as one of his top-five performances when he scored a first-half hat-trick as Atletico thrashed Chelsea in the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, and also played with him at at Stamford Bridge. He had frustrations clearly in England, said Cahill. But hes shown good character, hes found his form and hes banging goals in again.
The goal Falcao most dreamed of came one week ago, at the age of 32, as he scored for the first time at a World Cup to launch Colombia towards the last 16 in a 3-0 win over Poland. Its the goal Ive been dreaming of since I was a child, he said. I realise that all of Colombia had been waiting for this moment, supporting me, lifting me at difficult times, and in the end I want to thank the Colombian people for being with me unconditionally.
With James facing a race against time to be fit, it is now Falcaos turn to carry Colombian hopes and persuade any remaining English doubters that he is back to being the striker the world once feared in Moscow on Tuesday.  AFP

Federer, Serena lead Wimbledon against World Cup
London, Monday: Roger Federer and Serena Williams bring the curtain up on Wimbledon Monday with the All England Club confident their tournament can comfortably capture the imagination of a public distracted by the World Cup.
Federer, the record eight-time champion, opens proceedings on Centre Court against Serbia's Dusan Lajovic.
Williams, meanwhile, has been shunted off to Court One where she tackles Dutch outsider Arantxa Rus.
The American returns to the tournament for the first time since claiming a seventh title in 2016 having missed last year to give birth to her daughter.
"I think it remains a little bit nerve-wracking. It's a big deal," said Federer on returning to Centre Court and who is marking the 15th anniversary of his first Wimbledon title in 2003.
"Besides the history and the mythical place that it is, you cannot also practice on it.
"The entire atmosphere changes at Wimbledon, and you realise the eyes are on you."
World number 57 Lajovic will know what to expect -- the Serb was beaten by Federer in straight sets in the second round of Wimbledon in 2017.
Federer is the overwhelming favourite to lift a ninth title and 21st career major especially with old rival Rafael Nadal, fresh from an 11th French Open, not having played a grass court warm-up event.
The 36-year-old Swiss star's odds also improved when two-time champion Ansy Murray withdrew on Sunday with injury.
Three-time winner Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, is still struggling with form and confidence so badly bruised by the elbow injury he suffered at Wimbledon 12 months ago.
However, even Federer cannot escape the giant shadow cast on the sporting landscape by the ongoing World Cup.
He was even dragged into a discussion on Sunday over whether or not he and Nadal -- 10 years after their epic All England Club final -- could be likened to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
"Sure, yeah. They have a long-standing rivalry. I have the same with Rafa," Federer said.
"They're very different from one another. I guess there's some similarities there as well."
The All England Club will stick to its policy of refusing to show World Cup matches on its giant screen adjacent to Court One.
The men's final, meanwhile, will still start at 2pm local time as scheduled on Sunday, July 15 -- just two hours before the World Cup final kicks off in Moscow.
Williams, seeded 25 this year despite a ranking of 181, has never played Rus, the world 107 who made the third round in 2012 but failed to get out of qualifying on her last three visits.
Monday's other Centre Court matches see Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki face Varvara Lepchenko of the United States.
Bulgarian sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov, a semi-finalist in 2014, completes the programme against three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka.
Also getting their campaigns underway on Monday are five-time women's champion Venus Williams against Johanna Larsson.
Third seeded Marin Cilic, the runner-up to Federer in 2017 and this year's Queen's champion, takes on Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka. AFP

FIFA says video reviews have been 99.3 percent correct
MOSCOW , Monday: FIFA says video reviews are "close to perfection" at the first World Cup to use the system, claiming 99.3 percent of "match-changing" plays were called correctly.
Don't tell that to some of the coaches still angry about a few penalties, fouls or cards that were or weren't handed out.
The system has had a major impact, with seven penalties awarded using the Video Assistant Referee system. Two goals were given after being initially ruled offside, including one by South Korea that helped to eliminate world champion Germ any.
FIFA's referee committee head Pierluigi Collina claimed Friday that 99.3 percent of "match-changing" decisions were called correctly at the World Cup  "very, very close to perfection"  based on assessments by him and other senior ex-referees. Without VAR, the figure would be 95 percent, Collina said.
That missing 0.7 percent in Collina's statistic is still bitterly contentious.
Serbia's coach suggested a referee should be sent to a war-crimes tribunal when his team didn't get a penalty after two Swiss defenders appeared to hold Aleksandar Mitrovic in the penalty area . English media complained about Tunisian defenders grappling with striker Harry Kane .
Collina didn't address those plays directly, but suggested they prompted a warning to referees to be stricter about holding in the penalty area.
"I think you might have appreciated that at a certain point of the group phase there were some incidents which suddenly disappeared," he said.
"We had some holdings and they almost disappeared, but if they continued they were punished with the corresponding decision."
That's an example of the refereeing system being "fine-tuned," Collina said.
VAR means players and viewers expect more from referees. FIFA's head of refereeing Massimo Busacca expressed frustration about the interest in errors. "Today you are asking to be God, perfect," he said. "Who is perfect in this life"
On the whole, FIFA views VAR's rollout as a success.
Before the World Cup, there were concerns about referees who hadn't used the system before, about slower games and pedantic rulings on minor fouls. However, FIFA says the ball has been in play for longer than at the last World Cup and total fouls are down through 48 games.
The VAR crews, wearing full referee kit in a darkened room on the outskirts of Moscow, are urged to view incidents at normal speed so they aren't too harsh on slight contact between players. They can use slow-motion to find the point of contact, but normal speed to decide how serious it was.
"Everything with slow-mo or super slow-mo seems bigger, seems tougher, seems more deliberate," Collina said. "Football is a sport where contact doesn't mean a foul."
The VAR crews have examined 335 incidents  6.9 per game  including all the goals, but flagged only 17 for formal review. Fourteen decisions were changed and three were upheld.
Collina said he hopes for VAR discussions between referees and the control room to be part of TV broadcasts in future. However, FIFA's deputy secretary general Zvonimir Boban immediately pushed back against that idea, saying the mix of languages at the World Cup could make it "impossible" for broadcasters.
The more VAR is used, the more players demand it. Players and coaches are constantly drawing a TV screen with their fingers at this World Cup, but Collina said referees should only book players if it's meant to be "disrespectful."
Referees themselves aren't allowed to speak with reporters, but FIFA says they welcome VAR.
"In some situations, I prayed a lot when something occurred. I said 'My God, what happened' And then, at the end I was lucky in very difficult circumstances. Sometimes I decided without seeing, only made an interpretation from distance," said Busacca, who had a long refereeing career including two World Cups.
"What we want to give to the referees is this big opportunity not to be lucky." - Agencies

FIFA World Cup: What happens in knock-outs in case there is a tie
The knock-out stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup started on Saturday as France overcame Argentina and Uruguay downed Portugal.
It's a do-or-die battle in the knock-outs as there is no possibility of a draw.
So what happens if a knock-out fixture ends as a tie after 90 minutes
Let's look at the rules regarding tie-breakers.
THE EXTRA-TIME POST THE 90 MINUTES
EXTRA-TIME
In the group game, if two teams draw a fixture, then both sides are awarded equal points (1).
But in the knock-outs post the 90-minute period, the match enters extra-time.
There are two halves in the extra-time period of 15 minutes each.
We see a total of 30 minutes of football and the team which gets the winning goal progresses.
WHAT IF THE SCORE-LINE REMAINS SAME AFTER EXTRA-TIME
SCENARIO
Even after extra-time, if the two teams remain level in terms of goals scored, then the match enters the penalty shootout phase.
Five players are allowed to take the penalties.
After 5 penalties, if the score-line reads the same for both the teams, then the spot-kick battle continues until a team gets one more than the opponent.
GERMANY THE KING OF PENALTIES
GERMANS
Germans have been the masters of shoot-outs.
They have won four World Cup matches which were determined by the shoot-outs.
They have also scored 15 penalties in a row during the shoot-out in these four campaigns.
Argentina come second aftera claiming four wins from five attempts.
England have a poor record after failing to win even one of their three shoot-outs.
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE PENALTY SHOOT-OUTS
PENALTIES
In 1990, 2006 and 2014, four matches in the knock-out stages were determined by penalty shoot-outs.
Since 1978, a total of 26 matches have been decided by penalty shoot-outs.
In 2014, Argentina beat Netherlands 4-2 via penalties after their semis match ended 0-0 after extra-time.
Italy beat France 5-3 in penalty shoot-outs in the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.  Newsbytes

Tokyo, Monday: Japan's "Ice Prince" and two-time Olympic figure skating gold medallist Yuzuru Hanyu accepted one of his country's top awards Monday, pledging to be more than an "ordinary skater". The 23-year-old, wearing a sombre, traditional male kimono emblazoned with his family crest -- a far cry from his flamboyant competition wear -- said the award was a tribute to his team and would propel him to new heights.
"An award like this is not something that I could achieve all alone. I received this award representing so many people who have helped me and created the environment for me," he said.
"I cannot be just an ordinary skater or individual, having received this wonderful award." The clean-cut skater, who has legions of adoring fans, also pledged to maintain his squeaky clean image.
"I will pay attention to my private life and other things, so that I will live a life where no one can talk behind my back." Japan's People's Honour Award is one of the country's top prizes, awarded to the likes of film director Akira Kurosawa, and Hanyu is the youngest ever individual recipient. AFP

The surfing season is drawing a large number of foreign tourists to Arugam Bay in the Ampara District.
The beach isnt the only attraction in the area. The surrounding countryside with its quaint villages, the mangroves, jungle, lagoon, river, rice fields and dunes are also attractions for tourists.
The surfing season in Arugam Bay starts in April and ends in October. During the season, the wind is predominantly offshore. Two kilometers inland from Arugam Bay is the scenic Pottuvil Lagoon.
The Pottuvil Lagoon tour by local fishermen is another popular offering for foreign tourists visiting Arugam Bay.
The season for off-shore dolphin viewing at Arugam Bay beach is from May to September, the high season in Arugam Bay.
Twelve kilometres south of Arugam Bay is Panama, the last inhabited village that precedes the Yala East National Park.
Panama is somewhat inland, yet intersects with lagoons rich in bird life.
Arugam Bay is located 320 km from Colombo and can be reached within seven hours via Moneragala. Arugam Bay beach, a wide, sweeping sandy beach in front of Ulla village is an attraction for swimming all year round.

The fourth industrial revolution has already begun
The first industrial revolution started in 1760. This revolution makes a milestone in history as it marked the era of mechanization. In this period, people tried to understand how to use the deferent energy sources. The steam engine and looming the machine are the valuable inventions in this period.
The world is changing every day. We are at the beginning of the revolution which is fundamental changes of our day to day life. With the advancement of technologies, everything is shape out and complicated than before; this transformation may be difficult to understand, affordable to the human being.
The technology breakthroughs, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum computing, etc. indicate the new revolution has begun. It is the 4th industrial revolution (4IR).
How the industrial revolutions changed our world
The first industrial revolution started in 1760. This revolution makes a milestone in history as it marked the era of mechanization. In this period, people tried to understand how to use the deferent energy sources. The steam engine and looming the machine are the valuable inventions in this period.
The period during the first industrial revolution, we can see the rise of industries mechanized by steam energy and water, development of textile industry, evolving stages of metallurgy, and metal works. The second industrial revolution was utilizing the oil, gas, and electricity. Furthermore, most valuable innovations happened during this era in the field of communication, transport, and manufacturing. The invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse in the 1800s made the foundation of todays communication.
Antonio Meucci, an Italian immigrant, began developing the design of a talking telegraph in 1849. However, many people believe today; Alexander Graham Bell was the one who invented the telephone. In 1802, Humphry Davy invented the first electric light. Again, Edison wasnt the person behind the first light bulb.
The Internet and renewable energies are beginning to merge to create a new infrastructure for a third industrial revolution. It will change the way communication and power distribution in the world. The internet has reduced the marketing communication cost significantly, in the same way, the automation also reduces the labour cost and improved the production efficiency.
This is what the fourth industrial revolution looks like
An autonomous car is a vehicle that can guide itself without a driver. This kind of vehicle has become a reality and may pave the way for future systems where computers take over the art of driving. As technologies such as sensors and artificial intelligence in progress, the capabilities have shown for autonomous machines to improve at a rapid pace. Even today, the drones and submersibles are used in military applications.
One gram of thorium yields the energy of 28,000 liters of petrol and 8 grams are enough to drive a car in a lifetime. It is emission-free and environment-friendly. There are positive as well as negative arguments about this concept. However, it is much safer than uranium.
3D printing, also called additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. Most people think that 3D printing is a simple desktop document printing, but thats not the entire picture. 3D printing can be divided into metal, fabrics, bio and a whole host of other industries. The technology is being used in a broad range of applications, from giant wind turbines to small medical implants. The worldwide 3D printing industry is expected to grow from $3.07billon in revenue in 2013 to $12.8 billion by 2018, and exceed $21 million global income by 2020. 3D printing technology is expected to transform almost every significant industry and change the future of the people.
The strength and leadership of the manufacturing sector have given a significant contributor in both economic growth and economic recessions of a country. To increase the productivity of manufacturing sector and increase the economic growth, advanced robotics and artificial automation will pay the critical role. With advanced sensors, robots can understand and respond better to their environment and engage in an extended task even in household use.
Like many innovations, we have seen in first, second and third industrial revelations, in the fourth industrial revolution, it is guaranteed where the developments in new materials will lead. New materials can change the world. As we have seen the Bronze Age and the Iron Age as well as stainless steel, and silicon made products. The new class of materials, consisting of a different atomic structure, are emerging and offering numerous benefits than ever before. For instance, the advanced nanomaterials such as graphene, which is about 200-times stronger than steel, a million times thinner than a human hair, and an efficient conductor of heat and electricity. It could merely disrupt the manufacturing and infrastructure industries in the world.
Another critical aspect of the fourth industrial revolution is the internet of things (IoT), In its purest form, it can be described as a relationship between things such as products, services, places, etc. and its connectivity with the people, it possible to connect through the internet and various platforms. There are billions of smart devices around the word that are connected to the internet. This will alter the way in which customer ordering goods and services, manage supply chains by enabling us to monitor it online. It will change the entire industries from top to bottom.
The remote monitoring is an extensive application of the IoT. Any shipment can now be equipped with a sensor, transmitter or radio frequency identification (RFID) tag that allows a company to track where it is as it moves through the supply chain.
The impact
The fourth industrial revolution makes a tremendous impact on the world economy. It will increase the overall production and support the economic growth of the country. Automation and remote sensing are significant in the fourth industrial revolution, and human labour will not be the critical factor in the production process. Therefore, most of the investors will consider energy cost before taking the investment decision than the labour cost. Indeed, some countries developed their economy by supplying labour as the primary commodity, as a result of 4IR, they will end up with high unemployment.
Many Business Consultants expects that the Fourth Industrial Revolution change the role that companies play in society. When companies begin to adapt their business models to leverage with emerging technology, we can expect the paradigm shift of the company and overall operation. The top management of the company attempt to navigate the business in correct path to meet the business objectives in a new landscape.
Since companies entered the period of Fourth Industrial Revolution, their responsibilities are to empower and educate their employees to keep up with the pace of change. As the pace of technological change quickens, we need to be sure that employees are keeping up with the right skills to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. That applies to both technical and soft skills. There will be changes in both areas.

FR petition filed by Gnanasara Thera fixed for support on Oct. 15
A Fundamental Rights petition, filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera, was yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court on October 15.
Gnanasara Thera sought a declaration that the order given by the Homagama Magistrate to keep him in remand custody in 2016, is unlawful and is a violation of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution.
When the matter came up before Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, the petitioners counsel sought a further date to support the application.
Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to six-months rigorous imprisonment regarding this incident and he is currently out on bail following his appeal petition filed in the High Court against the conviction.
In his petition, Gnanasara Thera maintained that the statement made by him when getting ready to leave court on January 25, 2016, addressing complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda, can in no way amount to be a threat made to injure a person or her reputation, nor can it be said that the statement so made would cause alarm to a person.
The petitioner stated that on a complaint by Sandhya Ekneligoda on January 25, 2016 to Homagama Police, the first respondent, OIC Miscellaneous Complaints had arrested him and produced him before the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 26.
The petitioner stated that police alleged that he had committed an offence under Section 486 of the Penal Code.
He said upon being produced, the petitioner was remanded by the Magistrate until February 9 and then he was remanded till February 10, 2016.
He stated that police further alleged that he had committed offences under Section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act of no. 4 of 20. He said he was ordered to be further remanded till February 23.
The petitioner maintained that there was no justifiable reason for the Magistrate to make an order of remand with the statement so made in as much as such statement does not constitute an offence under Section 483 of the Penal Code and Section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva and Counsel Anusha Perusinghe appeared for Gnanasara Thera.

Glitter freckles on the dot!
Gone are the days when people were looking to get rid of freckles. Today, its not just about flaunting original but also fake freckles. These small brown spots that are naturally made-up, might seem like a strange concept in India as pale people with red hair are more likely to have them. But, it has become the make-up industrys biggest invention.
Inspired by the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markles wedding look, people all over the world seem to be pulling off this trend in a tasteful way. It goes well with many outfits and is suitable for parties, fashion shows, music festivals and other occasions.
****
How to get the glitter freckles:
1. Before starting, make sure your skin is fresh and radiant by exfoliating and then moisturising it well.
2: Add foundation to give some coverage to the skin, use a lightly tinted moisturising cream or a BB cream as a base layer.
3. Eyeliner or eyebrow pencils work best to dot the freckle. Ensure the tip is blunt in order to get the right shape. Create fake freckles by gently touching the pencil to the skin and twisting it. To make it look natural, you can spread it across your upper cheekbones and the bridge of your nose.
4. Blend the freckles into the skin by lightly pressing your finger over each pencil mark to evenly spread it out. It is important that the freckles dont look defined.
5. Set it with a translucent powder or bronzer to make it last longer.
6. To add the glitter finish, using a brush dab glitter over the dots. Experiment with different shades like rainbow, silver, iridescent and rose gold glitters to see what goes well with your look!

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is working hard to make Sri Lanka the country in the region with the best doctors, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said this was stated during the 92nd Election of the GMOA, held recently. It was decided there to fight against the ongoing foreign trade agreement racket and defeat it, similar to winning the fight against the SAITM racket, he said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA has also decided to stand by Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya, who is now being victimized by a well-planned conspiracy against him. The minimum standards of medical education should be legalized according to the recommendations made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), he said.
A period of one more month will be given to the Health Minister to gazette the rules and regulations and to hold elections for the four vacant positions in the SLMC. If he fails to do so, the GMOA will commence an island-wide protest and trade union action, he said.

Green cucumber promoted among farmers
The Agriculture Ministry has taken measures to promote green cucumber cultivation among local farmers as a private-public partnership project to meet the increasing demand for them in the international market.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the demand for green cucumber in the international market had increased by 2.7 percent annually. At present, the demand for green cucumber in the international market is 22,000 metric tons annually.
However, the contribution of Sri Lankan green cucumber to the international market is low.
The World Bank Assisted Agriculture Sector Modernization Project of the Agriculture Ministry signed an agreement with Hayleys (Pvt) Ltd and farmers of the Batticaloa District to cultivate green cucumber for the export market.
This cucumber variety is rising in demand as large international fast food chains commonly use this product.
Around 500 farmers will obtain funds to develop infrastructure and the irrigation facility through the project. The Agriculture Department will provide technical assistance to implement good agriculture practices.
Five hundred farmers will be divided into 50 groups and a farmers company will be formed for each group. In addition to cucumber cultivation, farmers will receive beehives to promote pollination. Selling honey will be an additional income from land used for cucumber cultivation, he said.
Hayleys (Pvt) Ltd has agreed to purchase the total production of the crop from farmers for a price agreed before every season. They have also agreed to provide storage facilities for farmers.

JLanka to introduce Trinahome, Smart Energy Management Solution
One of Lankas solar solutions providers, JLanka introduced Trinahome, Smart Energy Management Solution recently.
As market leaders, JLanka Technologies plays an important role in implementing the most efficient solar solutions through their partnerships with global solar industry leaders such as Trina Solar, ranked as a Tier 1 solar panel manufacturer and the most bankable PV module manufacturer in the world. One such innovative solution that will soon be introduced to the market through this partnership is Trinahome  a complete residential solar solution for the evolving energy consumer.
Drawing from 20 years of manufacturing excellence, Trina Solar has evolved from being a module manufacturer to a services and solutions provider in the global solar landscape. One such solution that has been successful across our home base in China is the Trinahome solution. stated Ms. Daphne Chee Chin Yee, the Trinahome Business Lead for Asia Pacific and Middle East during her visit to Sri Lanka recently.
With over 15,000 Trinahome units installed in China just last year, Trina Solar wished to explore the demand for the product across the Asia Pacific.
While the market size and accessibility to the source were key reasons why we approached countries such as India and Australia, Sri Lanka was a country that showed major progress in terms of solar policies. Since Trina Solar was already the leading solar panel used in Sri Lankan installations, we are collaborating with our local partner JLanka to introduce the Trinahome solution to the Sri Lankan market.
From solar panels to inverters, from the mounting system to grid box and cables, Trinahome contains the components (additional customization as per required) necessary to construct, install and operate a technologically advanced residential solar system.
What we at JLanka always emphasize is on the Balance of System (BoS) in a solar solution, Engineer Silva continued. This includes all components of the solar solution excluding the solar panels. We are looking at wiring, switches, the mounting system, the type and number of inverters, battery banks and battery charges. The Trinahome solar solution is one that guarantees the perfect BoS and installation standards. It is a compact, modular solution that will suit any residential energy need.
With a five year standard warranty for the Trinahome solution, we also offer a 10 year panel product warranty as well as a 25 year panel performance warranty.

Just like the Alien series
The tale of a morally compromised CIA agent (Josh Brolin), who teams with a Mexican associate (Benicio del Toro) and a plucky young agent (Emily Blunt) following some gruesome murders on this side of the border, it was the kind of stark, uncompromising movie that created a nearly unbearable level of tension and suspense with each passing moment. It was also the type of movie whose world was rich and expansive enough that it practically begged for a follow-up.
And that follow-up is finally here, in the form of Sicario: Day of the Soldado, a movie that reunites Brolin and del Toro (Blunt sat this one out), for a story of escalating violence in Mexico and the ways in which the American government both facilitates and reinforces that violence. And when things get out of hand, its up to del Toros Alejandro to make a very difficult choice.
The less you know going into the movie, the better. But it definitely delivers on the high-octane mixture of thrills and political intrigue that the first film provided, with even more insightful cultural commentary.
So you can imagine our thrill when we got to sit down with Stefano Sollima, the Italian director who took over for Villenueve and who made a movie all his own. Sollima has made a number of Italian crime movies and television series, and will next turn his attention to a big budget adaptation of beloved videogame franchise Call of Duty. Moviefone

Korean loans for 190 garbage collecting compactors
The Korean government has agreed to provide two concessional loans of USD 14 million (approximately Rs. 2,240 million) to supply 190 garbage collecting compactors to local authorities in keeping with the Korean governments target of strengthening local authorities with necessary equipment and technology to introduce modern solid waste management practices.
The signing of the loan agreement took place yesterday, at the Finance and Planning Ministry. The loan agreement was signed by Finance and Planning Ministry Secretary Dr. R H S Samarathunga and Chief Representative of the Export- Import Bank of Korea Jung Sung-soo.
The projects will be implemented by the Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Ministry.
An increasing volume of solid waste generated in the urban and suburban areas has become a nationwide problem and the rapid growth of population in urban areas, recent changes of consumption patterns and growing industrial and economic activities have directly associated with the problem.
Due to the present inadequate capacity for the collection and transportation of solid waste and outdated technology in handling solid waste by local authorities, various health and other hazardous situations have occurred in urban areas.
Currently, most of the garbage is being transported in open trailers attached to tractors. As a prerequisite to promote a sustainable solid waste management system, the capacity of waste collection and transportation of local authorities need to be improved.
In this context, the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of the Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) of Korea has agreed to provide two loans in Korean Won not exceeding the equivalent of US$ 14,000,000 to supply 190 garbage collecting compactors to improve the garbage collecting capacity of 84 local authorities in Sri Lanka.
The interest rate is 0 percent with a repayment period of 30 years, including a grace period of 10 years, according to a press release from the Korean Embassy.

## Title: LeBron James to join NBA Lakers in four-year, $154 million deal

LeBron James to join NBA Lakers in four-year, $154 million deal
LOS ANGELES, Monday - LeBron James is to join the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-year $154 million deal, his agents said Sunday, ending months of frenzied speculation about the NBA superstar's next career move.
The blockbuster contract sends the 33-year-old four-time NBA Most Valuable Player to one of the league's most iconic clubs, adding to the legacy of such legends as Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson.
"LeBron James, four time NBA MVP, three-time NBA finals MVP, 14-time NBA All-Star, and two-time Olympic gold medallist, has agreed to a four-year $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers," James' management company Klutch Sports Group said in a statement.
James is considered a rival of retired Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan for the title of greatest player in NBA history.
However, he had endured frustration with the Cleveland Cavaliers, culminating in last month's clean sweep defeat to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. James and the Cavaliers have been beaten in three out of four NBA Finals against the Warriors since 2015. James had been linked to several franchises, with the Philadelphia 76ers and Houston Rockets reportedly in the running. US media reports said the Lakers move was sealed following a meeting late Saturday between James and the team's president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson.
James, who has a home and production company in Los Angeles, now joins a club with money to spend and a desire to rebuild into a championship team. The Lakers have failed to reach the playoffs for the past five seasons.
News of James' arrival at the Lakers sparked a delighted response on Sunday.
"Welcome to the family @KingJames #lakers4life #striveforgreatness," wrote Lakers legend Kobe Bryant on Twitter.
"I am sure the Lakernation is rejoicing. The acquisition of LeBron James means that the Lakers are just a smidgen away from being real contenders," Lakers icon Kareem Abdul-Jabbar added. James, a two-time Olympic champion, left Cleveland before in 2010 for the Miami Heat, where he reached the NBA Finals four times, going 2-2, before departing for the Cavaliers, vowing to bring a title to Cleveland, his home region having grown up in nearby Akron.
That mission was accomplished when the Cavaliers won the 2016 crown with James in the starring role as Cleveland celebrated a sports champion for the first time in 52 years.
"Thank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible 4 seasons. This will always be home," James posted on Instagram with a photo of the Cavaliers' championship parade.
But the Warriors obtained Kevin Durant after that loss and Golden State has gone 8-1 against the Cavs in the two NBA Finals since.
"To be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember," James said after the Cavs' last loss of the finals.
James informed the Cavaliers on Friday that he would not exercise his $35.6 million contract option.
And he also snubbed what could have been the most money and longest deal available, the Cavaliers being able to extend James a five-year contract worth $209 million.
But money and years of security were less a concern than being able to play for a title contender.
The Lakers can offer top money plus talent and draft picks in order to surround James with competitive players enough to challenge the Warriors, who suddenly must contend with James as a Pacific division rival rather than a foe to be faced only twice a season and for the NBA title. The Lakers have reportedly been in talks with San Antonio for unhappy star Kawhi Leonard. And while such big names as Chris Paul of Houston and Paul George of Oklahoma City have agreed to terms to stay with their teams, nothing can be signed until Friday -- leaving lots of time for players to consider what sort of situation the Lakers with James could offer.

MEXICO GOES LEFT
MEXICO: Anti-establishment Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swept to victory in Mexicos presidential election Sunday, in a political sea change driven by voters anger over endemic corruption and brutal violence.
According to exit polls, the sharp-tongued, silver-haired politician known as AMLO won by a large margin over his two main rivals, who both conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed -- laying to rest concerns that a deeply divided country could face prolonged uncertainty over the winner. Thousands of ecstatic supporters flooded central Mexico Citys Zocalo square and Alameda park, celebrating to the sounds of mariachi music as Lopez Obrador slowly made his way there from his campaign headquarters in a motorcade, swarmed by huge crowds.
The government was failing. We needed a real change, said one elated supporter, Jose Gutierrez, 44.
Runner-up Ricardo Anaya of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and third-place candidate Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) both congratulated Lopez Obrador and wished him success. It is a major shift in Mexican politics: the PRI and PAN have governed for nearly a century, and Lopez Obrador will be the countrys first leftist president in recent history when he takes office on December 1.
Three polling firms gave the former Mexico City mayor the win. Newspaper El Financieros exit poll gave him 49 percent of the vote to 27 percent for Anaya and 18 percent for Meade.
Polling firms Mitofsky and the Strategic Communications Cabinet announced broadly similar results. Lopez Obrador, 64, successfully tapped voters anger over a seemingly never-ending series of corruption scandals and horrific violence that left a record 25,000 murders last year -- an orgy of bloodshed fueled by the countrys powerful drug cartels.
Casting his ballot early Sunday at his polling station in Mexico Citys Tlalpan district, he called the elections historic. We represent the possibility of real change, he told hundreds of journalists crowded at the entrance, promising a peaceful transformation of the country. AFP

Power and Rnewable Energy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should file a case against the New York Times if the allegations leveled against him through its report are false.
He was responding to a journalist at a media conference held yesterday at Isurupaya.
South Asia correspondent at The New York Times, Maria Abi-Habib, has written a controversial article titled How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port, claiming that China provided nearly 7.6 million US dollars Mahinda Rajapaksas election campaign.
At least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbors account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksas campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation.
The document details China Harbors bank account number  ownership of which was verified  and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out, the New York Times reported.
The State Minister further said that the Chinese Government has not directly denied that the former President obtained money from China.

The missing catch
During the war period in the country, the Northern fishermen lost their livelihood and the fishing activities had come to a complete standstill. However, with the end of the war in 2009, although the Northern fishermen were eager to get back to their fishing activities and rebuild their families, nine years down the line, some of them are still trying to get back on their feet. These fishermen are facing numerous difficulties ranging from the encroaching of the Indian fishermen into Northern waters to local southern fishermen entering their fishing area too to engage in fishing and sea cucumber harvesting.
But, having spoken to two fishing communities along the coast from Kankasanthurai to Point Pedro, their grievances are quite opposite.
Supparmadam fishing port
The Indian fishermen come in their big trawlers and they take all our fish and even destroy our fishing nets and boats. We fish in these small boats and we cannot knock heads with them. However, during certain seasons they dont come here as the seas are rough, said Sebamalai Rasa a fisherman at the fishing port in the Kankasanthurai area.
The fishermen at this port have come back to the area recently with the lands in Palali being released to them. The government had built houses for them but there are still several of them living in makeshift huts as they had not received housing yet.
The government recently also made a decision to reduce the price of kerosene to Rs. 40, but this group of fishermen claim that they still have to pay Rs. 70 per litre of Kerosene.
At the Supparmadam fishing port, there are around 150 small fishing boats which are used by the fishermen for their fishing activities. However, although they are fibreglass boats with outboard motors, these small boats are not equipped to venture out to the deep sea for fishing and can only fish in fairly shallow waters. They depend on the small fish found in these shallow waters to make a living. But they allege that fishermen from the South come into their territory and engage in the harvesting of sea leaches at night. As they use bright lights and torches to attract these sea leaches, it also scares away the small shoals of fish away from the shallow waters, depriving them of their opportunity to obtain a bountiful harvest and rake in a substantial income.
The income we get from fishing is barely enough to cover our daily expenses and fuel costs. We have to take another person or two when we go out to sea fishing and they have to be paid too. After all these expenses are met, we hardly have anything left over. By this, we are eternally in debt and the banks that we have obtained loans from come looking for us every day and we have no other option but to hide from them. The government has not given us any loan facilities and we have had to borrow money from private institutions or in some cases the fish mudalalis and they come at the end of the day and take our fish at cheap prices as repayment. As we dont have any freezing facilities, we cannot keep our fish for long periods and as such we have no choice but to give them the fish at the price they demand. If not the fish will spoil and we will be left with nothing, said Vincent.
However, apart from their fishing problems, these fishing families also face another issue with regard to the safety of their children. They claim that although their lands in Palali have been released and they have been resettled, the infrastructure facilities have still not been fulfilled. There is a bus that plies three runs on this road. But some of our small children finish school at 12 noon and at that time there is no bus and we have to bring them by three-wheeler, which is an additional cost that we can hardly afford, added Ajendran, another fisherman in the area.
Sebamalais wife Kaushalya said that they also have fears of unscrupulous elements roaming the area. In fact, recently one of the children was almost abducted by an unknown man and luckily we managed to prevent it from happening. There are people who use drugs and other substances and they dont have any decency. Our children are not safe. Our children have to go through unpopulated areas to reach school in Idaikkadu. Hence, it would be greatly appreciated if the government would repair and reconstruct the school in the area.
The government has provided them with houses valued at around Rs. 790,000 each and the fishermen had to put in Rs. 500,000, but these fishermen claim that although these houses look good on the outside, there are no doors inside and they cook on the floor.
Poor bus service
This fishing community appeals to the government to take measures to provide them with a reliable bus service so that their children could attend school properly and pursue their education. We are suffering today trying to do this job, risking our lives on a daily basis. This must stop and at least our children should study enough to get government jobs and live better lives than us, said Sebamalai.
These fishermen told the Daily News that although they risk their lives every day to bring in their catch, it is the trader or Mudalali who makes the money and not them. When asked why they do not obtain loans from state institutions, which has a more lenient payment plan, they said that the long process in obtaining these loans was a tedious process and these loans would not cover the cost of a boat.
They also alleged that the Tamil politicians in the North have done nothing to assist them and find solutions to their issues. They only come here when the elections are round the corner and promise us the sun and moon but thereafter they are nowhere to be found. This time we have decided not to vote for anyone, they are all the same and none of them is interested in helping us, the fishermen said.
There have also been many reports of the military interference being reported by the Tamil politicians in the North. However, when asked if the army was in any way putting any pressure on them or if they were a threat to them, these fishermen said that they preferred the army presence as it would ensure the safety of their children.
Further up the road towards Point Pedro, I came across another fishing port called Suppermadam which is a larger fishing community. However, their story was quite the opposite to the plight of the previous fishermen. But, these fishermen were willing to speak to the media but were rather reluctant to reveal their names.
They said that most of these fishermen at this port had obtained loans through state banks and they were satisfied with the repayment plans and schemes. It was difficult during the war and we could not go to sea, but now it is not like that. We earn a good sum from fishing and our lives are now turning for the better, said Jeewa, a Tamil national who is married to a Sinhalese lady. She too was assisting in the cleaning the boat and sorting of the fish.
Hopes for a better life
For most of these fishermen, the Indian fishermen encroaching on Sri Lankan waters with their huge trawlers pose a significant threat. They said that despite the Navy patrols that manage to deter some of these Indian trawlers, somehow some of them manage to come through. They just not only destroy our boats and drag away our fishing nets and equipment, their bottom trawling methods destroy our fishing resources, these fishermen lamented, urging the authorities to take more stringent action to prevent them from entering the Northern waters.
These fishermen are more organised and they have a stall by the roadside that serves to sell their fish stocks. Whatever remains is sent to the coolers. We generally get around half the price it is sold in Colombo for our fish stocks. If a kilo is sold for Rs. 200 in Colombo we can expect around Rs. 100, said Jeewa.
Unlike the previous group of fishermen who claimed that they were not benefiting the reduced kerosene prices, this group of fishermen said that although the prices increased at first, they were now receiving kerosene at Rs. 40 per litre.
For many of us although life has bounced back on track after the war, for many who are engaged in the fishing industry, returning to their professions has not been that easy. They had no income during the war and many of them have just been resettled after having spent years in makeshift shelters and IDP camps. Adjusting to a life of making their own living and sustaining their families is definitely a huge challenge for them. Some expect the government to provide them all the facilities and complain that they are not receiving enough, but there were others on the other hand, who have made it on their own while being thankful for the little assistance that has been given to them by the government.
However, although most expected their fishing industry in the North to boom after the war ended, the Indian trawler issue is a big challenge that they have to face. In addition, the fishermen from the South encroaching on their fishing grounds for sea cucumber and sea leaches is also another issue that needs to be addressed.
Their only hope is that these issues will be resolved by the authorities and they would be given the opportunity to live and earn for their families and rebuild their lives.

Nadi Dharmasiri setting trends in banking landscape
Sri Lankan marketing professionals are progressing along the right direction by reinventing themselves and the brands they manage to suit the changing times. The iconic status enjoyed by some of the countrys most respected brands and the entry of ever more international brands in to the market is a testament to this, says a senior marketing professional and current Head of Marketing, Sampath Bank, Nadi B. Dharmasiri.
While Sri Lanka offers world-class marketing education, I believe we need greater focus on practice over theory, offering students more hands-on learning opportunities. We also need to go beyond core marketing principles and expose students to other disciplines such as finance and strategic planning. This will help us shape well-rounded marketing professionals who have an added edge when they enter the job market, she said in an interview with the Daily News Business.
Excerpts;
1. Tell us about your current role:What do you enjoy most about your career
I joined as the Head of Marketing at Sampath Bank, one of the leading national banks in the country, in July 2016. There is never a dull moment in this role. Given the level of disruption taking place in the financial services sector, both globally and locally, I encounter different sets of challenges every day. My marketing teamand I work with colleagues from across the bank as well as a host of other partners and stakeholdersto come up with fresh approaches to overcome them. Keeping me on my toes, it drives me to stay abreast of the changes happening in both financial services and marketing. This opportunity to continue to learn and grow is what I cherish the most about my career.
I also have held and currently hold few other voluntary and elected board positions during my career spanning 20+ years; the Chairperson of The CIM Sri Lanka Region in 2013/2014 being one of them; during which period the much-awaited constitutional revision and along with that the introduction of new business model took place.
Currently I am an elected member of the Board of Trustees of The Chartered Institute of Marketing UK, occupying one of the two international seats in the board room; responsible for governance of the Institute. The foreign exposure and decision making along with different cultural backgrounds poses a significant positive challenge and has addedcolour to my career over the years.
2. How challenging is this position - to be the Head of marketing of a local bank
Sri Lankas financial services sector is intensely competitive and dynamic. All players are striving to gain an edge over the other by securing the first mover advantage. Despite being one of the relatively younger entities in this segment, having been founded in 1987, Sampath Bank has been the first to leverage severalemerging technologies to add greater value and convenienceto consumers and businesses whist setting trends in the banking landscape.Given this backdrop, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels but need to continue to keep up this pace of innovation. As the Head of Marketing, it is my responsibility to ensure that we engage the right target audiences on each of these innovative solutions with the right messaging.
3. As a person with wide experience in the marketing profession- how do you see the current trends in the industry
Marketing communications, as a sector, has been one of the key drivers of disruption across industries around the world. And it is no different in Sri Lanka. While we are a developing market, itgives me pride to note that our marketing professionals continue todo groundbreaking work, especially on the newer media platforms. This has been aided in part by the countrys literacy as well as mobile and internet penetration levels. As digital and social mediums take center stage, we have more opportunities to engage larger audiences with tailored messaging much more efficiently and effectively at a lower cost vs cost of traditional media. This has also brought with it the need for brands and their custodians to stay alert, responding rapidly to evolving consumer preferences and sentiments.
4. Have Sri Lankan marketing professionals moved in the right direction
I firmly believe that, while there is always room to learn, our marketing professionals are on par with, if not ahead of, our peers in the region. We are progressing along the right direction since we continue to reinvent ourselves and the brands we manage to suit the changing times. The iconic status enjoyed by some of the countrys most respected brands and the entry of ever more international brands in to the market is a testament to this. I am also delighted to note that a growing number of senior marketers in the country are getting actively involved in nurturing the next generation of talent.
5. How challenging is the marketing professionals role in an era run by millennial gen and social media
The role of a marketing professional has always been challenging. The advent of the millennial consumer together with the rise of social media and globalization has brought an added set of opportunities and challenges with it. While the primary objective of engaging the consumer to create a positive impression about the brand remains, the way we need to go about it is different now. The freedom, convenience and speed to interact and express are much greater both positively and negatively.
6. How should the concepts be changed/and marketing education be changed
Sri Lanka has always held the position of largest region outside UK for The Chartered Institute of Marketing, the most recognized global marketing qualification. While Sri Lanka offers world-class marketing education, I believe we need greater focus on practice over theory, offering students more hands-on learning opportunities. We also need to go beyond core marketing principles and expose students to other disciplines such as finance, strategic planning, etc. This will help us shape well-rounded marketing professionals who have an added edge when they enter the job market. I strongly believe that marketing should evolve to be a mandatory board position to drive the businesses forward in todays challenging environment.
7. Tell us about some of your past experiences in the profession Some of the best events in your profession
I have had the opportunity to work in a diverse set of industries including advertising and communications, banking, insurance and finance, FMCG and telecommunications. My days in advertising have helped me gain a firm understanding ofthe requirements and constraints of both the brand and creative teams. This continues to help me in my work relationships with our creative partners, allowing me to comprehend genuine issues and limitations. I have also had the privilege of steering the marketing team that helped build Asian Alliance Insurance to one of the most respected insurance brands in the country at the time I exited the insurance industry. During my eight-year tenure with the company, the brand rose to become one of the top five most recalled brand names in insurance.
8. You have consistently been recognized as a top performer throughout your career. What is your personal key to success
From a very early age I have been someone who will never give up. Whatever the task I set my mind to I have always strived to see it to fruition. Even when faced with seemingly unsurmountable hurdles, I have tried to find a way to reach my goals. And I have been blessed with family, friends, teachers, mentors and colleagues who continue to support me every step of the way. Above all I have a very strong will power coupled with divine guidance and intervention. I am who I am and what I am thanks to all this.
9. What are some of your personal and/or professional goals for the future
On the professional front, while I would actively seek to learn and hone my own skills, I would like to share my accumulated learnings with the next generation and do my bit to groom marketers with integrity and commitment. Personally, I would like to be a responsible citizen of the nation, someone my parents can take pride in. Professionally I wish to secure a doctorate before I retire.
10. How do you like to see the next gen to take the marketing profession forward
With the world in the palm of their hands, the current generation of digital natives has been very effective in learning about the world around them. However, they seem to be missing out on real world interactions. I firmly believe that as marketers, we need to be in touch with consumers, their pulse and society at large to be able to fully appreciate their needs and wants. Therefore, I would like to encourage the younger gento focus a bit more on real world engagements.
11. What are the best ways to get a job in the marketing field How available are internships
Young marketers need work on building a network of friends and mentors within the industry well before they hit the job market. In todays world, paper qualifications are no longer sufficient to secure a job. Employers are looking for street smart, go getters who can do whatever it takes to achieve the task at hand; ability to work as a team player and adopt to prevailing organizational culture too are key. Internships are a great way to learn more about the ways of the industry while also proving ones merits to prospective employers. And there are abundant internship opportunities available in the market for candidates with the right skills and mindset.Sampath Bank too has an internship program that continues to nurture thousands of young talents. My internship at Ceylon Tourist Board shadows me positively even to date.
12. What are some of the top challenges in facing marketing professionals over the next decade
As with any other industry, we too need to embrace change and adapt ourselves to the new lines of thinking; primarily in todays digital marketplace. We need to seek to disrupt the way we think and work or face the threat of being disrupted by new entrants.

Net- lingo leaves every Bimbo in cyber limbo!
Its all about that hip new jive lingo all those crazy computer whiz-kids are using! I am gradually getting used to deciphering some of the coined Netlingo by these high-tech oddballs. But I am doing so with the greatest difficulty. I must admit, though that Im a technological retard in the age of Cyber Civilisation.
For one thing, this computer geek jargon is all Greek to me but far worse to many others who are totally illiterate when it comes to comprehending the technical gobbledygook. To the uninitiated, computer parlance may sound a bewildering complexity of the most fanciful terms and phrases.
It may prove mind-boggling at the beginning but comprehension soon dawns on those determined to learn its bizarre terminology. Perhaps I could offer a few tips to the totally ignorant on the slang that certainly has nothing to do with my dear departed aunt Rhondas lingo in Bingo. Besides it is often replete with seemingly ever-so suggestive terms which sometimes abound with shades of double entendre.
Lets begin with the basics. The Internet is not a cafeteria where workers put their hair in. And a Mouse Pad has absolutely nothing to do with where Disneys Mickey and Minnie live. One incurable moron thought that a keyboard was some sort of rack where he was supposed to hang the keys so the wife could find them. And a keyboard to his Bimbo wife was nothing less than a piano or electronic organ!
Be aware that a laptop is not necessarily a place where grandkids or sexy willing secretaries are allowed to park their butts. An application to pre-computer era minds was a letter for seeking employment. A program was a radio or TV show you tuned into. A cursor, we usually spelled it curser, referred to an obnoxious individual who used profanity. And memory was something that you lost with age. A web was a spider's home. And a virus was the flu!
CD was a Cash Deposit you made into a bank account! And if you had a broken disk, with a slight variation in spelling, it was a darn agonising spinal symptom. The inexperienced should be warned not to take words such as unzip in its literal sense. Those naive enough to do so in public would find themselves facing an indecent exposure charge, zipped up and in the lock-up in no time. In computer-speak it simply means to decompress and open up a ZIP file using a file decompression program.
Worst of all was a recent one I came across. It was Hairball, which has nothing to do with our succulent rambuttans or any other coarse hirsute object you might fancy thinking it is. Hairball, in computer slang means any tangled mess and often refers to a poorly written computer code with Microsoft's name.
A poor geek found himself in a real domestic blitz situation and had to explain to his wife while back-pedalling and parrying a series of blows that the Diskette he was talking of buying was certainly not a female disco dancer. Its quite bewildering really when you suddenly realise that all of your friends have an @ in their names.
One clueless user called the online helpdesk asking how to solve a problem. The conversation went on with helpdesk advising her: Double click on My Computer! The user: How can I when I can't see your computer Helpdesk: No maam, double click on My Computer on your computer. User: What This is all so confusing! Helpdesk: Look lady, there is an icon on your computer labelled My Computer. Now double click on it. User: What the heck is your computer doing on mine
I told a young woman writer to call the office technician when her computer crashed. She described the problem and the technician concluded that the computer needed to be brought in and serviced. He told her to unplug the power cord and bring it over to his workstation so that he could fix it. About ten minutes later she showed up at his door with the power cord in her hand. Believe it or not some people cant figure out the mouse. One story of a woman computer debutante has become part of Geek mythology.
It appeared she had complained that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on.
The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in. More hilarious still was the one related by another technician that one of his customers held the mouse and pointed it at the screen, all the while clicking madly as she would a TV remote control.
The customer got no response and the technician had a hard time explaining to her that the mouse works only if its moved over a flat surface.
And talking about mice or rather a mouse is this phrase called word-of-mouse  meaning gossip or information spread via the net, usually through e-mail, blogs or newsgroup postings.
Then again I was persuaded to allow the family seamstress to gain some hands-on experience with my spanking new PC as she had been offered a job as a manageress of a swank womens clothing shop. I told her to go ahead and left her to it and returned a few minutes later.
The exasperated woman, whose only technical experience had been confined to sewing machines, complained she couldnt get the computer to turn on.
I asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Ive pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens, she replied. Foot pedal I queried. Yes, she said, this little white foot pedal with the on switch. The foot pedal, it turned out, was the computers mouse.
And a cyberpunk looked at me quite pityingly when I inquired whether a fatal error made with the e-mail I sent meant that I had killed somebody. But I refused to lose my cool and decided to get even. I asked him quite innocently whether the Adam and Eve virus is one that takes a couple of bytes out of his Apple
He got a bit suspicious when I explained to him confidently that a Freudian virus is when his computer becomes obsessed with marrying its own motherboard. He left in a huff only to return with the query: I cant find my dongle anywhere. I thought I plugged the dongle direct into the back of your PC.
Revenge is sweet as I spat out at him: Get out of here you technical pervert and take your darn dangling dongle along with you!

New York Times bribery allegations: Minister calls for investigations
Irrigation, Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said he believes that there is truth in the disclosure of the New York Times that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken a bribe.
Most of the content that appeared in the newspaper is true because I also received watches and sarees which are still in my possession, Minister Dissanayake said.
He was speaking to the press after attending several official engagements in Anuradhapura, recently.
The minister said he saw in media reports that former President Rajapaksa has allegedly received bribes from a Chinese company as reported by the New York Times newspaper. He requested the government to inquire into the alleged incident. He said if the said Chinese company had granted such a vast amount of money for the election activities of Mahinda Rajapaksa, such a transaction amounts to a probable bribe. The minister said he wondered as to why the government was being silent over the matter and hoped the government would show more interest to investigate into it.
I would like to bring to the notice of the government that it is more important to take immediate action to investigate the truth of the news report involving a large scale transaction rather than speaking about small-scale thefts such as stealing a few mangoes, he said.
On the surface, there is a clearly convincing truth. But without a legally acceptable investigation, we are unable to confirm the truth of the news item. If any fraud or cheating is proven, the former president, as well as those involved in the alleged fraud, shall be punished for others to learn a lesson, the minister said.
Referring to the drop in gas prices, he said it was not aimed at the forthcoming provincial council elections. The policy of the government is to allow price hikes or prices lowering according to the price fluctuations in the international market as in the case of gas.
We dont depend on commodity prices in getting an election victory, the minister added. We demand that the provincial council elections be held as soon as possible. What matters is not winning the elections but to vote for those who are immaculately eligible to administer the councils.
We rejected the optional voting system in Parliament and instituted policies to commence the new voting system. There is no time to spare to do justices to fulfill the wishes of the people. Hard decisions shall be taken to fulfill the expectations of voters who elected a national government. The election pledges and reforms promised shall be fulfilled before going for an election, Minister Dissanayake said.

Race 3
Not so racy!
When you think of the Race franchise, action, intrigue, deception and unpredictable personalities comes to mind. You also get a feast for the eyes with a glamorous star studded cast, luxury cars and mansions. Though logic may not be its strongest point 2008s Race and 2013s Race 2 have been quite watchable.
Based on the idea of being the winner in a race against each other, the Race franchise has always centered on individuals who have a hand in illegal matters like drug dealing and robbery.
In Race 3 we meet a family of criminals. Lead by Shamsher the Singh family comprises of Sikandar and twins Suraj and Sanjana. They are accompanied in their expeditions by their family friend, Yash. Though the twins are Shamshers offspring, he relies mainly on his brothers son, Sikandar to perform his duties and bring success. Though they do not show it on the surface, the twins resent their fathers treatment of their stepbrother. Things get out of hand when they are told that half of their mothers wealth goes to Sikandar while they each get a quarter. Impulsive Suraj is infuriated to take action but sly Sanjana assures that the time will come for them to outsmart their stepbrother.
Enter Jessica, a beauty who proves to be an airhead on the surface but is a quick witted con woman underneath her innocent profile. She forms a romantic alliance with Sikandar but later we are told that she is hired to play along in a plan of deceit by the twins. As the action flows it is puzzling where Jessicas true alliance lies with. This is part of the web of mystery that Remo Dsouza weaves in Race 3.
Though shouldered by a mega star like Salman Khan Race 3 does not fit the line of success paved by its predecessors. One point to consider is that there is hardly any substance in the tale. With an action packed opening of Anil Kapoors Shamsher blowing up an enemy to the sequences in which the twins barge into a den of thugs, Salman Khans Sikandar sweeps down from the sky to the rescue and Bobby Deols Yash pulls the curtains down with a fire armed finale, it is clear that Race 3 aims at the fans of action loving movie buffs. In contract to the larger than life fight scenes you get a kaleidoscope of scenes stringed into a meaningless plot and characters that lack depth.
Though the actors have a lot of potential, there is only a little that demands their acting talent. Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez manage to look glamorous even when they wipe the floor with their opponents. Salman Khan, Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem and Anil Kapoor look majestic but their roles do not leave much of an impact. Though the film tries hard to match up to the thrills generated by its predecessors, Race 3 just does not make it to the finishing line in the grand style typical of the Race series.

No matter what the conditions
Our big strength is our fast bowlers  Faf du Plessis
Faf du Plessis, the South Africa captain, has stressed that whatever the conditions, even in Sri Lanka in the upcoming multi-format series, the fast bowlers will always be his team's big strength.
South Africa will be touring the island nation for a two-Test series, the first starting in Galle on 12 July, followed by five one-day internationals and a lone Twenty20 International.
Despite the Sri Lankan conditions, which are known to assist the spinners, du Plessis expressed confidence in his fast-bowling unit, especially in Kagiso Rabada, Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn, who is set to return after recovering from the heel injury he sustained during the home Test series against India earlier this year.
Lungi Ngidi is the other frontline paceman in the Test squad, which also has three spin options in Keshav Maharaj, Tabraiz Shamsi and Shaun von Berg.
No matter what the conditions are, a big strength of our team will always be our fast bowlers, especially the personnel we have: Steyn, Kagiso and Vernon are all wicket-taking bowlers, said du Plessis. Those three have proven they can do it in any conditions.
Dale has got a fantastic record in the subcontinent and KG is gold. He will be able to do anything, and we've got Keshav. If we want to and there's an opportunity to, because the conditions are really bad, then we can look at a second spinner.
Following AB de Villiers retirement from international cricket in May, the No.4 position in the batting order has been left vacant and du Plessis feels it will be a great opportunity for someone like Temba Bavuma to step into the gap.
AB has only played the last one or two series for this Test team, so he has actually not been playing for a while, the South Africa skipper noted. It will be a nice opportunity for Temba or somebody else to put his peg in the ground and make the position his own again.
It wont be easy in Sri Lanka, and du Plessis knows that. If South Africa can apply the lessons learnt from their last tour to the subcontinent, which was back in 2016 when they were beaten 3-0 by India, it will help.
I am expecting tough conditions, said du Plessis. I think Sri Lanka will look at it on paper and think we've got a better side on paper, and I think they will try and make it as dry as possible and spin as much as possible.
It will be a nice opportunity to test ourselves in tough conditions. There were a lot of lessons learnt by us [in India]. You have to go through something like that to pick your game apart, start from scratch and look at how you get better.

Cher wants to stick needles in her eyes when watching aspects of her personal life being portrayed in her new stage musical The Cher Show.
The jukebox musical, which feature songs from Cher's back catalogue, chronicles her life from her childhood in Los Angeles to her reinvention as a pop icon and movie star, following her days in pop duo Sonny & Cher and the end of her turbulent marriage to Sonny Bono.
The production, which features three actresses playing Cher over different time periods, opened for previews early in June in Chicago, Illinois ahead of a transfer to Broadway in New York later this year, and the Believe singer admitted on The Graham Norton Show that it was hard to watch some of the personal elements in the show.
I have seen a piece of it and will see it all in Chicago, she explained. It was a bit nerve-wracking to see so many personal things portrayed that you thought was a good idea to talk about once but, to see it on stage, you just want to stick needles in your eyes.
The 72-year-old's career is still going strong, with an album currently in the works and an appearance in movie musical Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again about to hit cinemas, and the singer shared that she never expected to be working at her age, and doesn't know when she'll stop.
In the movie, a sequel to 2008s Mamma Mia!, Cher plays the mother of Meryl Streep's character Donna, but she insisted she wasn't offended to be offered the role, despite being only four years older than the Oscar winner.
I am older than her - by four years! When they asked I said, That's absolutely fine, thats cool, she said, before adding that she didn't have much say about her casting in the film.
My agent called me and said, Youre in the new Mamma Mia film and then hung up. I didnt have much choice! she joked.

Proposed Audit Bill, a timely need - Asgiriya, Malwatte Mahanayake Theras
Approval of the Audit Bill designed to prevent financial misuse in the country is a timely need, The Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte and Asigiriya Chapters said.
Malwatte Mahanayake Thera Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala and Asigiriya Mahanayake Thera Most. Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathana said Only people who engaged in fraud and corruption can oppose an Act of this nature which would help ensure transparency in the Governments financial transactions.
The two Chief Prelates expressed these sentiments when Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe called at their respective temples in Kandy and received their blessings on July 2.
The Auditor General said the proposed Audit Bill would be taken up in Parliament for debate on July 5.
The proposed Act once approved would bring fraud and corruption and financial irregularities under control, the two Chief Prelates said, adding that they would always confer their blessings on anything that would benefit the country and its people.
The Malwatte Chief Prelate said there was a group of people bent on opposing anything and everything in the country. Their sole endeavour was to create problems by opposing everything. The Asgiriya Prelate said it was the duty of all Parliamentarians to support the Audit Bill for approval in Parliament.
The Auditor General said certain public officials in highest echelons opposed this Bill while the President, Prime Minister, Ministers and all MPs were in favour of it. He said the notion that the new Act would confer excessive powers on the Auditor General was a misnomer.

Railway officers in civvies to look out for vandals
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday said Railway officers in civvies would in future monitor railway carriages for individuals who vandalise carriages and Railway property.
The government spends millions every year to provide the public with railway services, and thus it is the duty of the general public to protect these resources, said Minister de Silva.
Those found guilty of vandalising public property would be prosecuted under the Offences Against Public Property Act and would be liable for a prison sentence, fine or both.
The Minister was speaking at a function where 10 carriages that have been renovated by local manufacturers were put into service. The carriages were used on the train to Matara from Colombo Fort yesterday.
Under a government plan to strengthen local industry, in January 2017, a programme to revamp and refurbish 200 old and dilapidated Railway carriages was started, the minister said. Thus far 25 such carriages have been refurbished and are in use.
When we started the project, the trade unions opposed it. They said the Railways was being sold to the private sector. The Ratmalana Railway workshop workers today are on a work-to-rule campaign. So how can the minister or the government uplift the Railways with such action We alone cannot achieve this task. We all need to come together. For tasks which we cannot do, we need assistance from the private sector.
The Minister said the government spent Rs. 14 million to renovate each carriage under the current agreement, whilst they would have had to spend Rs. 60 million to import a new one.
The government has called for tenders for the purchase of 25 new engines and 15 power sets to further improve the Railways. We should be able to get them by next year, he said.
They have also started work on renovating several main railway lines and the Kelani valley dual track line. The Asian Development Bank has agreed to fund this through a soft loan.
The government will not privatise the Railways, but we also can no longer afford to run it at a loss. We need an alternative programme, said the Minister.

A resident of Ratnapura has written to the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province stating that a development officer has usurped her of compensation of Rs 1.6 million awarded to her by the government for her house that was damaged by the landslides in May 2017.
On May 26, 2017, her house was destroyed by the heavy rains, and the Divisional Secretariat had awarded her a compensation of Rs 1.6 million. In her letter, she stated that a development officer had handed over a half-built run-down house to her, and written the cheque due to her in the officers name. Further, she had taken Rs. 100,000 from her to hand over the deed to the land on which the house was built.
During that time, her husband was not at home and since he did not have a permanent job, she had to take a loan of Rs. 100,000.
As a result of having to repay it with interest, the education of her children has been affected. She has asked that the Governor look into her problem and provide her with a speedy solution.

Real life mermaid
A psychology graduate is living her best life as a mermaid, after investing in a four-day long course at a mermaid camp.
24-year-old Caitlin Hardy, who works in a bank during the day, was determined to fulfil her childhood fantasy of being a mermaid, so booked a four-day long course at a mermaid camp at a private mansion with a pool in Penrith, Cumbria. During this time, Caitlin created her own mermaid persona  Mermaid Liana Waterfall.
Now fully-trained and sporting a bespoke 160 tail, which she designed, Caitlin charges 100 an hour to swim like a mermaid at childrens parties.
She said, The best thing is seeing kids completely overawed. t melts my heart when I see their reaction to meeting a mermaid. I love when I go to the beach and bring out my tail and kids will run across the beach shouting mermaid. Its so lovely to see the joy it brings them.
A devotee of Disneys The Little Mermaid since childhood, Caitlin, who longed to be just like the main character, Ariel, was instantly hooked when she found mermaiding through a Facebook video.
Caitlin says being a mermaid is so much fun.
She said, I dont think Ive ever felt so good about my body  you lose sight of any lumps and bumps when you see how graceful you look with a tail. Its made my confidence soar. Ive always been a water baby. I loved the little mermaid when I was younger. When I was about three, I told everyone I wanted to be a mermaid but the adults around me just laughed about it. Now my mum loves telling them that I actually am one. I am living my childhood dream.
Caitlin took up her fishy hobby after spotting a Facebook video of Mermaid Grace Page  who won the first Miss Mermaid UK pageant in 2016.
The video advertised a mermaid camp with Grace and I jokingly sent it to my mum, she said. She sent it back to me saying, Why arent you going So, I signed up and went to my first camp in April 2017.
At the camp, run by Grace Page, about a dozen women from across the UK were taught how to swim and act like a mermaid.
As part of the package, you get given a tail. There was a tail giving ceremony, where we all got our chosen tail, she said.
They are made of material like a swimsuit with a hard monofin at the bottom. We spent the weekend first swimming with flippers, before moving to monofins. The instructors also started to teach us how to breathe for long periods of time underwater. Its actually quite difficult to swim like that and you cant just jump in and start.
At the camp, Caitlin passed her AIDA freediving qualification which requires her to be able to breathe underwater for two minutes.
Caitlin stayed in touch with Grace and began working with her company, Hire A Mermaid UK, going to childrens parties in her spare time.
I still have a nine to five job that pays the bills, she said.
Its very different, as I work in a bank, which is a very straight, office-style setting. I do let little bits of my mermaid side come out sometimes though and people are surprised. I have quite long hair and people will comment on it and I say, Thank you, its a powerful weapon as a mermaid, which normally starts a conversation. Sometimes, when Im dealing with a customer, their little girl wont be enjoying being in a bank, so Ill whisper to her about mermaids. Ive given out a few business cards for birthday parties at work, too.
Working as a mermaid about twice a month, Caitlin also trains every week at a local swmming pool, to make sure she maintains her mermaid skills.
She said, We get a lot of attention but its always really positive. If you dont practice your swimming and breathing, it becomes much harder. so I train when I can.

BoyZone visits Sri Lanka for farewell tour
Remembered forever!
BoyZone have lived a full life as a band. Ronan, Keith, Mikey and Shane have enjoyed life in an unbelievable way and have been so fortunate to get up every morning and do what they have loved doing  making music!
The success they have achieved is phenomenal and their achievements have been really awesome. And now after 25 years of enjoying making music, it is time to end it on a high. This Irish band have played in stadiums and arenas all over the world, released six albums, 25 million record sales and had almost two dozen hits. They have a legion of fans representing many generations and have made their lives so meaningful. They have enjoyed making music and have made a difference in the lives of their fans and have received as much as they have given. The loss of their brother Stephen Gately was painful but the music they have made together is forever. This November, they will be releasing their final album  Thank you and Goodnight. They have recorded twelve brand new tracks and we will definitely enjoy listening to them as much as the guys have enjoyed making them. And now the guys are on their farewell UK, Asia and Ireland arena tour and will be holding a show in Sri Lanka on August 16 at the CR & FC Grounds at 8 pm.
The guys have a special touching message to their fans Were especially excited to share a very special tribute to Stephen in the shape of a new song, I can dream. We came across a demo that he originally recorded for his solo album in 2002 and weve had the opportunity to rework the song and add our harmonies alongside his lead vocal. It was a bittersweet experience to hear all our voices together again. It is the closest the five of us will ever get to being in a room together again making music.
Finally their time together can be summed up in a verse of their song We know this loves forever. Thats all that matters, no matter what .
Daily News learnt more about their tour at a Press Conference held recently at the Hilton
General Manager Manesh Fernando commented that there is a need for such tours as Boyzone to come to Sri Lanka because we need to be in touch with what is taking place around the world.
There is a continuous focus on Sri Lanka, within Sri Lanka as a tourist destination. We need such happenings to put us on the world map. Sadly Boyzone is bringing their career to an end, but it is good to have them in Sri Lanka because we have all grown up with their music and it is still being played on our radio stations. I want to wish the organizers and sponsors all the best in this endeavor. I would like to ask Chairman DCI, Dilshard Hassan, to bring more superstars to Sri Lanka and put us on the world map, said Fernando.
GM Classic Travels, Travel Partner, Sabry Bahudeen, said it was a privilege to be associated with this Boyzone tour.
As a travel partner we see a lot of our Sri Lankan folk traveling overseas to see such concerts. It is great to see concerts such as Michael Learns to Rock and Boyzone happening in Sri Lanka because frankly traveling to other countries to see these bands play is costly. But thanks to the organizers our people can see these band playing in our own country. About 8000  10,000 Sri Lankans can see this event live in Sri Lanka. So I wish the event success, said Bahudeen.Consultant DCI, Anton Thayalan, said that the vision of organizer Dilshard Hassan was extremely inspiring. Micheal Learns to Rock was a success and Dilshards vision is to put Sri Lanka on the entertainment map. The world needs to see what Sri Lanka is all about by bringing to the country the very best of talent the world has to offer. This is something that we want to continue doing. So we want to launch DCI events and entertainment. For us this is an exciting time and we hope to see yet another successful event in Sri Lanka, said Thayalan
CEO 444.lk Official Ticketing Partner, Amila Fonseka, pointed out that they are proud to partner with this DCI events which is the Boyzone tour of Sri Lanka. One can purchase tickets by dialing 444 from their dialog mobiles or you can visit us at www.444.lk or simply download the mobile app. 444 powered by dialog is actually the only one stop shop platform in the country where we facilitate bookings across events. We would like to thank DCI events for allowing us to be part of this show. This is a very big event for all of us involved since Boyzone is huge. This puts us right there on the map, said Fonseka.
CEO taktikbook.lk Nishan Senevirathne, said it was a matter of pride being associated with the Boyzone tour in Sri Lanka.
We look forward to continuing our association with DCI entertainment which started last year with MLTR. They are doing a great job in bringing down world renowned artistes who have a massive following in the Sri Lankan public. I am quite sure that the event will be a sell out and CR&FC will be full capacity, said Senevirathne.
President Lions Colombo Host Charity Partner Shyana Jayalath, said they are delighted to be associated with the Boyzone farewell tour in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka kicks off the Asian Leg of the Farewell tour. Many of us in the club have grown up with this music. Our association with the concert is very special because this is where we give back to the community as well.
The tickets sold by the Lions Club, part of those proceeds will go towards our projects which include cancer, preventing blindness, youth empowerment, nutrition, health and community development. We are an international organization with the largest service organization in the world.
Boyzone is an international band and we look forward to working with the partners to make this a success, said Jayalath Insurance Partner, CEO Continental Insurance, Gerry Gunadasa, said that Continental Insurance is delighted, pleased and honored to be the insurance partner.
It was a pleasure for us to receive this invitation. We do not hesitate to support such events.
This is an international tour and Sri Lanka will be watched by the world and this is a contributory factor for tourism in Sri Lanka. We must thank all the organizers and all those involved in this. The country will definitely benefit from this endeavor and all will surely enjoy the entertainment, said Gunadasa.

Rihanna and Kylie among most influential people on the Internet
Rihanna, Kanye West, and his sister-in-law Kylie Jenner have been named among Time magazine's 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.
South Korean boyband BTS, actress Busy Philipps, U.S. President Donald Trump, and the students of the Parkland, Florida shooting massacre, who have been fighting for gun control reform, also make the cut for the fourth annual unranked list, devised by evaluating each contender's global impact on social media and their ability to drive news.
Rihanna was recognised for the hugely successful launches of her cosmetics collection, Fenty Beauty, and her lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, while she also made waves in March (18) after causing the stock market value of Snapchat's parent company, Snap. Inc, to drop by $800 million (612 million). The stunning loss came after the pop superstar slammed platform bosses for running an ad for a new Would You Rather game, which poked fun at the singer's 2009 assault at the hands of her then-boyfriend Chris Brown, asking users if they would rather slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown.
Snapchat officials quickly removed the promo and apologised, claiming it was published in error, but the statement was too little, too late for Rihanna, who promptly dumped the social media app and urged her fans to do the same.
She was the second famous face to cause Snap Inc.s value to plummet, weeks after Kylie Jenner admitted she was no longer using the platform following an unpopular tech update, which many complained made it less user-friendly.
The 20-year-olds admission wiped $1.3 billion off the company's market valuation back in February.
Kylie's other influential social media moves include dethroning Beyonce and her 2017 pregnancy announcement for the most-liked photo on Instagram, after revealing the name of her baby daughter Stormi online in February (18), and using the Internet to drum up excitement for her Kylie Cosmetics firm, which continues to grow from strength-to-strength.
Conversely, her sister Kim Kardashian's husband Kanye is known for using his Twitter page for less carefully curated posts, often stirring controversy for airing his strong opinions, most recently expressing his support for Trump, and defending comments he made about slavery being a choice for many African-Americans.
No matter what, his online persona - with 28 million followers - keeps him squarely in the public eye, Time's Eliza Berman notes.

Rs.95mn heist at Thalawa bank
The Thalawa branch of a state bank was robbed over the weekend and cash and jewellery valued at over Rs.95 million had been stolen by thieves.
The Police Spokesmans office told the Daily News that the robbers had entered the bank through the back door and had used a welding torch to cut open three safes containing the cash and jewellery.
The bank had closed for business on Friday and when it reopened yesterday, the staff realised that the bank had been broken into.
The robbers are said to have entered the bank and disconnected the alarm system which was connected to the Police station. They had also disabled the CCTV camera system and taken away the Digital Video Recorder (or DVR for short) which is essentially a computer that saves security video images to a hard drive.
They had also taken away the Wifi device.
The thieves had silently cut open the safes and had only left behind a piece of cloth and a screw driver. The Police with the aid of the sniffer dog Hero were led to an abandoned house and back onto the ThalawaAnuradhapura main road.
Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said that Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera last night handed over the investigation into this incident to the Criminal Investigation Department. In addition, eight Police teams have been deployed to carry out investigations and are following several leads to arrest the robbers. The Police suspect that the thieves may have stopped over at the abandoned house prior to fleeing the area.
The CCTV camera footage of the nearby buildings have also been taken by the Police for investigation, while statements were also recorded from the bank employees and the employees of shops in the neighbourhood.
Gold jewellery pawned by the customers weighing around 22.806 Kg had been robbed and the total value of gold alone is over Rs.78 million.
The thieves have also stolen around Rs.17 million in cash from the safe.
Around 17 months ago, a similar robbery was carried out ar Anuradhapura new town and the safes of a private financial institution were broken in the same manner with around 13.5 kg of gold valued at around Rs.75 million stolen.
A suspect from Jaffna known as Naguleswaran was arrested by the Police in connection with the Anuradhapura robbery. However, although three suspects were arrested by the Police none of the jewellery was recovered.

RTI Commission wants public to view draft laws in advance
The Right to Information Commission (RTI) pursuant to an appeal made to it has recommended presenting draft laws before the public in advance and before the Bill is gazetted.
The Commission has made this observation in its order related to an RTI appeal requesting the draft legislation on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, from the Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Ministry.
In many countries in the region and globally, draft laws are required to be presented before the public in advance and before the Bill is gazetted, in order to obtain public feedback on its contents which is a beneficial process leading to public consensus around the framing of legislation, the Commission said concluding the appeal.
The Commission highlighted that the definition of information in the Right to Information Act of Sri Lanka expressly includes draft legislation within its ambit.
The appeal had been filed by Dr. Mario Gomez on December 5, 2017. Gomez had requested a copy of the most recent version of the draft law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (in Sinhala, Tamil, English, and braille if available) and the current status of the draft law.
He had also inquired as to when the draft law is likely to be approved by Cabinet and tabled in Parliament. The Ministry had stated that it cannot provide the draft legislation until it is gazetted.
It had responded that draft amendment of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act has been sent from the Legal Draftsman to the Ministry for observations.
The five-member RTI Commission chaired by Mahinda Gammampila, which heard the Appeal in the presence of Dr. Gomez and Ministry Additional Secretary S. D. Udawatta, directed the Ministry to provide the Appellant of a copy of the requested draft law (in Sinhala, Tamil and English).
While the draft law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities may be subject to subsequent amendments, the Public Authority is bound to provide a copy of the draft in its current state to the Appellant and there is no requirement to wait until the draft legislation is gazzeted, the Commission ruled.

## Title: RUWIN PEIRIS
## Supertitle:

RUWIN PEIRIS
Another outstanding cricketer who touched the surface but couldnt emerge to Test level was Ruwin Peiris. He was dark charming and had ruggedly good looks akin to a West Indian, it was nice of him to come to my abode for this interview.
I would not be wrong to state that Ruwin was the best cricketer to emerge from the Colombo suburb of Piliyandala. His outstanding talent was spotted by the scouts of other famous schools such as Ananda, D.S. and Trinity but for some reason he was faithful to his school Piliyandala Central.
Ruwin although blazing a trail in both domestic and Lancashire league was a down to earth guy who has not lost his balance and knew where his roots were. He was a cricket mad brat who used to play cricket at every conceivable opportunity. He mentioned to me that he used to wrap his bat up with a piece of newspaper and hop into a bus and go to the public park at Piliyandala and play softball cricket with the likes of Hashan Tillakaratne who was living next door to the park those days.
During his formative years at Piliyandala Central he was selected to play for the first eleven team at the tender age of 14 and blasted 7 centuries during his first eleven days. Deepal Madurapperuma another cricketer from Piliyandala area who played for Thurstan, invited Ruwin to attend practice at Nomads and as time went by he got a call to play for Nomads first team as ex-Sri Lanka player Jayantha Amarasinghe was injured. The opponents of Nomads were the star studded CCC which had stars such as Sanath Jayasuriya and Roy Dias. Ruwin was 17 years old at that time. Although he did not get any wickets he batted at no 3 and made a brisk 25 unfortunately run out by a direct hit from Roshan Jurangpathy. The selectors at Nomads recognized his talent and invited him to play for the subsequent ODI match and batting at no. 3 he got a whirlwind 40 which enabled Ruwin to seal a permanent place at Nomads.
In 89/90 Ruwin was going great guns at Nomads and they were the ODI champions. He ended up as the Man of the Series and in the final against Bloomfield he was the Man of the Match. Ruwin was 18 years old at the time. People then were wondering who this wonder boy was and speculating whether he was an Anandian since he came from a suburb close to Colombo, stated Ruwin. He was in demand amongst the clubs and Champaka Ramanayake the then captain
of the Tamil Union invited Ruwin to join them. Tamils were one of the clubs selected to play in the Presidents Trophy where top clubs like CCC, Colts, Tamil Union and SSC participated together with Sri Lankan Board eleven and another Sri Lankan Board under 23 side. Ruwin had the opportunity of opening with Chandika Hathurusingha for Tamils in this tournament.
According to Ruwin Chandika was a well organized player who studied the opposing bowlers well and also encouraged Ruwin to go for his shots. He mentioned to me that he learned a lot about cricket from Hathurusingha and during his 10 year tenure at Tamils he got 10 centuries and over 10,000 runs.
His next pit stop was at the NCC where Asoka de Silva the famous umpire beckoned him to join in 1998. They became the ODI champs and Ruwin in his customary position was the Best Batsman. During his stint at Tamil Union he blasted the first three balls of a match against NCC for three sixes, pint sized Ruwin was a natural timer of the ball - shots came to him through innate impulse.
It was unfortunate that Ruwin was born in an era where star players were in abundance and he stated that even a class player like Marvan Attapattu was not in the playing eleven then.
There was no doubt that he was a prolific scorer in the club arena and one wondered whether he was side lined because he came from a Central school, then its the height of absurdity! Ruwins coaching career started at Moors where he was their head coach from 2009-11, a provincial coach in 2012 and cricket board development squad batting coach. He had a stint in Dubai for 2 years at Aravinda de Silvas Academy. Ruwin is now the head coach at NCC, he filled the vacancy left by the former coach who was a national selector till the recent past. His contract with the NCC is 2 years renewable. Ruwin had a 12 year stint at Lancashire League and played for Middleton and Etherly in the main. All in all Ruwin has notched up 40 hundreds and
accumulated 14,000 runs in those leagues which to me should go into the record books. Here are some headlines in those papers singing the praises of Ruwin; Ruvin grooving By Chris Ostick of THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN-06/08/2001
Improving Peiris has his sights set on a Test place* By Ray Simpson of the Northern Echo-08/06/1998 Apart from his cricketing feats in UK, Ruwin has done yeoman service for the communities affected by the tsunami and he was modest enough to inform me not to go to town so as to get mileage like the politicians of this day and age do. Finally he had a kind word for Lasith Malinga, according to Ruwin Lasith is no mug, he has 9 As in his O levels and helps the under privileged in a big way. Example once a boy with an incurable illness came with his parents to see Lasith at the NCC nets and after giving a patient hearing Lasith straight away wrote a check for Rs 3 lakhs and gave the child to get treatment. On another occasion Lasith has donated whole sets of books to a daham pasala worth lakhs and lakhs of rupees. Ruwin being the chief coach at NCC knew what he said and concluded by saying that one must not judge people by their hair styles. Lack of space denies me to write some other interesting stories related to me by Ruwin.

Series of discrepancies in selection of inflight duty free service provider
A series of discrepancies pertaining to selection of an inflight duty free service provider for SriLankan Airlines in 2012 were revealed yesterday before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka.
These revelations came to light as Senior Manager Commercial Procurement Gihan Silva and Senior Manager (Revenue) Accounting Upeka Abeysekara of SriLankan Airlines gave evidence before the Commission yesterday.
According to the board paper dated March 14, 2012, the national carrier has entered upon a contract with a company named Phoenix Duty Free Company Pvt Ltd for the supply of wine and champagne for onboard use in SriLankan Airlines. Following a delayed tender procedure, Phoenix Duty Free Company Pvt Ltd was selected out of 17 shortlisted bidders. However, the payments made to this service provider were directed to a Canadian bank account holder called Phoenix Rising Ventures of Canada Ltd. The latters name does not appear in the said agreement.
It was also revealed that the payments were credited to an account number which was not included in the referred agreement as well. Invoices pertaining to such transactions were submitted to the Commission by the witnesses. There have been several payments made to another entity under the title Phoenix Duty Free Lanka Pvt Ltd, it was observed.
According to the then Senior Manager (Finance) Accounting Upeka Abeysekara, they did not received any correspondence or verification from the service provider of a change of company name or anything relating to such an alteration. Abeysekara said that the Phoenix Duty Free Company informed her of an email in relation to this subject in 2015. However, the transactions took place from 2012.
It was also revealed that a US$ 1.6 million loss was incurred by SriLankan Airlines due to the change in the method of calculating the minimum guarantee commission paid to the same service provider after one year of the original contract. According to the evidence led before the Commission, a decision was taken to change the method of calculation of the minimum guarantee commission from sector passenger basis to origin to destination passenger basis.
According to the audited financial statements, earlier when SriLankan Airlines managed the duty free services in 2011-2012, it recorded arevenue of Rs. 721 million, whereas when Phoenix Duty Free took over, the revenue dropped to a Rs. 526 million.
It was also revealed that there was a conflict of interest with regard to the proposal forwarded by Phoenix Duty Free Company Pvt Ltd. According to evidence, the wine tasting event was organised by the bidder itself. The event and the panel of experts were selected by the bidder as well. The panel also included representatives of the bidder. Witness Gihan Silva said that usually such events were previously under the care of SriLankan Airlines.
State Counsel Shantha Bandara and Shakila Gunatilake led evidence for the day. The Commission is to sit again on Wednesday, July 4, at the BMICH.

Constrictions in the Korean Dream
Shadow veiling stride to success
Sumith Prasanna Bandara Koswatte came from a middle-income family. His father was an electrician and so was his brotherit was their family business. But having done his A/L exams, Koswatte was not satisfied with having to join their electrical shop in Matale.
At age 25, he was running out of options; he had a vocational training certificate and was a qualified electrician, but he could not find work at any established company. It was then that he learnt that the government had called for applications for those seeking jobs in South Korea. Similar to many men his age, he applied with hopes of going to South Korea.
He got chosen the first time he applied. Many apply several times, but my son was smart, said his mother, Badra Koswatte. Her son died early this year of lung cancer. He was 33 years old and a father of a three-year-old boy.
Long hours and harsh conditions
Badra Koswatte.
According to medical reports, Koswatte had been diagnosed with lung cancer. His mother said that he was in perfect health when he left to South Korea in 2009. She was not wrong; according to the Employment Permit System (EPS) scheme, all foreign workers need to pass a medical examination before they are chosen to be in the database for employment.
The doctor who examined him said it might have developed due to his work there, she said.
Koswatte, who had applied to work in the manufacturing industry, had worked at a paint factory initially and then was transferred to a gear box-manufacturing company as a result of the strong chemicals used in the paint factory.
He said the chemicals were too strong; he could not continue to work there. Then he moved to the gear box place, but even there, he was exposed to dangerous residues. He told me that even though they wore masks, when they washed their faces at night, they could still feel iron dust on their faces, she added.
Living and working conditions for Koswatte were no better. He shared a converted container space with four to five other workers and more often than not, they would work 12-hour days to earn extra money through overtime payments.
A Korean employment contract lasts a maximum of four years and 10 months and the end of it, Koswatte was back home. He had sent enough money home to build himself a house and save up to start a family. In 2015, he got married and had a son. One and a half years after his return, as Koswatte was working on setting up his own electrical work practice, he was diagnosed with cancer.
Korea a paradise for workers
According to a Financial Times report in December, 2017 (https://www.ft.com/content/57c76820-d3f0-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9), South Korea has one of the highest industrial death rates in the developed world, and a culture of covering up accidents, say lawmakers, workers and experts.
The occupational fatality rate was 10.1 deaths per 100,000 employeesamong the highest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)in 2015. But South Koreas overall industrial accident rate was just reported to be 0.49 per 100 workersthis has led to speculation that companies were covering up such incidents to avoid increased insurance payments and damage to their brands.
The article, which highlights the case of a worker at the Hankook Tire Factoryone of the largest in the countrysaid many workers had succumbed to occupational diseases such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.
Yet only four workers had been officially recognised and compensated by the company due to difficulties in proving a direct causal link between their work conditions and illnesses. An examination of 4,500 Hankook Tire workers discovered that about half the workforce should be considered patientsor were likely to become ill soonaccording to a 2010 study by the ministry.
The story of the worker at Hankook is no different from Koswatte. Whilst Badra Koswatte too knows that her son was diagnosed with cancer after having worked in the factories in South Korea, she has little means or ability to technically prove this causal link.
For one year and five months, she took her son from hospital to hospital and finally to the Maharagama Cancer Hospital where he died.
There were 120 boys in his batch. I heard two others also got lung cancer, but how do we prove it she queried.
One among many
According to research conducted by Kelaniya University student Ishani Wijesooriya in 2017 on Sri Lankan Labour Migration to South Korea, since the 1990s, there has been an increasing preference for Sri Lankan migrants to South Korea. The majority of those seeking work were men between the ages of 20 to 30 in the labour category, and the main driving factor was that Korea offered better wages and employment.
A photograph of Sumith Koswatte and his son.
Having interviewed 50 Sri Lankans working in South Korea, her data showed that 34 of them reported difficult working conditions (68 percent) and 17 of them (34 percent) said they had been in industrial accidents. However, a majority of those interviewed said they were satisfied with their lives and salaries in Korea.
For foreign migrants who move to South Korea looking for work, difficult working conditions are not new. According to official Korean statistics, there were 360,000 migrant workers in South Korea in 2006, making up 1.5 percent of the total workforce. By May, 2017, those numbers had declined to 260,000 as public perception of foreign workers in South Korea had worsened, as reflected in a poll released early this year.
Korea had allowed foreign migrants to enter as low-skilled labourers to work at 3Ds industries; Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning. These were the jobs South Koreans themselves did not want to do.
According to a 2006 Amnesty International study, with South Korea implementing the EPS Act that came in 2004, it became the first labour-importing country in Asia to attempt to protect the rights of migrant workers through legislation.
The EPS Act prohibits discrimination against foreign workers (Article 22).(57). It also recognises their right to have access to a system of redress against employers in cases of overdue wages and industrial accidents and also to national health insurance.
The report, however, noted that at the time, the EPS had little impact on health and safety at work for migrant workers, Under safety rules, all employers are obliged to conduct monthly medical check-ups for their staff and to check the safety of their machines. However, Amnesty Internationals research suggests that very few companies conduct such checks and that migrant workers continue to be exposed to industrial hazards such as dangerous chemicals, with little protection.
Further, under the EPS, migrant workers found it difficult to change jobs even when they suffered from health complications or human rights violations in a particular workplace, unless they had officially reported their ill-health or abuse, said Amnesty.
Since the Amnesty report, reporting and monitoring mechanisms in South Korea had received wide attention, but the question of sending Sri Lankan workers to work at dirty industries still remain. For those like Koswatte, the impacts of working in such environments was not immediately apparent, but under the system, does Sri Lanka really have a choice
Still the better option
Despite the issues, for sending countries like Sri Lanka, South Korea is a far better option than other countries; for example the Middle East.
In Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernandos view, workers sent to South Korea were treated well and if there were cases of cancer in some, it was isolated and unrelated; I have not heard of any problems from South Korea, he said.
Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment's (SLBFE's) Approval and Recruitment Deputy General Manager D. P. P. Senanayake, in an interview with the Daily News, said Sri Lanka was one of the 16 countries to be chosen to send workers to South Korea under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two respective governments.
Workers recruited under the E9 visa category receive an initial contract of three years, and if the employer wishes, it could be extended up to four years and 10 months.
On reasonable grounds, a worker, with permission from the Labour office there, can change employers thrice during the contract period. If a worker who gets there finds out that another company pays better, it would not be a justifiable reason to change employers, said Senanayake.
If a worker had worked for four years and 10 months for the same employer, once again with the permission of the Labour office in Korea, the employer could request for the same person on a new contract; They are called committed workers. This is to encourage people to stick to one employer.
Sri Lanka is the only country out of 16 to be given the opportunity to send workers under three categories. They are; manufacturing, fisheries and construction. Senanayake said Sri Lankan workers dominated the manufacturing sector there due to their skills being more preferred.
The whole selection system comes under a computerised EPS TOPIK Point System which holds an examination to test the workers for their language proficiency, skills and competency.
We are informed by the Human Resource Development Service (HRDS) of Korea regarding the issuance of admittance of applicants. We have a network of offices and we in turn call for applications. Another rule recently introduced is that those who had gone on the E9 and E10 visa previously and stayed for more than five years, are not qualified for admissions, he added.
HRDS Korea decides the quota of workers allowed from every country each year, based on their local requirements.
The number of passes has no connection with the number they require. They select extra so they have a pool to select from, by their employers. This year, they may have passed more than last year, but that does not mean they would recruit more than last year. This is for roster requirements, he said.
The workers marked out of 200 score differently according to sector. Manufacturing for example, scores language proficiency out of 100, whilst construction and fisheries score the same out of 90. Meanwhile, fisheries and construction score higher for skills (out of 110), whilst manufacturing requires a score out of 110logic being you need more skills for fisheries and construction.
Employers in South Korea then could approach a job centre there and request for workers based on their nationality, weight and height, and they would be given a selection of workers based on such criteria. Employers cannot choose based on a workers identity.
Just because you pass the exam, there is no guarantee that you would be selected. There are workers who have been in the system for two years and are still not selected. Eventually, the system automatically deletes them from the database, said Senanayake.
The SLBFE officer, who had spent three years at the Sri Lankan Embassy in South Korea, however noted that the country was still the preferred destination for many Sri Lankans and there was a huge demand for it; many could earn between USD 1,500 to 2,000 per month, despite the work not being easy. Today, Sri Lanka ranks fifth among the 16 in sending workers to Korea.
High-risk jobs
He explained that schemes such as the Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service and insurance for industrial accidents protected the workers there. In the event of a death or accident, the family of the worker would receive compensation. Further, the Korea National Pension Service Scheme was also extended for foreigners who have worked for four years and 10 months.
The workers, according to Senanayake, were informed of these schemes during their pre-departure training and orientation; three days after arrival in South Korea. Further, they were also informed of a hotline to contact if any issues were to arise; The worker can speak to a person in their own language, so they are free to complain.
He said the Sri Lankan Embassy there checked workplaces in order to ascertain whether there were any complaints regarding their Labour Office, but workers often complained to have not understood safety measures.
We have systems. Workers select their preferred sector, no one forces them to. If they do not want to, they can come back. Working in the industry sector means you have to deal with chemicals and machines, you cannot refuse to work with them, Senanayake said.
In our experience, we know that Korea is the safest country, compared to our other receiving countries, he added.
Role of the SLBFE
The SLBFE has a difficult balance to maintain often, between the welfare of the workers and ensuring that South Korea is happy so that they would recruit more of our workers. When asked what the role of the SLBFE was, Senanayake said it was to promote the sending of foreign workers, adding that he was simply catering to the demands of Sri Lankans who aspired for the Korean Dream.
The balance needs to be there, we cant lose the market, Senanayake said.
In 2011, 5,349 workers were sent to South Korea across all sectors, but by 2017, the number had dropped to 3,439. The main reason being that the fisheries sector, which had the second highest sending rate, also had the highest runaway rate; More than 90 percent of those who went for fisheries ran away in 2016.
Fisheries is tougher than manufacturing and earlier, they only looked at the language proficiency of those who applied. But we explained that it was better to also give them fisheries training, so we commenced a course on it. At present, the runaway rate has significantly declined, but the issue was that it created a bad impression about our workers.
As fisheries had a lower pass mark than the rest, most Sri Lankans had chosen that sector to work in, and they were not necessarily fishermen. Senanayake, however, said they expected their yearly quota to recover by this year.
People want to go to Korea somehow. They dont bother if it is fisheries, construction or whatever. Once they go there, they think they can runaway and work elsewhere, he said.
In a bid to win the confidence of South Korea further, the SLBFE, during the last few years, had also taken steps to curb the number of illegal Sri Lankan migrants in South Korea. The introduction of a bond for all those who go to Korea to minimise runaway rates and instituting legal action against those who do not keep to their contract, have had a positive impact, Senanayake said.
He said, We were praised by the Korean Government when President Maithripala Sirisena visited South Korea last year. With that they increased our quota for manufacturing by 1,200.
Senanayake added that sending workers to Korea might not always be feasible, especially with increasing youth unemployment there; Last year, there was a plan to introduce a special tax on companies that hired foreigners, but due to resistance from companies, they had withdrawn that. So we cannot always expect this trend to continue.
When asked whether it was time we ourselves should look at taking measures to ensure that our own workers were not exposed to dangerous working conditions, he said that they had done their best to voice concerns at various times, but given that we were sending country, our powers were limited,
Senanayake said, We cant protest. It is a preferable destination for everyone. This is a comparative thing. If we dont send, someone else will, or they themselves will find a way to get there.
Sri Lanka had also requested that Korea open up the agriculture sector for workers, to increase sending numbers.
Badra Koswatte, in the meantime, sits in an empty house she built for her son. It is all that is left of the Korean dream.
The South Korean automotive industry.

The SLCUA holds its felicitation ceremony with the intention of encouraging its current members and drawing in new recruits as cricket umpires. At the ceremony closer to 100 members were felicitated for their yeomen services bestowed as umpires for the game of cricket.
Presently the SLCUA has a strong membership of closer to 100 experienced and budding umpires, with many of them being youngsters who are training under the watchful eyes of the veterans of the trade namely D.N. Pathirana, J.W.K. Boteju and E.K.G. Wijewardhana. The President of SLCUA, Ashrof Ghany, at the felicitation ceremony stated the importance of being disciplined and unbiased at matches to safeguard the reputation of cricket umpires.
It's an honour to have veteran coach Mr. Nelson Mendis as the Guest of Honour, it's encouraging to have a personality like him to further boost the energy of our members. Mr. Mendis is known for producing top quality cricketers to the country, and it's a privilege to have him here to further enhance our umpires with his vast knowledge in cricket, Ghany stated.
Ghany further went on to say that the SLCUA is making all possible moves to encourage youngsters and newcomers to take up cricket umpiring. The SLCUA has an elite panel of experienced international and first class umpires, who are fully committed to train the newcomer, added Ghany.
An umpire should be well educated of the updating cricket laws, be neutral, unbiased and always ready to handle the pressure. At SLCUA, we are helping our members, specially the youngsters to adhere to those values, he added.
The SLCUA currently officiates matches conducted mainly by Mercantile Cricket Association, Nationalized Services Cricket Association, State Services Cricket Association, Colombo District Cricket Association and other encounters, in particular friendly games played against visiting foreign teams.
The event was planned to be held under the patronage of Colombo Mayor, Rosy Senanayake, but the chief guest could not attend it due to a personal reason and she was represented by her sister Shereen Massilamani and the Personal Secretary Sandra Thomas. The Guest of Honour veteran cricket coach Nelson Mendis took over the proceedings as the chief guest in the absence of Ms. Senanayake and delivered an inspiring speech. I commend the commitment of Mr. Ghany, who had been heading the Nationalized Services Sports Federation and the Nationalized Services Cricket Association. Under him the two associations achieved a lot and he has moved forward with his commitment with the SLCUA as well.
The entity has been helping produce umpires to the country and I'm proud to be here, to talk to these persons who stand there in the middle under varying conditions and help the game take a neat flow, Mendis stated, before personally talking to each member of the SLCUA.
The SLCUA has been conducting this programme to felicitate the umpires regularly mainly to recognise the services of the local cricket umpires who have contributed towards the SLCUA.

South Korea's Park wins Women's PGA Championship in playoff
Chicago, Sunday: South Korea's Park Sung-hyun birdied twice in a weather-disrupted playoff Sunday to win the Women's PGA Championship, capturing the second major women's golf title of her career.
The 24-year-old from Seoul, last year's US Women's Open champion, defeated compatriot Ryu So-yeon, denying her bid to reclaim the world number one ranking, and Japanese teen star Nasa Hataoka in the playoff to capture the $547,500 top prize.
"It was a really long round today and I still can't believe I'm sitting next to this trophy," Park said.
Hataoka and the South Koreans each finished 72 holes at Kemper Lakes deadlocked at 10-under par 278.
Fifth-ranked Ryu and sixth-ranked Park each birdied the first playoff hole, the par-4 18th, while Nataoka was eliminated with a par.
The Koreans, who shared LPGA Player of the Year honors in 2017, reached the green at the par-4 16th, the second playoff role, when play was suspended for dangerous weather in the area, halting the drama at its peak for 20 minutes as the tension mounted.
When play resumed, Ryu missed her birdie putt and Park sank hers for the victory then broke into tears.
"I got less nervous during the playoff. I was even joking," Park said.
"I was a little worried, but even though it was a tough week, I feel like I played really well. All the hard work paid off and that's what made me cry."
Park, last year's LPGA Rookie of the Year, won her second title of the year after the LPGA Texas Classic in May. It was her fourth LPGA title overall after last year's US and Canadian Women's Open crowns.
Seeing positives
Ryu, who won last year's ANA Inspiration and the 2011 US Women's Open, took her first title of the year two weeks ago at the LPGA Meijer Classic and hoped to more one step closer to a career Grand Slam.
"I did my best," Ryu said. "If I look back, nothing I can do any better than that. I just did 100 percent effort. Every shot, every putt and still looking at the positive side. This is my best finish for this tournament, so hopefully it's going to keep improving, and one day I want to lift that trophy."
Ryu, who turned 28 on Friday, would have overtaken Park Sung-hyun atop the rankings with a victory after starting the day with a three-stroke lead.
Hataoka, 19, won her first LPGA title last week in Arkansas and with more than $546,000 in the past eight days has eclipsed her prior career earnings. In the final round, Ryu stumbled with a double bogey at the par-4 second and Park birdied the par-3 third and par-5 fourth to seize a share of the lead.
But Ryu birdied the par-3 sixth and par-5 seventh to restore a two-stroke edge at 11-under.
Ryu added a birdie at the par-5 11th but took a bogey at the par-3 13th to stand only one ahead of Nataoka, with Park closing to within one after a birdie at 14.
Ryu responded with a birdie at the 16th, giving her a two-shot lead, but found water at the par-3 17th and made a double bogey, falling back level with Nataoka and Park, who both parred 18 to force extra holes. AFP

It is sorrowful to see artistes who contributed towards a bright era of Sri Lankan Cinema leaving us one by one. Roy de Silva was such a special artiste, who was a great strength towards the forward march of local cinema in many faces, such as a veteran actor, film director and producer, states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a condolence message issued on the death of veteran film actor, director and producer Roy de Silva.
The message said: "Roy de Silva, who entered the acting field in the 1960 decade, contributed his versatile acting to many films which became immensely popular among film fans. He had a special aptitude to play any role, including that of the hero, villain or jester.
"Roy, who was an incomparable actor and film creator, has also joined script writing and background singing. At a time when the local cinema suffered a setback in the 1980 decade, he contributed towards its uplift by creating commercial films which set box office records. While saluting veteran artiste Roy de Silva, who dedicated his whole life towards local cinema, I wish to convey my deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, veteran actress Sumana Amarasinghe and all his family members and relatives," the Prime Minister said in his message.

Strengthening US dollar leads to sharp currency depreciation - Moodys
The strengthening US dollar since mid-April has led to sharp currency depreciation and significant declines in foreign exchange reserves in a number of emerging and frontier market countries, increasing credit risks for those with large external funding needs, Moodys Investors Service said in a report yesterday.
The report looks at the external exposure of 40 emerging and frontier market sovereigns with some of the highest levels of external debt, either in US dollar terms or in relation to the size of their respective economies.
Some countries among the most vulnerable to a stronger US dollar are Argentina (B2 stable), Ghana (B3 stable), Mongolia (B3 stable), Pakistan (B3 negative), Sri Lanka (B1 negative), Turkey (Ba2 Review for downgrade), and Zambia (B3 stable).
Countries with large current account deficits, high external debt repayments and substantial foreign-currency government debt are most exposed to the impact of a stronger US dollar, said . To the extent that these currency fluctuations reflect capital outflows or significantly lower external inflows, they are credit negative for sovereigns with large external funding needs.
Emerging markets that have been prone to large shocks to external financing conditions in the past are  all else equal - more likely to experience large shocks now unless past shocks led to adjustments that reduced their reliance on external funding.
In 2014, Hungary, Malaysia, Mongolia and Russia were among those that experienced particularly large shocks to their external financing conditions. In the period since then, Angola (B3 stable), Kenya (B2 stable), Indonesia and Sri Lanka experienced relatively large negative shocks. Of these, Kenya, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Zambia remain highly vulnerable, implying high structural hurdles to lowering reliance on external financing.
Sustained and severe shocks to external financing conditions can have credit implications, in particular when they result in a significant further erosion of financial buffers, raise liquidity risks and/or take fiscal metrics onto a more unfavorable path than Moodys had previously expected.

Stylish Neymar steers Brazil past Mexico and into World Cup quarters
wSamara, Monday: Neymar scored a stylish opener and set up substitute Roberto Firmino for a late second as Brazil cruised into the quarter-finals of the World Cup with a 2-0 win over Mexico on Monday.
Bidding for a record-extending sixth title in Russia, Brazil weathered an early storm at Samara Arena before Neymar turned on the style to underline their status as favourites.
Brazil will now meet the winners of Monday's later match between Belgium and Japan, but after seeing Argentina, Spain and Portugal eliminated in the last 16, Tite's men will fancy their chances.
"We have to learn to suffer and we did suffer, it was a tough match," said Neymar. "We knew they were a high-quality opponent."
Mexico made a bright start in their attempt to beat Brazil in a World Cup match for the first time.
But after dominating the first 20 minutes of an entertaining opening period, Brazil came back into the match, bossing the final stages of the half.
The match had been billed as a duel between Neymar and Javier Hernandez, but the West Ham striker was more noticeable for his platinum-dyed blond hair, a choice also made by central defender Carlos Salcedo, before being replaced in the second half.
Brazil awoke from their early slumber late in the opening half, but Neymar's angled drive was blocked by Guillermo Ochoa and striker Gabriel Jesus saw the 'keeper block his drive after a smart one-two.
After the interval Mexico lost drive and focus and Neymar broke the deadlock on 51 minutes.
The Paris Saint-Germain star drew several defenders as he ran across the edge of the area with the ball at his feet.
He laid it off for Willian and darted into the box, stretching to convert the Chelsea midfielder's superb delivery.
Mexico were on the ropes, but Casemiro spurned a great chance to stretch Brazil's lead, seeing his shot blocked by Ochoa. Osorio replaced the ineffective Hernandez with Raul Jimenez on the hour and Alisson dived to tip over Carlos Vela's curling drive.
But Brazil had moved up a gear. Neymar was starting to showcase his talents but he was left writhing in pain after a tussle with second-half replacement Miguel Layun.
Replays appeared to show Layun caught Neymar on his ankle but he escaped sanction.
With 10 minutes remaining, Tite replaced Barcelona midfielder Paulinho with Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho. Brazil secured victory when Neymar turned provider in the 88th minute, finding Firmino in the box and the Liverpool forward made no mistake. AFP

Surveys say 25 percent of public sector officials are corrupt

Surveys done on the public sector by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) have revealed that 25 percent of public sector officials are corrupt.
CIABOC Commissioner C. Neville Guruge addressing the media and civil society members at an event held at the Movenpick Hotel, Colombo on Monday night said the remaining 75 percent were clean but their voices were drowned by the 25 percent, They have been cornered, the clean have not been given a place in the public sector, he said.
The event was held to gather views of the media and civil society members on the drafting of a National Action Plan to Eliminate Bribery and Corruption. The proposal to formulate one received cabinet approval recently and CIABOC stated that they expected to prepare one within the next three months.
We also see that in any institution where there is rampant corruption, there are weaknesses in the leadership. If the head does not lead by example, if he/she is not strict about curbing it in their respective institutions, the situation is bad, said Guruge.
He further explained that of the 25 percent who are corrupt, 15 percent can be reformed, but the remaining 10 percent were so entrenched in such practices that only legal action worked, This 10 percent does not want to change, they are not interested. Legal action must be taken against them.
Honesty is not only refraining from taking bribes. It is a wide subject. If someone is taking a salary but is not working, he is shirking his responsibilities. Simply coming to work on time and leaving early having done nothing is also being dishonest.
The CIABOC which is expected to focus on awareness and preventive methods to curb bribery and corruption, said they have launched several programmes in schools to mould the mindsets of children. Integrity clubs have been planned in schools to instil values of integrity and honesty, We have to start from the beginning otherwise we will also lose the next generation to this menace, said Guruge.

Switzerland bid to summon spirit of 1954 World Cup
NIZHNIY NOVGOROD, Russia, Sunday: Switzerland have made headlines in Russia for their players controversial goal celebrations but the team stands on the verge of matching their best-ever run at a World Cup.
If Vladimir Petkovic's side beat Sweden in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday, they will become the first Swiss team in 64 years to qualify for the quarter-finals of football's biggest tournament.
Although they have largely gone under the radar in Russia -- double-eagle scoring celebrations against Serbia aside against -- the unheralded team are enjoying an impressive tournament.
Marshalled by skipper Stephan Lichtsteiner, driven by Valon Behrami's energy, and able to call on Xherdan Shaqiri's creativity, Switzerland emerged from a tricky Group E that included tournament favourites Brazil.
They are unbeaten in Russia, have scored in every game and a defeat against Portugal last October is the only blemish in an impressive run of results over the past two years.
Add in impressive goalkeeper Yann Sommer, who writes a gourmet food blog when not playing international football, and Switzerland are becoming a formidable unit.
We want more and more, Petkovic said after his team made the last 16.
We are used to making history, we have big ambitions and the next big ambition is to beat Sweden.
The last time Switzerland reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup, in 1954, they were hosts and the 16-team tournament was a very different beast -- they lost their last-eight clash to Austria 7-5 after being three up early on.
But as they look to match or even better that showing, there is a significant cloud on the horizon for the Sweden match.
Switzerland and Sweden have not met since 2002 so there are recent no indications of who could have the edge on Tuesday.
Although the last-16 match is one of the least glamorous of the first knockout phase, it provides a good opportunity to qualify for the last eight in the weaker side of the draw, and for Switzerland to re-write their World Cup history.  AFP

Thailand cave rescue: Boys 'could be in cave for months'
Twelve boys and their football coach trapped in a Thai cave have been found alive but will need learn to dive or wait months for flooding to recede before they can get out, the army says.
The group had been missing for nine days before they were found by divers late on Monday on a small dry ledge.
Rescuers are now battling rising water to bring more supplies to the group.
They may need to have food sent in for at least the next four months, according to the military.
How were they found
Two British rescuer divers who had flown over to join the search operation found the boys on Monday night.
The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 were there and that they were very hungry.
They ask how long they have been underground and whether they can leave now. The divers tell them they have to wait, but say people will come back for them.
One boy replies: "Oh. See you tomorrow."
The search for the group had gripped the nation as it was unclear where they were or whether they even were still alive.
Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of the rescue.
How can they get out
The Tham Luang cave complex in Chiang Rai in northern Thailand is regularly flooded during the rainy season which lasts until September or October.
If the children are to be brought out before then, they will have to learn basic diving skills.
But experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be a very dangerous operation.
Attempts to pump the water levels lower have so far not been successful.
If they are to wait until the water recedes by itself, it would mean the boys will have to stay in the cave for months and have to be continuously supplied with food and assistance.
Doctors will go in to carry out medical checks in the coming days to establish their condition and treat possible injuries.
Who are they
The 12 boys are all members of a local football team, the youngest of them only aged 11.
The 25-year old coach who got trapped with them is known to have taken them on occasional excursions and field trips.

Troops in humanitarian effort in Mullaitivu to mark Poson Poya
In what could be considered a mammoth and noble welfare project to upgrade the living standards of the people of Mullaittivu, the Security Force Headquarters  Mullaittivu (SFHQ-MLT) in close coordination and sponsorship of the Embilipitiya Sri Bodhi Raja Foundation of Ven. (Dr) Omalpe Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, gave away a colossal stock of humanitarian goods on Poson Poya Day (27), during a mega event at the Mullaittivu public grounds.
The distribution of a herd of 100 dairy cows to selected 100 underprivileged families, 50 wheelchairs for the handicapped and to remote hospitals, 150 gift parcels of school books and accessories, each worth about Rs.1,000 to students, 150 mammoty blades for the poor agrarian community and several other relief packs, took place during this huge event, supported by Thai and Singaporean philanthropists and other donors of the Foundation.
In response to a request of Security Forces  Mullaittivu (SF-MLT) Commander Major General Dushyantha Rajaguru, Ven. (Dr.) Omalpe Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, in order to support ongoing healthy reconciliation gestures of the Army, all of which have been prioritised by the Army Commander under his visionary nation-building concept, voluntarily came forward to offer his generosity by way of this mega donation, worth more than Rs. 5.5 million. SFHQ-MLT, taking note of the fact that the Mullaittivu district is the worst poverty-affected zone in the country, has intensified its community-oriented roles in collaboration with the District Secretariat, Divisional Secretariats, state officials and Grama Niladhari officials at ground level.
Such welfare projects are carried out regularly by the troops in all formations under command to the SFHQ- MLT by way of conducting health clinics and distribution of nutrients, school accessories, clothes, medicine, push bicycles, scholarships, tree saplings, spectacles, vegetable and fruit seedlings, school uniforms, roof sheets, and home utensils.
Selection of the recipients, coordination and the guidance for the donation were made by General Officers Commanding of the 59, 64 and 68 Divisions of the SFHQ-MLT in close touch with respective state officials at village levels.
In addition, Mullaittivu troops offer their unfailing assistance to dig drinking water and agrarian wells for civilians on request since such work would cost them heavily if the private sector involvement were used for the purpose. Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray attended the distribution ceremony as the chief guest in Mullaittivu.
Ven. (Dr.) Omalpe Sobhitha Nayaka Thera, Chief Sangha Nayak of the Sourthern Province in Sri Lanka Ramagnna Nikaya and Chief Sangha Nayaka of Singapore who is also the pioneering architect of Mullaittivus welfare initiative thanked the Army for all the support and its painstaking efforts for screening of the most wanted and all other related arrangements before those reliefs were given away.
Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Catholic religious dignitaries, Mullaittivu District Secretary Rupawathi Kethishwaran, Commander, Security Forces  Mullaittivu Major General Dushyantha Rajaguru, Killinochchi District DIG Mahinda Gunaratne, Mullaittivu District SP Wasantha Kandewatta, and representatives from Thailand and Singapore, donors to the project, senior officials of the Education Department, agriculture, health, veterinary surgeons, senior officers of the Armed Forces, school students, parents and a gathering of civilians witnessed the mammoth welfare project.

US Open champion Sloane Stephens became the biggest casualty on the opening day of the Wimbledon women's singles as she lost to world number 55 Donna Vekic.
The fourth-seeded American, who was beaten by Simona Halep in last month's French Open final, looked out of sorts as she fell to a 6-1 6-3 defeat.
Her Croat opponent came out strongly and looked more confident throughout with her big-hitting causing problems.
Meanwhile Roger Federer began his quest for a record-extending ninth Wimbledon men's singles title with a routine win over Serbia's Dusan Lajovic.
Federer, who is 37 in August, won 6-1 6-3 6-4 against the world number 57.
The Swiss was in imperious form as he continued the tradition of the defending men's champion opening up Monday's play on Centre Court. Federer will play either Slovakia's world number 73 Lukas Lacko or France's Benjamin Bonzi - ranked 284th - next. The 20-time Grand Slam champion needed just 79 minutes to see off Lajovic, who also lost in straight sets to Federer at Wimbledon last year. - BBC

We grieve untimely demise of fearless media person
The untimely demise of youthful media person Chamara Lakshan who succeeded in opening a new vista of a long journey in the Sri Lankan media field within a short period, will bring grief to the heart of every person in this country who had cherished hopes for the future.
Mangala Samaraweera, Finance and Media Minister
The manner in which this youth, with determination, used his service stations as a school to fashion and polish his vision and virtues of life after joining the Lakbima, Irudina and Rivira newspapers is evident from his use of the media in later life.
Chamara Lakshan who was among the handful of journalists who bravely came forward to oppose the dreadful administration of the misguided pre-2015 regime used his pen fearlessly to achieve his objective with a vision.
He acted with great responsibility not only to bring about the yahapalana government, but also to plot it on the right direction.
Lakshan, who stepped into the leading newspaper publishing house (Pattara Mahagedara) as a Senior Associate Editor of the Dinamina worked with great effort and dedication to turn a new leaf in the path of Lake House within a short period.
The Resa newspaper was launched purely due to the results of his dedicated efforts. It is no secret that the Resa newspaper edited by Lakshan earned popularity among the countrys youth within a short time.
Chamara Lakshan, who became the youngest editor of the Silumina newspaper, was able to add his name to the list of senior media greats of the past due to his dedicated effort.
The manner in which he tried to add novelty to the Silumina newspaper without harming its endemic social, cultural and political values and layout is most praiseworthy.
The sudden demise of Chamara Lakshan who was a political commentator and a veteran media person, is a great loss not only to the media sector but the entire nation.
I wish to convey my condolences to the bereaved family of this energetic and fearless media person and his relatives and friends grieving over his untimely demise.
I salute you Chamara, who made a journey of several thousand miles start with just a single step, his watchword.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Winds of change in Mexico
Another newcomer challenging the Establishment has arisen on the international stage, this time in Central America. Mexicos pivotal Presidential Election held on Sunday ended with a massive victory for the former Mayor of Mexico City Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador  a populist nationalist representing the left-wing political party Morena that he founded just four years ago. This was the largest-ever election in the country with almost 90 million eligible voters and 18,000 open positions, with the Presidential race dominating the headlines and commanding the most attention of voters.
Obrador, affectionately called AMLO after his initials, had a simple message that resonated widely with the electorate  he would do everything possible to end drug and gang related violence, corruption at all levels and rampant poverty. His ascension to the presidency marks a major change for a country that has been led by the same two political parties for almost 90 years.
It reflects widespread disillusionment with outgoing President Enrique Pea Nieto and the ruling PRI Party. Mexicos other main party, the conservative National Action Party (PAN), also came under criticism for not tackling widespread violence and ingrained corruption. (Obrador will not take office until December 1, leaving Nieto at the helm for five more months)
There was another reason for Obradors popularity among voters. He has pledged to demand respect from US President Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on building a wall at the Mexican border and immigration from South America in general had strained relations between the two countries, perhaps to their lowest level in decades. Mexico has already ruled out paying for the wall and this policy is unlikely to change under Obrador. But in a sign of goodwill, Trump on Sunday night congratulated Lpez Obrador for the win.
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him, Trump tweeted. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!.
Indeed, the coming months will offer a clearer picture of how Lpez Obrador will handle his new role. Obrador drew huge support from Mexicans, as hundreds of thousands flooded stadiums, city plazas and rally venues to hear him speak. His challenge is to make that popularity last throughout his term, which is no means easy given the huge challenges ahead.
Obrador was frank enough to admit that main problem facing Mexico is corruption - a cancer that is destroying this country. His foreign policy will no doubt pivot on the US and he has offered no clues on links with other countries. In fact, he has maintained an almost obsessive focus on addressing internal issues, saying: The best foreign policy is domestic. He has thus promised increased pensions, educational grants for youth and more support for farmers.
Tackling violence should be his other main concern. Almost 110,000 Mexicans have been murdered since Nieto took office at the end of 2012. This years election campaign was one of the bloodiest in recent memory, leaving more than 130 candidates and others dead including Arturo Gomez, Mayor of Petatlan in the State of Guerrero. In the clearest sign linking official corruption with violence, the entire policy force of the city was disarmed and detained on suspicion. At the other end of the spectrum, Mexico badly suffers from a shortage of police personnel to tackle crime, with at least 116,000 positions unfilled. In the meantime, lawmakers have passed an Interior Security Law giving the military an official role in policing.
In fact, the military has had some success with cracking down on drug cartels under a directive of President Felipe Calderon in 2006. Since the crackdown on drug cartels began, many important drug kingpins have been arrested, leaving gangs to fight among themselves and fragment. That has lead to more, smaller gangs who are competing over the existing drug trade infrastructure and looking for new business. The dreaded Sinaloa cartel formerly headed by the captured kingpin Joaqun El Chapo Guzmn, has invested heavily in the production of Fentanyl, a new synthetic opioid considered to be 50 times stronger than heroin.
Among the new gang ventures are robbing freight trains, extorting money from civilians and illegally extracting oil, or huachicoleo, a phenomenon that has gone up by 790% in the last five years. Many politicians are said to be involved in this ring  12 mayors from Puebla State were arrested last year on suspicion of involvement in fuel-stealing.
Obrador will have his hands full dealing with all these problems for the next six years. He is under no illusion that it will be a walk in the park  he told voters that we are dealing with a country at war. He has an opportunity to reshape and rebuild the nation, a task that has so far eluded his predecessors. If he can end the violence and tackle corruption, economic growth will naturally follow for the second largest economy in Latin America. At the politically young age of 64, Obrador could be just the right man to lead Mexico beyond 2024.

World Cup penalty drama as Russia set up Croatia quarter-final
MOSCOW, Russia, Sunday: Goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was the hero as Russia beat 2010 winners Spain on penalties to set up a World Cup quarter-final against Croatia, who survived their own spot-kick drama on Sunday.
Fernando Hierros Spain totally dominated the match at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, hogging 74 percent of possession, but created few clear-cut chances and buckled under pressure when it mattered most.
Veteran goalkeeper Akinfeev saved penalties from Koke and Iago Aspas as Russia won the shootout 4-3, reaching the last eight for the first time since 1970, when they played as the Soviet Union.
The unlikely victory sparked emotional scenes as the rain poured down and there was jubilation in central Moscow, with disbelieving locals cheering, waving flags, blowing horns and yelling Russ-i-a!
There was more penalty drama in the later match in Nizhny Novgorod, with Croatia coming out on top 3-2 just minutes after Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel had saved a penalty at the end of extra-time.
Five spot-kicks were saved during the nailbiting shootout, two by Schmeichel and three by Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Subasic.
Earlier, Mathias Jorgensen gave Denmark the lead after just 58 seconds but Mario Mandzukic levelled for Croatia in the fourth minute and the sides remained locked at 1-1 at the end of extra time.
PENALTY AIM
Russia are the lowest-ranked nation in the tournament -- a lowly 70th in the world -- and were not expected to progress beyond the first round but they now find themselves in the last eight.
We were hoping for penalties, Akinfeev said after the match ended 1-1 after extra time, following a Sergei Ignashevich own goal and an assured Artem Dzyuba penalty.
We are having a fantastic World Cup. Not just our fans, but the fans of other countries are getting a sense of this atmosphere and understood that Russians really know how to play football and want to play football.
Russia came into the tournament derided by their own supporters after a string of defeats in warm-up matches but they thrashed Saudi Arabia 5-0 in their opener and then swept aside Egypt 3-1, making even their own sceptical public believe.
The result is a disaster for Spain, whose preparations for the World Cup were wrecked when their manager Julen Lopetegui was sacked on the eve of the tournament after he took the vacant Real Madrid coachs job.
Spain shipped five goals in their three group matches and there were major questions over the form of goalkeeper David de Gea coming into the knockout phase.
Hierro rejected any suggestion the team would have fared better had the Spanish federation not decided to axe Lopetegui after arriving in Russia.
We had opportunities to win this match but we ended up in a penalty shootout which is basically a lottery, and we werent lucky, he said.
I dont think you can talk about the team breaking down or there being any sort of collapse, the former Real Madrid captain said. In football theres a fine line between winning and losing.
STREET PARTIES
An impromptu mass party took place in the historic centre of Moscow late in the evening. Cars blared their horns as police and guards looked on.
Its great. Unbelievable. We are champions. We believe we will now be in the final with Brazil, said Anna Glazkova, 27, a human relations manager.
Im feeling perfect, said Ivan Lisin, 28, a Spartak Moscow fan, who works in digital marketing. He had the Russian flag painted on his cheek. This is a huge surprise for Russian people. We went on from the group stages and now we have beaten Spain. None of my friends or people who follow the game thought this would happen. This is like a miracle.
Sundays shock win for Russia follows the exits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi the previous day and means three potential contenders -- Portugal, Argentina and Spain -- have been dumped out in just 24 hours.
The departure of Ronaldo and Messi deprives the World Cup of its two biggest stars as they left the competition for possibly the last time.
Ronaldo will be 37 by the time the next World Cup is played in Qatar, but he would not be drawn on whether he planned to extend his international career after Portugal lost 2-1 to Uruguay on Saturday.
Messi, 31, was unable to find the net as France beat Argentina 4-3.  AFP

Wounded elephant charges at deputy minister
Deputy Wildlife Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma who went to check on an elephant who had sustained gunshot injuries, was charged at by the elephant for a distance of about 100 metres.
The incident took place near the Idda Pichcha Wewa area in Nawamillana, Dimbulagala, on June 30.
The deputy minister had been accompanied by the Aralaganwila Police OIC and a group of police officers and Weheragala Wildlife officers.
The Wildlife officers and police had fired into the air and stopped the elephant from causing any harm to the minister and had escorted him out of the jungle unharmed.
Speaking to the Daily News, Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma said, The elephant, though injured, still tried to uphold his majesty and thats why he chased us. Moreover, considering the harm done to him by humans, it is no surprise that he dislikes humans so much. We went back again on Sunday and examined the injuries on the elephant after sedating him and it was heart wrenching. The poor animal had a gaping gunshot wound on his left leg that was oozing out pus, as well as gunshot injuries on his chest and leg. He even had burn injuries on his head, possibly caused by being set on fire after acid or petrol or kerosene was poured on him. This animal is suffering. I dont know if we can save it, but we will do our best.
The deputy minister noted that the forest is polluted by the dumping of garbage which is consumed by wild animals, including the elephants. We found an elephant who was struggling in pain and upon examining its excrement, I found that 99 percent of it was shopping bags. Imagine what is in this animals stomach. The wildlife in our country is being systematically killed off in the most brutal manner. I commenced this inspection tour on June 23 from Sooriyawewa. A mother elephant who was injured by a hakkapatas was suffering with her mouth severely injured and in spite of her pain, she was still feeding her calf. Eventually the mother elephant came towards the village and collapsed. We rescued the baby elephant and took it to safety, but the injuries on the mother elephant were too much and she eventually succumbed to her injuries, explained Thewarapperuma.
The minister vowed that in spite of all the criticism, he would continue to do his best to save the wildlife assets of this country.

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday urged people not to sabotage countrys education system by politicising it.
Refuting some media reports which claimed that all government schools will be closed on July 4 due to a trade union action, Minister Kariyawasam confirmed that the schools will not be closed on that day.
He was addressing the media at Isurupaya yesterday.
Some media reports claimed that a trade union action is scheduled to take place on July 4 against the decision taken by the ministry to promote education officials allegedly for political revenge.
All these promotions have been done through a proper legal procedure by a committee and only 1,011 officials have been selected from 12,000 applications, said the Minister.
Political revenge is common under any government and it is not illegal to give promotions for the officers those who lost their promotions due to political revenge. Every government does that, he said.
UNP Trade Union Secretary and Power and Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera charged that all the promotions have been undertaken through a proper procedure.
Nobody can close schools as they wish and we will never let anybody do that, said the State Minister.

Young academics should think new to build Sri Lanka
Young academics should think new and think out-of-the-box, to build Sri Lanka, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawicrama.
Professionals and young academics should develop new thinking on Sri Lankas socio-economic advancement, he said speaking at the Saman Kelegama Memorial Symposium.
Saman Kelegamas legacy lives on through the research papers and books he authored, the young economists he inspired and of course, the institution he built. The Institute of Policy Studies is now widely recognised as a regional Centre of Excellence, and in large part due to his efforts. Economists who were trained and mentored by him, are now actively contributing to development initiatives in several capacities, including in my own Ministry.
As policymakers have over the past 25 years and in the future too will rely on the IPS to provide credible and rigorous economic analysis to help us formulate better policies for the betterment of the people. In 2015, our government identified the need to reorient the economy towards trade and investment  something that Saman had been advocating for some time and he agreed to guide this work. He was Sri Lankas chief trade negotiator for three bilateral Free Trade Agreements and took on this role at a time when the countrys growth orientation had been skewed towards an inward-looking, public infrastructure driven model.
During, Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement bilateral negotiations prior to signing of the FTA, the Singaporean Prime Minister made special mention of and paid a specific tribute to Dr. Kalegama.
Saman Kelegama was a true professional and a true patriot and always put the country first. However some opponents of the FTA with India even had the audacity to brand him a RAW agent or an economic hit man. A private sector individual went to the extent of getting his employees to protest on the streets with placards attacking him. He was deeply hurt and disturbed by these baseless and malicious allegations by a handful of people and organizations, particularly the GMOA.
These are the people who are against progressive steps being taken for the future of our country. They tried to question his patriotism, but actually it was they who are unpatriotic - putting their own interests above those of our country. We owe Saman a debt of gratitude for the immense contribution he made to Sri Lankas trade policy and economic reform work  not just with our government, but with successive governments before that, he added.

Dialog Inter-club Sevens overall champion CH and FC's dashing centre three quarter cum former St.Peters College Bambalapitiya vice-captain Nishon Perera has been selected to represent the Sri Lanka national Sevens squad for the first time.
Nishons exceptional performances at the recently-concluded inter-club Rugby Sevens (both legs) saw him obtaining a position in the 15 member Sri Lanka national 7s squad that was picked to represent Sri Lanka
It's an honour and a privilege to represent my country in rugby 7s. This is an opportunity that I have been waiting for, Nishon told the Daily News. First of all I thank God and my family for encouraging me in various ways and all the coaches who have been there from the beginning of my rugby career.
I don't forget the support of my team mates and friends. I will take this opportunity with both hands and do my best for the country, he said.
The Sri Lanka national sevens rugby squad left last night to France to participate in the World Games in Paris, which is due to be held on 7 and 8 July. By taking part in this tournament the national sevens rugby team will gain necessary experience for the upcoming Asian Games in Indonesia, which is due to take place in August.
Meanwhile it was shocking to see the selectors overlooking the best player of the Dialog inter club 7s second leg former Isipathana College, CR & FC and national sevens granite hardy forward Omalka Gunaratne who had an outstanding tournament both in attack and defence.
The selectors have instead opted for Dinuk Amerasinghe of Havelocks, who captained St. Anthonys College, Kandy and is also a former national under 18 and 20 sevens rugby player.
Sudharshana Muthuthanthri has been once again selected as captain, while all senior players like Danushka Ranjan, Srinath Sooriyabandara and Jason Dissanayake secured their places.
Due to reasons best known to the selectors, they have not selected CR & FCs nippy utility national sevens players Kevin Dixon and Rehan Silva in the squad.

Alliance Finance marks World Environment Day with a pledge across generations
It rained on Tuesday, the 05 June morning as Sri Lanka heralded the dawn of World Environment Day.
Showers of Blessing, one might say as the Alliance Finance team assembled across the island to mark this important International day set apart to bring home the significance of this all-encompassing among the Nations of the World.
In Sri Lanka, Alliance Finance (AFC) took the lead with their unique Thuru Mithuru program at just past 10 am on that rainy Tuesday morning, when AFC teams spread across 25 Districts in 991 Schools with 371,000 Children to plant 176,518 Trees that would absorb 3,843 Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide per Anum. It was a Pledge Across Generations across the nation in a fervent salute to Mother Nature!
In Colombo, one such school that hosted the AFC Thuru Mithuru Program was the Kotahena Madya Maha Vidyalaya, situated slap bang in the industrial district, known for its hardware trade. Headed by the School Principal, Mohan Weerasinghe, more than 100 students from the senior & junior forms took part in a mass Tree Planting exercise within the school compound, assisted by a band of enthusiastic teachers and a dedicated AFC team led by the Deputy Chairman & Managing Director, Romani De Silva himself.
Joining the mass of school children busy planting, he was heard to remark, our company is extremely satisfied by the spontaneous enthusiasm shown by the entire school in this volunteer effort. Right now, our teams across the island are doing the same in many other locations. I could not ask for more.
Following the tree planting, the School Principal made an impassioned plea for environmental conservation highlighting the dangers of neglect and indifference and extolling the virtue of protecting our planet. He welcomed the AFC team complimenting them for this initiative and stated that he was delighted to partner the company in this noble undertaking. A beautiful program of song and dance to depict natures pristine gift to humankind, presented by school troupes were interspersed by excellent video demonstrations of the Environmental Impact on our planet Earth.
AFC thus fulfilled a Pledge made on the 28 July 2013 to offset the carbon footprint of their motor vehicle leasing customers. Alliance Finance Co. PLC is Sri Lankas pioneering triple bottom line financial institution that promotes the creed, People <> Planet <> Profit. Having served for over four generations for 60 years, AFC is now promoting the concept of sustainability across our younger generations by the simultaneous planting of over 150,000 trees in schools across the island. By this initiative, AFC envisages sustaining a Life of Green in our Motherland in the years to come.

Chamara Lakshans funeral tomorrow
The funeral of Chamara Lakshan Kumara (39), the versatile young journalist who edited the Resa and Silumina, will be held in his native Mathugama on Wednesday afternoon.
The funeral will take place at Indigodatenna cemetery at 5.00 pm. Cortege leaves residence No:05 Athulathmudaligama, Matugama at 4.00 pm.
Chamara, who shone with his journalistic brilliance in the Lakbima and Rivira newspapers was a revelation to most traditional-minded journalists at Lake House, which he joined a couple of years ago. With his new ideas and positive thinking, Chamara threw archaic conventions out of the window and infused a fresh perspective to news stories and features.
He could enliven even the most jaded story with his unique brand of reportage and writing style. Be it politics, social commentary or the occasional foray to sport, Chamara managed to shed light on relevant issues and enlighten the reader with the complete, no-holds barred picture.
In fact, journalists and translators working for ANCLs English newspapers tasked with translating some of Chamaras copies for the benefit of the English readership were often at a loss for words as they struggled to find the matching English phrases for his literary nuances in the Sinhala language.
In fact, the management discerned that his talent should not be wasted on a couple of articles that appear on the inside pages of a weekend newspaper.
Chamara, they correctly guessed, was capable of doing far more. Being the innovative trailblazer that he is, Chamara was naturally the companys first choice for editing a new pathbreaking newspaper called the Resa launched a few months ago. Many questioned the wisdom of having another new newspaper, but Chamara proved his critics and detractors wrong with the very first issue of Resa, which defied convention and eschewed stereotypes. Chamara knew that the secret of a young newspapers success would be an equally young staff. Being young himself, Chamara identified himself with the ideas and aspirations of his young staff, who came out with excellent copies under his able guidance.
Chamara derived much satisfaction from mentoring his young staff members and always told them that you do not have to grow old to rise to the top in journalism. They are the ones who are most likely to miss Chamaras warm personality and brilliant mentorship. But it was also no secret that many older journalists turned to Chamara to unravel his memory of people, places and events.
With Resa proving to be a new landmark in local journalism, Chamara was destined for a higher callingediting the flagship Sinhala newspaper of ANCL, The Silumina. Most young journalists would be intimidated by the prospect of working for the Silumina, leave alone editing it, but Chamara took this challenge in his stride. Again, he brought his unique style of journalism over to the Silumina, which had stagnated for quite some time for want of fresh ideas.
He edited the Silumina for only a few weeks before his life was tragically cut short, but they proved to be a new beginning for the newspaper. The reading public responded enthusiastically to the new ideas and insights he introduced for the first time to a Sunday Sinhala newspaper. From eye catching pictures (and captions) to attractive headlines, Silumina was a pleasure to behold under his editorship. One can only imagine the heights that would have been climbed by Resa and Silumina had he lived on. Chamara leaves a rich legacy that is hard to beat in the sphere of Sinhala journalism. A young child will miss his father and a young woman her husband, but in the bigger scheme of things, an entire fraternity of journalists will miss a remarkable journalist whose incisive reporting, writing and above all, mentoring will shape and define local journalism for decades to come.

Cheese before bed
Have you ever been chided in the twilight hours of consciousness for opening the cold fridge in a quest for late night dairy delicacies If so, you have heard the unfortunate myth that eating cheese will give you nightmares.\Fear not, scientists have done the research to prove you can safely consume your curds without fear of a bad nights sleep.
Cheese has been blamed for bad dreams at least as far back as the 1800s, with the likes of Ebenezer Scrooge suspecting a crumb of cheese might be the cause of the ghostly apparitions haunting him.
Seeking to clear the foods good name, the British Cheese Board decided to conduct a scientific study testing cheese on 200 people. Each participant ate about an ounce of various cheeses 30 minutes before going to bed. Each morning, they wrote down whether they could remember having any dreams.
The results were promising. According to Nigel White, the secretary of the British Cheese Board, 75 percent of subjects reported they slept well.
Eerily, a trend developed correlating the type of dream a person had with the cheese they ate. People who ate Blue Stilton-blue cheese-reported bizarre dreams, but didnt qualify them as nightmares.
One dream involved a vegetarian crocodile, depressed he couldnt eat children. Another involved soldiers engaged in combat, but instead of guns, they were wielding kittens.
Menu of Cheese Dreams:
Blue cheese: Bizarre dreams.
Red Leicester: Nostalgic dreams.
Cheddar: Dreams about celebrities.
Cheshire: No dreams.
Brie: Relaxation for women,bizarre for men.
Lancashire: New jobs.
Nutritionists point to a number of reasons cheese might actually be good for sleep. We do warn moderation, however. What likely started this cheese myth in the first place was overeating. A stuffed stomach is more likely to cause sleep loss than a small dose of dairy. Ripleys
