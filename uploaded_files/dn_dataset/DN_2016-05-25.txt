Sensible decision to send Kusal Perera to  England early

Sri Lanka Cricket and the selection committee headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya should be commended for taking a sensible decision to include Kusal Perera in the Sri Lanka Test squad currently touring England.
When fast bowler Dhammika Prasad was forced to return home following an injury to his shoulder the normal practice was to replace him with another bowler in the team. But instead, the national selectors have reviewed the balance of the team and the area that needs to be strengthened and gone for a batsman.
In a media release from Sri Lanka Cricket, chief selector Jayasuriya explains, There is no specific need to replace Prasad with another bowler; we have enough bowlers in the squad  Kusal will join the team as soon as possible and acclimatize so he can do some serious work with the bat.
It is in the batting that Sri Lanka faulted badly being dismissed for totals of 91 and 119 that led to their innings and 88 runs defeat inside three days in the first Test concluded at Headingley, Leeds last Saturday.
Perera may not yet be ready for the second Test starting on Friday at Durham, but he certainly is a good bet to play in the final Test of the series at Lords beginning on June 9. By joining the squad Perera will come under the scrutiny of the national teams trainers and physio who can get him into match fitness and in shipshape for the Lords Test.
Also by arriving early he will be able to get acclimatized to the conditions especially against the swinging and seaming ball which are key ingredients for survival in England.
It was only last week we spotlighted the necessity to include Perera in the Test squad for Lords in this column.
The presence of Perera, a wicket-keeper/batsman at number seven in the order will not only strengthen the Lankan batting line up but will also relieve Dinesh Chandimal of wicket-keeping duties and allow him to concentrate on his batting at number four position.
Chandimal is a vital cog in the batting and is one of the few batsmen in the top order who can deliver once he gets his mental frame right on how to deal with the swing and seam of the English attack. The key is to judge which balls to leave and which ones to score runs off. It is often advisable to try and play the ball as late as possible by going onto your back foot so that you may be able to encounter any late movement the ball might make.
The big mistake the Lankan batters made at Headingley was they were more committed to playing off the front foot and eventually did not have enough time to adjust to the late lateral movement which resulted in the ball finding the edge of their bat.
Perera in his rather unorthodox and aggressive way of batting could even upset the England bowling, but one must not expect too much from him. If he delivers its well and good, but if not we should be patient with him.
However Pereras very presence will make the opposition wary of what type of damage he can do to them in his own destructive way if he is allowed a free reign. That much England will know and try to stop him. His inclusion in the Test squad will have England thinking and altering plans at least for the Lords Test.
Past England greats like David Gower, Sir Ian Botham, Michael Atherton and David Lloyd were not too critical about Sri Lankas performance and accepted the fact that an inexperienced team was facing two of the most potent new ball bowlers in ideal English conditions for swing and seam bowling in James Anderson and Stuart Broad.
They also drew reference to the Trent Bridge Test last summer where Australia (with a much experienced team than Sri Lanka) were shot out for a total of just 60 by a rampaging Broad who went onto take eight wickets in the innings.
Getting the ICC ban on Perera lifted is the best thing that has happened to Sri Lanka cricket in the recent past. It has in some way given Sri Lanka a leeway to strengthen their unstable batting which is still struggling to come to terms with the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, two of the greatest accumulators of runs in all three formats of the game.

SC nod for Fonsekas  parliamentary seat

The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) challenging the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to fill the vacancy created by the death of former Minister M. K. A. D. S. Gunawardana, as a Member of Parliament.
While refusing to grant leave to proceed with the petition, the Supreme Court two Judge Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Nalin Perera observed that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petition.
The Supreme Court observed that in accordance with Section 64 of the Parliament Election Act, the secretary of a recognised political party has power to nominate a member of the party to fill the vacancy.
The Court was informed that Field Marshall Fonseka had obtained UNP membership prior to fill this vacancy.
The petitioners the Centre for Policy Alternatives and its Executive Director Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu has cited UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, Democratic Party Leader Sarath Fonseka, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, the Attorney General and two others as respondents.
The petitioners further sought an Interim Order restraining Field Marshal Fonseka from functioning as an MP of the eighth Parliament until the hearing and final determination of the petition.
The CPA maintained that in terms of Article 99A of the Constitution, only a person whose name was included in the district nomination papers or national list submitted by the relevant political party, is entitled to be nominated to fill such a vacancy.
In its petition, the CPA stated that the appointment of a person as a Member of Parliament contrary to the provisions of the Constitution violates several rights guaranteed under the Constitution and in particular the franchise which is part of the sovereignty of the people.
The petitioners further argued that any attempt to interpret legislation in a manner contrary to the provisions of the Constitution would imperil the supremacy of the Constitution, which is the cornerstone of constitutional democracy.
Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General. Senior Counsel Viran Corea appeared for the petitioners. Presidents Counsel Faiz Mustapha appeared for Field Martial Sarath Fonseka.

Govt. needs 146,000 blocks of land for resettling

The government is in need of 146,000 blocks of land in Kegalle, Ratnapura and Kandy districts to resettle the people in landslide prone areas, Land State Minister T.B. Ekanayake said.
Addressing a press conference at the Disaster Management Centre yesterday, the state minister said the government has already commenced identifying suitable alternative lands to resettle these families.
He said each relocated family should be given a land unit of at least 10-20 perches.
Ekanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered to take over the uncultivated lands belonging to plantation companies under the Land Reform Commission (LRC) also for this purpose.
He said a Special Gazette Notification would be issued to take over such uncultivated lands suitable for resettlement.
All these lands will be selected subject to the observations and recommendations of the National Building Research Organisation, Disaster Management Centre and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau. This time we are more particular about the recommendations of these authorities that those lands are safe for people to reside in, Ekanayake said.
The identification of 146,000 land blocks has already commenced with the coordination of the Land Commissioner Generals Department, Survey Department, LRC and relevant district and divisional secretaries. The construction of houses in these lands has been undertaken by the National Housing Development Authority, he said.
The problem is that many people in mountainous areas cultivate cardamom and cloves. They are reluctant to leave that area and move. We have paid attention to this issue as well, Ekanayake said.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, explaining on the current situation in disaster hit areas, said the flood water was gradually receding in many parts and the number of people in temporary camps was decreasing.
As of yesterday, 115,494 people belonging to 25,793 families are in 291 temporary camps. The number of deaths had risen to 92 while another 108 are still missing. Thirty three people had sustained injuries due to natural disaster, he said.
The minister said the cleaning of houses, wells, tube wells, roads and other public places have commenced in areas where flood water had receded.
He said the Presidential Task Force would meet every two weeks to discuss on the future course of action.
The government has disbursed money needed for disaster relief measures and post-disaster activities. We have also got foreign aid and those have been deposited in the account under our ministry or given to the Treasury. The donations of items received from foreign countries would be distributed to the people via Army and Air Force personnel, Yapa said.
Commenting on the on-going operations by the Army in Aranayake, Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe said 27 bodies and parts of another 20 bodies had been recovered in the area. He said the number of soldiers deployed for search operations was reduced to 100 yesterday. There are difficulties in identifying some bodies. As of the information we have collected, we suspect over 100 persons are still buried under the soil. We will continue search operations to find their bodies, but we may have to discuss with the authorities and people to end the search operations in the coming days, Yapa said.
He said the boat operations in Colombo was also stopped by yesterday.
Civil Defence Force Major Vajira Kumaratunga said a team of 800 had been deployed for cleaning activities in disaster hit areas.
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary N Rupasinghe said plans are afoot to construct two new tunnels to carry water to the sea to control the floods in the city.
As of now Colombo goes under water from about 250 mm rainfall. After the construction of these two tunnels it will resist for a rainfall of about 350mm. The constructions will be completed within two years, he said.
Irrigation Minister Vijith Wijayamuni de Zoysa, Environment Ministry Secretary Udaya N Seneviratne, NBRO Director (Landslide) R M S Bandara and Health Ministry Epidemic Control Unit Director Pabha Paihawadena also spoke.

Next govt. should be a SLFP government- Dilan

The next government should be a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)government and everyone should work toward creating a SLFP government, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
To achieve this goal, the SLFP should win the next local government election.. The success of the next local government election will send a message to the public that the SLFP is strong and to create a winning attitude.
The Minister was addressing the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday in Colombo. Even though the persons, who do not know arithmetic say that a SLFP government could be formed based on the last general election result those with a clear mind-set know that the SLFP was not mandated to form a SLFP government. However, the SLFP was tactful not to let the UNP to form a government by creating a coalition government, he said.
Perera further said that the SLFP is launched on a winning path. With passing of the 19th amendment to the Constitution neither Mahinda Rajapaksa nor Chandrika Kumarathunga can contest the next Presidential election. Maithripala Sirisena has also stressed that he would not contest again.
Im ready to contest if I am informed earlier. As ab media friendly person I believe that I am suitable for contesting the next Presidential election he said.
He added that this is the last chance to change the election system and implement a people friendly constitution. This can only be done when having a cordial rapport among political parties and within the SLFP.
This is the last bus to change the election system and implement a people friendly constitution. Once these two targets are achieved,there is no use of being in this government anymore he said.
When questioned what will be the future of this coalition government, The State Minister said that this government may end up in two years once the agreement period is over.
When asked if the SLFP would take disciplinary action against those who participated in the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Kirulapona, he said while the Central Committee of the SLFP was currently analysing various reports regarding the Kirulapona rally, the chances of their being disciplinary action taken against them was not high.

JVP says govts disaster mitigation  allocation slashed for 2016

JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said yesterday that the government had no prior preparedness and plan to face the disaster situation as indicated by the reduction of the disaster mitigation allocation for 2016.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the capital expenditure on disaster prevention and mitigation for 2015 was Rs.2522 million. But, it was reduced to Rs.2135million this years. The allocation for the recurrent expenditure too was very low this year compared to last year. It was Rs.1543 million in 2015 which has been reduced to Rs.799 million in 2016.
Natural disasters occur suddenly. The government could not intervene in the relief and rescue operations in the first few days since it has no extra funds and initial preparedness. We urged the government to put the country on an emergency footing. But, the government did not do so. Therefore, government officers could not intervene to help the flood and landslide affected people at the initial stage due to barriers placed by circulars.
Now the government has designated these areas as High Security Zones.
He said a proper mechanism should be created to ensure that relief funds are distributed correctly to the affected persons.
If the government thinks about the environment, it should stop unauthorized constructions and reclamations. It is obvious politicians are behind most of these illegal constructions and reclamations. The Irrigation Department should have an alternative method to control the water level in the Kelani river and other rivers.
The government should also announce a definite stance on providing lands for the people who lost their homes due to floods and landslides. In paying compensation, the government should not restrict this to legal deed owners but should also consider the unauthorized settlers. A swift programme is needed to get the lives of the affected people back to normal. The JVP red-star relief team made a massive contribution in the rescue and relief operations in the flood and landslide hit areas of the country to the best if its abilities.
Commenting on the Rugby player Wasim Thajudeens death, he said that according to the statement given by the former Western Province DIG Anura Senanayake, the political big wigs behind the Wasim Thajudeens murder can be identified and their names should be revealed.

Cant see why  Sri Lanka have been  sent to the north : Former England quick Agnew questions Lankan tour itinerary

LEEDS: Former England fast bowler and present cricket commentator for BBC Test Match Special Jonathan Agnew has questioned the rationale behind Sri Lanka being asked to play the first two Tests of the English summer up in the north where the cold conditions would make any team from the subcontinent struggle for survival.
It is great for the home side that England won, but the nature of that victory does raise some serious questions about the scheduling and venues of these early season matches, Agnew wrote in his regular column on BBC.
I dont understand why Sri Lanka has been sent to Leeds and Durham for these opening two Tests.
You could say that the cold, grey conditions quite likely in the north of England at this part of the year give the hosts their best chance of winning - but theres much more to it than that, said Agnew.
While you certainly do not want to give the opposition a leg-up, you have to do whats best for Test cricket. That includes providing the best possible spectacle, ensuring the match is a contest and giving value for money to those who have tickets.
Sri Lanka being shot out for 91 and 119 before the close on day three does none of those things and is no help to people who wanted to see cricket on days four and five or those who want to maximise income from these international matches, Agnew continued.
There are questions hanging over these May Test matches, not least because their continued existence prevents England players from going to the Indian Premier League.
Throwing more light to why Lords was staging the third Test and not the customary second Test, Agnew said, This year, Lords was not available for the first two Tests (it will stage the third) because of work being done to the Warner Stand, while the other ground in London, The Oval, usually stages the final match of the summer.
Could Surrey and The Oval volunteer to do something that is best for the game and take on one of the early summer matches I doubt that will happen.
Next year, the Tests wont be held at this time because of the Champions Trophy but, after that, should we look at where these matches are played
Yorkshires chief executive Mark Arthur was also critical of the ECB staging Test matches at Headingley in May.
Arthur has said it would be sensible for Headingley to host Tests in July.
Headingley should be playing their Test match cricket in July,
Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds.The current regime at the ECB has inherited this situation and they agree with us that it is nonsense to have any Test matches in the north in May.
On Monday we questioned the manner in which the Sri Lankan tour itinerary had been drawn up and why Sri Lanka Cricket had not even made an attempt to change it. We also criticized the amateurish way in which the administrators had handled the fixtures allowing eight free days between Tests for a team that is struggling to come to terms with English conditions.
The second Test against England ends on May 31 and Sri Lanka have to wait till June 9 for the start of the third Test at Lords with no fixtures arranged in between.

Another Lankan  fast bowler  returns home  injured

Sri Lanka suffered another injury blow to one of their fast bowlers when 24-year-old Dushmantha Chameera was ruled out of the tour of England with a back injury.
A media release from Sri Lanka Cricket states that Chameera sustained an injury to his lower back and will be returning to Colombo for further treatment.
Chameera underwent an MRI/CT scan this morning, which has indicated a stress fracture to his lower back, and medical recommendation is treatment and rest for as long as four months, the release states.
Chameera, the quickest of the Sri Lankan bowlers currently on tour of England took three wickets for 64 including the wicket of Jonny Bairstow who top scored with 140 in the first Test at Leeds which Sri Lanka lost by an innings and 88 runs.
Chameera is the second casualty the Lankan team has suffered on the tour. Last week the spearhead of the fast bowling attack Dhammika Prasad was forced to return home after injuring his shoulder. Prasad at present is undergoing treatment.
Prasad was replaced by batsman/wicket-keeper Kusal Perera.
A replacement for Chameera will be named shortly.

SLC reacts to unprofessional administration

Sri Lanka Cricket has reacted to the article carried in the sports page of the Daily News of May 23 and we publish below their right of reply.
RIGHT OF REPLY:
Article titled UNPROFESSIONAL administration leaves our cricketers in the cold.
Sri Lanka Cricket is disappointed to note the deliberately misleading and malicious article of above caption published in the Daily News of 23d May 20!6, written by Sports Editor Saadi Thawfeeq.
The Headline in itself is malicious and defamatory, and seeks to undermine the credibility and hard work of the elected administration of Sri Lanka Cricket, that has held office for a mere 4 months.
Please note the following facts that are pertinent to the vein and tone of your article.
+Sri Lanka Cricket, as with all other member boards, is bound by the FTP or Future Tours Programme of the lnternational Cricket Council, which scheduled this particular tour for May 2016. The FTP is fixed and finalized up to the year 2020 as at the current time.
+Sri Lanka cricket, as with all other member boards, is bound by the Mous that specify that all tour itineraries be finalized a minimum of 9 months prior to the tour.
+The itinerary for the current tour of England was finalized in June 2015, by the then lnterim Committee headed by Sidath Wettimuny.
+The lnterim Committee had also approved the A Team and Under 19 tours of England to be held subsequent to the National team tour, contrary to the usual practice of being held prior to National team tours.
+Alternate proposals - bearing in mind the weather during the current months, and the suitability of the venues, should have been made by the then administration prior to finalizing the tour itinerary.
The current elected body has no possibility of making any changes or change requests, as the itinerary was finalized in June 2015 - a full 6 months prior to their taking office.
+Notwithstanding the above, the current elected Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket, made arrangements for an official to travel to the venues in England in order to ascertain suitability of facilities, security and logistical matters (as is a practice with all other touring countries as well.)
+The official travelling for the above purpose, was however not in a position to request any changes to the itinerary, due to the above facts, and due to the fact that the ECB had already finalized logistics, and tickets were on sale.
We reiterate the view of Sri Lanka cricket that based on the above, your article is misleading, and maliciously so, as you being a veteran cricket journalist are well aware of the above facts, and have chosen to deliberately disregard their verity in order to sensationalize your news piece.
Group Sports Editors note:
This article was not written with any malice towards Sri Lanka Cricket or its present administration. It was written to spotlight the shortcomings of the administration responsible for agreeing on an itinerary of this nature and failing to give what is best for our national team. The CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket has confessed in his letter that the itinerary was agreed by the then interim committee as far back as June 2015. It is therefore no indictment on the current elected administration.
However it is sad to note that the Sri Lanka team was exposed during the early spring under such weather conditions and pitches which are not conducive to us,
Apart from playing the first two Tests in the coldest region in England the itinerary also glaring exposes the fact that our cricketers dont have any cricket for eight days between the second and third Test matches (June 1-8) where with a more common sense approach another match could have been fitted into the itinerary.
To quote the CAO: The itinerary for the current tour of England was finalized in June 2015, by the then lnterim Committee headed by Sidath Wettimuny.
Alternate proposals - bearing in mind the weather during the current months, and the suitability of the venues, should have been made by the then administration prior to finalizing the tour itinerary.
I cant see any reason why the present administration should react in the manner they have when the responsibility does not lie with them since the itinerary has been agreed by the previous administration.
