The Presidential riddle
Election time is always a period when existing political alliances are put to the test and new partnerships are fashioned. That is exactly what is happening, even with presidential and general elections being more than a year away.
The government of national unity headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe leading the United National Party (UNP) has been an uneasy alliance, barring the initial few months when everything was hunky-dory in the first flush of President Sirisenas election victory.
However, since then, the relationship between the two parties have been strained with the motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe being its lowest point. After the motion was defeated in Parliament with UNPers rallying around their leader, the UNP insisted that those ministers who held office in the government and voted for the motion should leave it.
President Sirisena relented to that request and the net result is that now, there are four main political groupings in Parliament: the UNP, the mainstream SLFP loyal to President Sirisena, the Joint Opposition (JO) aligned with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and a so-called Group of Sixteen who left the government after the motion of no-confidence but remain as a distinct entity, without formally joining the JO.
Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions
Thus, the SLFP has now fractured into three groups and last week saw the possibility of the Group of Sixteen splintering further, with four persons in the group indicating that they still retained their loyalty to President Sirisena, while the other dozen parliamentarians in this group preferred to stand with Rajapaksa and the JO.
These four- former ministers S. B. Dissanayake, Dayasiri Jayasekera and Dilan Perera and former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala- are pursuing their own agenda which is to seek a rapprochement between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions of the party, even though the latter are now busy strengthening their own political party in the form of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
Speaking to the mainstream media, Dissanayake, a former General Secretary of the SLFP during the Presidency of Chandrika Kumaratunga who also spent some time in the UNP, has outlined his vision. He envisages a scenario where President Sirisena will contest the next presidential election as the nominee of a unified SLFP, with Rajapaksa as his virtual running mate as the prime minister in a potential SLFP-led government.
We would never condone any political deal with the UNP in the future. We firmly believe that we would be in a position to set up administrations in all provincial councils, elect our own President and form a government on the results of the three forthcoming polls. Anyhow, if we need the help of any other political party, we would turn to minority parties but never to the UNP, Dissanayake was quoted as saying.
UNP-SLFP alliance
The thrust of Dissanayakes argument is that the mainstream SLFP finds itself in a political predicament now because it aligned itself with the UNP. Dissanayake, of course, chooses to ignore the fact that the UNP-SLFP alliance was a necessity at the time and that he himself was a member of that unity government until recently.
The more pertinent question is how Dissanayake can sell his proposal to the Rajapaksa camp and the SLPP. Buoyed by its success at the local government elections where it swept the board and relegated the mainstream SLFP to a distant third place, the SLPP is busy planning its own presidential election campaign and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is being projected as the front-runner to be its candidate.
The other issue is whether Dissanayake- and the likes of Jayasekara, Perera and Sumathipala- have enough political clout to convince the SLPP to enter into a political partnership with President Sirisena who ousted Rajapaksa from office in January 2015.
It is also highly unlikely that the SLPP will want to play second fiddle to President Sirisena in a future government because he still wields significant executive powers under the Constitution and has demonstrated during his current term of office that he isnt shy to use them.
The different aspirations of the SLPP and the SLFP also came into sharp focus last week when the SLPP continued their agitation for provincial council elections. Polls are already due for councils in the North Central Province, the Eastern Province and the Sabaragamuwa Province.
However, they have not been held because there is no agreement on whether they should be conducted on a hybrid of the first past the post and proportional representation (PR) systems or on the PR system alone.
Elections for the remaining six provincial councils will also be due in the coming months- and if elections are not held, the government stands to be accused of postponing polls because they are running scared.
At a recent party leaders meeting, the UNP, as well as the JO, agreed on polls to be held for six provinces in January next year. The UNPs thinking is that, because provincial councils have to be held anyway before the presidential and general elections, the party would be better off conducting them early. That would provide them with an ideal opportunity to assess the mood of the electorate. In the event of a less than optimal performance, it would also give the party to rethink strategies and regroup.
However, the mainstream SLFP is yet to endorse the proposal to conduct elections in January. It is true that the new delimitation of electoral districts has not yet been completed and is, therefore, a stumbling block to conducting elections immediately.
Executive Presidency
However, critics point out that if all parties agree, it is a simple exercise to bring about an amendment to the legislation passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament that would enable polls to be conducted under the previous PR system, if necessary for this election alone. That the SLFP is unwilling to do so is an indication that it is fighting shy of facing a contest, these critics argue.
It is also interesting that President Sirisena is yet to declare himself as a candidate for the next presidential election. It will be recalled that he had publicly pledged several times that he would not run for President again and had in fact promised to abolish the Executive Presidency. However, the President has embarked on a series of high profile development projects, launching them first in his home turf of Polonnaruwa, thereby almost confirming speculation that he will indeed run again for President in 2020.
There has even been conjecture that he could call an election earlier than January 2020 by which date a presidential poll must be held. The Constitution does allow him to call for a premature poll and indeed the surprise factor could work to his advantage because other parties including the UNP and the SLPP are yet to formally announce their nominees for the contest.
Considering that the potential nominee from the SLPP, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, also has to renounce his United States citizenship- which is a process that may take a period of time to complete- a snap election that catches the Presidents rivals off guard cannot be ruled out.
For its part, the UNP has been content to go about its business of running the government and has launched its own programmes with an eye on the polls, most notably the Gamperaliya projects. However, the series of crippling strikes that have swept the country in recent months have not been to its advantage and the party hierarchy is aware that it still has a long way to go to re-establish voter confidence. It can, however, be thankful that it is not beset with the kind of infighting and factionalism seen in the SLFP and the SLPP.
The coming months will see a sharper demarcation of political battle lines with the glorious uncertainties of political alliances coming into play, perhaps as never before in the countrys recent history.

SC vacates Interim Order restraining Adhikaram
The Supreme Court last Friday (10) vacated an interim order issued by the Colombo Civil Appellate High Court restraining the Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya from appointing the former Kapurala (caretaker) Pathmasiri Adhikaram as the caretaker of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya.
The three-Judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Justice Nalin Perera made this order pursuant to an application made on behalf of the former Kapurala Pathmasiri Adhikaram.
The Supreme Court had earlier ordered the secretary of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya that necessary arrangements be made for Pathmasiri Adhikaram to function as a caretaker for one month each year in the Devalaya.
However, the respondent parties were reluctant to implement the order and a contempt of court case had been filed against the Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya for allegedly not complying with a Supreme Court order.
In this backdrop, four caretakers of Kataragama Maha Devalaya had filed a lawsuit in the Colombo District Court preventing former caretaker Pathmasiri Adhikaram being appointed as the caretaker of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya.
However, the Colombo District Court had dismissed this lawsuit. Subsequently, four caretakers obtained an Interim Order against Adhikaram from the Colombo Civil Appellate High Court.
However, prior to this petition was filed before Supreme Court, on April 4, 2004 the SC had declared that Pathmasiri Adhikaram of Boralesgamuwa had a right to function as a caretaker for one month each year in the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya. Adhikaram had a hereditary right to the post of kapurala in the above mentioned devalaya.
Adhikaram stated that his family has been claiming for the post of caretaker of the devalaya since 161 BC. He stated that king Dutugemunu before he launched his fight against King Elara made a vow to the Kataragama deity and having won the war, he built this devalaya and appointed his great grandfather as its caretaker to perform rituals. He claimed that his family held the post for over 2,300 years.

Skillfully designed!
C Plus Design is an in-house powerhouse providing consultancy addressing all aspects of architectural design including planning, space programing, interior designing and project management, and are catered to by a team of architects, interior designers, civil engineers, MEP Consultants, quantity surveyors and project managers. Daily News speaks to Chinthaka Dayaratne the innovative leader in charge of C Plus Design on its commitment to design excellence.
At C Plus we undertake the consultancy part of the architectural design. A customer will come with an idea and we will develop it. We have the entire resources available with us to fulfill their consultancy requirements. We have the professional body in-house to fulfill the clients requirements. C Plus is seven to eight years old and we have a staff that is very committed and dedicated, said Dayaratne.
The goal of C Plus is doing elegant and simple designs. They feel that there has to be a simplicity and elegance to the design. That is their aim and philosophy.
We basically design for the budget. This ensures that throughout the project there will be no hassle to anyone. We are with the client throughout the project. We have all the professionals in-house with us. In the field of consultancy you need to be creative. You need to be skillful to consult on the proper design. Soft skills are key to this field. You need to understand the clients requirements. You need to be able to have architectural insight and find correct solutions. Being able to master time management and project managing is crucial to this area of architecture since time is of the paramount importance, pointed out Dayaratne.
Dayaratne also said that in Consultancy you need to understand the behavior and lifestyle of the client and interpret it into the layout. A house and a home is different. A house is a structure. But to make it a home you have to add value to it.
With limited time in Colombo you need to understand the internal dynamics of families. You need to understand the familys weaknesses and strengths. How they also relate to each other is an important factor. You need to understand how people gather in spaces and how those spaces can be converted. You need to understand their habits and understand how they communicate with each other. But if you ask me what I always go for is spaces that are elegant and simple. So it is a challenge bringing all of this together, striking that perfect balance explained Dayaratne.
Dayaratne was born to consult. From childhood he has always been creative and passionate.
Being an architect is not an easy journey. You need patience, guts and skills. Patience is important because we are essentially dealing with human beings and you need to get onto the same page. You need to be able to finish the job while doing all the hard work. It takes a long time to succeed. Consultancy is an inborn talent combined with hard work. It can be developed through time working on the project, stated Dayaratne.
Dayaratne pointed out that those in rural areas have no or little idea of architecture. He states that there are plenty of people in the field who in reality should not be in architecture. The architect has been trained and is qualified to do the job. But there are those in Vastu and Feng Shui. Basically is it not quite professional, he adds.
What C Plus wants to do is to bring an element of professionalism into the field. However another problem we encounter is doing the project management in the country. This is where we normally get stuck. The professional labor is not available in the country. In the past there were carpenters, masons, laborers and painters who were thoroughly professional about their subject. But now they have diverted to other fields. So most of the people who can do the execution part are not in the country.
Our policy is that we will be there through the project from inception to the end. We do not leave the client in the lurch. After the design consultancy, the execution is done by a contractor. The contractor needs enough people to carry out the work. So because of lack of man power when it comes to project management we all get stuck, explained Dayaratne.
With the younger generation coming into architecture the profession must be filled with properly qualified people.
Trust is important to me in our field. This is because word of mouth is essential in our profession. You need to build up a good reputation. We must be firm that people who are not qualified should not be practicing in our field. I said before and must reiterate, most people do not realize the value and potential of architecture. We need to let the professionals handle the job. Architecture is a very logical subject and the architect is trained to think logically and analytically.
There are opportunities and scope in this field. It has potential depending from within  your mindset and how you want to move forward. No matter where you are in this world, the field of consultancy has potential, said Dayaratne.

Softlogic revenue grows to Rs 16 bn in 1Q
Softlogic Group revenue grew 5.1% to Rs. 16. billion during 1Q FY19 said its Chairman, Ashok Pathirage.
The Retail sector witnessed an ownership restructure in March 2018. This resulted in the creation of a sector holding company, Softlogic Retail Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.
Softlogic Group reclassified its operating sectors under three prime business verticals -- Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services; while Leisure and Automobiles were classified as non-core. The IT companies will be transferred to the Retail sector in due course.
The core verticals emerged to be the top contributors of Group top line with Retail contributing 51%, Healthcare Services making up 20% and Financial Services with 19%. Contribution from our non-core businesses in Automobile and Leisure & Property were 2% and 3% respectively during the quarter.
Gross Profit improved 4.7% to Rs. 5.8 Bn. Better bargaining power led by Group synergies paved the way for margin improvement from 35.9% in 1QFY18 to 36.3% in 1QFY19.
Operating profit increased marginally by 1.7% to Rs. 1.9 Bn during the quarter. Nonetheless, operating profit margins remained unchanged at 12% in the three months under review.
Operational expenses increased 3.5% to Rs. 4.1 Bn. Distribution and Administration expenses increased 3.0% and 3.6% to Rs. 688.0 Mn and Rs. 3.4 Bn respectively in 1QFY19.
EBITDA for the quarter improved marginally by 1.5% to Rs. 2.6 Bn during the quarter.
Group net debt has reduced from Rs. 57.2 Bn in March-end 2018 to Rs. 54.3 Bn in June-end 2018. This reduction was due to the rights issue of Rs. 3.9 Bn that was utilized again to settle debt in April 2018.

Sri Lankan surfers to make impact on their median National tour to India
The newly formed Surfing Federation of Sri Lanka (SFSL) is to take part in the upcoming Covelong Point Surfing Championships in Chennai, India from today to August 19.
This is the first time a Sri Lankan national team is being fielded in an overseas championship after all local surfers were brought under one umbrella via the federation. Sri Lankas first ever national surf competitions were held in Hikkaduwa and Kabalana in early-2018, and served instrumental in building up a national ranking table. Out of 76 contenders, the five highest ranking surfers in each of the competitions will be flying to India for the big challenge.
Covelong Point Surfing Championships have been held annually since 2013, and has seen participation of surfers from across the globe, including Australia, USA, France, Maldives and India. The Sri Lankan team is comprised Praneeth Sandaruwan (Captain), Milan Andra Hennadige (Vice Captain), A.H Siril, Anandarasa Anusanth, Lesitha Prabath (All from Arugambay Surf Club), Nadeen Sampath, (Mambos Surf Club Hikkaduwa), Pradeep Kumara (Reef End Surf Club Hikkaduwa), Lakshitha Madushan (Weligama Surf Club) and P.G Sandika Thushara - serving as the teams manager.
Additionally, Lahiru Wijesekara and Kelum Nanayakkara - who sat on the judging panel of the Hikkaduwa and Kabalana competitions, will join the surf team on invitation from the organisers to serve as officials. The SFSL was formed with assistance from Tim Jones - International Surf Association (ISA) Advisor to the SFSL. Jones also played a major role in establishing the National Olympic Committee in Sri Lanka. The introduction of surfing as an official Olympic event in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the chance of competing in it, served as a driving force to set up the SFSL and a national surf team.
One day Sri Lanka will get a chance to send a surfer to the Olympics. Until that dream comes true, Sri Lankan surfers need to be well-committed to training and development, and enhancing their skills and techniques. In time, we will beat the top surfing nations, says SFSL President, Hiran Ukwatte.
Ukwatte added that Sri Lankas next targets before the 2024 Olympics, is to compete in the ISA world championships and the World Surf League (WSL) qualifying series.

Travel Lanka - Silver Jubilee  in service to Tourism
The Tourism Industry in Sri Lanka keeps expanding, and is now the major contributor of foreign exchange to the national economy. It is a widening source of employment and an important field in the development strategies of the country. Tourism is now a key aspect of economic growth in the South Asian region, bringing new a competitive demand to the Sri Lankan Tourism Industry.
This success of Tourism is very largely due to the role of publicity, an integral need for the growth of Tourism. A country known to the world for centuries through trade with the East and West, and as a centre of Buddhist cultural and civilization tradition, went through nearly 500 years of western colonialism, too. Sri Lanka achieved independence 70 years ago in 1948, and moved into modern Tourism with the passage of the Ceylon Tourist Board Act in 1966. In the 52 years since then, different sectors of the Tourism Industry have achieved remarkable success  with Travel Trade, Hotel Industry, Sports and Recreation, and Tourism Facilitation, making remarkable progress. Travel Lanka has moved steadily with this progress, shared the burdens of difficult years, and contributing to the success that has followed.
Travel Lanka offers the best way to decide on a holiday destination and planning ones holiday. What began as a regular book now has digital access on the Internet too, with best opportunities for holiday planning. Print and digital facilities, give visitors the necessary Information from the time a holiday in Sri Lanka is planned, to when it is enjoyed in this beautiful Indian Ocean Island.
Information and Publicity, a key aspect of the industry, has played an essential role in its growth through the past six decades. Today, Travel Lanka, celebrating its 25th Anniversary, stands out as the outstanding publication that supported the Tourism Industry, through its periods of success and difficulty, and remains the tourism publication with the widest regular reach, and Internet access too, giving continued service to a steadily expanding industry. It is clearly the monthly Information Digest on Sri Lanka, for the Tourist and the Tourism Industry.
The growth of Tourism saw the arrival of more than 2 million visitors in 2017, and by end July this year arrivals had exceeded 1,200,000. Travel Lanka has served for almost half the 52 years of the formal Tourism Industry in Sri Lanka. It provides the most up-to-date information to visitors, updated monthly, on all visitor attractions such as such as accommodation  from hotels, guesthouses, home stay, Eco-tourism and Nature Resorts; to restaurants, shopping, entertainment, sports and recreation facilities. It serves the needs and answers queries of visitors from countries far and wide.
Its 25-year record has seen Travel Lanka move with the ups and downs of Tourism in the country. The most remarkable in this record is its uninterrupted publication during the worst years for the Industry, at the height of the war of terrorism and separation, for nearly two decades. Yet the publisher of Travel Lanka continued to provide the Tourism Promotion Bureau and hotels with the publication at no cost, managing its publication with much depleted advertising support, and commitment to the Industry. This service to the industry through shared hardship, when many in tourism sought other investments, marks its dedication to the sustenance and growth of Tourism, and assistance to the Tourist.
Travel Lanka continues with this commitment in its range of information to the visitor. The material in each monthly issue is topical with informative articles, good photographs and illustrations of interest to the reader, elegant and pleasing advertising, with the best and most up-to-date information to visitors backed by maps and guides to tourist locations, whether in the ancient cities, the beaches, centres of the colonial era, and wildlife, too. Moving to digital communication Travel Lanka now has its website - travellanka.lk, enabling those planning visits to Sri Lanka to obtain information well in advance, with advice, tips and information, updated every month. The monthly access to travellanka.lk exceeds 35,000 searches, and rising.
Travel Lanka brings out its publisher Piyaratne Hewabattages love for tourism, from when he was the first Creative Production Officer of the Ceylon Tourist Board in the 1960s, when he designed most of the early publications on modern tourism in Sri Lanka. He began service under the first Editor, the celebrate Neville Weeraratne, winning many prizes from PATA and other international tourism development organizations. The design and production of Travel Lanka show the continuing skill of this international prizewinner in creative art, print design and publication.
The publication moves on with the growth of the Tourism Industry to present all its new aspects, is emerging as the fastest growing Tourism market in South Asia, and as a very competitive Tourism location in Asia. The new geo-political changes in the region, and importance of Tourism as a key aspect of Regional Growth, brings new challenges to a publication able to meet the new demands, with creativity and content.
As it marks this 25th Anniversary, Travel Lanka stands out as the most comprehensive and up-to-date information publication- both print and digital - on and for Tourism in Sri Lanka, enriching its record of contribution to the growth of the Tourism Industry; taking over the new challenges of a vastly expanding and increasingly diverse and colourful industry.

Books not only stimulate the intellect, but also widen the horizons of individual thinking. With flashy gadgets, gizmos and games in the wish list of the generation today, reading is easily relegated to backburner.
The reading habit seems to be on a decline among the modern youth. Their jam-packed lifestyles often do not afford them enough time to sit back with a good book. It has also become an archaic idea for most people as technology takes steady control over individual lives.
Story telling helps children present their thoughts boldly. It cultivates ability to share their thoughts with others in an interesting way. Sometimes, childrens reading habits rub off on adults too. Through children, the parents will also start taking interest in reading and that leads to better communication.
These themes and more have been presented in Poth Gullee (Bookworm) a play by renowned dramatist Nalaka Swarnathilake. Presented by Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy Poth Gullee is the only mobile stage play in the country which is dominated by child actors as there are only a handful of adult actors on stage. The first show had been in staged in August 2017. They had done around 14 shows across the island in areas like Colombo, Matara, and Kalutara. Dihini Sandanima Kankanamge takes on the lead role as Matilda - a book-loving, witty young lass who is filled with wondrous knowledge. Based on British writer Roald Dahls Matilda the story revolves on how Matildas family misunderstands her reading habit and sends her off to a school which is ruled by a distasteful and tyrannous elderly lady. However her class teacher, Miss Honey develops a soft spot for her student especially when she discovers that she is equipped with vast knowledge and possesses telekinetic powers. Thus a series of engaging and comic scenes unfold, most of which are shouldered by Dihini.
The 15-year-old school girl of Sujatha Vidyalaya, Matara, had been studying in Visakha College, Colombo when she had joined the academy. She had been motivated by her mother, Thanuja Dilrukshi Wimalagunasekara, to join Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy to discover her hidden potentials in art.
I was not a very outspoken girl before that. A few months into the academy made me realize my hidden skills. My mother had been into arts when she was schooling. She believed that I too inherited her potentials, she said.
Dihini had taken part in a number of school plays staged by Sujatha Vidyalaya after that. She had watched Swarnathilakes Dangamalla while she was at Visakha College and had gotten to know about the academy through the leaflets distributed after the show.
Speaking about landing the lead role in Poth Gulee Dihini said that she never thought that she would be chosen for the character.
Sir picked three of us for the final audition. Though I thought that I did well in it I never dreamt that I would get the role, she added with a smile.
Unraveling her thoughts about Matilda Dihini says that she finds Matilda to be an exceptional character.
She is not like an ordinary child because she possesses special powers through reading. She is a matured character compared with the rest of the characters in the play. Therefore it was a challenge acting her role in a manner which sets her apart from the others, she explained.
Like Matilda, Dihini too is into books. She had read Dhals book when she was in her teens.
Books came into my life during my tender years. However I am not a hard core bookworm like Matilda though I too would have stood up against injustice the way she did, she said with a smile.
Though she had moved to Matara with her family last year because of her fathers professional duties Dihini says that her passion for arts makes her travel all the way from her new hometown to Colombo to take part in the academys weekly sessions. She stepped into Matildas role again this year in the show staged at Bishops College recently.
Speaking about her favourite scene in the play Dihini says that she finds the episode when a boy named Bruce had to scoff a whole chocolate cake hilarious.
Apart from being funny almost all the children who make up the cast in the play are on stage in this scene. It is nice to interact with them all rather than recite a monologue by oneself, she said. Apart from Matildas character she also likes another supporting role called Amanda. She says that she finds the scene in which Amanda is pulled up for wearing a different hairdo entertaining.
Queried on her dream role in a stage play and Dihini says that she has always been enchanted by the princesses found in Disney fairytales.
Most childrens plays comprise characters of talking animals and trees. However I like to be a part of more realistic tales which embody out of the box themes. To take on the role of a Disney princess would be a dream come true, she giggled.
Dihini hails from a family of three children. She is the eldest in the family. Her father, Saman Dhammika Kankanamge, is a medical officer at Matara Hospital. She has two younger brothers who are still schooling.
Dihinis ambition is to become a fashion designer. She is also gifted with the ability to draw and paint which is required of the profession.
I love the Anime and Manga drawing style. I incorporate that into my drawings, she said.
Dihini is into singing too and had won the Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy Award for Best Vocalist.
Speaking about choosing Dihini for Matildas role Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy Director Nalaka Swarnathilake said that Dihini had been quite a mousy character when she joined them four years ago.
She hardly spoke a word then and used to answer a question using as few words as possible. It is difficult to imagine that she had come all this way to bag the protagonist of the play. I was scripting the drama when she joined and my image of Matilda tallied with her appearance. However I had second thoughts about casting her for the role then.
However she has proven her mettle for acting since then and had done the role wonderfully. I saw her give her best performance in the last show staged at Bishops College recently, he said adding that only a child who is into books can do justice to the role.
My previous creations Dangamalla and Anne too have been based on childrens novels. Mama Venama Malaka is my own story. These are not only stories which will keep the viewers engaged but they also send across messages to the society. Matildas exist in the society today but are oppressed due to various ideas embodied by the elders. They believe that children should stick to reading books connected with their studies. They should be encouraged to read books outside those connected with their school syllabus to excel in life, Swarnathilake opined.
He notes that he realized that Dihini not only had the ability to act and memorize lines but also expreses her emotions in crucial scenes well.
Poth Gullee will be holding its next performance in Matara on September 24. A Kandy show on October 28 is also on the cards. Swarnathilake also hopes to reproduce Dangamalla and Mama Venama Malak.
Dihinis message to youth is to explore their potentials and discover their skills.
She says, It will take time for you to note what you can excel in but it will be worth the effort as it will benefit you on the long run. Follow your heart and give it all that youve got.

## Title: Ven. Gnanasara and the rule of law
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Thursday, August 16, 2018 - 01:00
Ven. Gnanasara and the rule of law
A determined bid is been made by certain groups of the Bikkhu community to challenge the verdict handed down to Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera by the Supreme Court which found the Ven. Thera guilty for contempt of court and sentenced the latter to six years RI, and secure his release. These monks contend that the Ven. Gnanasara Theras case was not properly presented and the verdict was delivered on that basis by the Supreme Court. In the forefront to secure the Theras release is the Kotte Maha Sangha Sabha to which the Ven. Gnanasara Thera belongs. Speaking to the media, Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagi Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha Nayake the Ven Dr. Iththepane Dhammalankara Thera said they have a special responsibility on Ven. Gnanasara Thera because the Thera belonged to the Kotte Maha Sangha Sabha.We have now faced a legal problem. All the Maha Sangha and other Nikayas are awaiting the decision of the Kotte Maha Sangha Sabha with regard to Ven. Gnanasara Theras case the Kotte Sangha Sabha Maha Nayake was quoted as saying by an English daily. The Mahanayake Thera further goes on to state that: The Ven. Gnanasara Thera was not acting for his own benefit but for the betterment of the country, Maha Sangha and the Buddha Sasana. Therefore, we wish that the Ven. Gnanasara Thera would be able to fulfill his aims and we will take the necessary action as soon as possible.
It is difficult to fathom how the Kotte Maha Sangha Sabha Mahanayake Thera arrived at the conclusion that misbehaving in a court house and speaking abusively to a female within its precincts was tantamount to advancing the cause of the Buddha Sasana or how it will benefit the country. Far from standing up on behalf of the Sangha the Ven. Gnanasara Theras conduct only served to besmirch the good name of the Bikkhu community in the country. Nor is it clear what aims the Ven. Gnanasara Thera intends to fulfill. If this includes fanning the flames of communal strife in the country and inciting the Buddhists to violence against minority religions, the Ven. Gnanasara Thera will be best behind bars, lest this further aggravate tensions in the country.
Those with independent minds who viewed the antics of the Ven. Gnanasara Thera on television, which was virtually on daily display, no doubt, would have drawn their own conclusions if indeed the Ven. Thera disported himself in a manner that typified the image of members of the Sangha in the eyes of the Buddhist public, that of serenity, composure and benign deportment.
Besides, the Supreme Court verdict was based on the laws of the land and members of the Sangha cannot claim immunity from the law. According to media reports there are some 20 Bikkhus serving time in the prisons for lesser offenses and no voice had so far been raised on their behalf. There was no clamour among members of the Sangha for the release or a state pardon for Ven. Thalduwe Somarama and Ven. Mapalagama Buddharakkitha, the main actors in the Bandaranaike assassination. This is as it should be.
Does the Kotte Sangha Sabha consider the Ven. Gnanasara Thera a special specimen, or, is politics playing a hand in the whole affair
The Maha Sangha cannot and should not interfere in the verdict of the Supreme Court which, no doubt, has issued its judgement taking all factors into consideration, including the fact that the accused is a member of the Buddhist clergy. Besides, the Ven. Gnanasara Thera had shown no remorse on his conduct at the Homagama Magistrates Court, but continued to justify it in TV interviews. A Supreme Court judgement cannot be reversed and only a Presidential pardon can get the Thera released. Here too caution is in order, lest a bad precedent is created that will encourage the likes of Ven. Gnanasara Thera to take the law into their hands.
Militancy among the Bikkhu community is not something new in this country. But Ven. Gnanasara Thera, it will be agreed even by the staunchest Buddhist, had overstepped the bounds. Breaking into government offices and threatening officials, leading a pack giving chase to a fellow monk, the intemperate language liberally used to attack other religions and minorities is not exactly the persona of a member of the Maha Sangha. It is therefore prudent that those clamouring for Ven. Gnanasara Theras release to act with circumspection, lest they too be tarred with the same brush as those bringing disrespect to the Buddhist religion.
Bring them to book
The attackers on Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Yohan Koralage should be arrested forthwith and dealt with firmly by the law enforcement. It was reported that the assault was carried out by a group of students of the Peradeniya University Arts Faculty on August 3 and the doctor is receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. The Anuradhapura Branch of the GMOA has threatened to go on strike if no action is taken to bring the culprits to book. On this occasion GMOA is fully justified in its action, though not at other times.

Wrth Group makes donation  to UNICEF
Within the framework of a worldwide ride-along campaign, Wrth customers were given the opportunity to purchase a limited-edition magazine screwdriver. For every screwdriver sold, the Wrth Group donated one euro to UNICEF.
For more than 30 years, R.W. WORKOUT Week has been a firm part of the cooperation between in-house staff and sales force of the Wrth Group companies. During this ride-along campaign, in-house employees accompany sales representatives on their daily customer visits. This does not only help their cooperation but also gives sales force and customers the chance to suggest improvements and ideas to in-house staff in personal conversations.
This year, a donation campaign and a limited-edition product were integrated in R.W. WORKOUT Week. Wrth customers could purchase a magazine screwdriver with signature of Professor Reinhold Wrth and matching belt pouch. For each screwdriver of this limited edition sold, one euro is donated to UNICEF.
In this way, 120,000 Euros were collected in worldwide sales activities. Wrth Lanka too participated in this campaign following tradition, and contributed 1 euro for every magazine screw driver sold in Sri Lanka. Wurth Lanka wishes to thank its customers to have made this possible.
Bettina Wrth, Chairwomen of the Advisory Board of the Wrth Group, handed over the symbolic check to UNICEF on Tuesday. It is part of our corporate culture to get involved and make a social contribution. Therefore, I am particularly delighted that this donation can be made thanks to the commitment of different companies of the Wrth Group. This proves once more that our corporate culture is lived in all companies, explains Bettina Wrth.
The donation will benefit a social project in the Philippines supported by UNICEF. The Molave Youth Home in Quezon City looks after children and adolescents who come into conflict with the law and helps them reintegrate into society and try a new beginning.
The Wrth Group is the worlds market leader in its core business, the trade in assembly and fastening materials. It currently consists of more than 400 companies in over 80 countries with more than 75,000 employees on its payroll. Approximately 32,000 of those employees are salaried sales representatives. In the Groups core business, the Wrth Line, the sales program for the trades and industry comprises more than 125,000 products: from screws, screw accessories and anchors to tools, technical chemicals and personal protective equipment.
The Allied Companies of the Wrth Group, which either operate in business areas related to its core business or in diversified business areas, round off the range by offering products for DIY stores, material for electrical installations, electronic components such as circuit boards, and financial services. They account for more than 40 percent of the Wrth Groups sales volume.

Watching  whales from  air
Famed author and foreign correspondent, Janine di Giovanni recently visited Sri Lanka on vacation. As a visit to Sapphire Island would not be complete without witnessing one of the most splendid sights it has to offer Janine and her companions opted to try whale watching by air with F-airways. This is her description of the experience
Luca was very excited about our next proposed safari. Apparently a major feature of many a bucket list is the sight of our planets largest land mammal and largest sea mammal within a few days of each other. Having met elephants in Yala, we were now going to attempt to see blue whales off the coast of Koggola, just north of Cape Welligama.
As much as 30 meters in length and weighing in at up to 150 tonnes, these are the true Leviathans of the Deep, as the vastly-knowledgeable former engineer turned whale expert, Howard Martensteyn informed us at the local airport, who also happened to like breeding and feeding off the nutrient rich waters of Sri Lanka. A few tourist boats braved the day-long return trip on the choppy sea, but we were lucky enough to be watching from the air  apparently also the most environmentally sound option, too, keeping the disturbance to whales at a minimum. Taking off in F-airways five seater plane early morning, we spotted the tourist boats first, receiving a pounding from the waves as we flew serenely past at about five hundred feet.
Then Howard pointed out five great dark shadows in the clear blue sea, and a plume of water shot out of a blow hole. Blue whales! An awesome and majestic sight that we could clearly see, but the boats had not yet spotted much more than a box ticked on the bucket list, it was sight that will live with us for the rest of our lives, if our excited chatter upon our return an hour later is anything to go by.

When will Meghan  speak to her father
Meghan Markle will not speak to her father Thomas until he makes contact in a respectful manner and stops airing his grievances in public, DailyMail.com has learned.
The Duchess of Sussex, 37, has not spoken to Markle Sr since shortly after her wedding to Prince Harry in May when the royal, 33, allegedly berated the retiree for staging a series of fake photos with a Los Angeles-based paparazzi photographer.
Since then, the 74-year-old has gone on to give a series of interviews in which he claimed Meghan would be better off if I was dead and said he had been cut off by Kensington Palace and has no way of contacting his youngest daughter.
But a close friend of the 37-year-old has now told DailyMail.com that Markle Sr does have a means of contacting Meghan  via her mother Doria Ragland, 62. The couple, who divorced when their daughter was six, have remained in touch and, shortly before the royal wedding in May, Markle Sr was seen delivering pots of Mothers Day flowers to his ex-wifes home in Los
Angeles, California.
The only reason Meghan hasnt spoken to her father yet is because shes yet to hear from him in a respectful manner, the source told DailyMail.com. Thomas is speaking to the press more than hes reached out and spoken to his own daughter.
The friend added: Despite Thomass claim that he has no way to reach Meghan, he knows that her mother Doria is in touch with her and Thomas knows how to reach Doria. If Thomas truly wanted to speak with Meghan, he could easily have sent a letter to her mother and asked her to pass it along. Unfortunately that wouldnt sell papers or fit into his fabricated and salacious narrative.
The pair have a history of rifts, as DailyMail.com has previously revealed, with Markle Sr claiming the latest one began because Meghan asked him to cut off contact with her half-sister Samantha.
Kensington Palace has been approached for comment by DailyMail.com. The new revelations come after Markle Sr gave another interview this past weekend to the Mail on Sunday in which he once again moaned about being unable to contact Meghan, claimed to have sent her two birthday cards, and admitted that he lied to Prince Harry about the paparazzi photos scandal.
He told the paper of the now-infamous pictures of him being measured for a suit: I told him [Prince Harry] I was being measured for a new hoodie.
Markle Sr also lashed out at the Prince for remonstrating with him over the photo scandal while he was allegedly lying in his hospital bed recovering from a heart attack in San Diego, and described the timing of the call as rude.
The septuagenarian then went on to speak of his hurt over not receiving a wedding invitation to frame and revealed that he was upset that Meghan had decided not to let him make a speech at her wedding.

Why cant MR go to CID - Rajitha
Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne asked as to why former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot go to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to record a statement in connection with the Keith Noyahr abduction case, if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could testify before the bond commission.
The Minister made the above statement at the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday, in response to a question raised by a journalist as to whether the CID would go to the former Presidents house to get a statement, if he does not visit the CID office.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has to be summoned to record a statement when his name is mentioned several times regarding Keith Noyahrs abduction and assault. Further investigations will be conducted and he will have to answer questions arising from them, he said.

Alternative facts on the pay peril
When parliamentarians tried to get their salaries increased exponentially, naturally, there was an outburst of public indignation. Dismayed, most politicians backtracked. The JO was particularly vociferous, blaming the government for proposing the raise. The proposal, in reality, was the outcome of a rule introduced by the Rajapaksa administration in 2006, creating an unprecedented link between the salaries of parliamentarians and the upper judiciary. Last week we saw how the Yahapalanaya deals with a real problem- the railway strike.
It is very easy to tell when a real workers strike takes place because it will stop all sections of production whether its goods or services. It will immediately felt by the rest of the population and there will be a protest by the affected. The recent railway strike was such a successful work stoppage; an act of strike by almost hundred per cent participation.
Many of the railway leaders supported Yahapalanaya and active in the democratic revolution. Hence it was not an anti-government action, sabotage or a desperate act of last resort. Often, a trade union in the past in this country tends to have shades of both. Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said he had warned of an impending railway strike at the recent Cabinet meeting when Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera objected to the Cabinet proposal brought in to resolve the salary anomalies of the railway employees.
Salary anomalies
The strike had the sympathy of a section of Yahapalanaya. However, the Finance Minister has a different view on this.
Railway strike which included station masters and locomotive engine drivers brought the railway services to a grinding halt for four days. Stranded commuters attacked striking workers and damaged railway property. The strike was called off on Sunday after the President agreed to look into the salary anomalies, the main grievance of the strikers. The trade unions of the Railways Department had decided to call off their strike following a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena, a top TU official said later.
Politicians in general, blame against other politicians, for doing what they themselves have done in the past when in power. But Mahinda and his cohorts seem to be headed in an entirely different direction, towards a world made up of alternative facts (as former Donald Trump staffer Conway memorably phrased it). The danger of such a place is that those who occupy it absolve themselves completely of accountability. They can say and do anything, however outrageous because they think their opinions are the facts!
In Lankan context, democracy, media freedom and even the independence of independent commissions will be what the Mahinda say they are. One of the earliest sign of this departure from reality came in December 2017, in a statement issued by the former president, under his own signature, blaming the government for not resolving the SAITM issue his own government created. The statement, a hotchpotch of lies, evasions and alternate facts, deserves to be read in its entirety; it is available!
Protests against SAITM
The statement is also important for another reason; it inadvertently reveals when SAITM was turned into a do-or-die by the GMOA. Not in 2008, when the SAITM started; not in 2011, when the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted it as a medical and engineering degree awarding institution via the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1721/19; not in 2012, when the Supreme Court gave the green light to the SAITM; not in 2013 when the then President Rajapaksa awarded 11 scholarships (each worth Rs. 7 million) to SAITM students using public funds.
The continuous protests against the SAITM, the disruptive demonstrations and the unethical doctors strikes began in 2015 after the electorate sent the Rajapaksas home. Using words like traitors and patriots is something one expects from politicians, or mass campaign leaders, not from medical professionals, especially doctors.
However, one journalist says that they have created a point scheme, to identify traitors. Is the GMOA or any other medical organisation compiling a list of traitors, using abusive psychiatric methods, the very methods used by authoritarian rulers to confine their opponents in psychiatric facilities by sticking the mentally sick label on them
In 1977, the World Congress of Psychiatry adopted the Declaration of Hawaii. The purpose of the Declaration is to take a firm stand against the abusive use of psychiatry for political and personal ends: As the Declaration states, The psychiatrist must never use his professional possibilities to violate the dignity or human rights of any individual or group and should never let inappropriate personal desires, feelings, prejudices or beliefs interfere with the treatment If a patient or some third party demands actions contrary to scientific knowledge or ethical principles the psychiatrist must refuse to cooperate. There are 18,000+ members in the GMOA. Do they all approve of the GMOA engaging in practices banned by the World Congress of Psychiatry

Building, Owning  and Belonging
The European Union (EU) and UN-Habitat today launched a book titled Building, Owning and Belonging about owner-driven housing reconstruction, featuring lessons learnt and good practices from the last three decades till today. The book focuses on Sri Lanka and includes case studies from other countries including India.
Sri Lanka has been internationally recognised for providing homes and not just houses since the Million Houses Programme of the 1980s. Ever since, Sri Lanka has demonstrated the value of building together with the active contribution of the people. It has also showcased how effective it is to support local actors with affordable financing and technical assistance geared towards stimulating locally-sourced supply.
The European Union has been able to build on the success of Sri Lankas owner-driven approach to housing reconstruction since 2007. The EU has assisted returnee families to build more than 20,000 houses and another 2,400 are expected to be completed before 2020. The various EU grants to owner-driven housing reconstruction amount to EUR 65 million. Over 40,000 people including female-headed households, families of persons with disabilities and families with missing persons have directly benefitted.
The Head of Cooperation, Libuse Soukupova, said Support to housing has been a flagship programme of the EU-Sri Lanka partnership for over a decade. It has responded to actual demands of most vulnerable people, addressing not only housing needs but also helping them take control over their lives. Different forms of assistance to households and in particular support to women in the process of reconstruction have led to more resilient communities.
We feel privileged for having accompanied people of Sri Lanka in re-habilitating their villages in their own meaningful ways.
The book provides evidence that owner-driven housing has been the most successful way of meeting peoples aspirations as well as the most economical approach. What matters for the success of a housing programme is that people be in charge, able to make choices and that they can negotiate with contractors what they want.
On-going EU support to housing is helping to improve financial literacy and the scope for expanding their houses in the future without over-indebting themselves. The EU is also scaling up the production of appropriate and locally-sourced construction materials such as compressed, stabilised earth blocks (CSEBs). CSEBs use only a third of cement as compared to conventional sand-cement blocks hence contributing more to the local economy.
CSEBs also reduce negative environmental impacts because they do not require to be burnt and use substrate earth as opposed to top-soil which is precious for agriculture.
Valuable contributions to the EU-funded book have been provided by implementing partners such as UN-Habitat, Habitat for Humanity, Arbeiter Samariter Bund (ASB), Practical Action (now Janathkshan), the International Federation of the Red Cross, World Vision, the Auroville Earth Institute and other donors such as the World Bank, the governments of Australia, Switzerland and India.
They all have been instrumental in making the owner-driven reconstruction of over 100,000 houses a success.

Turkeys lira meltdown causing  a global economic crisis
AS TURKEYs lira collapses after a huge drop in price against the dollar on Monday, President Erdogans countrys debt continues to rise, putting at risk its major European lenders  a shocking graph shows the extent of the sudden drop in the lira.
Turkeys lira meltdown is causing a global economic crisis on all four corners of the world  particularly in France and Spain where major lenders are at risk of losing substantial paybacks while President Erdogans debt rises. The banking business in Turkey has been highly profitable for many years, which was also due to the economic policy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and through extensive guarantees, he stimulated private credit growth. In contrast, the Turkish economy grew by 7.4 percent last year - quicker than financial growth champions China and India.
But now with every one percent the lira loses, the dollar debt automatically rises as shown in a graph  meaning the first Turkish companies can no longer meet their financial obligations and have had to restructure their loans.
The lira slipped below 7.0 to the US dollar and was down 12 percent on Fridays value at one point this morning. The currency is collapsing after Donald Trump doubled import duties on steel and aluminium as part of fresh sanctions on the country. The countries are embroiled in a diplomatic row sparked by the case of US evangelic pastor Andrew Brunson, which Turkey wants to try on terrorism charges believing he was behind the attempted coup on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two years ago.
The euro had already plunged after the tariffs were imposed on Friday, with the currency dropping to a 13-moth low this morning. It has been a concern that the lira will affect European banks, mainly Spanish and French, because of the exposure of major European lenders to Turkish debt.
However, Elsa Lignos, Managing Director of FX Strategy, claimed the crash could still be judged as an isolated incident unlikely to cause a wider recession. She told Sky News: If you look at the case of Turkey, real interest rates are actually fairly positive given how high inflation is at the moment.
So its not clear that investors are being rewarded for the risk that theyre taking. Asked if the current crush of the Turkish Lira could be compared to the early 1990s recession of emerging European countries, she said: I think central banks and emerging markets have gotten much smarter at using the tools at their disposal to really complement what the government is doing.
And find ways of squeezing the speculative positioning.
So we sold out, for example, with CNH earlier last year and this year were seeing a similar kind of situation at the moment in several other currencies and we may see the same in Turkey. (www.express.co.uk)

Acted constitutionally in Opposition Leader post ruling - Speaker
The decision regarding the post of Opposition Leader was taken by the Speaker after extensive study and probing ideas and views of local and foreign experts and traditions followed by other democratic countries in the Commonwealth, the Speaker's office in a press release stated yesterday.
Letters sent by former General Secretary late Prof. Viswa Warnapala and incumbent UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera dated 01-09-2015 and 06-08-2018 as well as their recommendations were also taken into cognizance in making this decision.
Furthermore, the proposal containing standing order no 47(1) 6 adopted on September 5 by 143 members of Parliament was taken into consideration in making this decision, the release said.
It has been observed that certain Opposition members had criticised the decision taken by the Speaker regarding the post of Opposition Leader and used it to publish malicious and defamatory statements against the Speaker through the media. They have made these false allegations without understanding the different backgrounds which existed during the appointment of opposition leaders on earlier occasions and the appointment made of the first time under under a national government concept the release added.
The release said speaker Karu Jayasuriya had acted independently devoid of political considerations and without succumbing to any pressure since he accepted the post on 01-09-2015.
He has not visited an office of any political party including the UNP and always acted apolitically in an independent manner.
The normal traditions in democratic countries in the world is to accept the Speaker's decision or else take the next necessary step regarding it in a democratic manner.
Without doing this just because one's opinion was not accepted, attacking opposing views and character assassination of individuals and subjecting them to degrading criticism would not be condoned by a disciplined and cultured society, the release said.

Asgiriya Cricket Stadium the forgotten international venue
Asgiriya Stadium is one of the famous stadiums in Sri Lanka after the country attained Test status and all international matches were played there until the construction of the Pallekelle Stadium International Stadium which has now taken over as the main centre in Kandy to host international matches.
Most of the worlds great cricketers who visited the country have played at Asgiriya. To name some of them - Frank Worrell, Fazal Mahmood, Bill Lawry, Colin Cowdrey, John Edrich, Tony Greig, Jack Hobbs, Leslie Ames, Lindsay Hassett, Sunil Gavaskar, Ajith Wadekar, Geoff Boycott, Kapil Dev, Intikhab Alam, Majid Khan, Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Mushtaq Mohamed, Zaheer Abbas, Wasim Akram, Greg and Ian Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Bob Simpson, and Shane Warne.
Once when Robin Marlar the famed cricket writer, visited Asgiriya he noted that the ground was comparable with the best in the world. It was in 1910 that permission was granted to start work at Asgiriya by the white sahibs. The principal of Trinity College at that time, Rev. A.G. Fraser was the man behind the construction. It was completed in 1915 and the ground was ceremonially opened by Sir Robert Charmers, the Governor of Ceylon, on January 15, 1915.On this day a cricket match was played between combined past and present students of Trinity College against Dr. V.R. Schokmans team from Colombo. The first delivery was sent down by R. Ellawela to Trinitys Richard Aluvihare and it is said that it was lofted to the mid wicket boundary. The happiest man on that day would have been the man behind this project, the principal Rev. A.G. Fraser.
The first inter school game to be played at Asgiriya was between Trinity and S. Thomas Mount Lavinia on January 25, 1915 and the Trinitians won by an innings. Before the Asgiriya ground was built Trinity used the Bogambara grounds. Since that time various changes have taken place at this ground. The old pavilion still stands. After 67 years the late Gamini Dissanayake who was the president of Sri Lanka Cricket with the help of Abu Fuard who was the power behind the throne worked endless hours used modern machinery and within a short period of 150 days made the ground into an International Stadium with all facilities. On June 6, 1981 Gamini Dissanayake, as president of the Cricket Board, cut the first sod to start work and on February 5, 1982 , the then president of the country J. R. Jayewardene ceremonially opened the stadium amidst a vast gathering.
Within a few days the first International cricket match was played at Asgiriya between Keith Fletchers England and the Sri Lanka side led by Duleep Mendis.
The first official test to be played at this venue was between Greg Chappells Australian side and Duleep Mendis led Sri Lanka team. From this day onwards most of the visiting teams played Test and one day games at this venue.
Asgiriya has an excellent pavilion consisting of three floors, the ground floor exclusively for players, umpires and officials, with all the facilities. The other two floors accommodate over 1500 spectators.
The turf wicket at Asgiriya was prepared by T.M. Omardeen under the supervision of Abu Fuard who coordinated on behalf of the Cricket Board, with J.D. Shaw Wilson as the first curator, later Alex Lazarus was the curator. Trinitians of all walks of life extended their fullest support to Gamini Dissanayake. The chairman of the project was late Rev. Dr. W.G. Wickremasinghe, Principal of Trinity at that time. S. Bandaranayake, late H.M. Halimdeen, Harindra Dunuwille, late Kavan Rambukwella, Jayantha Jayawardene, late Rohan Wijenayake all old boys of Trinity, Gamini Kannangara and S. Mubarak from the Water Resources Board were some of the officials who did a tremendous amount of work to make this ground an International stadium.

He added that improvements in safety standards and workers rights had raised buyers confidence in Bangladeshs RMG sector, which a contributing factor to the growth in exports.
According to the BGMEA leader, Bangladesh has plenty of opportunities in the global export market. The increase of duty on Chinese imports by India; the trade war between China and the US may both help exports from Bangladesh.
Hassan also said the upcoming declaration of a new wage structure, and the prices of gas may pose challenges in maintaining the growth rate in the future.
In the last fiscal year, Bangladeshs export earnings from the apparel sector registered 8.76% growth, reaching $30.61 billion.

Chinese Li Nings apparel sector 1H revenue up
Chinese sportswear maker Li Ning Co Ltd has placed its confidence in its apparel business, which boosted the companys half-year revenue and helped it stand out amid fierce market competition.
Chairman Li Ning said at a media briefing on Monday that he expected the China LI-NING series of sportswear products, which were released at the New York and Paris fashion weeks, to be a new source of the companys revenue. Revenue from the apparel business rose 30.7 percent year-on-year in the first six months of the year, accounting for the bulk of the companys total revenue, the sportswear brand reported. The substantial growth is mainly due to the low base of the apparel business in the past, as Li Ning did not focus on this division before, said Terence Tsang Wah-fung, the companys chief financial officer.
He believed the apparel division would continue to grow in the future at a slower speed, but the proportion of apparel in total revenue would remain at the same level.

Sanga, the cricketing great
When living in a world of a species different to that of the world we came from a world now full of selfishness and power craziness, we as seniors are happy to see among us a man so full of altruism and so full of graciousness as cricketer Sangakkara.
This is not the first time he refused to be lured by a life of pomp and pageantry. We know he earlier refused an offer of a diplomatic post by the President. This was an unselfish act with the full knowledge that he was not having the experience and the quality for political diplomacy. This is a time when the very scum of our society would run for such a post. But no this man was quite satisfied with the wealth and fame he has earned over the years and he has thus become a beacon of light to a country groping in darkness.
Sanga, like some others who had earned fame, glory and wealth by what they have done in their careers, such as Ottara of Odel fame, Kishu Gomes of business fame, Cricketer Mahela who sweated for a cancer hospital and a host of other silent men and women of such ilk and fame, have opted to be different from many others who are chasing mirages to fulfill their illusions. This is an appeal for all such good people to get together for realms of a higher order.
Let these folk of altruistic motives form a movement to help the poor and marginalized in our country. We are very sure there will be an avalanche of Goodwill for such a great deed, devoid of politics of that dirty variety that had done very little since gaining independence.
Hats off to Sanga and may he steer the proposal that we sincerely make for this blessed country.

Cleared Stokes fuels fiery debate about his future
London, Wednesday: England star Ben Stokes may have been cleared of affray but former cricket luminaries while agreeing his behaviour was well below that expected of a man seen by many as a role model are divided as to whether he should face further punishment.
The 27-year-old New Zealand-born all-rounder faces an internal disciplinary enquiry by the Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) following his acquittal by unanimous decision of a jury on Tuesday.
former Derbyshire batsman and qualified solicitor Tim O'Gorman is heading the investigation.
Stokes's team-mate Alex Hales -- who was with him during the late night brawl outside a club in Bristol, southwest England, last September but was not charged -- will also face the enquiry.
However, former England captains Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain whilst both abhorring his behaviour are at odds with each other as to whether he should be punished further.
"With a not-guilty verdict, the way forward seems, to me, to be clear enough and should not involve further punishment," Atherton writes in The Times.
Atherton, who captained England in 54 of his 115 Test matches, conceded Stokes's heavy drinking that night and what ensued afterwards "is not exactly acceptable behaviour for an England player during international duty".
"There are clauses in an England cricketers contract - such as bringing the game into disrepute - that could yet result in punishment," the 50-year-old commented.
"Although Stokes was never formally suspended from the England team, his non-selection for the Ashes came about clearly as a result of the events in Bristol.
"He missed the most high-profile series in which an England cricketer can play, essentially a six-month ban."
Hussain, capped 96 times and captained England 45 times till stepping down from the post in 2003, argued differently saying the images caught on CCTV cannot just be ignored and the governing body the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have to act.
"Some people would argue that Ben Stokes has had it tough, and has served his time in missing the Ashes, but I see it differently," he told The Daily Mail.
"The ECB should not now take the easy option. "It is far too serious an issue, and the footage far too serious, for people to think about moving on and brushing things under the carpet."
'Doesn't everyone'
Former England spinner Vic Marks says in The Guardian there is no doubt Stokes "brought the game into disrepute" on a "feral night out" which does nothing to promote the image of the game the ECB wants to display to families.
Marks draws comparison between Stokes and a superstar all-rounder of another era and one he played with in the great Somerset side of the 1970's and 80's, Ian Botham.
"The very best cricketers often ooze invincibility; they are never out and never wrong," wrote Marks.
"They feel invulnerable, capable of dominating any situation.
"I have witnessed this at close quarters when playing alongside Ian Botham."
Marks, who played six Tests and 34 One Day Internationals for his country, says Stokes, though, suffers from being a star in a time when social media can destroy you within seconds but compares the professionalism these days of sports stars management teams to those in Botham's day.
"In Botham's era the backroom staff were not so sophisticated," observed Marks.
"He once had an agent, Tim Hudson, whose response to an allegation about Ian smoking cannabis was famously, "Doesn't everyone"
Marks suggests Stokes take former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting as a role model in moving forward. "Ponting had his moments of madness in bars as a young Australian cricketer and was dropped in 1999 after an incident in Sydney which left him unconscious in the early hours of the morning," writes Marks.

ComBank Pbt up 23.73% to Rs 12.9 bn in Q2
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has continued its growth momentum into the second quarter of 2018, despite having to pay in excess of Rs 7 billion in taxes and being compelled to make significant provisions for impairment charges for the six months ending June 30, 2018.
The Bank has posted profit before VAT and NBT of Rs 15.65 billion for the period, reflecting growth of 23.33% over the corresponding six months of last year. Profit before tax grew 23.73% to Rs 12.898 billion although VAT and NBT rose to Rs 2.75 billion for the six months under review.
Gross income for the period was up 19.30% to Rs 65.99 billion, with interest income growing by a healthy 18.89% to Rs 58.21 billion on the back of robust loan book growth, the countrys benchmark private bank said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Notably, timely re-pricing enabled the Bank to restrict growth of interest expenses to Rs 34.66 billion, an increase of only 11.30% despite a shift towards high cost funds in the six months reviewed, to generate net interest income of Rs 23.55 billion. This is an improvement of Rs 5.71 billion or 32.14%. Incidentally, net interest income accounted for 77.35% of the total operating income of the Bank.
Income tax grew by a hefty 47.38% to Rs 4.25 billion for the six months, primarily due to the removal of most income tax exemptions enjoyed by the banking industry with the introduction of the new Inland Revenue Act.Consequently, profit after tax grew by 14.67% to Rs 8.65 billion for the first half of the year, an increase of Rs 1.11 billion.
Commenting on these results, Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said the Banks performance reflected its ability to withstand challenges, such as an industry-wide increase in impairment charges, necessitated by the trend of an escalation in non-performing loans (NPLs).
The Bank has been able to maintain its NPL ratios well below industry averages, but we expect the pressure on impairment charges to continue in the year ahead due to slower business growth, Dheerasinghe said.
The Banks Managing Director, CEO S. Renganathan said, The Bank has focused a lot of attention on digitisation and centralisation, enabling it to consistently control operating costs and improve the Cost Income ratio, to remain one of the most financially sound business entities in the country.
Renganathan also pointed out that the Bank had achieved a CASA ratio of 39.31%, one of the best in the industry. We are also contributing substantially to the state, he said, disclosing that the Bank had contributed Rs 7.001 billion or 44.74% of its profit in taxes in respect of the six months reviewed.
Total assets of the Bank grew by Rs 56.341 billion or 4.93% over the six months to reach Rs 1.2 trillion as at 30th June 2018. Asset growth over the preceding 12 months totalled Rs 115 billion, reflecting YoY growth of 10.60%.

Initially classified as waste land, the 77-acre estate was sold by the colonial secretary. The land was then auctioned off to John Vincent Blair Stork, a British tea planter who, being enamored with its lush pastures and rich soil, transformed the wild woods into a gently swaying grove of coconut palms, which was later supplemented by fields of paddy and pepper. The founder of Comilla, Stork worked as a District Engineer in the District of Comilla in Bangladesh. When he moved to Ceylon, he carried the Comilla name and legacy with him.
Surrounded by green acres, Stork built a two-bedroom bungalow for his family in traditional Dutch period architecture, with a high open verandah at the Northern post along with airy lounge and dining areas. The estate was passed down within the Stork clan until the 1950s, when the family of its present owners took possession of the estate.

Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) council member Sharmila Jayawardene Gonawela has decried the proposal stating that it was unbecoming of the council to have allowances increased when people were struggling to make ends meet.
CMC Opposition Leader H.N. Manzil said that the matter had been brought to the notice of the Standing committee on Finance. The final decision rests with the Commissioner, he said adding that it may be taken up for discussion on the 24th of this month when the CMC meets again.
It was reported that if the proposal goes through,the CMC would incur an additional Rs. 2,957,000 per month. The Mayor had proposed the move to avoid councillors from resorting to unlawful means to find money for their official duties.

CSEs Multi Currency Board  to go live soon
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) will introduce the proposed Multi Currency Board which will enable overseas companies to list and raise capital in US dollars in three months.
The CSE is currently working with the regulator to obtain necessary approvals, Chief Executive Officer of CSE Rajeeva Bandaranaike said in an interview with the Daily News Business.
Once that is done, we hope it can be launched in another three months, he said.
Commenting on domestic and foreign investor participation in overall market activities, Bandaranaike said the present market scenario has created opportunities for investors to buy stocks at relatively low prices.
The market is at very cheap multiples. This is not the time to sell; this is the ideal time to purchase shares. Compared to local investor base, the international investors have identified potential opportunities in our stocks. We are hoping that local investors will avail themselves with this opportunity of buying stocks at relatively cheap prices.
In addition, a sizeable public holding is a necessity for a transparent and liquid market, he said. Various rules and regulations have been introduced to address the liquidity issue in the capital market. The CSE has introduced minimum public rules and enforcement rules. Were sort of pushing companies to increase their public float to increase the liquidity in the market.
Therefore, a minimum public holding as a continuous listing requirement is introduced with the aim of promoting a liquid and transparent market with a better price discovery mechanism.
Commenting on how vulnerable the capital market is to a tightening in the global market, Bandaranaike said, the global economy has come under severe stress and at the same time growth of Sri Lankan economy has slowed down due to various factors.
Due to changes in the US fed rate hikes, we are seeing an outflow of funds from the Asian regions back to the USA. All the equity markets in Asia have impacted including Sri Lanka in terms of foreigners moving their funds away from capital markets into the USA. All the equity markets including our markets are a bit sensitive to these measures.
It is important that we also drive the local investor; so that we can cushion the impact of foreign investors when they exit the market. Unfortunately, our local institutions are not that active, he said.
At present, the market is subsided due to lack of local investor participation, it is the foreigners who have been active even during last year and even up to now, he said. It is very important that our local institutes, the private sector, high net worth investors and retailers get active in the market now, to sustain the market growth.
In a bid to trigger a fresh round of investor interest, the CSE has plans to conduct two overseas road shows. Accordingly, the CSE is planning to hold the first road show towards the end of this year and the second one in 2019. However, the CSE has not made a decision on the final locations of the proposed road shows.

Former SriLankan Chairmans decision resulted in over Rs.10 mn loss to airline - Air Traffic Controller Managers
Due to former SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickremesinghe changing a decision taken by highly trained professionals with regard to the departure time of a flight scheduled for Paris in 2014, the Airline had to incur a loss exceeding Rs.10 Million, two air traffic operation control managers giving evidence before the Presidential Commission inquiring into irregularities in connection with Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday said.
The witnesses also said that former Chairmans decision had a negative impact on the international reputation of Sri Lankan Airlines.
The Air Traffic Controller Managers Dhammika Senanayake and Nishantha Handapangoda giving evidence before the Commission yesterday also said that it was the first time that a SriLankan Airlines Chairman took decisions regarding air traffic control.
The decision referred to concerns UL 563 flight bound for Paris on Januray 25, 2014.
The Air Traffic controllers had taken a decision to delay the flight slightly taking into considerations the requirements of the passengers. However Wickremasinghe had allegedly ordered for the flight to procedd without further delay.
Due to this decision authorities had to delay UL 553 flight bound for Frankfurt and 75 passengers had missed connecting flights and the Airline had to pay close to Rs.10 million for the inconvenienced passengers.
According to evidence, the said flight has been delayed for a particular time as it was the only one bound to Paris. However, the former Chairman Wickremesinghe had ordered the flight to leave saying that there is a group of diplomats in the flight who needs to reach France on time. The Air Traffic controllers said they were not aware who the diplomats were.

GIS Mapping Technology used for Thailand Cave Rescue
Rescuers used GIS Mapping to gather data, guiding search and rescue plans to secure monsoon rains trapped a soccer team of 12 boys, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach in a remote cave in Thailand. Rescuers uses 3D terrain and watershed maps to show how and where to divert water during the rescue.
Most search-and-rescue missions start with a map to guide the operation and coordinate tools, supplies, and personnel. Todays maps, created in a geographic information system (GIS), bring in all types of data to query and explore. In cases of cave rescue, workers rely on maps to correlate the underground world to the land above.
Early on, the Thailand Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) pulled in GIS and mapping experts from Esri Thailand and GIS Company to create a variety of maps to help locate the boys.
DMR staff and the mapping teams had to find a new approach. They added prior cave surveys to the GIS to make maps that showed the complete picture of the cave surface both above and below. Staff from the Royal Irrigation Department surveyed the areas geology using electrical resistivity techniques. Mapping experts interpreted the data to find sinkholes that might be acting as water funnels and they created 3D maps to show where aboveground streams stopped and went underground. Experts conferred with GIS-based data and analytics to review and model water diversion options.
We had to calculate the basin, water flow direction, and accumulation using a digital elevation model, geological detailsand details about the dense forest cover in order to identify the origin of significant flows of water inside the cave, said Chanist Prasertburanakul, Senior Aerospace Mapping Manager and Team Leader of GIS Company, Ltd. and Esri Thailand. With this data, we found two significant sources of water flowing into the northern and southern parts of the cave.
Responders set up a rescue operation war room at the Geohazard Operation Center. From this central location, they planned and coordinated activities using a digital twin of the cave.
Many responders and experts assembled and with water levels safely lowered, the dive team was ready to set out in search of the missing boys. They first studied maps depicting the caves twists, turns, and dimensions to help navigate difficult passages and mentally mark their progress inside the cave.
Engineers, hoping to find a place to drill, explored 3D cross-section maps to calculate the distance to the center of the cave from multiple angles.The boys discovery kicked off a frantic phase of extraction plans as rain kept pouring and the team waited in jeopardy. Initially, one government official suggested the boys might have to remain in place for four months until waters receded. However, map-based calculations revealed that cave oxygen levels would not sustain them that long. GIS Solutions (Private) Limited was appointed by Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. (ESRI) as its sole Distributor for Sri Lanka. GIS Solutions is a group company of the Just In Time Group, a foremost systems integrator in Sri Lanka with a 21+ year history, providing ICT solutions and service support to a niche market in Sri Lanka.

Hathurusingha praises SLC injury management for Test success
Injury management at Sri Lanka Cricket has tremendously improved over the last six months and it is a good sign for the team, head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said.
He made these remarks at a press conference held yesterday at SLC headquarters. He further said that the players did not have any major injuries over the period in question.
"We havent had any injuries over the past four months and that's a good sign for us and all credit goes to our trainers, physio and assistant coach who manage the training schedules well concerning player injuries, Hathurusingha continued.
"If you compare our records, in the last seven months we have achieved a lot than before. Weve become the first Asian team to win a Test match in Barbados (against the West Indies) and continued the winning streak against South Africa," he said.
Hathurusingha said the wins were achieved in two contrasting situations on fast and slow pitches and all credit to the bowlers who adjusted to the wickets.
"Before the New Zealand and Australia tours (in December and February) we are looking to having our training in Kandy and Dambulla on two different pitches similar to New Zealand and Australia," said Hathurusingha.
Questioned about ageing fast bowler Lasith Malinga's status, Hathurusingha said he (Malinga) has the potential to return to the Sri Lanka team provided he proves his fitness and worthiness at domestic cricket.
CEO of SLC Ashley de Silva said the team's performances against South Africa was refreshing.
"I hope the same success story will continue in the future in the next couple of series as well," he said.

Hemas Holdings records Rs 13.5 bn  revenue in 1Q, Yoy growth 21.3%
Hemas Holdings PLC (HHL) recorded a consolidated revenue of Rs 13.5 billion for the first quarter ended June 30, 2018, ayear-on-year (YoY) growth of 21.3%,led by higher contributions inour consumer and healthcare sectors.
The Group operating profit at Rs 895.7 million in the first quarter of the financial year is an increase of 3.5% over the previous financial year. Operating profit growth has been impacted by losses at N*Able, its IT technology solutions business, coupled with a weaker macroeconomic environment with sluggish consumer demand as disposable incomes have been dampened by rising costs from Rupee depreciation and increased taxes.
The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent at Rs 554.3 million is a decrease of 20.2% in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. This is due to reduced interest income post utilisation of cash reserves to acquire Atlas in January 2018 and increased interest costs relating to higher working capital due to strong growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and the loan financing for our new logistics park. All three of these investments should contribute to earnings from Q3. Excluding the first quarter performance of Atlas, HHL recorded revenue and an operating profit growth of 10.9% and 1.5% correspondingly.
The groups consumer business revenue stood at Rs.5.4 billion for the three months ending June 30, 2018, indicating a YoY growth of 36.2%. Growth in the consumer sector excluding Atlas stands at 6.8%. Operating profit of Rs 569.3 million grew by 8.1% during the quarter. Market conditions domestically remain depressed with most market commentaries indicating low or negative growth in most major FMCG categories. Against this backdrop, the business has performed well.
The Grops technology business, N*Able got the year off to a slower start with revenue decline of 68.5% due to delays in project completion during the quarter in contrast to its strong start in FY2017/18.
Overall the Group had a satisfactory start to the year in a difficult macro environment. Solid performance in its core Sri Lanka Consumer businesses supported by improvements in Leisure and Travel sector performance and the seasonality effect of Atlas, has positioned the Group well to improve operating profit growth in the coming quarters of the financial year.

High expectations and the clinical nature of finishing in the middle
Greetings rugby islanders and lovable fanatics who religiously follow our union code to all over this sun drenched land we call home.
So it naturally stepped up on expectations scale a few yards shy of 150% ...that the U20 7s team captained by Naveen Heenakan would carry our Lion flag all the way.
On the opposite group defending champions Hong Kong ...making Sri Lanka favourites for the final v HK.
No deckchair expert in their social media mind would dare to contradict or offer believable alternatives.
The class and running quality of the young Sri islanders absolutely clinical and second to none.
In addition to the hugely successful schools coach Nilufer Ibrahim, plus expertise from the vast experience of Fazil Marija. However in all the thinking...little consideration was given to ball retention.
I am guessing that vital component was factored in under running yards and finishing.
The fight and rip good turnover ball ticked off on the list.
Running in big tries against China, Taipei and Singapore...all as anticipated.
The wins not testing our power and physicality and breakdowns.
Alas our natural game skills suffered against the bigger Koreans who out muscled us to win extra time with a sudden death try...that floored our boys in utter disbelief.
A shock result which wiped our half time lead ...with lazy defence and possibly some questions about stamina to finish.
The flight home across the vast ocean .with a bitter taste thats impossible to wash or spit out.
Playing Singapore for no 3...almost too harsh and slightly beneath us.
Hong Kong champions again seeing off an Sri Lanka inspired Korea...5-0 ...hard graft and a monumental upset, had Korea managed a converted try.
Imagine a heap of murmuring by the brains trust at Sri Lanka rugby HQ, especially the nature of our performance indicators.
Opportunity of this type must be absorbed well.
The thought of becoming Asian rugby 7s champions again...taken by warm ocean...lapping our island shores.
August is certainly a month of meticulous prep for 3 leg Asian 7s series.
Both men and women stepping up September in Hong Kong, then to South Korea early October and concluding in Sri Lanka for medals and final rankings.
Men are 4th from 2017...Looking at top 2 for sure.
The .women are 6 and starring down the barrel at 4 or 3.
Must quietly mention in passing as a quick free kick....tap taken...that the team scaled up from 12 to no. 5 and Plate champions 2 years running with the white shark...plus heaps of burgees and lots of barking.
The tactics worked and we shocked ARFU 7s series 2 years running.
Many thanks to Asanga Seneviratne, president Sri Lanka rugby, Colonel Dhammika Gunasek..chairman womens rugby...plus the Sri Lanka Army...Navy...and Air Force...for all the players.
A remarkable and hugely laudable fact that supports this Olympic sport in its entirety.
Were it not for the sterling effort by the Service Commanders ..womens rugby would be on the endangered list.
From August to December Asian rugby steps up its annual 7s calendar...and I am almost sounding like an old pedigree...dog, barking across the vast ocean.....this is Sri Lanka best opportunity, at all national grades to stamp our class and secure rankings.
I am hoping my bark and pride still potent enough to hits its mark.
Blessings for more.
Bula, bula 7s and Sri Api.

Yes, other than keeping yourself internally hydrated, also use a good moisturizer to feed your skin. Moisturizers do not add a great deal of moisture by themselves but they lock in the present moisture and are hence essential to keep your skin hydrated. After a bath, make it a routine to moisturize your face daily to keep it hydrated. Before bedtime, place a towel soaked in warm water on your face and keep for some time. This way the pores of your face will open allowing the moisturizer to soak into your skin.
Tip 6: Eat proper food
Food provides life to your skin. Everything you eat in your everyday life contributes to a healthy skin. Only that you have to cut out on some and add some more.

Knightley  turns Sugar Plum Fairy
Disney has released a trailer for The Nutcracker and The Four Realms starring Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Morgan Freeman as Drosselmeyer and Dame Helen Mirren as the antagonist Mother Ginger.
It has all the majesty and grandeur you would expect from one of these Disney fantasy movies, which I imagine are budgeted using one of those novelty cash-firing guns.
The film follows Clara (Mackenzie Foy) who wants a key  a one-of-a-kind key that will unlock a box that holds a priceless gift. A golden thread, presented to her at godfather Drosselmeyers annual holiday party, leads her to the coveted key-which promptly disappears into a strange and mysterious parallel world. Its there that Clara encounters a soldier named Phillip, a gang of mice and the regents who preside over three Realms: Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets. Clara and Phillip must brave the ominous Fourth Realm, home to the tyrant Mother Ginger, to retrieve Claras key and hopefully return harmony to the unstable world.
The film is out on November 2 and was directed by Lasse Hallstrm (Chocolat) and Joe Johnston (Jumanji)

Litro Fuels commission two fuel stations along the Southern Expressway
Introducing a state-of-the-art fuel dispensing system to motorists using the Southern Expressway, Litro Fuels, a brand of Litro Gas Lanka commissioned their first ever fuel stations on either sides of the Welipanna entrance recently.
The two fuel stations which incidentally become the first ever fuel stations along the Southern Expressway comprise fuel dispensers that utilize an automated multi-product fuel delivery system with electronic receipt generation to ensure a reliable service to customers. The two fuel stations are positioned with adequate space and specifications conforming to international standards.
The fuel dispensers will dispense all four varieties of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation fuel namely - Lanka Petrol 92, 95 Octane, Lanka Auto Diesel and Super Diesel.
In addition, the fuel stations are equipped to provide facilities such as tyre top-ups (free of charge) and Nitrogen tyre filling service which particular service is capacitated to fill all four tyres simultaneously. Motorists using the Southern Expressway have long felt the need for an accessible fuel station. Having realized this urgent requirement, we took measures to commission two fuel stations on either side of the Welipanna entrance to ensure accessibility and convenience. Moreover, our fuel delivery system is one of the most advanced automated features available in Sri Lanka. The real-time monitoring and electronic receipt systems embedded into this system guarantees service excellence that is on par with international standards, commented Muditha Peiris, Managing Director, Litro Gas Lanka Ltd & Litro Gas Terminal Lanka (Pvt) Ltd
The Southern Expressway, Sri Lankas first E-class highway was declared open in November 2011 and it was extended up to Matara in 2014 covering over a stretch of 130 Kilometers. However, thus far the expressway continued to operate without a functioning fuel station along its length and breadth.
With the commissioning of the two fuel stations, Litro Fuels offers a much needed service to motorists further enhancing their service quality by virtue of bringing in world class technology and service delivery.
Litro Fuels plans to commission similar systems at convenient locations across the island in future.

Long walk to water autonomy
Wanni! The moment you mention the word it immediately brings to your mind an endless stretch of parched and scorched earth. It immediately brings to your mind an endless stretch of hot midsummer sky devoid of the faintest hint of rain. Even the wind is coarse and dry. Trees and leaves have shrivelled and wizened. Gaunt and skeletal, cattle graze on dead grass that is more like sand. People make their living by chena cultivation against all odds. Paddy cultivation they have given up - not because they detest it, but because of the nagging doubt about timely rain.
However, amidst all daunting challenges people in Wanni havent abandoned their constant battle with earth as yet, toiling in defiance to make their chena cultivation and its improbable harvest a reality. From the time of our ancestors, we have seen Wanni in this plight. Does that mean our future generations too should experience Wanni the same way
Construction of Wayamba Canal along with the resurrection of 2,400 tanks programme is due to be commenced this month under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. As the people in Wayamba, we could not describe our happiness when we first heard the news that all necessary steps have been taken to provide water to the dwellers in the Kurunegala district.
In their youth, our ancestors, unfortunately, failed to witness the promise of Wayamba Canal being fulfilled. A promise which was mentioned casually somewhere in the to-do list of national or regional political leaders who came to power from time to time. Our ancestors are no more with us. It is now our turn.
Yes, we were under the impression that Mahaweli Water to Wayamba is just an illusion intended for our current generation also - who are engaged in an eternal struggle with soil - and remain so for our future generations as well, but the recent news tells us otherwise - creating strong trust in our minds about the Wayamba Canal initiative.
Wayamba Canal project
Wayamba Canal project takes place in compliance with his 2015 Maithree Governance  A Stable Country election mandate in which President Maithripala Sirisena pledged his people that he will take measures to repair clogged irrigation systems and remove silt-formed tank beds so as to preserve abundant rainwater and face climatic changes.
First, high-level talks dealing the issue in detail regarding the scarcity of water for the people in Wayamba dates back to 1960s. But it remained unresolved, despite the eagerly anticipated solutions proffered by the Mahaweli Project or the various water management programmes based on Deduru Oya, which meandered across the Wanni region itself. Ever since then, people in Wanni were unwilling to place much faith on political discussions that concerned supplying water for their agricultural requirements.
Cultivators and farmers in Wayamba had much zeal and zest to exert themselves dedicatedly to the task of tillage. But the shortage of water brought their large-scale agribusiness to an inevitable halt. The only answer left to them was to depend on rainwater.
So when rainwater pools into tanks - which are actually man-made excavations engineered during the reign of the Sinhalese Kings - people in Wanni utilize it to the last drop. They have to. Because of the searing heat, evaporation occurs swiftly. There were times when the tanks in Wanni contained ample water. But today they are not much different from abandoned playgrounds. Few tanks still stubbornly hold on, looking  pitifully - not more than mere ponds.
In this context, it is not much of a new experience for people in Wanni to endure lengthy periods of drought when it becomes extremely problematic and difficult for them to obtain water to drink let alone farm their lands. Especially for the people living in the northern sector of Kurunegala district, this tragic situation is a part of their everyday life. True, roads had been built and buildings erected, but the necessity of providing a sufficient water supply to the region always received poor attention and went unnoticed. The ultimate result was; groups of villagers walking miles on foot - with buckets, pots, bottles and cans in hand - to fetch water from faraway wells. Yeah, it might sound unbelievable to you. But the scene is commonplace.
Through this proposed new project, it is expected to channel 130 million cubic metres of water to Wayamba. Ten percent of that amount is clean, distilled water suitable for drinking. This may also help alleviate the infamous, hereditary kidney ailment the people in Wayamba have been mysteriously suffering from generation to generation.
Already, the Kurunegala district has been identified as risky in relation to this Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu), the origins of which are still at the debate. It has been identified that the northern zone of Kurunegala district has the highest risk exposure to CKDu. According to statistics published in 2015 by the Ministry of Health, the number of patients having CKDu has surpassed  staggering and shocking - one thousand five hundred. It should be specially noted here that a majority of these patients live in the region which will be provided with drinkable distilled water under the Wayamba Canal project.
Water for paddy cultivation
The next gravest worry that stems from the water crisis in Wanni is obtaining adequate water for paddy cultivation. In desperate times, things easily escalate and the cooperation, harmony and togetherness that prevailed among farmers since bygone times have started to gradually fade away. Even the opening or closing of the smallest water conduit has driven people to the point of ending the lives of one another. Unable to bear the loss of harvest many have committed suicide.
The water crisis has worn out the farmers. For them, it is a question without an answer. Some say, going to farm is more painful than going to war. The construction of Wayamba Canal is in some sense a humanitarian operation of its kind that hopes to sooth the sorrows of such people in distress, bestowing them with the invaluable gift of much-needed water. In one hand, it is an alms giving at a supreme level. On the other hand, it is an excellent endowment that can be conferred on a distraught community of our nation to end their long-lasting grievances.
With a breathtaking expanse of 92 kilometres, Wayamba Canal is expected to steadily flow into eight main lakes and 350 other smaller tanks that span the breadth of Wayamba and Central provinces. Consequently, 2,400 additional tanks connected to the ancient Tank Cascading System (TCS) that is unique to our country, will be water fed by the excess release of the leading tanks.
The eight main lakes belong to Nikaweratiya, Galgamuwa and Hiriyala electorates in the Kurunegala district. One of the lakes, Devahoowa comes under Matale district.
The 350 smaller tanks belong to five divisional secretariats. They are Polpithigama Divisional Secretariat (109 tanks), Maho Divisional Secretariat (104 tanks), Ehetuwewa Divisional Secretariat (90 tanks), Galewela Divisional Secretariat (11 tanks) and Dambulla Divisional Secretariat (1 tank).
Further, a myriad of lake clusters - each consisting of a parent lake and several infant lakes dependent on it  that are nestled in the Basins of Mee Oya, Hakwatuna Oya and Kalaa Oya, will come to life with the rejuvenating new water flow.
Most significant lake clusters are Maniggamuwa, Helembagahamula, Gallinda, Ehetuwewa, Ulpatha Wewa, Pahalakele Amuna, Polpithigama and Kataragama.
In addition to this, large-scale irrigation projects are scheduled to be started at the wake of Wayamba Canal. Some of them are Mahakithuala reservoir, Mahakiruala reservoir, Dambe reservoir and Wemedilla new sluice. And yes - three underground tunnels more than 500 metres in length will be built focusing the areas of Ranwediya, Nilagama and Mahakithula.
One of the key issues in this project is to be compliant with the Social Security Programme and Forestry Preservation Programme. Already, arrangements have been made to face the required standards.
National heritage
When implementing projects of this kind, a frequently observed shortcoming is that the vital components of Mother Nature tend to be ignored. But this time it is going to be different. Scientists and scholars are dedicated to the task of mitigating the impact on nature at all costs. All functions of the project are carried out according to the 2009 Social Security policies endorsed by the Asian Development Bank. This guarantees that the Wayamba Canal project will be closely monitored by ADB and will not proceed according to anyones whims or fancies.
Meanwhile, the Department of Archaeology has submitted a report on how this project will affect the archaeological sites in the project area and how to preserve them. The report has proposed to minimize the harm that the Wayamba Canal could bring on our national heritage. We should keep it in our mind that the Wayamba Canal is not a project that drowns our glorious history. It should carry water to the needy whilst protecting our regional values and cultural inheritance.
In brief, at the culmination of this project in 2024, the northern parts of the Kurunegala district will be provided with an annual water supply up to the capacity of the 105,000-acre foot. The total cost of the project is calculated at Rs. 30 billion. 13,000 families will directly (40, 000 families indirectly) benefit from this new water resource and 12,500 hectares of cultivable land will be well nourished with water.
The day we and our kids will watch and feel the seeping waters of Mahaweli across the paddy fields of Wayamba, which had been only a dream for the past generations, is not far. Each drop of that water will quench our thirst. Each drop of that water will enrich our lands. At last, our farmers will be able to stand up proudly as farmers. They will be beggars no more. As in the ancient times, they will again come to be treated as kings. Farming will no more be an ordeal.
We are waiting for that historical moment to scoop up a handful of crystal clear water that will soon reach us through the Wayamba Canal. Blessed with pirith chanting, the waters will no doubt bring prosperous times to the entire Wanni region.

MEPA writes to Indian HC over clinical waste issue
The Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) has written to the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka over the matter of Indias clinical waste polluting Puttalam coastal belt, MEPA General Manager Dr.Turney Pradeep Kumara said.
He told the Daily News yesterday that the MEPA is waiting for a response to the concerned raised by the MEPA in its letter, adding that the MEPA together with the Foreign Affairs Ministry will start diplomatic level discussions to control the environmental problem.
He pointed out that the MEPA has provisions to take legal action on this incident under the International Ocean Law, but first trying to mitigate the problem through discussion.
He noted that the MEPA investigations have proved that the majority of clinical waste found in the Puttalam coastline was from India, especially Kerala.
It could be due to floods in Kerala that the load of sea debris increased. However, we are not in a position to exactly say whether the clinical waste had been dumped or washed with the ocean currents. The labels in the clinical waste were proof that most of them were from India, he explained.
However, this is not a problem that could be solved overnight. Ocean currents are moving sea debris and India will have to take measures to reduce generation of such waste, he added.

Modi says sleeping elephant has woken up
INDIA: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday hailed Indias growing role in the world economy, calling it a sleeping elephant that has woken up, in a keynote national speech before a looming election campaign.
Modi spoke for more than 80 minutes from the ramparts of New Delhis 17th century Red Fort in the final Independence Day address of his five year term.
Modi used the spotlight to laud his governments achievements and announce that a massive health insurance scheme would be launched in September and India would send a manned mission into space by 2022.
The Prime Minister said that India was seen as one of the fragile nations before his nationalist party took power in a landslide in 2014.
India is now the land of reform, perform and transform. We are poised for record economic growth, the prime minister said.
Today the world says that the sleeping elephant has woken up, is walking and has joined the race, Modi added. India has seen annual economic growth of about 7.0 percent since he took over -- though the rupee is now under attack in the fallout from the Turkey lira crisis.
Modi, who is expected to call an election for early 2019, announced that an ambitious health insurance scheme -- providing annual cover of about $7,000 for 500 million Indians -- will be rolled out on September 25.
The scheme -- popularly known as Modicare -- has been described as the worlds biggest government health insurance initiative.
It is high time we ensured that the poor of India get access to good quality and affordable healthcare, he said.
The government health care initiatives will have a positive impact on 500 million Indians, Modi said, adding that it would cover the equivalent of the population of the 27 member European Union.
It is essential to ensure that we free the poor of India from the clutches of poverty in which they cannot afford health care, he added.
Adding to the nationalist tone, Modi said India will send a manned mission into space within four years.
India will send into space -- a man or a woman -- by 2022, before that if possible, Modi said adding that the chosen astronaut would be carrying the national flag.
Modi also highlighted his clampdown on corruption, bringing electricity to more Indian villages and his reform in introducing a single national goods and services sales tax. - AFP

More than meets the  eye!
Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. But what if the beholder has depressingly dark circles under his or her eyes Be it pollution, stress or sleepless nights of examination tension, you have enough reason to be worried about your appearance. Fortunately there are some simple and easy ways to avoid this issue. Follow these guidelines to rejuvenate your eyes.
Defining under eye dark circles
Simply put, perorbital dark circles are a result of the thin layer of skin below your eyes showing the blood vessels and the blood they contain more clearly than anywhere else on your body. (For reference, this skin around your eyelids, called perorbital skin, is on average about 0.5 mm thick compared to an average of about 2 mm thick on most of the rest of your body.)
Under eye dark circles and heredity
Hereditary dark circles under your eyes look just like other dark circles - they show up as round, uniform areas of darker skin underneath your eyes. The difference is that hereditary dark circles are determined by genetics, so while you can do things to make them look worse or better, you can't control whether or not you have them in the first place.
A few different types of dark circles may be hereditary. Most dark circles are caused by allergies, which can be hereditary.
When you rub your eyes to soothe irritation, you may be causing dark circles. Some people may also have more pigment beneath the eyes or slower vascular movement, also hereditary traits. Thin skin and pale skin, both hereditary traits, can also cause dark circles.
Best eye serum for under eye dark circles
Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides, and Humectants: these work to moisturize the delicate skin around the eyes. The periorbital area is a common area that dries and irritates easily, especially in women since we are applying multiple products daily. Therefore, keeping a strong skin barrier to this delicate area is crucial; Lightening products with kojic acid, glycolic acid, hydroquinone, vitamin c can be helpful. Products with hyaluronic acid can also help hydrate the skin, which can help with the under-eye appearance.
Products to use for eyepuffiness and to brightenunder the eyes
Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide): This vitamin not only calms down redness and inflammation but stimulates collagen production and increases free fatty acids in the skin to hydrate, tranexamic acid from lytera helps reduce pigmentation as well as phenylethyl resorcinol and niacinamide, tetrapeptide-30 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide, which all balance melanin production.
Under eye dark circle causes
l Sleep deprivation and tiredness: A lack of sleep or excessive tiredness results in pale skin, making blood under the skin become more visible and appear more blue or darker.
l Smoking and drinking: Late night parties, smoking and drinking can play havoc with your skin and result in dark eye circles. Dark eye circles could be a sign of loss of water from the body (dehydration) due to excessive drinking and intake of caffeinated drinks.
l Sun exposure: Increased exposure to the sun can draw pigmentation of the skins surface and create dark circles. Long sun exposure produces more melanin around eyes than usual, giving them a darker colour. There are two main layers of skin, the outer layer of skin known as epidermis and inner layer known as dermis. When excess melanin is being made in the epidermis it appears brown, and when there is more than usual melanin in the dermis it looks blue or blue grey.
l Hormonal changes: In women, the skin undergoes lots of changes during the phase of pregnancy and menstruation, causing darkening under the eyes.
l Allergies: Any condition that causes the eyes to itch may contribute to darker circles due to rubbing or scratching the skin around them. Apart from that, some food allergies can also cause the area under the eyes to appear darker. In fact, dark circles in children often indicate allergy problems. Research also suggests that dark circles are linked to anemia, and liver diseases.
l Anemia: Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of inexplicable dark circles in many cases, which can be treated by making simple changes in your diet. Low iron levels is the most common form of anemia, and results in poor oxygenation in body tissues due to low supply of oxygenated blood. Thus, always take a balanced diet rich in green leafy vegetable, dairy products and all types of fruits to keep your body healthy.
l Dehydration: Dehydration is one of the most common reasons for dark circles under the eyes. The reason is the close proximity to the skin underneath the eye in relation to the underlying bone. When the body does not have a proper amount of water, the symptoms are often evident in this specific area. Thus it is advisable to have at least 8 to10 glasses of water and include fresh fruit daily. It is also advisable to restrict the intake of caffeinated drinks such as tea, coffee, alcohol and other caffeinated drinks as it aggravates dehydration.

Mother foils hawks attempt to snatch child
A woman in Veluwanagama, Anuradhapura, prevented a hawk from snatching her seven-year-old daughter, by attacking it with an ekel broom on Tuesday.
The child, Devmini Amaya, had sustained injuries to her back and was later treated at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital.
A youth had then captured the hawk and handed it over to officers attached to the Anuradhapura Wildlife Assistant Director's Office. Officers said the bird was of the oriental honey buzzard species.
Villagers said the bird had attempted to snatch four other children the previous day.
The girl's mother, 30-year-old Ashoka Malani, said that she was sweeping their home garden while her daughter was playing when the incident occurred.
She added that the hawk had grabbed her daughter's back and attempted to peck her head.
Wildlife Range Officer Upali Jayawardena said that the bird probably came to the village in search of food due to the prevailing dry weather, adding that the bird would be soon released into a sanctuary.
A similar incident had occurred in 2015, when a mother of a seven-year-old boy had foiled the attempt of a hawk to snatch her son bathing in the Thuruwila tank in Hidogama.

Man of the Match at one-off T20I:
My dad is watching me at some point  Dhananjaya de Silva
Dhananjaya de Silva said that he missed his late dad Ranjan de Silva very much after winning his first Man of the Match award in the one-off T20 International against South Africa at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday.
De Silvas all-round contribution saw Sri Lanka pull of an exciting three-wicket win chasing 99 for victory.
My father used to watch almost every match. I am really sad but I believe, he might be looking at me at some point, said De Silva who lost his father, a Dehiwela-Mt Lavinia municipal councillor who was killed by unidentified gunmen in March this year.
De Silva won the Man of the Match award capturing the key wickets of Hashim Amla and JP Duminy and playing an important innings of 31 during Sri Lankas run chase putting together a partnership of 53 with Dinesh Chandimal after they had lost two wickets for six runs in the opening over.
He batted with so much ease having lots of time to play his shots against the likes of Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi.
It's totally due to our practices. We know that their bowling attack was more challenging so we challenged accordingly and some time on the granite and that helped a lot in facing them, De Silva said.
De Silva does not have a permanent slot in the one-day side (ODI & T20I) being shifted from opening the innings to batting as low as number nine.
I like to bat at a designated position because I was batting in the top four since my school days but when it comes to playing in the national team, I'll have to take it up as it comes.
Also it mostly depends on the situation. But, usually, before the series, I am informed about the place where I am going to bat. So its upto me to adjust and bat according to the team requirement. Some people see it difficult and even for me its difficult at times but by now, I'm used to it, he said.
OUR EXECUTION WAS WRONG  DUMINY
South Africas T20I captain Jean-Paul Duminy admitted that their execution was wrong and that led to their defeat.
If you look at all of the first four games, our approach was one of positive shot selection as a team. Most of the guys were playing sweeps and reverse sweeps but the interesting thing was that we executed, said Duminy.
When you dont execute like on a day today, its always going to look like: What happened It looked frantic. But in the bigger scheme of things, Im not disappointed. We had a game plan, but unfortunately it didnt work. There are lessons to be learnt no doubt. All in all Im happy about the options that we took. We just didnt execute.
Duminy said that to defend a total as small as 98 they had to capture wickets and they came quite close to achieving that.
I go back five years, I think we scored 115 here and defended it in a T20 game. In the back of my mind, I always knew there was a fighting chance. Sri Lanka had everything to lose at that stage in time, at the halfway period. They were expected to win the game, said Duminy.
All we could focus on was trying to take wickets. That was the only way we were going to win the game - try and take 10 wickets within 15 overs. That was always the angle. We got close in the end.
I said to the guys: If we can walk off the field knowing that we gave it our level best and tried to attack as best we could, and tried to take wickets every single ball, then we can walk off with our heads held high. We didnt know we didnt bat well enough. 30-40 runs was probably the difference between us winning the game and losing. Still a lot of positives to take away, he said.
Although his team lost Duminy said that he was not disappointed with the result.
We would like to have walked away with some success here in the last game. But for me the success is not the win or the loss. Its a building period for us in terms of the World Cup. Even though its a T20 game were trying to develop something within our squad - a different mindset and a different approach, said Duminy.
Theres going to be times when youre going to get it wrong. Today, unfortunately, we got it wrong. Our execution wasnt there. For me the mindset was good. We were in a positive frame of mind, looking to take the game on. If we go in with that kind of mindset and try to execute, more times than not were going to give ourselves the best chance going into a World Cup next year, he said.

## Title: Navy Sampaths arrest

Navy Sampaths arrest
Hettiarachchi Mudiyanselage Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, also known as Navy Sampath, wanted in connection with the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009, was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday.
The CID arrested him on Lotus Road, in Colombo, according to the Police Media Spokesmans office. He was produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court where Colombo Additional Magistrate Kanchana N. Silva granted permission to the CID to detain him on a 48-hour detention order, for questioning.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court had earlier issued arrest warrants for the arrest of the suspect for evading magisterial inquiry into the alleged abduction and murder case.
It was revealed that the suspect had been in hiding and working as a guard officer under the name Polwattage Gallage Ashoka, using a fake National Identity Card. He had been working as a security guard attached to an estate in Dompe, prior to his arrest. The arrest had been made by the OIC of the CIDs Organised Crimes Unit, Inspector Nishantha Silva.
Six accused including former Lieutenant Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi who were indicted over the murder of former TNA Jaffna district MP Nadaraja Raviraj had been acquitted and released in the case after they were found not guilty by the Colombo High Court. However, the state has now filed an appeal.
Navy Sampath, who previously served in the Sri Lanka Navy as a Lieutenant Commander, was wanted by the police in connection with the kidnapping for ransom, illegal detention and murder of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
The CID is currently investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths and several Navy personnel have been arrested in this connection, including the former Navy Spokesman D.K.P. Dassanayake.
The CID is investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths based on a written complaint by the then Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the DIG of the CID on May 28, 2009, against his personal security officer, then Lt. Commander Nilantha Sampath Munasinghe, following which the CID was able to uncover the Navys involvement in the abductions. Those abducted were Kasthuriarachchilage John Rit alias John, Rajiv Naganathan alias Malli, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Tillakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohomed Sajith, Jamamdeen Dilan, Amalan Leon, Roshan Leon, Antony Kasthuriarachchi, Thyagaraja Jegan and Mohomed Ali Anver alias Hajiya.
(Amalan Leons father, Stanley Leon, was also abducted in 2008 and is still missing. He had come to Colombo with his son and the foreigner Mike Ogan, to apply for a visa to the United Kingdom. They were staying at the Ramanadan Flats in Kotahena. On August 25, 2008, Amalan and Stanley were kidnapped by an unidentified armed group.)
The abduction
The CID had arrested retired Navy soldier Luthuwahandige Thushara Mendis on January 23 this year, in connection with the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008. He was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on January 24 and ordered to be remanded.
According to the CID, Mendis had served as the senior Master Chief Petty Officer in the Special Intelligence unit headed by Lieutenant Commander Sumith Ranasinghe, and had been involved in the abduction of Ali Anver in Katunayake. Ali Anver was an informant for this intelligence group. Mendis had also been part of the Navy Special Intelligence team that had taken the eight abducted youths to Gun Side, located within the Ocean Science Faculty premises of the Naval Command in Trincomalee, from where they were being held at the Naval camp in Chaithya Road, Colombo Fort.
A CID source told the Daily News that Mendis had been in charge of a boat which was providing support to this Special Intelligence team, especially in the disposal of bodies. He had served under Ranasinghe from 2008 to 2009, attached to the Parakrama Naval base.
CID investigations revealed that on October 17, 2008, the intelligence team had obtained an open warrant and raided a house near the Dehiwela Police Station and arrested five youths, including Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Thilakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohommed Jilan and Mohommed Saajith. The five youths were taken in their black Indigo car (KC 5565) and held at the Pittu Bambuwa jail under Lt. Commander Hettiarachchi.
However, during the period from December 31, 2008, to the end of March 2009, one of the abducted youth, Rajiv Naganathan had been in contact with his parents Govindasamy Naganathan and Sarojini Naganathan. The Navy soldiers guarding these abducted youths had lent them their mobile phones for them to contact their families.
The CID sources said that Ali Anver had been the informant to this special Navy team, but he too disappeared in 2009. However, it was revealed during the investigations that in fact, Rajiv Naganathan had told his parents that Ali Anver had also been arrested and he was being beaten up. The five boys had been later taken to Trincomalee by Mendis and Ranasinghe.
Further, the Indigo car had been taken to Giriulla by Thammitage Dharmadasa and Aluthgedara Upul Bandara, who had also given evidence. The duo were residents of Giriulla. Several soldiers too had given evidence confirming the detention of these youths. The CID source also added that they had obtained evidence that the Indigo car had later been handed over to the former Navy Spokesman Commander Dassanayake.
An NIC found at Sampath Munasinghes official residence was found to belong to Thiyagaraja Jegan, who was from Trincomalee. Jegan, who was working at a jewellery shop in Colombo 13, went missing in 2008.
The CID was able to get much useful information regarding the abduction when communicators attached to the Sri Lankan Navy Signal Corps, Aluthgedara Upul Bandara and Lakshman Udaya Kumara, who were working under Sampath Munasinghe, were questioned.
A mothers diary
According to police records, the abduction is said to have taken place on September 17, 2008.
Sarojini Naganathan, the mother of Rajiv Naganathan, had made several hurried notes in a diary during several secret phone conversations with her abducted son, that first makes mention of Dassanayake. While being held at Chaithya Road, a place locally known as Pittu Bambuwa after his abduction, the CID says Naganathan, calling his mother through a borrowed phone, was able to identify those holding him captive, as his mother noted the details down. Presented to the courts as evidence after being handed over to the CID for investigation, Sarojinis notes, quoting her son, mention that Commander Dassanayake who is to be made Captain, is here.
According to an investigating officer at the CID, these notes have helped investigators in uncovering details of Dassanayakes alleged link to the supposed extortion racket and abductions carried out by a group of Naval officers at the time. In fact Rajiv, in a series of calls, was able to provide valuable information regarding his whereabouts and captors to his mother, which has now greatly contributed to the investigations.
Dassanayake who was working as the Deputy Director of Operations at the time, was far more involved in these abductions than just being there, as mentioned by Sarojini.
The CID claims that Dassanayake was in fact aware that several of the abducted persons were being held captive at the Pittu Bambuwa.
According to the CID source, yet another suspect in the case, Lt. Commander Sampath Munasinghe, in his statement to the CID, maintained that Dassanayake was made aware, particularly, about the presence of Amalan Lyon and Roshan Lyon at the Pittu Bambuwa by him. The CID also claims that the Navy maintained files regarding the two, another fact known to Dassanayake.
Therefore, they say his knowledge regarding the captives led to his arrest under the charges of aiding and abetting the disappearance of the men.
Photographic evidence
Further to these facts and evidence presented in court, the CID says they are in possession of photographic evidence showing then Lt. Commander Sumith Ranasinghe, who was also arrested in connection with the case, along with Dassanayake and a number of sailors serving at Gun Side in Trincomalee, where the abducted youth were said to have been last held, and two other intelligence officers working under Dassanayake. According to the CID source, Dassanayake is part of the group photograph, in his capacity as an officer with authority to oversee them.
Meanwhile, the CID was also able to reveal that complaints were made to the department regarding alleged attempts by Dassanayake to intimidate Naval officers speaking to the investigators. Lt. Commander Welagedara and Sailor Upul Bandara complained to us of death threats made to them by him, the source claimed.
Since the beginning of the CID investigations in 2009 to probe the disappearances, the CID, along with other related parties, is said to have faced various obstacles, including non-cooperation by the Navy, and other interferences.
However, for the parents of the abducted youths, the wait for information about their children has been gruelling. In fact it has been nine long years since Sarojini Naganathan last saw her only son, Rajiv. The latter, along with four others, was abducted on September 17, 2008, a day before he was scheduled to leave for the United Kingdom for higher studies. Rajiv was a lover of animals, cricket and a studious child, Sarojini says, adding that she prays daily for his return and for the capture of all the perpetrators. Despite having last heard from her son in May 2011, she holds on to the belief that Rajiv is still being held in an undisclosed location.
My son is alive, but they are afraid to release him, she says, adding that it is as if life has stopped since Rajiv was taken from them. We spend our lives just waiting for our child to be returned to us. Having suffered a fate worse than death, having lost her only child, Sarojini says she is now fearless.
I will fight for justice and find my son in whichever way possible, she says, adding that she is pained by the callous statements made about her child by certain individuals.
My son was talented and educated, and would have served the country well if he was allowed to do his higher studies, she says, questioning if such a gifted child could be an LTTE sympathiser. They are spewing lies about these children she says.
Ransom demand
Recalling the past, Sarojini says, she herself had withdrawn money on that day, to give her son.
He wanted to treat his friends before leaving, she says, adding that he had then left with his friends. Having spoken to anyone possible to secure the release of her son, she says, a man calling himself Annachchi had kept calling her asking for Rs. 10 million as ransom in order to release Rajiv.
The tip-off on the economic situation of Rajivs family, to demand a ransom, was given to Munasinghe by Anver Ali, alias Haajiyar, who was in the intelligence service at the time. Anvar Ali is a resident of Dehiwala.
We told him we will pay, but just return the child, Sarojini says, adding that their pleas fell on deaf ears. Sarojini and her husband today continue to live in their family home visiting places of worship and the courts, focusing solely on the return of their son and justice for the wrong that was done to them. The mother of Thilakeshwaran, who was abducted along with Rajiv, passed away earlier this year, and Sarojini says the disappearance of her son greatly contributed to her failing health and eventual death.
The suffering and stress due to losing Rajiv too appears to have taken a toll on Sarojini and her husband. Despite failing health, the brave parents have vowed to fight for justice.
I can barely walk, but I will go anywhere and do anything to get justice for my son, she says, determinedly. However, according to Sarojini and attorney-at-law Achala Seneviratne representing the disappeared youths, more support is needed from the Attorney Generals Department and the other parties involved to ensure that justice is done.
Recalling the obstacles faced, Sarojini commended the CID for their tireless efforts, saying that she is thankful the case is now being heard by the courts regularly.
My child did no wrong to anyone and all of them were just students, she says, adding that due to her belief in God, she refuses to give up hope that one day she will once again see her son.

NO ROOM FOR RACISM, RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE - PM
Racism and religious intolerance will not be accommodated again, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said.
PM Wickremesinghe observed that some people are unfortunately spreading racism and religious animosity without nurturing empathy and kindness.
Both religious ceremonies held at Madhu Church and Kataragama Devalaya have created a road to reconciliation where people of the North travel to the southern part of the country and vice versa.
The Prime Minister made these observations participating in the annual Madhu Church Festival yesterday (15).
PM Wickremesinghe also handed over a donation of Rs.1 mn allocated by the Tourism and Christian Affairs Ministry for administrative purposes of Madhu Church.
The Annual Madhu Festival was concluded following the main mass conducted by Colombo Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith. Mannar Bishop Most Rev. Dr. Fidelis Lionel Emmanuel Fernando participated. Mannar District Secretariat and Madhu Divisional Secretariat facilitated Madhu devotees who arrived for the annual celebration.

Northern midwives told to wear new uniform despite Provincial Directors ban
All circulars issued by the Health Ministry are valid for the entire country. Accordingly, midwives serving in the Northern Province should wear their new uniform, despite the order given to them by the Provincial Director of Health Services not to wear it, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was addressing a meeting at the Health Ministry with the Midwives Association, recently.
The midwives expressed their satisfaction over the new uniform introduced to them. However, midwives serving in the Northern Province had informed the minister that they are unable to wear it due to the ban imposed by the Provincial Director of Health Services.
Minister Senaratne said all midwives must adhere to the rules and regulations of the Health Ministry.
A new training school for midwives will be opened at Yatadolawatte in the Kalutara district soon. A building complex at Yatadolawatte is now being used to train midwives.

ONUR launches radio drama on reconciliation
The Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) launched a radio drama series to help people reflect on national unity, empower them to be creative, and to encourage critical thinking in day-to-day issues faced by communities.
The radio drama series titled Kanata Paharak, produced by ONUR, is directed by Award Winning Script Writer and Director Malaka Dewapriya. Apart from the Saturday Night broadcasting of radio dramas, ONUR expects to broaden the coverage and promotion of radio dramas by sharing episodes with listeners through CDs, downloadable YouTube content and podcasts, the ONUR said in a press release.
At a time when it seems that with the advent of television and film, the trend of radio plays are lost, the ONUR hopes that this initiative will contribute towards a positive dialogue in society. People have come to believe that television and film is superior and that the visual language is more powerful. However, it is also a known fact that with regard to developing imagination, creativity, critical thinking and aesthetic knowledge, radio plays have been identified as an influential medium.
The collection in Kanata Paharak has 12 episodes including 10 Sinhala and two Tamil language plays.
The titles of the radio dramas are Tharuwan Saranai (Blessed by Star), Nihon Sepalebewa (May you attend comfort worldly life in Nihon), Alayaka Damanaya (Love Tamed), Nirabhishekana (Felicitation), Nirwasthran Paraman Sukhan (being nude is the best policy), Funsalak, Roma Roopana (Perform in Rome), Suwadena Agni (Soothing Fire), Rangadena Kapuwo (Trickster Matchmakers), Ekathana Kerakuma (Stagnation), ; Nawanalu Dahama (Tele Actor) and Bashmaanthara (interaction ).

Panasian Power posts record  growth in PAT for 1Q
Panasian Power PLC, one of Sri Lankas leading green energy solutions providers, posted a consolidated net profit of Rs. 99 million for the quarter ending 30th June 2018.
This represented an remarkable growth of 1380% compared to the same period last year. Revenue also grew during this period by 134% to reach Rs 177.7 million. Operating profit for the quarter increased to Rs 138.7 million from Rs 40.3 million during the same period last year.
These stellar results were attributed to contributions from the Padiyapelella, Manelwala and Rathganga mini hydropower plants, both of which have Standardised Power Purchase Agreements (SPPA) with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to supply all of the energy generated to the national grid. The period under review also saw Panasian Power record its first solar power income. The company was also able to increase margins during the quarter by exercising prudent cost control practices which brought down direct expenses and finance costs. This resulted in direct expenses of Rs 19.5 million compared to Rs 22.9 million during the same period last year and a finance cost of Rs 25.8 million compared to Rs 33.6 million during the same period last year.
Commenting on these strong results Dr Prathap Ramanujam, Chief Executive Officer  Panasian Power, said, This monumental growth is validation of the steps we took last year to aggressively seek bottom line growth as well as the many processes put in place to reduce overall costs. We fully expect these figures to improve further over time as power generation increases at the plants and with greater contribution coming from our solar power investments. With several solar projects in the pipeline, as part of our continued energy diversification plans, and as we continue to explore new opportunities both here and abroad, we are that much closer to realizing our ultimate goal of securing a clean energy future.
Speaking about the companys future Pathmanatha Poddiwala, General Manager and Executive Director  Panasian Power, said, We have already begun construction on another 900 Kw rooftop solar plant in Kelaniya and a 1 MW ground solar plant is expected to begin construction during the second quarter of this financial year. Furthermore, we have entered into an agreement to build and operate a 2.9 MW rooftop solar plant in the Kurenegala district which is expected to be commissioned during the third quarter of this financial year.

Parents Union of the State Medical Students waiting to meet President
The Parents Union of the State Medical Students is waiting for an appointment with President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the issue of the Eastern University Medical Faculty, the Unions Media Spokesperson Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the President has given several opportunities for the parents of SAITM students to hold discussions with him, and also provided scholarships and other facilities for the SAITM students to enter the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). However, the Parents Union of the State Medical Students is still waiting for an appointment from him even after making several requests, he said.
According to Alwis, funds required for the proposed Medical Faculty at the Eastern University were received several years ago from the Kuwait Government. However, the project has not commenced yet. Several requests were made to the President to obtain an appointment to discuss the issue, but we did not receive the opportunity yet, he said.
Everything has been done to ensure the welfare of the SAITM students but qualified medical students in state universities and parents still suffer because of the struggle they launched against injustice. The Law and Order Minister had broken his pledge to remove all cases filed against them. Meanwhile, efforts are being made now to sell the MBBS degree through state medical faculties for 62,500 US Dollars, he added.
