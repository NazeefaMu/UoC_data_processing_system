Basel III to increase capital pressure on Lankan banks - Fitch
Sri Lankan banks are likely to come under increased capital pressure from Basel III-related requirements that take full effect at the start of 2019, Fitch Ratings says.
Fitch expects that most banks will have to raise capital to meet the higher requirements, particularly if they are pursuing rapid growth.The sectors capital needs could be exacerbated by deteriorating asset quality following aggressive lending in 2015/2016 to more vulnerable segments, such as retail and SMEs, the effects of the recent floods and weak internal capital generation. Our negative outlook on the Sri Lankan banking sector reflects these pressures, although banks have coped with the deterioration in the operating environment and loan book growth could keep non-performing loan ratios around current levels.
Capitalisation is thin at state banks due to substantial dividend pay-outs. In 2016, the three largest state banks (National Savings Bank, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka)) paid 76% of their profits as dividends. Their capital levels are vulnerable to dividend demands from the state, and continued high pay-outs in the absence of capital infusions could leave them struggling to meet regulatory capital requirements.
Rapid loan growth by the private banks exceeding their rate of internal capital generation has weakened capital ratios. The sectors average Tier 1 capital ratio declined to 11.4% at end-2016 from 13.0% at end-2015, following high loan growth of 21.1% and 17.5% in 2015 and 2016, respectively, despite several contractionary monetary policy measures.
Sri Lankan banks may start issuing Basel III-compliant debt instruments once clarification on the tax treatment of interest from listed debt securities is obtained.
The government proposed removing this tax relief in its November 2016 budget, but a final decision has not been made.

Beautiful, and completely guilt-free!
Everyone, at least once in a while, eats a depressing homemade salad, whether at their desk in work or from the confines of their own kitchen.
But a new cafe, in Naygowa, Japan, hopes that people would find a plate filled with wilting rocket and tomato slightly less depressing if it looked like a beautiful cake.
Food stylist Misuki Moriyasu first came up with the idea for so-called salad cakes (which are basically salads that look like cakes), and her idea has been so popular that a cafe selling them, The VegieDeco Cafe, is slated to open this month.
How a salad cake works is that basically in lieu of traditional icing, the cakes are glazed with either tofu or cream cheese, before they are blended with vegetables to make them look like frosting.
The cakes may look devilish, but they are in fact extremely healthy - simply speaking, they are nutritious salads disguised as tasty cakes.
The cakes contain whole vegetables in them, while the sponge part of the lunch is created using natural ingredients like soybean flour.
The so-healthy-it-hurts cafe is set to open on April 5, and it will feature a number of superfoods, including low carbohydrate ingredients and gluten-free items.
Little or no sugar is added to each salad and there is a focus on health and beauty, with roots and peels also thrown into the mix to maximise the health benefits of each dish.
While they are certainly beautiful, and there is an intricate level of attention to detail in every single salad available, these cakes may fall short of your regular sweet batter, if youre expecting them to deliver a typical cake-y sugar rush.
However, they are a new, and nutritious way of pepping up your normally boring midday meal.
And best of all, unlike their chocolate counterparts, they come guilt free.
Following a seasonal menu, the VegieDeco cafe is sure to become a favourite haunt of the health-conscious in Japan in days to come.

## Title: Black and White: A new trend - Did you watch Fury Road 
## Supertitle:

Black and White: A new trend - Did you watch Fury Road 
The mother of all road movies, George Millers visionary reboot of the Mad Max franchise 30 years after the original Mad Max, is one of the grittiest movies ever made. Watching Fury Road is such a visceral, even ethereal experience primarily because of its judicious use of colour in all the right ways. From the crimson desert traversed by the weird vehicles to the elaborately ornate clothes worn by the protagonists, Fury Road is a riot of colour. Can you think of seeing Fury Road any other way
Well, apparently director Miller did. He decided to strip the colour away layer by layer and do a Black and Chrome version of Fury Road. Just when you begin to think that Fury Road would be reduced to a colourless grey void by taking the multitude of colours away, Miller has done exactly the opposite  the Black and Chrome version breathes new life to the movie, making it an almost entirely different one. Moody, atmospheric and even more surreal, this is the version to watch if you are new to the movie. (Check out the new blu-ray edition which includes the Black and Chrome version without delay).
A painstaking process
Regarding Fury Roads coloring and de-coloring, Miller had this to say:
One thing Ive noticed is that the default position for everyone is to de-saturate post-apocalyptic movies. Theres only two ways to go, make them black-and-white , the best version of this movie is black-and-white, but people reserve that for art movies now. The other version is to really go all-out on the color. The usual teal and orange thing Thats all the colors we had to work with. The deserts orange and the sky is teal, and we either could de-saturate it, or crank it up, to differentiate the movie. Theres something about black-and-white, the way it distills [Fury Road], makes it a little more abstractlosing some of the information of color makes it somehow more iconic.
Not to be outdone, well-known director Peter Mangold has gone down the same road with his directorial effort Logan, the superhero flick where Hugh Jackman a.k.a. The Wolverine hangs up (withdraws) his claws for good after 17 long years of saving the world. (This should make Logan the last X-men film, but you cannot make accurate predictions on movies).
Mangold did choose colour for shooting Logan, Wolverines swan song, but took some black and white stills for promotional use while filming was on. Little by little, Mangold realised that Logan could have been entirely shot in black and white.
Of course, by that time it was too late to do anything about it and the film was released in colour. Then he hit upon the brilliant idea of converting it to Black and White in post-production. The result is the absolutely stunning Logan Noir, which you can check out in 2160p 4K on the Ultra HD blu-ray and 1080p high definition on the normal blu ray. There was also a limited run of Logan Noir in select theatres in the US only. The Noir version is included on separate discs as a no-cost extra, so you have nothing to lose.
Noir has two meanings  Noir means black in French and since this is a black and white version, the name fits perfectly.
The other meaning or dictionary definition is in fact more apt for Logan Noir - a genre of crime film or fiction characterized by cynicism, fatalism, and moral ambiguity. Logan is very much an anti-superhero movie since it has no heroics  just the painful struggle of two heroic men (Logan and Professor X played by Patrick Stewart) who know the best years of their lives are behind them. Logan is a revelation in Noir form, to the extent that some critics now say the film should not be seen in any other way.
But de-colourising a movie is no mean feat. Try turning the colour all the way down on your LCD TV and see what happens  the picture becomes an unwatchable muddy mess.
Thus it is simply not a matter of taking the colour(s) away. It is a science as well as an art. Colours have to be graded according to what shades they should represent in black and white terms. Contrast, brightness and black levels all have to adjusted for the monochrome version, lest some scenes appear to be washed out. It is a painstaking process that can take days, if not weeks, even with the best computing and editing equipment. Needless to say, not every movie works well in glorious black and white and these should be left untouched in the colour department.
The monochrome route
This trend of re-grading color movies into black-and-white first started with Frank Darabont, who claimed that he always wanted to shoot his Stephen King adaptation The Mist in atmospheric black & white but the studio forced him to use color for commercial reasons. The DVD release of Darabonts The Mist included a two-disc special edition with an exclusive black-and-white cut of the film.
That [it doesnt look real], to me, is what makes black-and-white so very cool. No, it doesnt look real. Film itself [is a] heightened recreation of reality. To me, black-and-white takes that one step further. It gives you a view of the world that doesnt really exist in reality and the only place you can see that representation of the world is in a black-and-white movie, says Darabont.
Even King admitted that watching The Mist, which is a horror film, in Black and White was an exciting experience. You can catch the Black and White version of The Mist on the collectors edition blu-ray released in 2008.
There is a film which actually begins in colour and ends in black white - Sympathy for Lady Vengeance by Park Chan Wook. This version is appropriately called the Fade to Black and White version. Bong Joon Ho also took the monochrome route for his acclaimed movie Mother which was initially released in colour.
These movies are somewhat difficult to find on the Web, though.
There are some surprising entries too in the monochrome game. Raiders of the Lost Ark in Black and White, anyone The monochrome version of the Steven Spielberg classic is not available commercially, but it was uploaded to the Net by fellow director Steven Soderbergh through his blog Extension 765. He also changed much of the music to match the black and white mood. Lets hope that this one too gets a blu-ray or DVD release.
Of course, a very few movies are still originally made in black and white. The Oscars best picture winner The Artist (2011) is the most recent movie that comes to mind (this movie was also silent) while monochrome Schindlers List won the same award in 1993. Ed Wood, Pleasantville, Mutual Appreciation, Control, In Search of a Midnight Kiss, the White Ribbon and Tabu are some of the well known Black and White movies made during the last 20 years. If colour can be turned into black and white, why not do the opposite  Indeed, colorization is a thing. Black and white films can be turned into colour by computer, but there are only a few examples for well-made colourised movies.
The best example is Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life. The colourised version of one of the most uplifting movies ever made is available on Paramounts Platinum Anniversary Edition blu-ray.
Hundreds of films have now been colourised and most are available on DVD or blu ray. Both versions of the film are always offered, so you will be able to elect what version you want to watch.
Colourisation is not so bad as it is made out to be. Technology gives us the ability turn black and white to colour and vice versa, but the final verdict still lies with the viewer.

Campaign to improve quality of parliamentarians
There is widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of the Yahapalana Government. While the establishment of an Independent Judiciary and the Independent Commissions, Regaining of GSP etc are all noteworthy achievements, the public is yet disillusioned with regard to its efforts on fighting corruption, misuse of power and progress on settling the National Question.
The Governments failure is mostly due to the poor quality of our elected representatives, who are expected to support and give leadership to settle these outstanding promises made by the President and Prime Minister to the people at the last election. Most of them are only interested in their own well-being. While we cannot change the quality and character of our existing representatives, we should at least prevent such poor quality representatives entering Parliament in the future.
Answer to this problem lies with the leadership of every political party  particularly their Election Nomination Boards. If the Nomination Boards do not act according to the selection criteria to be collectively developed by all those interested in ensuring a clean and efficient good governance for our country, the members of Nomination Boards should be personally targeted by Civil Societies nationally as well as in their respective electorates with the aim of defeating them at the next election. This threat should be made well in advance.
Criteria for nomination
(a) No criminal record including election malpractice.
(b) Not a Tax Defaulter and free of any investigation on disproportionate asset accumulation.
(c) Necessity to file an Asset/liabilities Statement.
(d) Minimum educational qualification  A/Level or equivalent. Exemption to those with over five years experience as an elected member of a Local Body.
(e) Dual Citizens to be ineligible.
(f) Should have a clean public image.
Civil Society should take over this question and take it to a satisfactory conclusion without delay. The major parties in particular should not be given any opportunity to ignore the proposed criteria for selection/nomination.

The Russian School of Ballet which took its initial steps with only four students in 2001 has now flourished into a full-fledged institute that promotes classical ballet. The school holds ballet classes for students from 3 to 17 years, and holds annual examinations conducted by ballet artistes from Moscow.
Its a joy to see our little girls who took their first steps in ballet with us 16 years ago, grow up to be graceful, poised and confident young ladies. The Russian School of Ballet not only teaches its students the art and technique of ballet as a form of dance, but also endeavours to build confidence, sportsmanship and grace among the students, said the organizers.
Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Alexander Karchava and other guests participated.

Djokovic crashes as Nadal, Murray move on
PARIS, Wednesday: Defending champion Novak Djokovic crashed out of the French Open on Wednesday, sparking fresh fears over his appetite for the sport he once dominated as Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray made the semi-finals.
World number two Djokovic slumped to a stunning 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-0 quarter-final loss to Dominic Thiem for his earliest exit in Paris in seven years.
Nadal, chasing a 10th Roland Garros title, will face 23-year-old Thiem after making the last four without breaking sweat.
He was 6-2, 2-0 up on Pablo Carreno Busta when his Spanish compatriot quit with an abdominal injury.
Friday's other semi-final will pitch world number one Murray, the runner-up to Djokovic in 2016, against 2015 champion Stan Wawrinka.
Murray made the semi-finals for the fifth time with a 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/0), 6-1 win over Japanese eighth seed Kei Nishikori.
Wawrinka became the oldest French Open semi-finalist in 32 years when he brushed aside Marin Cilic 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.
Djokovic, who had brought in Andre Agassi as coach in an effort to boost his flagging career, hinted he may step back from the sport to regroup even with Wimbledon fast approaching.
"Trust me, I'm thinking about many things, especially in the last couple months," he said.
"At the same time, I have responsibility to the game itself, towards others. We'll see. Obviously it's not an easy decision to make, but I will see how I feel after Roland Garros and then decide what to do next."
Wednesday's defeat to Thiem was Djokovic's first straight-sets loss at a major in four years and comes just 12 months after he completed the career Grand Slam in Paris.
He then also held all four majors and became the first man to break the $100 million prize money barrier.
Wednesday saw him suffer a first 6-0 'bagel' at a Slam since the 2005 US Open while the defeat will see him slip out of the world's top two for the first time in six years.
"All the top players go through this. It's a big challenge but I am up for it," said Djokovic who was also runner-up in Paris in 2012, 2014 and 2015.
Thiem had lost to the Serb in the semi-finals last year and took just one game in a straight-sets loss in Rome in May.
His shock quarter-final victory was his first in six meetings with the 12-time major winner.
Austrian sixth seed Thiem is the only man to beat Nadal on clay this year -- his Rome quarter-final success offsetting losses in the final in Barcelona and Madrid.
"It's going to be the toughest match you can imagine," admitted the 23-year-old.
Fourth seed Nadal recorded his 100th best-of-five-sets victory on clay -- from just 102 matches.
He will be playing in his 10th semi-final in Paris and has made it having lost just 22 games through five matches. Bjorn Borg surrendered just 32 games on his way to the 1978 French Open, but Nadal insisted he has no interest in such records.
"I don't know how many games I lost this year, but I really don't care about this. I only care that I am in the semi-finals," said Nadal.
Murray advanced to his fourth straight semi-final in Paris, defeating Nishikori to avenge his loss to the Japanese star at the US Open last year.
The Scot set up a semi-final rematch with third seed Wawrinka after beating the Swiss in four sets at the same stage a year ago.
"He's played fantastic this tournament so far," Murray said of the 32-year-old, the oldest Roland Garros semi-finalist since Jimmy Connors in 1985.
Like Nadal and Thiem, Wawrinka has not lost a set on his way to a third successive semi-final at Roland Garros.
"It was perfect today, I'm very satisfied," said reigning US Open champion Wawrinka after a 12th win in 14 meetings with Cilic.  AFP

Fine Furniture opens refurbished showroom at Nawala
Fine Furniture opened the refurbished new showroom recently at Nawala Road with a huge investment with 14 luxury European brands.
Martin Klement, Co Founder of Fine Furniture speaking to Daily News Business said that they have invested extensively for Fine Furniture at Nawala. "We are introducing some luxury European brands to Sri Lanka and now we have expanded to over 15,000 square feet of the showroom. We have every product that customer requires, he said.
Martin Klement, a former structural engineer and his partner Niluka Klement, in a brief period of three and a half years have successfully established a new benchmark for luxury living in Sri Lanka and raised the bar vis a vis customer expectations and service .
At Fine Furniture we promote the concept of investing in long-lasting, quality products with outstanding design, function and performance for a new way of living, said Klement.
He promises his clientele a one stop shop that caters to the changing lifestyles and demands of todays sophisticated consumer, providing an experience hitherto not encountered in Sri Lanka.
According to Klement the renovations which are currently ongoing have entailed a considerable investment which he says further underlies his commitment to Sri Lanka and his desire to bring the very best of European lifestyle products to the country.
When we started Fine Furniture a few years ago, it was answering an obvious need for great kitchens, luxury interior products and furniture that represents the lifestyle of the upwardly mobile, modern Sri Lankan and Sri Lanka responded to us exceptionally! Furthermore with the real estate boom which has resulted in several international developers such as Clearpoint Residencies, Destiny, and Shangrila etc, flocking to Sri Lanka, not forgetting local entrepreneurs Blue Mountain and Achilleion, the need for furniture and fittings of an international standard have increased exponentially; hence our decision to expand and upgrade, said Klement.
At Fine Furniture whether your style is down to earth, creative, purist or romantic, the possibilities for creating an individual style are endless. Our exclusive partnerships with some of the most luxurious European home brands such as Koinor, Pacific Green, Flexa, Loddenkemper, Alpa Salotti, Hcker Kitchens German Made, Bosch, Miele, Brandt, Bovictus Metaltex, Eurographic and Masterlight have made us the obvious choice for total home solutions, said Klement.
Today, Fine Furniture occupies a niche in the local market for superior and luxury furniture and fittings and has established a whole new paradigm for luxury living spaces in Sri Lanka.

The collapse of a two storey building in Ginigathena recently was due to poor construction and not because of an earth slip, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) said yesterday.
The two storey building caved in and later completely collapsed at Peragahamula, Ginigathena last Tuesday.
There were heavy damages to Hatton  Colombo Road as a result and vehicle movement had to be restricted to one lane.
A private business was operating at this site.
The authorities took measures to evacuate several families living close to the building.
NBRO officer Samantha Bogahapitiya after investigating the incident said that the building had been poorly constructed and the cave in had happened to structural deficiencies.
He also noted that the NBRO will conduct further studies in the area to see whether there was a threat to those residing close to the affected site.

Gone are the buggy days
When we emerge from mothers body we come not only with life but also with capabilities may be with a flair for something or more or a cleverness of some form. It is to develop those abilities that we learn in schools on wishful disciplines. Education is incomplete without a vocational training. Practical knowledge and experience is an absolute necessity for a person to become a practician or a practitioner. The maxim, Little education is dangerous is a wisecrack known to all of us and often talked of when somebody fails to perform to required standards.
One must become dexterous and conscientious once theoretical and practical lessons are completed and show proof of competency before an examiner or a panel of them to obtain certification as a qualified or a competent individual on a respective discipline.
This applies to all people and all professions. Climbing coconut trees for plucking and tapping is a profession. If a coconut plucker cum tapper is not skillful he will fall to death halfway while climbing up or down or when moving from the peak of a tree to another on ropes. Likewise, if a person is not an experienced (skill or knowledge gained by practicing) driver, he will crash, kill, devastate and explode himself. The aforesaid clich has been declared by the wise to predict this outcome owing to this inadequacy, the inadequacy of the know-how and the expertise of any profession to have a claim for professionalism, to say in other words.
In an era eight decades ago, when our principal mode of transport was the buggy cart pulled by a bull and the dual purpose single-bullock and the double-bullock carts were hauled on gravel paths and subsequently on few macadamized roads in villages gradually turning in to townships, driver training in this country started in a small scale by few individuals who owned discarded cars sold to them by the British who monopolized in the importation of brand new cars exclusively for their use.
Disciplined elderly people
In those former times, the owner - father taught the son to drive otherwise he was sent to be trained by an experienced person in the village, not the daughter, because, unlike today, the females were barred as religions, cultures, customs and traditions did not permit their pursuance of such activities on the belief that those harmed their modesty which our ancestors and our elders continuously treasured as precious than their lives. That was a belief come to pass from primordial times sadly overlooked by the present day gyna sapiens of Sri Lanka.
The people to whom their sons were referred to were well disciplined elderly people reputed as master drivers. They were tough and tenacious. The trainees who failed to toe the line were dealt with instantaneously and had to bear the pains of knocks on the head or squeezed ears at every mistake or even a dressing down sometimes in vituperative language had to be listened to.
These punishments were not intended to harass them but to insist on them to be attentive to the lessons. Those rigorous lessons mixed with strict discipline made the youth of a by-gone era to be on their toes as long as they were at the wheels. The trainer became the guru (teacher) and the trainee became the gola (pupil). The guru and gola combination went on honourably for several generations. The trainee underwent training with due respects to the trainer. The trainer offered a proper course of training to the humble and obedient trainee to gain knowledge and experience, to pass the examination on merits, find employment as a professional, to be useful to the society and do well in life.
As time went on, with the commencement of large and vast development programmes, rapid urbanization, industrialization and modernization of the country when driving of vehicles and operation of machines became a necessity, the demand for drivers and operators for engagement in industries arose. At his stage, driver training became a business for those who were competent in the trade. So, they opened their own training centres but, they couldnt proceed on a straight forward journey owing to an unexpected bottleneck.
The examiners of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles solicited gratifications to certify trainees as competent drivers. As such, they had no alternative but, to continue reluctantly in connivance with them. With the passage of time, it became a well known secret, a practice descending from several generations and even at this juncture this corrupt practice is in operation about which the attention of the government is also being drawn at present.
The training given to the Learners by the so-called instructors who identify themselves also as Learners is a cheap one negotiated by coming in to contact and entering in to verbal contracts with prospective trainees in a foxy way offering incredible easy payment terms with an assurance of quick training with no inconveniences to undergo.
Caught in their razzmatazz, after a training given during few hours in a few days and after a test ride with the so-called Examiners of the Department of Registrar of Motor Vehicles, the trainees get the certificates of competence from The Learners and from then onwards, the learners become drivers and wise guys on the road. Are these people teachers of an up and coming generation or are they arch-enemies It is left to the authorities concerned to decide whether going for a ride in the outer circular road at Kadawata for a few hours during a few days is sufficient training and experience for a beginner to drive on a highway or even in the backyard of a house.
Like The Learners, next came in the yesteryear, the Private Security Services and recently, the School Bus Services run by individuals. Initially, vans were hired by groups of parents to send their children to schools as they found their children suffered great inconveniences when travelling in public and private buses. This system too, like The Learners and the Security Services spread in the length and breadth of the country and became a brisk business. When time went on complaints began to pour in about wrong doings by The Learners, mismanagement and malpractices in the security services and about un-roadworthy vehicles transporting children and, molesting and raping of children by school bus drivers.
Driver training schools
The state intervened in response to complaints against them and made it compulsory for them to get registered with the relevant authorities. The Private Security Services are covered by the Wages Boards Ordinance from several decades ago. The Learners and the School Bus Services are not regulated hence those who depend on them are inhumanly deprived of services expected of them in return for an agreed payment. The Learners do not give a proper training. The school buses are not regular in service. Whilst the passed out drivers doesnt know even to park a vehicle on the correct side, the schoolchildren are compelled to find alternative means of transport owing to unexpected absence of buses transporting them. These are two major shortcomings among the many to describe if space is available here. The state therefore must regulate these two organizations forthwith.
The Sri Lanka Transport Board has a Driver Training School. It is open to all but, patronization is less because The Learners who dominate in the field tower over the Training School in connivance with the trainers of the Sri Lanka Transport Board. Their interference has prevented a majority from joining the Driver Training School of the Board which awards a certificate of competence recognized the world over.
When this vexed question was discussed at length by the media, specially the Daily News in the lead in the past and, during the previous regime too, there was a plan to establish a Driver Training Institute with Japanese aid. It did not materialize as the people rejected that government and elected this government in 2015.
Since we gained independence and began to rule our country by ourselves we had the ugliest habit of discontinuing what a previous regime failed to complete and the elected governments to do what they preferred under their policies. But, fifty two years after, we saw a change in the year 2000. The United National Party before 2005 had in its plans inter alia to develop the southern province creating an airport at Weerawila and a harbour at Hambantota. It couldnt do it as it was rejected by the people in 2005. But, the next government in 2005 did not discard that plan. It implemented it with changes like taking the airport from Weerawila to Mattala giving a hearing to the people. Though Mattala Air port and Hambantota harbour were created, it lost its power in 2015 before it could build up other facilities needed around the airport and the harbour. When the United National Party came to power in 2015 in amalgamation with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, it did not discontinue it. Its true that it took some time for it to study the plans that existed, financial involvements et cetera in detail, make necessary amendments and then, to continue. They have begun work now. This is actually a very great change in Sri Lankan politics and this is the change the people wanted. This is a praiseworthy move.
In the same manner, the existing government must think about establishing a Driver Training Institute to train and pass out drivers replacing the examiners of the R.M.V. who are an untrustworthy venal community. The Learners can continue to train the learners but, the learners must pass a test at the DTI to obtain the Certificate of Competence. If they fail at the trials at the DTI they must undergo training at the DTI to qualify for a certificate of Competence. In such instances, they will have to get enrolled in the DTI to follow its course of training.
Road rules
When mannerly people are passed out from the DTI with an experience in driving, knowledge in motor mechanism, road rules, the etiquette and so forth, we will have a gentle class of drivers day by day to replace the road hogs. The present day drivers do not have a knowledge to attend to running repairs. They do not have a tool to replace a punctured tyre by the spare wheel. They go begging for tools from garages to tyre shops and people when broken down with stranded passengers. Are they drivers
The DTI must be established towards Namunukula in the hill country for training to be given on roads there. Training given in the level country has proved fruitless. Intake must be in batches giving full board in the hostel of the DTI. Its in the mid and up country roads the drivers have to ascend and descend on narrow paths negotiating precipitous bends, not in the level country. These are the roads that made the drivers there to be cautious, patient, careful and cooperative while in motion. The care they take when they go past other vehicles and the observance of road rules until they reach their destinations safely are exemplary and praiseworthy. And, the hair-raising art of negotiating hairpin bends cautiously displaying the mindfulness of a drivers responsibility on roads having precipices on both sides of the roads is exciting to watch. Seldom an accident occur in the hill side.
But, in the hazard free level country with more than sufficient spacious roads built to ultra modern specifications under space age technologies its havoc we witness all over the country day in and day out causing indignation and disgust. The roads in the level country have become tracks for motor racing and speed contesting by the Tempters victims.
These days, practically every day in the morning, in the forenoon, in the afternoon, in the evening and at night we read in the print media, hear in radio broadcasts and view and hear in telecasts endless reports on horrific incidents of vehicle collisions all over the country.
Media institutions
I feel the media institutions in our country are overburdened with news and views of these horrendous incidents that they appear to be suffering from a shortage of space in their broadsheets to publish and time for the broadcasters and telecasters to narrate their tales and tales of woe of the victims.
If you observe you will hear and see lengthy reports read one after the other at a stretch in televisions in the same breath in an accelerated speed against time, showing pictures of crashed and crushed vehicles of different shapes and sizes and horrific scenes of the profusely bleeding and critically injured, the sinking and the dead. When all these news are bombarded on us daily via these modes in this manner about this kind of terrorism led by the Grim Reaper, we, the flabbergasted citizens of Sri Lanka have become cataplectic listening to Cliffhangers after cliffhangers.
It appears that liberalization under the unity government for good governance has exceeded limits that those who live irresponsible and immoral lives have mistaken liberty to behave with undue freedom. The sequence of occurring accidents are so frequent, tragic and mournful, safety of people on road is at stake. The pedestrians on tenterhooks are of the view that this lamentable situation must be brought under control forthwith and, egg on the government to do so.

Government institutions lack equipment to be used in emergency situations: Handunnetti

JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday in Parliament that relevant government institutions lack, generators and water bowsers to be used in emergency situations.
Handunetti was moving an adjournment motion on the recent flood and landslide havoc in the country.
The Parliament facilitated nine and half hours debate on the disaster situation extending the sitting time till 8pm yesterday.
Oral questions and questions under the Standing Orders 23 (2) usually taken up at the commencement of sittings were postponed and the debate continued without a lunch break to facilitate more time for the debate.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the sitting time was extended as many members wanted to speak at the debate.
MP Handunnetti who moved the motion said many areas were flooded since the river banks are not properly maintained.
He urged the Government to build anicuts at necessary places and invest money on new technological equipment such as Watermasters which are used for dredging, piling and raking.
The MP also said that the families evacuated due to landslides are resettled in same risky places.
He said Morawakakanda and Ayagama are examples for this claim.
He also said the Government would need Rs 8,886 million to pay compensation for the lost lives and fully damaged houses.

Grow trees to reduce natural disasters - Sadaharitha Plantations
Sri Lanka is desperately trying to find solutions to prevent floods and drought that have had catastrophic consequences for the people living in the affected areas.
However, the answer is actually quite simple. Commercial Forestry will significantly help to reduce natural disasters that come in the wake of torrential monsoon rains.
The green canopy will also prevent the ground from becoming dry and arid when the rains cease and there is a long dry spell.
BBC recently announced that according to new research, planting trees around rivers would reduce flooding by at least 20%.
Planting trees round a feeder stream can slow the rush of rainwater and save properties from flooding. The report - from the universities of Birmingham and Southampton - says that with increased building on flood plains and climate change increasing the risk of heavy rain, many places cannot be completely protected by walls of concrete.
While this research finding does not have direct relevance to Sri Lanka, Sadaharitha Plantations, the leaders in commercial forestry in the country, would encourage landowners to invest in growing forests as a means of investment that will prove to be lucrative in many years to come while helping to safeguard the environment.
The company recently invited landowners in the low country wet zone area where the climate is conducive to commercial forestry to team up with it, if they have over five acres to invest, in areas such as Kandy, Kurunegala, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Galle, Matara, Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara.
In return, Sadaharitha Plantations will provide free plants, technical support and advisory services including the companys patented CA Kit that helps agarwood trees to develop the sought-after resin required by perfume manufacturers in the world.
Once a landowner signs a memorandum of understanding and enters into a joint venture with Sadaharitha Plantations, the advantages that are in store for the investor includes the value of the land increasing considerably, together with a high return on the investment in a period of eight years as the company will help to harvest the forest as well as utilise the export potential of the harvested resin to the maximum.
This unusual opportunity is offered at the request of several investors of agarwood forests who see the potential commercial forestry has for Sri Lanka. At Sadaharitha, we have our own forestry lands; yet the production is not enough to cater to the demand in the international market.
Therefore we are confident that landowners with lands in the low country wet zone areas will welcome this lucrative opportunity that helps to promote a clean and healthy country in an environmentally friendly manner while boosting Sri Lankas economy, said the Chairman of Sadaharitha, Sathish Navarathna.
Sadaharitha Plantations is the only company in the country with expertise and passion to promote commercial forestry. It has over 2,000 acres of forestry with over 26,000 customers and will soon be celebrating 15 years of establishing the business of commercial forestry in Sri Lanka.

Have a banana peel 
You probably have been throwing banana peels till now, so this is going to be a shocker for you. Many people in India have been using banana peels to many advantages for decades now. Not only banana peel is edible but it also holds many benefits. These peels are full of anti-fungal compounds, antibiotic agents, fibre, nutrients and other health-enhancing properties.
Here are 10 healthy reasons why you should eat banana peels:
Good for depression:
Banana peels are packed with serotonin, a chemical that helps in boosting your mood and makes you feel good. According to a study at the University of Taiwan, if you consume two banana peels for three days continuously, your serotonin level will increase by 15 per cent.
Lowers Cholesterol:
Banana peels are full of soluble and insoluble fibre. In fact, they have more fibre than banana itself. Fibre helps to lower your cholesterol and thus, helps prevent cardiovascular diseases and strokes.A study conducted on a group of people who had high LDL (bad cholesterol) levels proved this fact. When the participants consumed banana peels everyday, it was reported that their bad cholesterol levels were decreased noticeably.
Help you sleep better:
Banana peels are full of tryptophan, a chemical that is known for inducing more relaxed sleep.
Helps to detox:
Because of good bacteria in your colon, these peels help get rid of constipation and thus, help detox the body and create a better immune system.
Weight loss:
Because banana peels are full of fibre, they help in losing weight.
Cardiovascular Health:
Banana peels can help in eliminating atherosclerosis from your body by preventing cholesterol from sticking to the walls of your arteries.
Creates probiotics:
Again because of a high fibre content, banana peel creates a space for good bacteria to grow in your colon and thus, boosts your immune system.
Good for eye health:
Banana peels contain lutein which is important for night vision. They also prevent muscular degeneration and prevent cataracts.
Skin health andAnti-Inflammatory Agent:
Banana peels are good anti-inflammatory agents that help to sooth away all kinds of inflammations. Banana also help with warts, psoriasis, itching, insect bites, rashes, wrinkles, and help to better skin texture.
Deccan ChronicleProtective agent for Red Blood Cells:
Banana peels help to protect the red blood cells in your body from breaking down. It was found that green banana peels were more effective in doing so.

HelpAge awareness programme for schoolchildren
The Youth Educational Division of HelpAge Sri Lanka conducted an educational awareness programme for over 1,000 students of Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda on `Gerontology and Geriatrics related to healthcare of elderly people.
Anula Vidyalaya Principal P. N. Rajapaksha highlighted the value of educating schoolchildren and raising awareness on the importance of keeping parents and grandparents within their family circle without sending them to elders homes.
The principal also commended the services rendered by HelpAge Sri Lanka to improve the quality of the lives of elders, especially underprivileged citizens in the country.
HelpAge Rights and Advocacy Advisor Lionel Premachandra said `Gerontology is a scientific study of old age and the process of growing old while the subject `Geriatrics is a kind of medicine or social science concerned with the health and care of elderly people.
Although these two subjects are new to present day schoolchildren, education officials have decided to include the same to the school and university curriculum, he said.
Premachandra added that health authorities have decided to start separate geriatric wards in hospitals to treat elders.
This shows our country needs separate doctors to treat elderly citizens similar to paediatricians looking into the health care of children, he said.

## Title: Ideal solution for Kandy
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Ideal solution for Kandy
If you think that Colombos roads are congested and polluted, just visit Kandy, where it is much worse. Kandys woes are worsened by the fact it is boxed in by mountains, with fairly narrow streets already bursting at the seams. Kandy suffers from bumper to bumper traffic and severe air pollution. Parking is a nightmare on the labyrinthine one-way streets.
With the authorities ruling out opening the road in front of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, which no one can fault given the sacred sites religious and cultural significance, other alternatives have to be found to reduce traffic congestion in the countrys second biggest city. This is not easy, because some of the solutions that work in Colombo are practically impossible to implement in Kandy due to its hilly terrain.
It is in this context that the Highways Ministry and the Road Development Authority (RDA) began to earnestly study the possibility of building a network of underpasses or tunnels in and around Kandy. Although this will be an enormously expensive undertaking, it seems to be the most viable solution that will also address the issue of air pollution. Clearly, foreign funding, expertise and assistance would be needed for a project of this magnitude. The pedestrian underpass in Borella is the only such existing project in Sri Lanka, though the Kandy project will be much bigger in scope, being a vehicular tunnel.
The good news for residents of Kandy (and for visitors) is that the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of Korea has approved US$ 200 million for the Kandy tunnel construction project, according to the Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka. The project comprises four tunnels with a total length of 5.5 Km from Suduhumpola to Tennekumbura via Bogambara and Ampitiya which will be the longest road tunnel in Sri Lanka. The Korea Exim Bank will finance this project with a concessional loan with a 0.15 percent interest rate and 40 year repayment period including a 10 year grace period. The project also includes building a number of bridges and roads and will cost US$ 250 million.
The main objective of the project is to ease traffic congestion in the centre of Kandy City by constructing bypass tunnels for vehicles heading to the west or east of Kandy without entering the circuitous Kandy Lake road. The tunnel is expected to reduce the travel time from Suduhumpola to Tennekumbura from two hours to less than 30 minutes even at morning and evening rush hours. This will make a huge difference to motorists and save a colossal amount of money that would otherwise go for extra fuel.
Experts say the tunnels will also boost the economy of Kandy by providing a short connection between the Kandy Industrial Zone and the A1 Road to Colombo. Coupled with the Central Expressway now under construction (completion slated for 2019), the tunnel and road network will give a much-needed boost for goods and passenger transport to and from the Hill Capital. The train service too must not be forgotten  it should be a prime candidate for rapid electrification which should slash journey times further for the Colombo-Kandy intercity express service.
We hope the authorities would take extra care to ensure quality control and adherence to environmental guidelines in both the tunnel and expressway projects in the light of concerns over the Southern Expressway after the recent floods. Many allegations have been made that the construction of the Southern Expressway without necessarily taking environmental concerns into account may have contributed to the recent floods in some of the areas traversed by the expressway. The authorities should investigate these claims without delay and apply any lessons learned to ongoing and future projects. Building back better should always be the aim of previous lessons learned.
The Government has embarked on a series of expressway and road development projects that will link every part of the country including the North and the East whose road infrastructure must catch up with the rest of the country. Among them are the Rajagiriya flyover, Ruwanpura Expressway, Central Expressway and proposed expressways linking Jaffna, Trincomalee and other Northern and Eastern cities. Most of these will be elevated, but serious thought should be given to underpasses where they could be more viable. The authorities are also saddled with the massive task of repairing the roads, bridges and culverts damaged in the recent floods. Again, the motto should build back better.
The Government should pay equal attention to developing road and rail public transport. Sri Lanka will soon have eight million vehicles in line with current registration trends with no immediate solution to congestion in sight. The only alternative is to build a quality public transport network that can lure a percentage of motorists who will then keep their cars at home. Fortunately, the Government will shortly embark on Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects in key cities. These projects will hopefully come on line before our roads become more or less permanently clogged. A better public transport network is the best answer yet to the private car.

Moves against terror
PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY) PROVISIONS ACT AND ITS AFTERMATH:
It was ides of July 1979. I saw the Bill for Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions). I felt that its Section 7 was repugnant to the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution as it kept the arrested person in police custody for a period not exceeding seventy-two hours without producing him to the Magistrate.
When a police officer, not below the rank of Superintendent would make an application in writing that such person should be remanded until the conclusion of the trial. The Magistrate was debarred from exercising his judicial discretion. It undermined the Judicial Power of the Court that is enshrined under Articles 3 and 4 (c) of the Constitution. Article 3 states inter-alia that sovereignty is in the people and it is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the exercise of fundamental rights too.
Thereupon, I telephoned to then Leader of the Opposition, Amirthalingam and told him that I intended to challenge the Bill. I entertained a fanciful thought that he would be pleased and praise me. To my utter dismay, I was given a severe dressing down.
Birth of PTA
Amirthalingam told me that President, JR Jayewardene had promised to grant several demands of the TULF and my petition in opposition would render negative approach by JR. Though I did not agree to his line of thinking, I told him that several provisions of the Bill violated the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. He admonished me and queried me whether I could claim more knowledge than Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam on the Constitution. I was made to understand that Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam had approved the Bill in toto and had expressed his satisfaction and none need to entertain obnoxiousness in any one of its provisions.
Then I became aware that Law No.16 of 1978, proscribing the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was originally intended to operate for two years but on the request of Amirthalingam the period was reduced to one year. In the same way Amirthalingam wanted PTA for a period of two years and JR gave him a solemn undertaking to do so.
Kuttimani episode
The provisions of PTA had subsumed the provisions of Penal Code for murder. In or about 1981, Kuttimani was indicted under both provisions before the High Court for murder of a police officer. Upon conviction he was sentenced to death.
After the judgement, Amirthalingam wanted to arrange a date for consultation with V.S.A. Pullenayakam to enable him, Sivasithambaram and Neelan to attend such consultation. I did arrange a date for consultation but refrained from participating. Chandrahasan, Kumaralingam, Perinpanayakam and Navaratnam, Attorneys-at-law participated. Pullenayakam informed me that they did not attend the consultation. I telephoned Amirthalingam to find out why they did not attend. Amirthalingam was lamenting that JR had deceived them and they intended to take up those matters with JR at the next meeting and would get them rectified. However, PTA remained unamended.
JR had also manoeuvred to have the period of operation of PTA for three years and PTA was made a permanent statute by a subsequent amendment. JR, a Machiavellian of all times, gave innumerable promises to Amirthalingam that he would pass legislation or frame regulations to smooth the grievances of the Tamils in the field of education, colonization, employment and of the use of Tamil Language. He honoured his promises in the breach and succeeded in the scheme to destroy the political strength of the TULF among the Tamils but failed to destroy LTTE.
K.W. Devanayakam, Minister of Justice moved the Bill in Parliament on July 18, 1979. The Bill was passed by 129 votes without opposition.
None of the TULF Members ever participated in Parliament. All of them refrained from participating at the debate of the Bill as previously promised to JR.
The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Bill, which came subsequent to PTA, had a provision that bail cannot be granted except with the sanction of the Attorney General. It was held by the Supreme, that it was a fetter on, and in effect a power of control over, Judicial Power of the Court. The granting of bail is an exercise of judicial power, which can only be controlled or reviewed by a higher court. Such power cannot be given to the Attorney General or a non-judicial body. The Supreme Court recommended that the said provisions require to be passed by a two-thirds majority and approved by the People at a Referendum or else the amendment should be deleted entirely. Consequently, the said provision was amended by Parliament to provide for the grant of bail by courts in exceptional circumstances.
If it is construed that granting of bail with the sanction of the Attorney General a fetter on judicial power, does not the act of remanding a person until the conclusion of trial on a written application by a police officer become a fetter on judicial power
Maithripala Senanayake only opposed
In Parliament Maithripala Senanayake spoke on behalf of the SLFP on the Bill. He proclaimed that relations between the Sinhalese and the Tamils had been allowed to deteriorate very rapidly and the PTA would create the solid groundwork for a police state. He declared that the problems of the Tamils cannot be solved by military action.
He further said The directive issued by the President to the Commander of the Armed Forces in Jaffna to eliminate terrorism in all its forms before December 31, 1979 is reminiscent of Adolf Hitlers directive fixing a deadline for the final solution of the Jewish problem.
Maithripala Senanayake wanted the operation of the Bill only in the Jaffna District and to remain in operation only for so long as a state of Emergency was in force in that District.
Today, we witness many suspects in remand for a prolonged period of incarceration under PTA without trial or bail: their fundamental rights being violated without sanction: they are being convicted on confessions obtained by threats, intimidation and torture and they are compelled to fast unto death to accelerate the hearing of their trials.
Amendment to PTA was moved in March 1982: Section 15A (a) of the Amendment Bill empowered the Minister to keep a person in custody of any authority. Chandrahasan wanted to object this amendment and I became the Petitioner though my name was wrongly entered in the record. Court held that the removal of a person from judicial custody and placing him under ministerial custody was an interference with the judicial order and was inconsistent with Article 4 (c) read with Article 3 of the Constitution.
Two international covenants
Sri Lanka has ratified in 1980 the two International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights rendering the Government to act according to the international norms, rules and practices.
PTA is blot on humanity. A reading of the Reports on Ethnic Conflict and Violence on Sri Lanka prepared by Professor Virginia A Leary on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists and Sri Lanka A Mounting Tragedy of Errors prepared by its Chairman, Paul Seighart have recommended the repeal of and replace of PTA in keeping with International Covenants.
Sri Lanka Government was a co-sponsor with UN and other International Communities to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in line with international best practices.
Joint resolution
Joint Resolution was passed in 2015 but Sri Lankan Government has till the PTA in force. It is earnestly hoped that when Sri Lankan Government would decide to bring the New Act, it would not be worse than PTA in its nature, effect and operation.

Muralidaran inducted as first Sri Lankan into ICC Hall of Fame

Muttiah Muralidaran, the most successful bowler in Tests and One Day Internationals, was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in London yesterday.
The Sri Lankan spin great was honoured during the innings break of the India versus Sri Lanka Champions Trophy match at The Oval.
Muralidaran was awarded the honour along with Arthur Morris, George Lohmann and Karen Rolton by fellow ICC Cricket Hall of Famers and members of the media.
He became the first player from Sri Lanka and the 83rd overall to be inducted into the Hall of Fame when ICC CEO Dave Richardson presented him with a commemorative framed cap.
It is a moment of great pride and honour to be receiving this award, especially from the ICC which is the ultimate any cricketer can aspire to achieve. The induction during this prestigious ICC Champions Trophy makes it even more remarkable, said Muralidaran.
I thank the ICC for making this possible because this is a moment I will cherish throughout life, he added.
Richardson added: Muralis record speaks for itself. His control of line, pace and length coupled with his ability to spin the ball prodigiously are legendary. Once he developed the doosra he became almost unplayable.
A character popular with fellow players and fans alike, he not only helped raise the profile of Sri Lankan cricket but was a player people came out to watch the world over.

Norwegian Foreign Minister Brge Brende said, Norway will contribute with NOK 10 million (LKR 180 million) to the humanitarian relief effort due to floods and landslides in Sri Lanka.
The support will be channeled through United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) and International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC).
The Foreign Minister stressed the importance of mitigation and prevention of destruction caused by natural disasters and climate change.
Human life can be saved and the cost of prevention is significantly lower than the price of reparation, Brende added.
UNICEF will assist children, women and their families affected by the flood and landslides. Norwegian support will also be provided in the areas of water, sanitation, hygiene, child protection and education.
The Norwegian support to IFRC will help to improve the condition in collective centers with water and sanitation. It will also contribute to clean up the wells and give people basic household items to restart their lives.
The Norwegian Embassy in Colombo is funding an ongoing technical cooperation between the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), for capacity building and advanced equipment to NBRO on landslide prevention, analysis and early warning systems.
The support to NBRO aim to save lives and property by early warning systems and comprehensive mapping. The Embassy is in dialogue with NBRO on their needs for increased support.

The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) has postponed the debate on allegations of corruption and malpractices against some of its members to June 14.

According to the NPC sources, heated arguments had broke out among some members when the issue was taken up.
A three-member committee appointed by Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran to look into the accusations against four NPC Ministers handed over a report containing their findings to the CM last week. Wigneswaran had told the NPC council meeting on Wednesday that an independent investigation has been done and the matter will be discussed on the 14th. However, some members had urged Wigneswaran to reveal the content of the report and have the debate on Wednesday itself.
Several other members had opposed the suggestion resulting in a heated argument between the two groups, the NPC sources said.

## Title: Outlook on Lankan banks for 2017 remains negative - Fitch

Outlook on Lankan banks for 2017 remains negative - Fitch
Fitch Ratings outlook on Sri Lankan banks for 2017 remains negative, although the expected deterioration in the operating environment has so far been managed.
Challenges stemming from slow economic growth together with deteriorating asset quality and weak internal capital generation could put further pressure on capitalisation levels of banks. The operating environment is a key rating driver for the banking sector as it can affect the vulnerability of the banks financial profile.
Fitch believes the Sri Lankan banking sector faces challenges from a slowdown in economic growth despite the revision of the outlook on the sovereigns rating to B+/Stable from B+/Negative in February 2017. Fitch estimates Sri Lankas real GDP growth to be just under 5% over 2017-2018, moderately lower than the authorities estimate of 5.5%-6.0%, as Fitch expects a greater drag on growth from tax hikes as well as slowing credit growth.
Fitch expects loan growth to moderate in 2017 following policy rate hikes in 2016 and early 2017 and a tax hike, which may reduce consumption demand.
However, increased credit demand from the state can push growth higher. Loan growth slowed to 17.5% in 2016 from 21.1% in 2015, but remains high in certain sectors such as construction (2016: 17.4% of sector loans and 2015: 16.7%), which could pose risk, if not well managed.
Absolute NPLs among Fitch-rated banks rose 7% in 1Q17, and could see further increase following aggressive lending in 2015/2016 into more susceptible segments such as retail and SME and the effects of the recent floods.
However, we do not expect a significant deviation in the sector NPL ratio due to the moderate loan book growth expected.
Fitch sees capitalisation as a key issue facing the sector, stemming from thin capitalisation across state banks and diminishing capitalisation across most private banks.
The state banks internal capital generation has been weak, with substantial dividend pay-outs to the government.
In 2016, the three largest state banks paid 76% of their profits as dividends.
Stronger capital buffers are desirable to counterbalance structural balance-sheet issues and to absorb unexpected losses.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has issued local Basel III capital requirements that banks are expected to comply with from July 1, 2017. Whilst Fitch believes that banks are likely to be compliant on the July 1, 2017 requirement, most banks would need to raise capital to meet the new Tier 1 levels by 2019.
The new rules also include higher risk weights for foreign-currency lending to the state and gold-backed loans, which the old rules did not have.
The government in 2016 proposed an increase in the minimum capital of licensed commercial banks to Rs 20 billion from Rs10 billion, and that of licensed specialised banks to Rs 7.5 billion from Rs5 billion.
Six small and mid-sized banks rated by Fitch did not meet this requirement based on reported core capital as of end-2016.
Sector profitability may decline as net interest margins (NIMs) are likely to narrow due to higher funding costs, which could outpace the rise in lending rates due to higher funding costs. This could be compounded by an increase in credit costs if asset quality were to worsen alongside the implementation of IFRS 9 due in early 2018.
Fitch-rated banks account for around 88% of the sectors assets. Fitch-rated state banks market share had declined to 43% by end-2016 from 47% in 2013 due to aggressive growth by private banks.
Loan growth has been high despite contractionary monetary policy.

Plans to provide solar power to religious places
Measures are being taken to provide solar power to all religious places, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said the initiative will help religious places to bring down their energy and utility bills while contributing to a more greener and a sustainable environment which will also indirectly motivate the devotees to switch to renewable energy.
The Minister was addressing a ceremony at the Dodamgaslanda temple yesterday.
Efficient use of renewable energy will be introduced to the people by making religious places switch to solar power use,he said. Minister Siyambalapitiya further said that solar power has contributed more than 50 Mega Watts to the National Grid in a short time. We spend huge amounts of money to import fossil fuels. We have to focus more on the use of renewable energy sources to save foreign exchange,he said.

Politics: Left, Right and center
Once again the old saying unuth ekai munuth ekai (There is no difference between former and present rulers) is heard more and more in the streets. That means ordinary masses, including those that voted for change on January 8, 2015 are frustrated and demoralized. Their expectations have been not only not fulfilled but they also see a continuation of old policies by the new dispensation too. Old wine in new bottles, so to say.
The promised national policies are not yet formulated, leaving aside implementation. Much valuable time is wasted on repairing the crisis-ridden machinery of the SLFP that the Head of State is unable to fulfill his role as the helmsman of the ship of State. Intra-party disputes in the Cabinet of Ministers have made parliamentary democracy a joke. Even budgets were in tatters.
As we have pointed out in this column repeatedly a way out could be found only in the close unity between the Government and the forces that represented the January 8th programme of action. Even the President had called for such a unity. Why has it not materialized, then This is a question that needs an answer.
Weakness of the civil society
A little bit of reflection would show that the principal weakness lies in the weakness of the civil society. Political parties- Left, Right and Centre () are proving themselves incapable of leading the masses due to various reasons including vertical splits and lack of foresight and innovative thinking. Leaderships of the established parties are still groping in the dark with outdated perceptions. This situation has created a leadership vacuum in most of the established parties though there are nominally elected leaders.
To make matters worse the so-called leaders of the civil society seemed to have exhausted their usefulness in view of most of them engaging in marketing campaigns (kade yanawa) for the government instead of following an independent line. Some of them have compromised their political positions by accepting material positions in Government institutions or appearing on its behalf.
In politics the Right, as represented principally by the UNP and the SLFP have failed to forge an organic unity despite the shaky ruling coalition and their ideological unity vis-s-vis their common stand on the neo-liberal path of development. Struggle for power is a heavy impediment to any strategic unity between them. Their rightist fellow-travellers are physically, numerically and theoretically too weak to influence them or act as king-makers. Moreover they are responsible for most of our past failures.
On the Left of the political spectrum what we see is all-round disunity with no prospect of unity in the near future. Intransigently clinging on to doctrinaire differences or competing with each other for an illusory take-over of power seem to separate the old and new Left. In the meantime the so-called new Left has also matured to be a twin brother of the traditional Left.
It is too unrealistic to imagine that the Left, despite the soundness of most of their policies, would be in a position to play the leading role in the next Government. It would have to realize that they have the future only to the extent that they lead the people through several intermediate steps that take forward the aspirations people expressed on January 8 without allowing the dominant classes to sabotage them and turn the wheel of progress 180 degrees counter-clockwise.
Traditional political parties
It is up to the civil society to forge a broad alliance for the same objectives. Unorganized civic actions depending on charismatic personalities cannot substitute genuine organized mass movements. Also to be noted is the trend away from traditional political parties in many countries. It was just few weeks ago that France elected a President outside the established parties of the Left, Right and Center.
Even the January 8 change in Sri Lanka resembled somewhat such a change though it was immediately nullified by the elected President taking over the leadership of the SLFP. New movements such as the One Percent Movement in the United States are attracting youth in several countries and their common feature is the independence from established political parties.
In our own country it could be fairly established that a silent majority unattached organically to established political parties are a dominant section of the voters at elections.
Their alienation from the established parties poses a threat that they would in turn to nihilist and anarchist positions in disgust.
Only a powerful civil society movement could compel them towards playing a dynamic role in social transformations required to ensure a better society for posterity.
Failure to do so would perpetuate the pendulum like oscillation of power between the established Rightist parties and leave the poor in the same or even worse conditions of life.

Relatives wait as bodies retrieved from Myanmar plane wreck
Hundreds of people gathered solemnly on a beach in southern Myanmar on Thursday awaiting news of their loved ones as rescuers worked to pull bodies from the Andaman Sea after a military plane crashed with more than 120 people on board. Navy ships and Air Force planes have been scouring the waves since late Wednesday afternoon, when the aircraft disappeared en route from the southern city of Myeik to the commercial hub of Yangon.
The commander-in-chiefs office said 10 corpses, including five children, had been retrieved from the sea since a navy boat discovered wreckage from the plane early Thursday off the coastline near Dawei town.
A local police source, who asked not to be named, put the tally closer to 20.
Hundreds of locals, relatives and NGO workers endured an agonising wait on the rain-battered San Hlan beach accompanied by stony-faced soldiers, as helicopters flew overhead heading towards military vessels just visible on the horizon.
My cousins sisters family was in the plane crash -- her husband, her child and herself, Kyaw Swar Myint, 44, from Dawei, told AFP.
We heard news that the helicopter was now transporting about 20 dead bodies to the beach, so we are waiting here.
A military officer said the strong currents meant boats can not make shore, so many of the bodies may have to be airlifted to land.
The Chinese-made Shaanxi Y8 plane was carrying a total of 122 people when it it disappeared on Wednesday afternoon during a routine flight, according to the latest military tally.
More than half of the passengers were from military families, including 15 children, along with 35 soldiers and 14 crew members, the army chiefs office said in a statement.
Some were travelling for medical check-ups or to attend school in Yangon.
The office of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi posted a statement expressing its condolences to the victims and pledged to support the rescue teams.
It is monsoon season in Myanmar, but there were no major storms reported along the aircrafts flight path on Wednesday afternoon.
The military said the plane was flying at over 18,000 feet (5,486 metres) when it lost contact with air traffic control at 1:35 pm (07:05 GMT) on Wednesday, about half an hour after takeoff.
The military named the captain as seasoned pilot Lieutenant Colonel Nyein Chan, who it said had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience.
He was flying the Chinese-made four-engine turboprop, a medium-range transport aircraft based on the Soviet Antonov An-12, a widely used aircraft that has had numerous crashes over the decades. Myanmars former junta bought several Y8s during their 50 years of isolated rule, when they were squeezed by Western sanctions.
The military said the plane that crashed was delivered in March 2016 and had a total of 809 flying hours.
The debris was found in the Andaman Sea, north of the last known location of Malaysia Airlines flight 370.
That plane went missing in March 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, but no wreckage has ever been found.
Myanmars military fleet has a chequered recent history of plane crashes.
A former executive at the aviation ministry said many of the aircraft were old and decrepit.
Myanmar air force has (a) very bad safety performance, he said, asking to remain nameless.
A five-strong crew died when an air force plane burst into flames soon after taking off from the capital Naypyidaw in February last year.
Three army officers were also killed in June when their Mi-2 helicopter crashed into a hillside and burst into flames in south-central Bago. - AFP

Reunited!
Dog lover Cheryl McCabe was a mum-of-one the last time she saw her beloved pooch Mitzy. Cheryls Patterdale Terrier vanished six years ago after being taken from the familys
Middlesbrough garden. She spent fruitless months looking for Mitzy, who shed owned for seven years and loved dearly.
It seemed as though shed never be seen again - but this shaggy dog story has a happy ending. Two months ago, a vet got in touch to say that after all this time, Mitzy had been found.
Now the perfect pet is back at the familys Thorntree home and getting used to a much larger family. When she went missing, the only child at home was Cheryls son Elliot, then seven.
Now theres not only Elliott but his brothers Charlie, five, Harry, three, and Freddie, nearly one - not forgetting Cheryls partner Gary Walker, a sausage dog, a Shih Tzu and a budgie!
Cheryl said: I had given up hope - I really thought Mitzy was dead and that we would never see her again.
Id had her since she was five weeks old. She was the perfect dog and I was devastated.
There wasnt much social media six years ago so all I could do was put posters up and ask around the area, but she didnt turn up.
Mitzy was found near the A19 near Thirsk and taken into Skeldale Veterinary Centre, the original James Herriot practice where TV series The Yorkshire Vet is filmed. Using information on Mitzys microchip, veterinary nurse Zoe Jackson and vet Julian Norton turned pet detective to track down her owner. And the team at Skeldale were stunned to discover Mitzy had been stolen six years ago.
Cheryl said: I got a voicemail and had to listen to it four times because I couldnt believe it.
I wasnt sure shed remember me after all this time so I was quite nervous when I went to pick her up.
But Cheryl neednt have been nervous as Mitzy, who had been unresponsive to Skeldale staff, wagged her tail for the first time since arriving and
immediately recognised her rightful owner, joyfully licking her face.
Cheryl, 32, said: Shes greyer around the eyes now, which I wasnt expecting - I guess I was still remembering the dog I had six years ago. But her lovely nature is just the same.
It just shows never to give up hope.
Vet nurse Zoe said:  Its such an amazing feeling being able to reunite Mitzy with her owner after so long as well! This is why Im a vet nurse,
this is why I come to work every day and do what I do.
We have never seen a case like this before and Im fairly sure that I wont see any case like this again.

Rhythm and Moves with Sri Lankan drumming
Juliet Coombe went on a course to learn the spiritual power of the Sri Lankan drum and how it is used to dance the devil away with the devil dancer.
I must confess to being quite nervous about training to be a drummer but Jetwing Travels organized a great master class with drummer and teacher Harsha. Before his weekly show he came at tea time to meet me for an hours training at the Centre Point of Jetwing Blue in Negombo. Harsha I discover has been playing drums now for some 13 years since he was nine years old and is deeply passionate about the language of music and its power on the human mind.
At the start the hotel naturalist and guide explains the rich cultural traditions of devil dancing used when village people are sick and how the weekly cultural show is a way of connecting the visitor to the island with its deeply spiritual way of life. I learn how the Sri Lankan drum tradition goes back 2500 years and that there are 33 types of drums recorded by historians, but like so many art forms it has been reduced to ten different types today. Each drum sounds different and was used for different purposes e.g Ana Bera drum was used to inform the people about orders from the King and Vada Bera - drums played when a criminal were taken to the jail and when heard the people could differentiate between a drum for rituals and one for promoting a theatrical event.
An incredible collection
Today the drum is mostly used for celebrations such as weddings, openings of a shop and important rituals whether it is in the Buddhist temples or as part of an elaborate healing process done by the village devil dancer. The cylindrical long shaped drums are often made from the Kohomba, Kitul or Jack trees using the skin of cattle in particular the stomach lining or a cow or monkeys hide to cover it, and the ties to tighten the sides were mostly in the past made from deer skin.
Until doing this course I had no idea of the complexity or the hard work that goes into this activity that therapists of the Western world could learn a great deal from as it is an acceptable health treatment that is still widely practiced through out the island to heal the traumatized mind or some ailment that is often seen as the work of a devil or hierarchy of devils. I myself witnessed the power of this ancient tradition in action post the 2004 tsunami when many people were deeply traumatized by their terrible family loses and through the rich belief system and power of music to heal it helped many thousands of people to deal with one of the worlds worst ever natural disasters.
A dramatic way
After the talk and a few tips my drummer takes his huge black bag and unzips it and inside is an incredible collection of things to dress up in. Everything from an amazing array of adornments: garters, a glorious emperor like collar, a sort of white embroidered sarong, a red oversize cummerbund that could go right around the swimming pool, huge elbow bangles, giant earrings and to cap it all the worlds longest white turban. Once dressed up you do feel more part of the scene and somehow it takes away the painful self-consciousness of hitting the drum with a stick and your thumbs.
For a difference and to make the experience potentially more embarrassing for me, we were directed to the rooftop between the two pools, sort of natural theatrical podium, where Harsha tried to show me an elaborate set of dance steps which I constantly fluffed until I decided to do my own similar version of what I thought might satisfy him  it seemed to work or else he gave up on me being a possible trainee for future shows. He also showed me how to hit the drum with my thumb in a hard flicking motion that left me thinking I would eventually destroy all the bones in my hand. To my relief, my hands went numb pretty quickly and I was fully into the spirit of whacking the drum with both thumbs in a dramatic way that brought a powerful sound to the air full of bird song and chatter of the fascinated passer by. Fortunately, no-one could tell whether I was quite in time as Harsha played along with me as we danced and drummed the night away  well, for a few minutes actually but I got so into it my life for a few minutes seem to run away with the fairies!
Once I had learnt the basic hand and thumb drumming techniques and shown a few more steps, and how to throw my head back in the air and jump I started to find myself enjoying the experience of learning the transfixing language of the drum and devil dancing. The mix of the sea, jangle of my foot bells and rhythmic drumming sounds drew people from all over the hotel complex to see what was going on and as I explained the fascinating ancient art form their eyes lit up and one could see from the incredible interest in this living healing art form that Jetwing Travels are onto another winning formula.

The salesman and sales efficiency
Marketing is talking about push and pull strategies with all the activities revolving around seven Ps and namely product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence.
The promotion mix is also referred to as the marketing communication mix where the data and information is exchanged to the client for his purchasing choices.
For most part, when an organisation makes a marketing communications business plan, it consolidates various types of correspondence channels in the general mix.
This is done to guarantee that the message of the organisation reaches the end customer. It is likewise done to guarantee reiteration so that the client reviews the brand due to the brand message being repeated in different channels immediately.
Communication mix includes advertising, sales promotions, public relations, personal selling, and direct marketing/Internet marketing.
Personal selling and its strategic perspective
Kotler and Armstrong define personal selling as personal presentation by the organisations sales team for the purpose of making sales and building customer relationships.
Broadly the sales function contributes to the organisation in the way of letting the target customers know whats on offer, helping in building relationships with new and current customers, and building credibility with customers. Personal selling is the only element in communication mix where customer and buyer interact.
It is the most direct, immediate and personalised approach and that is the main reason why an organisation needs to be more focused on the salesmans capability, skills and attitudes which will blend in the process of communicating with the customer.
Salesmen get involved in the communication process with the customer from the prospecting stage, through the transaction stage, to post transaction, where the involvement of all other communication mix elements will be limited to one or few stages of the process, in terms of ability to convince, convey, understand the exact needs, and satisfy them.
Personal selling is the most effective tool compares to other communication mix elements.
This is one main reason why an organisation needs to have a brilliant salesforce instead of just numbers.
From the salesmans point of view the salesman need to cut through the clutter in terms of performance, capabilities and mostly the willingness to perform.
Communication process
The customer goes through an evaluation process within his mind before the purchase decision. Competitors usually track the customers thinking process to gain the advantage, but the salesperson can himself understand the customers thinking process and use it to his own organisation's strength effectively.
The salesperson should have good knowledge about his own organisation and its products so that they can customise their requirements proactively thus winning customer loyalty in the long run. The selling process is vital for all salespeople to understand, which includes grasping customer needs, decision making stimulus, fulfilling that need and satisfying the customer without allowing any post-purchase dissonance.
Objectives of personal selling
An organisation may have the best brands and the best products spend the majority of the promotions budget on advertising, but if the salesman is not managed well the efforts will be a waste.
Salesman to stimulate the pull - mainly to encourage the intermediaries (in the case of B2C channel sales) to purchase, stock and display in a way to facilitate the end customer to pull. The salesperson is the key to penetrating, making the product range freely available for the consumer to pull.
Salesman as a communication medium  the salesperson acts as a communication medium to the end customer and the intermediaries.
For the retailer to be an information hub the salesperson needs to be smart and strong in providing all necessary information. Salespersons ability and skills make sure the intermediary will remember information and in turn pass on to the customer at the purchase decision.
Key essentials of a salesperson
The most important element of the organisation to succeed is the resources, mainly human resources and the strategies planned and executed by the people.
The salesman is also a part of the resources who is involved in delivering the strategic perspective of the organisation.
But the efficiency and the effectiveness of the salesman will not produce the desired results because it depends on how the target customers are approached and convinced to buy.
Personal selling - benefits to the organisation
Personal selling allows your organisation to come out from the traditional thinking that the customer will purchase what we have.
The ability and skills of the salesperson will create a customised approach and in the long run customers will be loyal to their brands.
In Sri Lanka, the salesman shifts jobs frequently with his client database. But the success of the salesman is always dependent on his capabilities and the attractiveness of the organisation's offerings.
Most of the time the customer remains with the organisation and its products depending on the benefits derived from the product or service and the relationship with the salesperson.
One of the key strategies and broad objective of personal selling is relationship strategy. There is no other better mechanism of creating relationships with customers other than through personal selling.
The management of the organisation should be smart enough to obtain the best commercial value and benefit to the organisation through its sales personnel.
The relationship between the customer and the selling organisation always helps to build and develop collaborative relationships for short-term and long-term goals.
Traditional to modern approaches in sales
Traditional versus modern selling is always an interesting topic to discuss during sales meetings. Everyone has their unique approach but it has to match to evolve with your customer's needs or else you will get left behind.
I think most salespeople will agree that in the past 12 years or so, to be successful you need to have at least a small amount of modern consultative selling within your overall style and personality.
The role of the modern salesperson is very different from what we commonly termed as traditional selling jobs.
These days the seller is aware that the buyer is now more aware of the seemingly clever complexity and refinement of todays selling. To those in charge of setting the standards, creating the presentation styles and being able to influence the direction modern selling is taking has been primarily influenced by the increased number of motivators who consistently work at reinforcing what can be done.
Today the standard of selling is up, whereas the ground level is fuelled by many of todays small business owners who encourage those that seem to be personality-driven to get into sales. Since they wont encourage formal training, that sector of sales is still churning people who last just a year or two and in the process contribute the questionable reputation some sectors of the sales industry unfortunately carry.
In short, here are two simplistic ways of capturing the differences between the two.
1. The more traditional approach taught by many in the 70s, 80s and 90s was very salesman and saleswoman oriented (primarily salesman) and worked on the premise that the selling process attempted to create a small number of needs in customers during the presentation process. The goal then was to make sales and the approach was generally inflexible.
2. The more modern view is that selling primarily should be customer-oriented and the salesperson should try to discover customers' wants (and to a lesser extent needs) by discussing their situation with them through a somewhat static questioning process. The goal of modern selling is to build long-term relationships and to create customers who will be encouraged to provide repeat business, rather than just generating one-off sales.
This approach seems to be working better and is much more flexible allowing the salesperson to adapt to the unique needs and situation of the customer.
Sales push and customer pull
Every individual has to play the role of the customer at one given point of time. If you do a self-evaluation of your own buying decision process, you will understand how complicated it is.
It may be an insurance policy, motor vehicle investment plan or any kind of high-value complex product or your daily rations such as brands of rice, food items and toothpaste. Your decision process involves gathering information, communicating and experiencing for consideration of buying.
Customer pull is the demand created by the customer and the push is purely the function of the salesperson. Personal selling may include the product displays, merchandising and influencing the retailer or the intermediary to promote one's brand or the product.
The customer is always in the driving seat; organisations can provide lots of information via many channels to create attraction towards the brands and products.
Marketing as a concept shows how to understand and anticipate customer needs and theoretically enable customers to pull when they have a need.
There are a lot of important reasons that enable us to engage customers in different and more impactful ways. However, we need to understand that the salesman has a better and bigger obligation to push the sales because it is not possible for the sales to be pulled and management needs to understand that sales cannot be pulled forcibly.
Factors for effective selling
Selling skills, knowledge and attitudes make the salesperson to be effective or not. Most of the time salesman may be lacking one or many of the factors and the responsibility of the supervisors are to manage and control them in the salesperson.
Sales pitch, understanding the needs of the customers, analyses the type of prospects and the conversion of the prospects into customers will be based on the skills of the salesman.
Self-motivation to be successful is a precondition for this effectiveness. Douglas McGregor (1960) said there are two types of people named X type and Y type.
X type people dislike their work, have no ambition to perform, avoid responsibility, have to be controlled, need to be supervised and have no interest to work.
Y type of people are creative and plan ahead, are more organized, are eager to work, take more responsibility, make positive decisions and are comfortable in the working environment.
It is essential to make sure that your sales team has more weight on Y type of salespeople. If not the result will be not much different as less motivated salespeople cannot participate in business and may damage the spirit of the team efforts too.
Knowing the competition is an analytical skill, the salesperson should be convinced of the benefits that your company can offer over the competition.
Industrial selling
Also known as B2B selling, the difference from retail is that two or more organisations get involved in buying and selling, rather an individual salesman and a customer. Complexity is high by nature simply because of the number of individuals involved in the decision making process. The salesman has the responsibility of convincing many individuals representing the buying organisation and the needs and benefits of each individual are different.
In these situations, the salesman needs to be smart in understanding each decision maker in the buying organisation so that each stakeholder is satisfied. (Morris, 1992) described the three types of buying in organisations: speculative buying, forward buying, and hand-to-mouth buying.
In the first two methods focus on purchases for futuristic requirements are projected and forecasted, but hand-to-mouth buying is about the organisation buying as much when needed and in smaller quantities.
Service selling
In service selling, the service and selling function takes place simultaneously. Seller needs to be service oriented and treat the customer with a service-oriented mindset since both functions of selling and service is experienced by the customer at the same time.
Service selling requires an effective association to build a fruitful market yield with clients. The challenge in service selling is you can create a push via excellent service orientation but there are limitations on creating a pull function. Word of mouth is the best channel and medium for service selling to spread among the target audience and pull customers looking for such experiences in high service levels.
Retail selling
Selling could be done via physical stores or on a door-to-door basis. A retail sale happens when a business pitches an item or service to an individual buyer for his or her own utilisation.
The exchange itself can happen through various diverse sales channels, for example, on the web, in a physical storefront, through direct deals, or regular postal mail.
The part of the sale that qualifies it as a retail exchange is that the end client is a buyer. Sales channel management is a key function in the retail selling function. Retail networks add value to the organisation products by the way of sorting, displaying merchandise, transportation and demonstration to push the product to the final consumer.
Sales ethics
These days, most ethicists trust that relationship selling is sensible work on prompting positive connections among buyers and sellers. Relationship selling requires that guidelines are not really legally binding. It enables purchasers and dealers to cooperate.
In any case, there are detriments to this approach as relationship offering needs time to create and it might be hard to build up an expected code of conduct. Marketers must know about moral measures and adequate conduct.

SL Tourism targets over 4.5 million tourists by 2020
Existing economic development and peace in the country will largely benefit Sri Lanka to target over 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals by 2020.
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga made these remarks at the official opening of the newly constructed Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing Hotels in Panadura.
The hotel's project investor Jie Zhong Jie, Lanka Development Construction and Engineering (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Li Jian Guo and Jetwing Group Chairman Hiran Cooray were also present.
The modern three-storied Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing, constructed at a cost of US$ 20 million, is owned by Jie Zhong Jie and Lanka Development Construction and Engineering, while the hotel is managed by Jetwing Hotels.
Addressing the gathering, Minister Amaratunga said that at a time when the countrys tourism industry was reaping fruitful results due to the arrival of large number of tourists, Sri Lanka Tourism has planned to develop the sector by helping local and foreign investors to construct more and more hotels in every part of the country.
Like the newly constructed Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing, Panadura, we also urge other foreign investors to visit this beautiful island and construct many more hotel complexes considering the arrival of an unprecedented number of foreign tourists to the country at present, he said.
Quoting statistics, Minister Amaratunga said over 2.5 million foreign tourists arrived in the county last year and during the past few months of this year over 2.3 million tourists have arrived so far. He said these statistics reflect that the country can expect over 4.5 million foreign tourists by 2020 and to achieve this target the Government is now planning to construct more hotels with the help of local and foreign investors.
Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing, the 180-roomed largest luxury hotel is located only one-hour drive from the city of Colombo.
It has deluxe rooms and suites with attached balconies and terraces, banquet hall, conference halls, a bar and a karaoke lounge, a wedding hall, a well equipped in-house spa, and roof top presidential suite.

Sri Lankas epic run chase stuns India
London: Sri Lanka staged a superb run chase to stun India and keep alive their Champions Trophy challenge as Kusal Mendis inspired a famous seven-wicket victory over the holders on Thursday.
Needing 322 to avoid a second successive Group B defeat, Sri Lanka powered to a memorable triumph at The Oval thanks to key contributions from Mendis (89), Danushka Gunathilaka (76) and captain Angelo Mathews (52).
Mathews admitted earlier this week that many experts expected his underdogs to be thrashed by in-form India.
But Sri Lanka defied the odds to win with eight balls to spare and they can qualify for the semi-finals if they beat Pakistan in their final group match in Cardiff on June 12.
After losing by 99 runs against South Africa in their opener, that would be a remarkable turn around for a young Sri Lanka team in the midst of a major rebuilding project.
Indias failure to secure a second consecutive win after thumping arch rivals Pakistan was a major surprise and they must beat South Africa at The Oval on Sunday to avoid a humiliating exit.
Shikhar Dhawans 125 had put India in a strong position as the holders piled up 321 for six. The 31-year-old hit 15 fours and one six in his 128-ball innings, receiving strong support from Rohit Sharma (78) and MS Dhoni (63), but it wasnt enough.
India had only themselves to blame after squandering the momentum given to them by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who dismissed Niroshan Dickwella for seven when the openers edge was caught by Ravindra Jadeja.
Needing what would be a record run chase in ODIs staged at The Oval, Gunathilaka set about giving Sri Lanka hope.
He hit Umesh Yadav for a sky-scraping six and, together with the aggressive Mendis, imposed himself well enough to build a quick-fire 50 partnership.
Hardik Pandya had a chance to remove Mendis with the score on 70-1, but young all-rounder dropped a chance off his own bowling.
If complacency was an issue for Indias wayward bowlers, Gunathilaka made them pay, reaching his half-century in emphatic style with another six.
By the time Sri Lanka reached 108-1 in the 20th over, the holders were beginning to worry.
Jadeja, the worlds top ranked ODI bowler, was slapped away for four by Mendis, who sailed onto fifty with his first six.
An audacious reverse sweep for four by Gunathilaka off Jadeja showed Sri Lankas rising confidence, which hold spiked higher after the diving Rohit Sharma dropped Gunathilaka.
When Mendis hit three successive boundaries, their partnership was up to 159 and India were in danger of letting the match slip from their grasp.
But Gunathilakas career-best ODI innings came to an end when he was run out by Umesh Yadav after rashly trying to turn a single into two.
Incredibly, Sri Lanka didnt learn from that mistake and Mendis perished in the same fashion, easily run out by Kumars direct hit while attempting to steal a single.
Crucially, Mathews, playing his first ODI since August after a calf injury, came in to steady the ship with a nerveless innings.
Assisted by the opportunistic hitting of Kusal Perera, he turned the tide back in his teams favour.
Perera gave Sri Lanka a scare when he suffered what appeared to be a hamstring injury and had to retire hurt after limping through several runs.
That added to the tension, but India were bereft of ideas.
Gunaratne came in to spank a pair of sixes, putting Sri Lanka on the brink, and Mathews saw them over the finish line to complete their joint highest ever ODI run chase. AFP

Sri Lanka defends Chinas OBOR project
Chinese investment in Sri Lanka is reviving a 3,000-5,000-year-old shipping route, said Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, defending the governments decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative.
The fact is that regional trade needs to move forward. If one country is doing a project, that is not against another country, said Minister Karunanayake to journalists at the end of his two-day visit to New Delhi. Like Hong Kong was a launching pad for China, Sri Lanka would like to be a hub of economic activity for India, he added. Karunanayake said Colombo hoped for similar investments from India and Japan and would welcome Indian investment in the East Terminal of the Colombo Port; one of two new container terminals to be built in the next phase of the Chinese-built harbour project. Five consortiums including two with Indian companies, Container Corporation of India and Shapoorji Pallonji Ltd, are reported to have filed bids for the project in 2016.
He said that in his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, he had expressed the desire for an early resolution to the fishermen issue and bottom-trawling by Indian fishermen in the Sri Lankan waters. - The Hindu

Susanthika calls to end unsporting conduct
One-time Olympic Silver medalist Susanthika Jayasinghes decision recently to sell her medals created tremendous hype in society. She made allegations against the Ministry of Sports for not giving her due recognition.
Jayasinghe, in a recent interview with the Daily News, said, recognition given to sportsmen and women have declined and as a result, Sri Lankans participating in international competitions have also gradually declined.
She alleged that the Ministry was not providing adequate facilities and pointed out that athletes do not even have a ground with an adequate track for practice.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Did financial difficulties make you want to auction the medals
A: It is not a big issue, but the way they treated me made me take that decision. The problem began when I got a special award at the Platinum Awards Ceremony (organized by Sirasa TV) which was held in April. Many other sportsmen and women also got awards at the ceremony. After presenting me with the award, they requested that I make a small speech. I took that as an opportunity to express myself and let others know about the present state of sports.
I spoke about the role that needs to be played by the Ministry of Sports, Athletics Association and the National Olympic Committee, in the present era. I said, mainly three things such as values, marketing and management that need to be maintained and promoted.
As soon as I stepped down from the stage, the Sports Minister sarcastically reminded me that I would be coming to the Ministry to collect my cheques in a few weeks.
Later, the Sports Minister stopped my cheques and said they cannot pass so easily. And he asked me to report on the work that I have done.
Q: Have the ministry officials called for reports prior to this
A: This has not happened to me before; they never asked for any reports before that incident. The Minister gave me the appointment letter in July, 2016. Though they gave me the appointment letter, I wasnt assigned to do any work. They didnt include a job description in my letter. I had no higher official to ask what my duties were. So I was clueless. I wrote to the Ministry several times for clarification, but got no reply. I wasnt signing or placing my fingerprint anywhere and I had no office.
Q. But Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara had said that he has not seenyou working
A: I dont think he would like me going to his Ministry every morning to greet him. As I said before, I was not informed about my duties. They never described what I had to do. Therefore, I did whatever I could do.
As I had an understanding about sports, I looked into training of the students, checked their food, spoke to the coaches and saw to the ground facilities. I always mentioned all what I did in a letter addressed to the Secretary and submitted it before I received my cheques.
All these issues began after I made that speech. I had to do a job. I did sports and nothing else. I didnt get any academic qualification. If I dont have a job, then my medals are the only option for my survival.
Q: Did you have a discussion with the Minister regarding this issue
A: No, he never spoke to me about this. I heard all what he said through media.
I have won two world championship medals, one world cup, one Olympic medal and lot of Asian medals. Though I brought fame to the country, I was not given a proper place.
Q: Do you think all the athletes are not being recognized or is it just you
A: My son was home for six months without a school. They didnt give me any prominent place. I know many other athletes whose children are going to international schools. It is very pathetic to say, but thats the recognition that we have got so far.
I cannot tell the school athletes to enter sports when we athletes who ran for the country in international competitions are not recognized. I have not been given a value and nobody recognized my talents, so how can I tell the young athletes that they can come to a professional level through sports.
We represented Sri Lanka and took part on behalf of the country. We need support from the government. How can I tell the young athletes to take up sports as their future
Q: Did you write to the Ministry asking for an office before
A: Of course I did, but they never responded to any of my letters. They are all lying about things now.
Q: What made you change your mind about selling your medals
A: A month ago, I sent a letter of explanation to the President about the prevailing situation at the Ministry and the way that they treated me.
After that, this issue was brought up in the media; an official attached to the President contacted me and asked me to change my decision regarding selling the medals. He told me that the President is also aware of the issue and asked me to wait for some time.
Now I am waiting for their reply.
I got no salary for April and May, but I spoke to the Ministers Additional Secretary and he asked me not to create an issue over it. He informed me to come and collect my cheques in two days. See what happened at the end; they need not drag it so much.
Q: Were there any other activities that you did apart from what you mentioned above
A: I was not given a job description, but I can do a lot of things. I can train the students and coaches; I can also engage in empowerment programmes. I have practical experience in participating in many international competitions. I can do many things to develop and increase the standard of sports in our country. I can also do physical fitness and sprinting training.
I have the potential to do many activities, but they dont give me a chance. If the people who are working for it know the subject, they wouldnt do this to me. If this is the situation for me, how would it be for the people who are lower than I
I have no idea what they are doing for the betterment of the sportsmen.
Q: What do you think about the present state sports in Sri Lankan and about up and coming athletes
A: It has fallen now. We dont see any improvements or great achievements. Sri Lankan athletes participating in international competitions are very low.
Q: Why is it very low
A: There is no proper coaching for athletes. There is no ground with running tracks. We are unable to do training. When there are no tracks and distance marked, how can we train athletes
Q: Have you informed the Minister about this
A: I spoke openly about this. I am not sure whether others complain about it to him. I would say there are no adequate facilities for students.
Many parents in Colombo from popular schools give private practice to their kids. I think the people who are doing it do not have a clear understanding about sports. Maybe they have not done sports before. Ministry can send us to foreign countries to learn the latest theories as I am qualified. They do not do anything like that. If that happens, I can train the coaches and athletes.
Q: What do you expect to gain by doing all these things
A: I can stay away from all sorts of activities if they arrange at least a pension scheme for me. I need something. This is not like other sports; I think this is the same situation for all the athletes.
Players should not be ungrateful: Dayasiri
The country and government has spent a large amount of money on her up to and beyond the point she won her silver medal. When the government came into power in 2015, she did not have a job. In 2016, I put in a cabinet paper asking that she be given a salary of Rs 60,000 until she was 60 and Rs 15,000 fuel allowance, along with a vehicle. I wanted to appoint her to this programme we were carrying out until 2024 called Talent Identification Program (TIP) as an advisor, but Cabinet gave approval for her to be employed until 2020 with a salary of Rs 60,000. Thereafter, it can be renewed.
I invited her and presented her with the appointment letter and when she took it, she said, "I was paid Rs. 80,000 earlier; now you are paying me Rs 60,000."
That appointment letter clearly states what her job description is because Cabinet approval for her appointment was only granted under certain conditions. We had thus identified the tasks she needed to fulfil. We were rolling out a programme to train 13-year-olds in 312 schools and what she had to do was to go meet them and help train them. Thereafter, I called her in and said, Sri Lanka has identified three levels in sports; national, Asian and Olympic and someone has to take the responsibility of training, looking into dietary needs, health and injuries of athletes in these levels. So I asked her if she could take on that responsibility. She agreed to it and then left. I did not meet her after that.
She has said, I informed her to come collect her April salary as her lastI said no such thing. At a sporting event where I was the chief guest, she announced that the Ministry of Sports had done nothing for her. I then spoke to her after the ceremony and told her not to forget that it was the Ministry which was paying her salary.
In April, the Secretary sent her a letterI was not aware of thisbut it did not mention anything about stopping a salary. The letter, which I have here stated that according to Clause 8 of her appointment letter, said, she needed to submit and approve her plan for the month by the Ministry Secretary, at the end of the month she had to submit her progress report and at the end of the year she needed to submit her plan for the following year. These are not big reports; she simply needs to show what she did and where she went for the month. The Secretary further noted that since her appointment, she has not submitted any of the above reports and that the Ministry has continued to pay her salary throughout even when she was sick and now officials want to see what work was done for that payment due to auditing purposes. Thus, to continue with the payments, he has asked that all reports be sent. The letter did not stop payment of her salary.
On Tuesday, the Additional Secretary sent another letter to her stating that the Ministry did not intend to stop her salary, but simply asked for her progress reports and she was invited to the Ministry for a discussion about it and resolve the issues as soon as possible.
You need to know that this advisory position is not attached to the minister, if she was an advisor to the minister, she will not be required to submit reports. But she is an advisor to the Ministry and thus, a public servant, and public servants have certain duties that need to be done. Earlier, she was an advisor to the minister and did not need to submit any reports, so perhaps she thought it was the same scenario here and she did not have to show any work being done to collect her salary.
What I wanted was to use Susanthikas experience and hard work to benefit the poor and hardworking young athletes of this generation. Isnt that what she needs to do
I have no personal anger towards her, but I am disappointed to say she has no sense of gratitude.
When she was sick at the Diyatalawa hospital, it was I who sent the helicopter to her so that she could be brought to Colombo and treated here. Even S.B. Dissanayake, when he was minister, has done a lot for her. After I assumed duties, she said she wanted to start an Academy, so I gave her Rs 1.1 million for that.
The Sports Ministry has spent a lot of money on her and it is not my problem she has no control over her finances.
I would also like to mention here that while Susanthika won an Olympic medal, there are many more athletes who have won Commonwealth games. Sriyani Kulawansa should berate us on the roads; she does not mention a word. Today, she works at the Ministry of Education for a Rs. 15,000 salary. Sugath Tilakaratne has received nothing from us. Damayanthi Darsha has not asked for a cent from us; she works in a private company now. Pushpamali Ramanayake won Commonwealth medals; she did not ask for anything. There are many more boxing medalists. If the Ministry goes to look after all of them, we would go bankrupt.
I asked her to do some of the trainer courses, both, level 1 and 2. It would add such value to have a former Olympian come and train new athletes, but she does not do it. She could be a good trainer. We need such skilled trainers and we have rolled out a programme now to take level 1 and 2 trainers to level 3, 4 and 5 as they have no money to pay for it themselves.
All these allegations are unfair. If she is going to auction her Olympic medal, she can do it to the Ministry. The medal belongs to the country, it cannot be her private property. The country spent a lot for that. In future, I will bring in a law to prevent any athlete from selling or auctioning their medals, the medals will belong to the state.
She also draws a salary of Rs. 60,000 from the army as a trainer. I dont know what work she does there. She has scolded every Sports Minister there has ever been. Not a good word has been uttered by her.
These are excerpts from Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekaras comments at the Cabinet media briefing held on June 7.

Too young to get old!


They will go down their different paths but one thing is certain, they will never forget those days when they all achieved something great, something wonderful, something unforgettable. They came together as a family and though they may never see each other again they will never forget each other. Dramatic Moves features the Thespians of St. Peters College.
Our Drama club was formed in 1924, and we are the oldest club at St. Peters College when it comes to Drama at 93 years. Whenever possible, we explore all types of Drama depending on the availability of the Cast and their talents. Our Directors Jehan Bastians and Neidra Williams know the potential of the boys and most of the boys have worked under them since they were youngsters. According to them the cast is formed and we choose our scripts accordingly, said Teacher in Charge of the English Literary and Drama Society (ELDS)/ Moderator (Drama) Imogen Mel.
Mel has known these boys from the time they were kids.
I have seen them step on to stage with joyous faces, small kids that they were. I have seen them grow over the years, and they enjoy their drama. They have matured in their acting. From tiny tots, I have seen them becoming mature actors. I am proud of them because they are the future of St. Peters College. They are leaving behind a set of youngsters who have learnt from them and will become our future dramatists. They want to share their knowledge with the new generation and that is one of their strengths- the fact that they want to give back, stated Mel.
This is basically drama at St. Peters. Jehan is an old Peterite. He is sharing his knowledge with these boys and they in turn share their knowledge with their juniors. Drama is another way of education. It is not just stepping on stage and acting, it is a way of life. And they have learnt it. This is another one of their strengths, pointed out Mel.
Last year was a dream come true for St. Peters, when they became Overall Champions for 2016 at Shakespeare.
Last year was a dream come true for us. That moment I will always treasure for all my life. We had tears in our eyes. After so many years of struggle we finally won the cup. The winning production was Julius Caesar and the three other schools, were St. Josephs, Wesley College and Royal. For this we owe a lot to Jehan and Neidra for molding our children. There was a Faux Pas, because they announced us as third place and then the judge got up and corrected the error and announced us as Champions. I will never forget that cheer that came up! elucidated Mel.
Another unforgettable production they did was Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.
This was our public production this year in January. This was a one year practice. During that time we took part in Shakespeare. I told them they would be too tired but they felt they were equal to the task and ultimately they won Shakespeare. For Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, we had four sold out shows. I was at the gate and people were asking me if they could stand and watch! Colombo went crazy over Joseph!, explained Mel.
The attachment that Mel has with the boys is quite evident.
They are a lovable lot. They are very talented. They have to be led and guided, after all they are still children in my eyes. They are very eager about drama and they give 100 percent, while making many sacrifices. They are passionate about Peterite drama, added Mel.
*********************
Method acting
President, Dion Weerasinghe feels that one of their biggest strengths is that they function as a family. That is what we focus on mostly, we bond as a group during practices. That helps us enjoy the whole process and helps our performance onstage, said Weerasinghe.
Weerasinghe has a method he uses when stepping into someones skin.
There is one method when it comes to acting that is called Method Acting. Which I find very favorable. If there is something I find hard to imagine, Method acting for me is the easiest way. You put yourself into the scenario of your character. Then you base your feelings on what your character would be feeling. That is the easiest and most intense way you can get into your character, explained Weerasinghe.
Weerasinghe excitedly explained, that definitely drama at St. Peters will continue to thrive and prosper. I can see at practices that the younger ones have matured and they listen very well and understand what is happening. When I see this I am proud and impressed. They will keep on growing. Jehan and Neidra have been with us for a long time. They spend a lot of time on us. They do this for pure joy. The old boys also keep giving us ideas and supporting us. Drama at Peters will be strong in the years to come, pointed out Weerasinghe.
The extract we did (for the winning production), did not focus on Caesar. Even in Julius Caesar he comes in the first act, the main part of Julius Caesar is when he dies. But the main characters are Brutus, Cassius and Casca. They are the people who basically run the show.
Weerasinghe recalled one of their performances at the Royal Interact Drama Competition.
We did a drama on bullying. This was controversial and modern. It examined five different aspects of bullying e.g. bullying by peers, teachers and society. We had five main characters/ actors who played five different roles. These five different actors were directed by five different old boys of St. Peters. It helps you look at the world in a different way. We have a lot of talented old boys. They have so much knowledge and experience in the field of drama and they come back and give everything to college, added Weerasinghe.
*********************
A really good teacher
Vice President of Drama, Sheshan Dias, feels that they look after each other very well. One of our main strengths is that we bond as a cast. Before the play we make sure we have chemistry as a team. We know what everyones strengths and weaknesses are. We build up each others strengths and cover up the weaknesses, said Dias.
Dias felt that the intensity of the competition these days in the Drama Circuit has changed.
These days the competition and the standards are quite high in the Drama Circuit these days. This is especially true when it comes to Shakespeare. Getting into the finals is now a really big matter. Winning is both superb and indescribable, pointed out Dias.
Dias placed emphasis on the importance of having a good director.
Jehan has been very supportive. He can read people very well. He has always been there for us, whenever we have needed him. He is a really good teacher, and has taught us about a lot of things, not only drama but life, stated Dias.
*********************
A lot of experience
Secretary Dylon Walker, spoke about the challenge of taking on a female role. Playing a female role is challenging. It is not something that you are used to. It takes a lot of courage to get into that outfit, and step on stage and act like a female, said Walker.
The experience you get from drama helps you tackle obstacles.
In drama you get a lot of experience, so whatever challenges may come, you know how to handle it. You also learn from your seniors. You are able to cope with any challenge, stated Walker
Walker initially was reluctant to speak in public
I had the fear of public speaking, but I do not have it anymore. This is because of drama. Now I can freely speak and nothing holds me back anymore, explained Walker.
*********************
A talent factory
Past President, Demintha Fonseka, said that St. Peters is a talent factory.
I have come to realize this year, that there is a lot of talent at St. Peters College. Even though there have been old boys who have gone out to do amazing things in the circle of theatre in Sri Lanka, there is still so much talent right now at college. This needs to come out and it needs to be showcased. I think we have a really good team for future years, said Fonseka.
*********************
A long legacy
Past Secretary, Devinda De Silva, feels the young ones at St. Peters are ready to take up the challenge of carrying St. Peters into the future.
Our performance at the recent Royal Drama Competition really proved that. The younger batches are ready. I have seen a performance of St. Peters that I could not believe due to its high standard. It is very important that students come back each year to act with us, because no one becomes a good actor in one year. Our club has a long legacy. The continuance and the fact that these guys keep coming back, have provided an amazing platform for us, said De Silva.
*********************
Enhancing onespersonality
Vice President of Literary Activities, Ayoob Aboosalih, felt that drama enhances ones personality.
Drama has helped me come out a lot as a person. It has really helped me develop my personality.
During these last three years I must say that it has really taught me skills like learning to work with others, said Aboosalih.
*********************
Hard work
Treasurer, Abhishek Fernandez, felt that at St. Peters they are proud of their school.
In a school that is big like this, people expect a lot. So you know that at St. Peters there is a standard to keep. So the amount of work you put in really is a lot. A person gives more than 100 percent. This can be for anything done at St. Peters. Hard work is something that is very important and expected, said Fernandez.
At St. Peters they do a public production every three years. During the years in between, they do three drama competitions. It is a pretty busy schedule. Regardless of the acting pool, the committee is always small. So it is difficult for them to work on inter-house drama as well.
The boys all agreed that their parents have been extremely understanding and tolerant. There two Directors Jehan and Neidra are very accommodating and flexible when it comes to parents. They understand the parental issues.
Practices for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat lasted for a year before the Show Dates, Therefore we took part in and Won Shakes 2016 while practicing for this Public Production which Sold Out 4/5 of its performances

Travel marvel by the sea
Jetwing Hotels has cemented itself as one of the premier hotel chains in Sri Lanka. Over the years it has expanded into one of the most successful hotel chains in the island offering services and facilities that are lavish and spectacular. Their latest property is Jie Jie Beach, a property located in Panadura that is yet another marvel and masterpiece in Jetwings 44 year old history.
Owned by Jie Zhong Jie Lanka Development Construction & Engineering (Pvt) Ltd, Jie Jie Beach is managed by Jetwing Hotels.
Daily News attended the opening of Jie Jie Beach and experienced Jetwings warm hospitality and vibrant spirit which captures the very essence of the brand. Jetwing made a strong statement backed by their distinctive design built on a foundation of passion and love for the hospitality industry.
We are greatly pleased to be introducing another hotel  Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing. This is probably the largest hotel that Jetwing will manage in Sri Lanka. It is all due to Li Jian Guo and his partners from China who came to Sri Lanka and found our island so lucrative. It was he who built this hotel, said Chairman of Jetwing, Hiran Cooray.
When Guo came to meet Jetwing, and spoke of his idea to build a hotel in Panadura he was not taken seriously.
But then we saw the construction and we were amazed at how the project was going on. We were shocked that within 18 months of starting construction they completed this hotel. Now we are privileged to be appointed Managing Agents of this beautiful hotel, stated Cooray.
Jetwing is riding the wave of stability.
We can see that there is a lot of destruction and disturbance in the Western World. More and more tourists are looking at coming into the Southern Hemisphere. We must utilize the opportunity presented by the political stability in the country and for this we are greatly privileged, explained Cooray. Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs John Amaratunga was highly excited at the launch of Jie Jie Beach.
I can vouch for the fact that anyone coming here would love to come back because of the facilities. The construction is marvelous and flawless. It is really encouraging to have the Chinese Workers here. I invite Lee to come and build some more hotels in Sri Lanka.
We have plenty of beaches, heritage sites, Wildlife and all the necessary attractions. We are a wonderful place for tourists. But I think we definitely need to advertise more. We need to take Sri Lankas message of tourism to the rest of the world. Lets hope at least this year we can advertise the beauty of this country so that tourists will be excited about coming to Sri Lanka. We need to step up to the plate and meet this challenge and requirement, said Amaratunga
The Minister also commented that we have so much more to offer that some of the countries in the rest of the world.
There are no seasons in Sri Lanka. All 365 days are good. Any tourists would love to come her and experience our hospitality and services. I think this hotel will definitely flourish, stated Amaratunga.
Li Jian Guo Chairman of Jie Zhong Jie Lanka Development and Construction Engineering is the true hero here.
I am an investor from China and I am involved in the construction industry. I came to Sri Lanka in 2013 and fell in love with the island. I stayed here for a few days and thought it was a lovely land to invest in. I have been in the construction field for 30 years and made a quick decision to build a hotel here, said Guo.
Construction work was started in 2015.
This is a large and magnificent hotel. It is one of the largest hotel projects in Sri Lanka. Even though I am an expert in the construction industry, I dont know how to manage and operate a hotel. This is why I have partnered with Jetwing. They are professionals in the industry. I am definitely expecting to invest in more hotels in Sri Lanka, stated Guo.

UK General Election: Political turmoil awaits after shock results

UK Prime Minister Theresa May's future is looking uncertain after her election gamble appears to have backfired. The opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, has performed far better than polls indicated and is likely to cost May her majority in the UK Parliament.
Update:
Theresa May had hoped that calling a snap election would give her stronger position to negotiate Brexit. But then the results started coming in...
Theresa May's in trouble:Instead of securing an increased majority,May's Conservative partyhas lost seats and, with them, its slender existing majority. Her party has suffered stunning losses while Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour has performed far better than expected.
Coalition of chaosIt's looking increasingly more likely is the prospect of a hung parliament -- which basically means no single party has a majority. In this instance, leaders will have to start thinking about forming coalition governments or reaching agreements with rival parties which, if history is anything to go by, could be a monumental headache.
Result = Brexit-liteWithout the majority she sought, Theresa May will now beunlikely to push through her visionof Brexit unopposed. Leaders in Brussels could be forgiven for thinking that Britain's strategy for handling its departure from the EU might be about to change a bit.
Pound still down:The poundfell sharply against the dollarafter the shock exit poll announcement. It's now trading down about 1.6% as investors fret over the political uncertainty facing the UK.

UK polls race tighter than expected
Britons went to the polls on Thursday in the shadow of terrorism, in an election Prime Minister Theresa May once expected to win easily but has proved increasingly hard to predict.
When May called the snap vote in April, presenting herself as the strong leader to take Britain into Brexit talks, opinion poll ratings for the premier and her center-right Conservative party were sky high.But Islamist attacks in London and Manchester have put her under pressure over her six years as interior minister, while campaign missteps have dented her reputation as a safe pair of hands.
Meanwhile opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, an anti-war campaigner deemed unelectable by a majority of his own lawmakers, has run an energetic campaign promising change and an end to austerity.
While May has been touring target seats around the country, delivering slogan-heavy speeches to small groups of hand-picked activists, Corbyn has drawn large crowds to open-air rallies.
Polling experts  many of whom failed to predict the referendum vote to leave the European Union last year  are now wary of calling the outcome.
While most still expect a Conservative victory, predictions of the margin vary widely, and one shock forecast model even predicted May could lose her majority of 17 in the 650-seat House of Commons.
Id still put my money on a comfortable Tory win  but who knows said Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London.
Speaking to reporters on her plane during a final burst of campaigning on Wednesday, May insisted she had no regrets about calling the vote three years early.
Ive enjoyed the campaign, she said. There is a very clear choice for people when they come to vote, between the coalition of chaos of Jeremy Corbyn, or the strong and stable leadership with me and my team.
Asked what would constitute success, the 60-year-old vicars daughter said: I never predict election results.
Corbyn, a 68-year-old leftwinger who has never held ministerial office and defied the odds to win the Labour leadership two years ago, urged supporters in Glasgow to think big.
The election is Mays first since taking office after Britons voted by 52 percent to leave the European Union, plunging their country into an uncertain future.
May has accused Corbyn of being unprepared for negotiations set to begin on June 19, and unwilling to curb mass migration  a key driver of the Brexit vote.
But her governments record on cutting funding for health and education have also featured strongly in the campaign, to the benefit of Labour.
Jeremy Corbyn just seems more for us, said 38-year-old Debbie Worthy, a mother-of-two in Middlesbrough, northern England.
The Conservatives were also damaged by a manifesto plan for elderly care that would see many people pay more.
Then came the suicide bombing at a Manchester concert on May 22, which killed 22 people including seven children, followed by Saturdays knife and van attack in London, which left eight dead.
As the Conservatives and Labour trade blows, the smaller pro-European Liberal Democrats and the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party (UKIP) have failed to gain much traction.
However the Scottish National Party, which has called for a new independence vote after Brexit, again looks set to dominate north of the English border.

Wesley College will once again go out as favourites as they have a slight edge over their opponents when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season in St. Josephs College Maradana in their Milo A Division inter-school knockout rugby tournament quarterfinal match at the Sugathadasa Stadium today commencing 4.15pm.
Wesley kicked off this years season by losing to formidable Trinity College but went on to beat Prince of Wales Moratuwa, S. Thomas Mount Lavinia, Science College, Zahira Maradana, St. Peters Bambalapitiya and St. Josephs Maradana before losing to league champs Royal and league runners up Isipathana in the just concluded Singer league rugby tournament.
The Josephians started the season with two losses after close battles against Royal and Isipathana before beating Dharmaraja Kandy, St. Anthonys Kandy, arch rivals St. Peters Bambalapitiya, D.S. Senanayake and S. Thomas Mount Lavinia before losing to Wesley and Trinity in the league. Meanwhile Wesley led by centre Avantha Lee will have to watch out for the oppositions speedy three quarters and have to match their opponents really well to prevent winger Vinul Fernandos St. Joseph from scoring through their famous three quarter moves.
The two forward packs are evenly matched, hence a close tussle for supremacy can be expected in todays game and whoever win this encounter will have a semifinal berth next week with Dharmaraja, Kandy.

Speaking at the Asian Views on Americas Role in Asia seminar in Colombo, organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka and the Asia Foundation, he said that the travel ban, curtailing of global economic partnerships, and worker movement restrictions are some of the negative areas.However people also must remember that USA in not a readymade market to sell their products and must look elsewhere as well.
Programmes Director, International Relations, Asia Foundation, John Brandon said he felt that USA is falling behind in the Asian region while China is catching up very fast. Chinas One Belt One Road initiative will push USA even further back with other Asian nations.
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Atul Keshap said that Sri Lanka is still to reap full economic benefits from the assistance it has around the country. If you go to Galle and observe the commercial vessels that operate, one can see what a lot of commercial activity from the shipping sector could be attracted to Sri Lanka. The Indian Ocean too would be a major economic draw in the future and here again Sri Lanka would have opportunities, he said.
Centre for Policy Alternatives Executive Director Dr. Pakiyasothy Saravanamuttu was also a panelist at the seminar. (SS)

Shortage of nutritionists in SL
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne ordered health officials to formulate a cabinet paper to recruit 567 nutritionists, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, at the moment, only 25 nutritionists work in the country and this number of nutritionists is inadequate to educate the public on correct practices to upgrade their nutrition. Considering the requirement, more nutritionists are to be recruited.
At the moment, there are 567 persons in the country who had already completed degrees and also obtained post-graduate qualifications in Nutritional Science. These graduates are to be recruited as nutritionists, the sources said.
Although Sri Lanka has high health indicators such as low maternity and infant mortality rates etc, nutrition is one area that need to further improvement. The normal Body Mass Index (BMI) is between 18.5 to 24.9. People who are bellow 18.5 considered as underweight and the people who are above 25 to 29.9 considered as overweight.
