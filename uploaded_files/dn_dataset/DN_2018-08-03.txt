Cross country development
President Maithripala Sirisenas pledge to spread development equitably to cover all regions of the country, no doubt, would be applauded by all citizens of this country. It was the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa who strove to take development to all corners of the country through his Gam Udawa concept and the garment factory programme. Those who poked fun at these efforts later appreciated his work, and, what is more, continued with the same programmes. The late President who was an individual who identified with the poor was well acquainted with the needs of the ordinary folk and largely catered to this segment of society through his development programmes. Similarly President Sirisena, too, who rose to the top from an ordinary background should be able to emulate President Premadasa to bring the fruits of development to the ordinary people.
True, the village landscape is gradually changing with development making inroads into the hinterland. But on the whole, true development is yet to reach the villages. Some of the far flung villages in the Raja Rata, from where the President hails, have no proper drinking water and the villagers are prone to kidney diseases by drinking contaminated water. Women in tattered clothing are shown on television walking miles with clay pots on their hips to fetch water from dried up tanks and streams. The President, as a son of the Raja Rata should give immediate priority to solving the drinking water problem of the people of Raja Rata. A gigantic water project that covers the entire Raja Rata should be commissioned as a priority measure to alleviate the suffering of these folk.
Neglect of the rural areas in the sphere of development, it was, that fueled the first JVP uprising, with the pithy slogan kolambata kiri apita kekiri underlining this disparity. Hence, the need for equitable development cannot be overemphasized if this sense of discrimination is to be set right. This asymmetrical development also took its toll in other forms such as exacerbating the divide between the town and the village.
Speaking at the opening of 180 projects under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa programme, President Sirisena said he would launch a programme to distribute development work evenly to cover all areas by changing the current lopsided system of development restricted only to a few areas. He said a giant development war would be launched in the country equivalent to the development projects completed in Polonnaruwa. The President added that it would be a people based development programme catering to the heartbeat of the people and one not restricted to a concrete jungle.
The President of course may have been referring to the ego projects undertaken by the Rajapaksa regime to foster the Rajapaksa name in his native Hambantota. It has to be admitted that some of these grandiose projects, far from benefiting the ordinary peasant in Hambantota only went to plunge the country into a massive debt burden. The Hambantota Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium is a classic example of this spending spree indulged in by the Rajapaksas with little or no return to the ordinary folk of Hambantota. This cricket stadium today is all but abandoned and frequented by wild animals, who naturally had to make way for the wasteful project.
For development to be integrated with man and nature it has to be a sustainable development. Over 10,000 acres of jungle cover were cleared for the construction of the Mattala airport causing massive destruction to the animal life and disturbing the ecological balance.
Utmost care, therefore, should be taken not to cause disruption to the pattern of life in the villages when development, as envisaged by the President, is taken to the villages. The President has already stated that he will take steps to increase the countrys forest cover to 32 percent (presently 29%) by 2020. Whatever development therefore should be within this ambit.
Special emphasis should also be laid towards developing the north, which was starved of development during the three decades long civil war. There is huge potential for local industries in the north that could also generate massive employment. The northerners being an enterprising lot, they, no doubt, will make the most of the development benefits. Sri Lanka is an island nation surrounded by the sea but we continue to import fish, causing a severe drain on our foreign exchange. The north would be ideally suited for the setting up of a canned fish industry. Tourism too has massive potential. There is a need to build the necessary infrastructure to promote tourism in the region.
Development should be centred on the needs of the area. The kind of development that will be planned for the central province would not suit the south. Here too, Mattala is a classic example of misguided development, with the airport starved of international flights.
It is hoped that this all out development drive that is to be launched by the President to cover the whole country would receive the support of all political parties. After all, it will not be only members of one political party who will benefit.

Dananjaya plays captains knock to steer Lanka to win
A captains knock of 92 not out by Nipun Dananjaya off 112 balls with seven fours saw Sri Lanka beat India by five wickets with 26 balls to spare in the second Under 19 ODI and square the five-match series 1-all at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Chasing 194 for victory, the Sri Lanka rode on a 92-run fourth wicket partnership between Dananjaya and Pasindu Sooriyabandara who contributed 52 off 71 balls (5 fours) to reach their target comfortably.
Sri Lanka lost Navod Paranavithana to the fifth ball of the innings but recovered through the partnership to register a handsome win.
The Lankan bowlers also played their part earlier with fast bowler Navin Nirmal Fernando striking twice off his first three overs to reduce India to 23-2. He had Anuj Rawat, out for three and Atharwa Taide for eight runs both caught behind by wicketkeeper Nishan Madushka.
Left-arm spinner Shashika Dulshan continued the good work with three wickets for 27 runs that included the wicket of Pavan Shah for 49 scored off 64 balls with 4 fours.
The third ODI will take place at the SSC grounds on Sunday (August 4).

DBS Q2 profit rises 20%
DBS Group Holdings Ltd, Southeast Asias biggest lender, reported a 20 per cent jump in net profit on Thursday (Aug 2), missing market expectations as the impact of business volume growth was moderated by lower trading income.
DBSs profit increase was also supported by improved net interest income and fee income. The net interest income, which refers to interest it earns from loans, rose 18 per cent to S$2.2 billion, with loans growing 12 per cent. Singaporean banks reported record profits last year but the outlook for the sector has been clouded by curbs on property investment imposed last month and a slowdown in economic growth due to international trade tensions, analysts said.

De Kock relieved to score runs against spin
DAMBULLA, Thursday: Man of the Match Quinton de Kock said that he was relieved to finally score runs against spin after going through a lean time during the Test series against Sri Lanka which South Africa lost 2-0.
It was de Kocks knock of 87 off 78 balls that paved the way for South Africa to successfully chase down Sri Lankas total of 244-8 and win by four wickets.
Feeling more satisfied than I was after the Test matches. It was quite tough then. Coming out to white balls and a change of format and adding value to the team is always nice. Its great to also be on the winning team in Sri Lanka, said De Kock at the post-match conference.
Coming from the Test series it was quite difficult to play spin especially when the wickets have been given the chance to deteriorate over the last couple of days. Its always nice to come in with the white ball, and have spin that is a bit more true. We practiced hard during the Test series to deal with the spin, so its just nice for me and the team to finally play spin properly, he said.
The key to South Africas success with the white ball is their fast bowlers getting the early breakthroughs and pushing Sri Lanka onto the back foot.
In the one-day format its always nice taking wickets up front. I think thats the goal for any bowling side. The more wickets you take up front the more you control the middle. Thats the plan, said De Kock.
It was a mission to go 2-0, and hopefully well go to 3-0 and win the series in a great way, and then hopefully well win the last two after that. Thats what were pushing for. The Test series was a tough one for us, so were trying to play our best cricket now in the one-day format.  ST

Detecting explosives the mongoose way
The Sri Lanka Army Corps of Engineers research arm has launched a pilot project to study the possibility of utilising the indigenous grey mongoose for the detection of explosives.
This project was initially launched on a concept by former Commander of the Engineer brigade, Brigadier (Rtd.) Amith Seneviratne. The project was encouraged by former Army Commander General (Rtd.) A.W.J.C. De Silva. This research project is currently progressing under the supervision of the Director General of the Armys Research Analysis Projection and Development arm, Major General K.R.P. Rowel, on the directive of Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake.
Speaking to the Daily News, Major Supun Herath, who is involved with the programme, said the Corps of Engineers of the Sri Lanka Army is the only unit that deals with explosives. We initially used detectors to trace explosives. Later, dogs were used for the detection of explosives. However, one of the biggest issues with dogs is that it is a very expensive operation as we cannot breed them locally. We have to import them from Europe or America and train them to detect explosives. It costs around Rs. 2 million to import a dog.
Dogs can sniff out explosives and other parts of the mine or UXO (unexploded ordnance) body. They are therefore commonly used within mine and UXO detection programmes. Examples of dogs used for landmine clearance go back to the Second World War and in more recent times, to the Vietnam War and, of course, Sri Lanka. Dogs were first employed for humanitarian demining in Afghanistan, which today features one of the largest and most successful mine dog detection programmes.
Training a dog to detect explosives is difficult and time-consuming, and can take from three months to several years. A mine detection dog may well be trained far from the country where it is later to be deployed, but a period of acclimatisation and adaptation to the new climate, the soil and the mine or UXO type in the operating area is always required. This period can take from one to six months depending on whether there is a need to train new dog handlers from the target area too.
The price of a high-quality mine dog is high, while other limiting factors are unfavourable climatic conditions (such as excessive heat and humidity, too much wind or wind blowing in the wrong direction), thick vegetation, and dense minefields. The latter will result in a complete contamination of the wider area and thereby confuse the dog. Daily working hours vary from a few hours to six or seven hours per day. Dogs tend to work for shorter periods in hot climates, while they are able to work for longer periods where it is colder. A mine dog can scour a few hundred to a thousand square metres per day (figures vary sharply), depending on local conditions and training. However, like humans, dogs may have bad days where motivation is low.
Mine dog detection is far from a perfect science and the detection rate (efficiency) can vary significantly. Meanwhile, other possibilities are also being explored to ascertain the most cost-effective manner of undertaking mine detection. Currently, it is believed that over 500 dogs are being used worldwide for this purpose.
We too began to look into the possibility of other cost-effective alternatives. Brigadier Seneviratne had initially done a study in 2016 on whether the mongoose can be used for the detection of explosives. We also found that a local university had undertaken research and found that the mongoose can be used for explosives detection, apart from dogs. Other than that, we had no research to go on, said Major Herath.
The initial experiments were done with the wet zone reddish mongoose and the dry zone grey mongoose, and of the two, the grey mongoose showed greater sniffing capability than its counterpart.
While training dogs in explosives detection, we use the reward method, where they are rewarded when they respond well to the training. Hence, we began experiments with the mongoose to see how they responded to the same reward system. We used both species of mongoose for this initial experiment and our experiments established that the dry zone grey mongoose showed greater ability to sniff out explosives. We also did research on the direction of the sniffing capabilities of the grey mongoose. As with dogs, they only have downward sniffing capability, which means that they can more accurately sniff areas below their feet rather than scents at a fair distance or above their head. Dogs rarely have upward sniffing capability. However, with the grey mongoose, they have a wider sniffing range.
In 2017, we recruited a specialist who was knowledgeable about the mongoose and its behaviour, food habits, and capabilities. Then we undertook the research and were amazed at the mongooses sniffing capability and response to reward-based training, he said, adding that as a secondary project, the Army was looking at breeding possibilities under a controlled system.
Currently, we have around nine mongooses in our research programme, and, of them, one has been trained to a very satisfactory level. We have so utilised funds allocated by the Army for research purposes. Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake has given his approval for this project and we intend to undertake further research in terms of training the grey mongoose in explosives detection, and also undertake research on the possibility of breeding the mongoose locally.
Meanwhile, visiting scholar at Harvard Universitys School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and 2008-09 Radcliffe Institute Fellow Thrishantha Nanayakkara and a group from Moratuwa University have done an explosives' detection study using the mongoose. They picked an indigenous mongoose for its temperament, size (roughly 2.5 kilogrammes, light enough to step on a mine without detonating it), and sense of smell (ability to detect explosives three metres away).
Nanayakkara equipped a robot (roughly a metre tall and half-a-metre wide) with a harness to keep the mongoose under control and a video camera to record its findings. Although the mongoose walks a few feet ahead, the robot with its eight metal legs sets the pace. During the test run, the pair went back and forth across a 10-by-10-metre plot, stopping whenever the mongoose detected a mine, which it indicated by sitting up (as it was trained to do). In a mornings work, the mongoose found every mine, proving its effectiveness in explosives detection.
The success of the initial experiments bring great hope that the indigenous grey mongoose could prove to be a cheaper alternative in explosives and mine detection than the far more expensive method of using imported dogs.

England 9-1 at 2nd day close,  Kohli, hits first ton in England
Birmingham, Thursday: England were nine for one in their second innings, a lead of 22 runs, at stumps on the second day of the first Test against India at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Alastair Cook was out for a duck to what became the last ball of the day when Englands all-time leading Test run-scorer, for the second time in the match, was drawn forward and bowled by a superb delivery from off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin that pitched on middle and hit off stump.
Keaton Jennings was five not out.
India were facing a large first-innings deficit at 182 for eight but skipper Virat Kohli, dropped twice, made a superb 149 his maiden Test century in England in a total of 274.
He was eventually last man out, with India just 13 runs adrift of Englands first innings 287.
This is Englands 1,000th Test and the first of a five-match series.
Kohli, one of the outstanding batsmen of his generation, managed just 134 runs in five Tests at an average of 13.4 on his maiden tour of England four years ago.
But the now 29-year-old India skipper surpassed that total in one innings with a knock of 149 during the second days play of the series opener at Edgbaston.
Kohli was on 97 when No 11 Umesh Yadav walked out to bat, with India 217 for nine in reply to Englands first innings 287.
But a late cut four off all-rounder Ben Stokes, his 14th boundary in 172 balls, saw Kohli to a 22nd Test hundred in what is the first of a five-match series.
However, England slip fielder Dawid Malan dropped Kohli twice, on 21 and 51, with James Anderson and Stokes the unlucky bowlers.
Kohli then topped his 2014 series total in the one knock with a two off leg-spinner Adil Rashid.
He was last man out when, cutting at Rashid, he was caught at backward point by Stuart Broad.
In total, Kohli batted for nearly five hours, faced 225 balls, including 22 fours and a six.
He dominated a last-wicket stand of 57 with Umesh Yadav, who made just one, with India just 13 runs adrift at 274 all out. AFP

Excellence in ugliness!
Dog owners are encouraged to flaunt their pets' imperfections
The winner of The World's Ugliest Dog 2018 is a nine-year-old English bulldog.
The unattractive pooch, named Zsa Zsa, won the title at Sonoma-Marin Fairgrounds in Petaluma, California.
The annual competition started as a parody of more traditional pure-breed dog contests, with hounds flaunting their hairless bodies, lolling tongues or unusual eyes.
But there is an incentive for people to enter their pups in this fairly ridiculous annual event.
Zsa Zsas owner, Megan Brainard of Anoka, Minnesota, will receive an impressive $1,500 (around 1,130) for the win.
Although a common feature of the breed, this English bulldog is particularly recognisable for her long tongue that almost touches the floor.
Her short, squat legs were given an extra special touch, as Zsa Zsa sported hot-pink nail polish.
Although a tongue-in-cheek event, the winner of this year's event highlights a broader issue with dog breeding.
English bulldogs so inbred their health problems are here to stay
English bulldogs are one of the most inbred types of dogs, with some geneticists saying the problem is now so bad their health will never be able to improve.
They often suffer from a range of health problems and ailments.
Their heavily wrinkled faces are prone to skin infections, and their narrow nostrils mean they often having breathing difficulties.

The forthcoming Provincial Council election should be conducted according to the new electoral system by resolving technical problems encountered during the recent local council elections, the Civil Society Action Committee on Provincial Council Elections has emphasized.
The election authorities should not try to steer the country back to the former election system Prof. Sudantha Liyanage, a member of the committee and Dean of the Faculty of Applied Sciences Sri Jayawardenepura University, said. He was speaking at a press conference at the National Library services and Documentation Board auditorium Colombo yesterday (August 2).
Prof. Liyanage said that even through the number of elected representatives increased at the local elections under the new system such a scenario will not occur during the Provincial Council elections under the new system.
He said the Civil Society Action Committee has already submitted its observation and analysis report on the Provincial Council elections system to the Speaker and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister.
The government should study this report based on six subjects and take steps to hold the Provincial Council election according to the new system, he said.
Executive Director, PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi said that although people had a high literary rate in Education their literary rate on elections was still at a low level.
He said the terms of three Provincial Councils had already expired and the number of Provincial Councils which had to go for elections would become six before the year end.
Their report would help overcome all deficiencies in the new electoral system, he said. If their proposals were implemented, there would be no need to postpone election anymore.

Govt. to write off loans  taken by drought affected
The government has allocated Rs. 1 billion to write off debts of 75,000 women from 12 drought affected districts who had taken a Rs. 100,000 loan or less, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. All micro-finance companies have been asked to submit the list of the debtors by August 31.
Finance companies and microfinance companies have been asked to send a list to the Treasury of all such loans which are three months in arrears as at June 3, this year, he said. The list will be verified by the Government Agents and submitted to the Finance Ministry.
He said the Ministry would finalise the list and would settle the loans by giving the assurance that the capital will be paid to these finance companies in bi-annual installments in three years.

It was revealed that 70 to 80 per cent of women from Polonnaruwa were heavily indebted to these finance companies.
We will studying amendments proposed by the Central Bank to regulate these mico-finance companies. We will make amendments to the Micro-finance Act and make it compulsory, he said.
We are looking at setting up a Micro-finance Regulatory Body to look into the complexities of this problem. He said the changes would be effected before the next budget proposals.
Senior Advisor to the Finance Ministry Mano Tittawella said a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the finance companies and micro-finance institutions with the Ministry also stipulates a cap on interest rate of 35 per cent per annum for all future mico-finance loans.
Referring to the issue as a national tragedy, the Finance Minister said the government felt it had a moral duty to intervene and alleviate the livelihood of these women to recover from the debt trap.

Htota Port set to accomplish  top position in region
Just about six months into its operations, and the Hambantota port is gearing up to become the number one port in the region. A combination of factors is carefully designed and put together to achieve this goal.
We in Sri Lanka have all been aware of the advantages of this location for centuries now, it being just a little less than half a nautical mile from the sea lanes itself makes it obvious. But what was necessary to push this into the limelight, was the right partnerships and this is what CMPort brings to the table. Cpt. Ravindra Jayawickreme, CEO of Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS) said.
The CEO says that Hambantota is being developed into a multipurpose port, which will provide a variety of services such as handling containers, break bulk, RORO, passenger, oil, bulk terminal, gas and project cargo. The port is slated to become one of a kind, as it will be the only port in the country, designed to handle the full gamut of services in the maritime and logistics area.
The port will be providing off port services including the supply of ship stores, provisions, and facilitating crew changes, said Tissa Wickramasinghe, COO of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG).
By implementing this Ship Supply Services at off port limits of Hambantota, the port also intends handling the refueling of vessels while they are on the move on the sea lanes.
All of these services are being introduced in planned phases and the port has already commissioned Atkins Limited a firm specialised in designing globally renowned ports, to fast track the master plan of the port.Soon after they took over, HIPG began Dry Bulk, Break Bulk operations in the port, whereas previously the port handled only RORO operations. Another important change that took place was the considerable increase in RORO volumes under HIPG management. In the first half of 2018 alone, HIPG handled 106,135 vehicles and 153 ships, whist showing a year on year growth of 85% and 17% respectively. The company has also installed CCTV systems to increase security in the port especially to ensure the safety of valuable cargo such as vehicles that are being handled at the Hambantota port.
At the time HIPG took over the port, wharf clerks who entered the port for vehicle clearance did not have proper facilities, which the company took immediate steps to remedy, installing air-conditioned rest areas with washroom facilities. Vehicle clearance procedures have also been streamlined to provide a more efficient service overall. Other facilities the Hambantota port would offer includes bonded warehousing for related businesses, ship repairs/urgent ship services inside the port by providing sheltered piers for the vessels and bunkering which would be ready to commence by the end of 2018. The port has already invested in two modern bunker barges to develop this business.
HIPG under their Energy Hub concept has plans to develop and increase facilities for LPG handling, for which they intend partnering with companies such as Litro and Laugfs gas.
This will vastly benefit LPG users in the country and also enable the port to be a distributor of LPG to the region.
The proposed LNG plant will provide leadership for the whole region to support the IMO 2020 rule of limiting global sulfur emissions for marine fuels up to 0.5% by 2020.
HIPG has just implemented a Bulk Terminal Operating System (BTOS), in the Hambantota port to further improve service levels and efficiency which has brought system to the ports operation process.
The system will also allow the monitoring of productivity and remaining move count, from anywhere in the world.
The Hambantota Port is managed by Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) and Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), two new companies set up by China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

Jaffna College Director Board blames Trustees
The Board of Directors of Jaffna College issuing a statement allege that the Trustees of Jaffna College Funds (TJCF) attempt to reduce the fund for the college in various ways. The statement says the TJCF has sent a letter to the Board threatening to starve the school of funds unless, among other demands, the Chair and Vice Chair of the school board resign.
Full statement:
The Board of Directors of Jaffna College is greatly concerned by a recent letter sent to us by the Trustees of Jaffna College Funds (TJCF), a sizeable Trust Fund based in Boston, USA established more than 140 years ago for the sole purpose of supporting Jaffna College. The letter-made public by the Trustees-threatens to starve the school of funds unless, among other demands, the Chair and Vice-Chair of the school board resign.
Rt. Rev. Daniel Thiagarajah is the Bishop in Jaffna of the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India, and is
the ex officio Chairperson of the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Constitution of Jaffna College. This is similar to the position of the Boards of Directors of several other leading schools in the country. The Vice Chairperson of the Board is Ms. Vijula Arulanantham, a senior legal practitioner in Sri Lanka and a
member of the Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) and is a critical asset in the Board who provides invaluable legal advice in these trying times.
This demand of the Trustees is the latest in a long series of actions by them, taken in blatant violation of their legal and ethical duty as Trustees. The Trustees have changed the Trust deed on several occasions.These changes were made without consultation with Jaffna College or the Board. The Trustees have even attempted to replace Jaffna College as the supported organisation or chief beneficiary of the Fund, despite the original 1877 Trust Deed expressly stating that The purpose for which the Corporation is constituted is to obtain, hold and manage funds for supporting Jaffna College.
In these attempts to replace Jaffna College as the chief beneficiary, the Trustees misappropriated funds from the Trust Fund of the school in order to pay for their own legal fees.
In January 2017, the Trustees announced their decision to reduce Jaffna College funding by 20 per cent and imposed a number of largely unreasonable and unnecessary governance changes. This drastic (and illegal) reduction of funds placed a great strain on the school, greatly hampering educational activity. In an attempt to resolve matters harmoniously in the interests of the school however, the Jaffna College Board and Principal worked strongly to address all issues raised by Trustees that the Board considered would benefit the College. The Trustees, however, have continued to act duplicitously, as evidenced by this latest demand.
It is a matter of great regret and sadness that this iconic school has suffered significantly due to the self-interested actions of a few individuals. The Board of Directors will continue to take necessary action, including legal steps, to prevent the closure of Jaffna School.

Lankasoy enters European Market
Convenience Foods (Lanka) PLC, market leader in the manufacture and marketing of textured soy protein products under the Lankasoy brand in Sri Lanka, recently announced that it has successful entered into the European market. Being a subsidiary of the countrys premier food manufacturer  Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL), Convenience Foods recently tied up with a leading Dutch dealer, securing a supply of consignment to Netherlands.
Convenience Foods delivers a range of innovative and high quality textured soy protein (TSP) products under household brand name Lankasoy. Being the pioneer in introducing soy nuggets to the Sri Lankan consumers, Lankasoy has been instrumental in developing and shaping the soy food market by introducing an exciting range of flavours for vegetarian and non-vegetarian consumers. This in turn has made Lankasoy a trendsetter for its counterparts and even inspired a number of new brands to enter the local market. Elevating its standards and heightening its product innovation, Lankasoy has delivered a host of shapes and revolutionary flavours to suit the taste spectrum of its discerning consumers. And over the years the brand has steadily grown, spreading its foot print in both local and overseas markets. At present, Lankasoy products thrive in Middle Eastern and Maldivian markets, thereby making the entry to European market yet another iconic achievement for Lankasoy.
Commenting on the occasion, Thilanka De Soyza, Managing Director of Convenience Foods (Lanka) PLC noted, We are the pioneers in soy manufacturing and marketing in Sri Lanka, and our products have been accredited both locally and internationally with ISO 22000, HACCP, ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 and GMP certification in addition to SLS.
Garnering these certifications have given the edge to Lankasoy as a brand on par with the global food quality standards. European food standards are one of the highest in the world, and our partnership with the Dutch market clearly testifies the superior quality of Lankasoy products. We believe that the new synergy will not only help us establish a strong footprint in Dutch market, but also open new avenues to effectively penetrate the rest of the European market.

LB Finance introduces First Aid training programmes for three wheel drivers
Aiming to fulfill a specific need of the community through the Companys CSR agenda, LB Finance has introduced a First Aid training programme to three wheel drivers with the support
of well-establish Training partner , BeSmart Solutions ( pvt) Ltd. The training programme which aims to fill the knowledge gap in three wheel drivers consists of theoretical and practical
training sessions on a range of first aid techniques including performing Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and safe transportation of casualties.
The pilot programme of the entire project is scheduled to take place in Matara in partnership with the Three Wheel Drivers
Association and the motor traffic division of Superintendent police office, Matara with the participation of 100 three wheel drivers. Upon completion of the pilot project, LB Finance plans to implement a series of similar training sessions across the nation. Statistics compiled by Sri Lanka Police indicate that in year 2016 the total number of accidental road deaths reached an alarming total of 3,003. General observations indicate that three wheel drivers are quick to act on such occasions to provide aid and transportation services.
Once LB Finance became aware of this situation, the Company took the initiative to launch a training programme of this nature in a bid to minimize road accident casualties.
When requested to comment on the training programme, Sumith Adhihetty, Managing Director of LB Finance said, it is a known fact that generally three wheel drivers often come
to the rescue of unfortunate victims of road accidents. However, lack of knowledge and training puts these victims at the risk of losing their lives or suffering serious complications during
transportation to the hospital or prior to that due to improper administration of first aid.
Introduction of this training programme is our way of filling this vacuum through training three wheel drivers. The pilot project in Matara will enable us to identify the practical requirements and redesign the programme. Once we are ready to launch the programme island-wide, we plan to train approximately 1000 three wheel drivers during the first phase itself.
The pilot training session will include four separate training sessions during which 25 selected three wheel drivers will train under a professional First Aid Trainer. The First Aid Trainer will cover both theoretical and the practical part of First Aid training using modern techniques and tools.
Once the training programme concludes, the participants each will receive a portable first aid kit as well as a sticker confirming that he or she has undergone professional training in
administration of first aid.
This is a worthy cause that we are pleased to introduce for the benefit of all Sri Lankans. I am confident that with proper training, three wheel drivers will be able to effectively help victims of road accidents, said Suresh Nalaka, OIC - Motor Traffic Division of Superintendent Police office, Matara . LB Finance has continued to remain a pioneer in aligning the needs and interests of Sri Lanka with the many CSR initiatives carried out over the years. As a responsible corporate citizen,
LB Finance has etched CSR as one of the top priorities amongst the various business activities it engages in. The commitment to uplift the well-being of citizens of the nation with initiatives as
such is a strong depiction of LB Finance pledge to factor social responsibility and sustainability into their business.

Never to be forgotten
PRINCE WILLIAM and Prince Harry each selected a very personal item to remember their mother, Princess Diana, following her tragic death in 1997, it has been revealed.
After Princess Diana was killed in a shocking 1997 car crash both of her sons chose a keepsake from amongst her personal belongings to remember her by.
They were taken to Kensington Palace to make the selection according to a source close to the Royals.
Prince William chose a gorgeous Cartier watch whilst Harry selected her stunning diamond and sapphire engagement ring.
A source told the Daily Star: William picked his mums Cartier watch, and Harry picked her sapphire and diamond engagement ring.
In an extraordinary sign of brotherly love, Harry later gave the ring to William, who used it to propose to the Duchess of Cambridge, during a romantic Kenyan holiday in 2010.
William said using the ring was his way of ensuring his beloved mother had a presence at his wedding.
In addition to personal possessions, Princess Diana left a small fortune, which was given to her boys as they grew up.
She left 13million which came from her divorce settlement from Prince Charles as well as shares, cash and personal items. However this figure fell to 8million after death duties.
The money was shared equally between William and Harry.
The two princes each got some of the money when they reached 25, but had to wait until the age of 30 for the full amount.
Management by royal advisors meant the inheritance had increased to 20million by the time it was given to William and Harry.
A Royal insider told The Mirror: There is no way Harry would dodge tax. There are few similarities between the average person and Harry and William but when it comes to tax, they also have to pay their way. "William got hit with a hefty bill when he turned 30.
His aides have to work out the most tax-efficient way for him to handle the money."
When Harry turned 30 the boys also inherited many of Dianas personal items, including her stunning David and Elizabeth Emanuel wedding dress.

SPGMAS supra grade promotion issue:
Petition filed for limited competitive exam
Three persons had submitted a petition to Southern Provincial Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakarathna, pleading for a Writ of Mandamus directing the Southern Province Governors secretary to hold the respective competitive limited examination for the appointment of officers of the Southern Provincial Government Management Assistant Service (SPGMAS), to the supra grade of the same position.
The petitioners pleaded for the suspension of the decision of the Southern Province Governors secretary, to recruit personnel to fill the existing supra grade vacancies in the service based on the merits of the respective competitive examination held in 2016.
Diyunage Prasanna of Bataganwila, Galle; Metaramba Kanaththa Gamage Nalina of Uluwitike, Galle; and Gothatuwe Parana Widanalage Hemantha of Gothatuwa, Baddegama; had filed the application for the Writ of Mandamus.
The Southern Province Public Services Commission located at the Galle District Secretariat, SP Public Service Commissions secretary, SP Governors secretary, Southern Provincial Council Secretary, W. H. Nandani of the Southern Province Ayurveda Department, M. Sandya of the Tissamaharama Base Hospital, K. K. Jayanthi of Matara, the District Engineers Services Office, A. W. P Malkanthi of the Matara Cooperative Development Commissioners Office and G. H. S. Dayawathi of the Southern Province Chief Secretariat had been cited as respondents.
The first respondent is the appointing authority of the above appointments, while the second respondent is the secretary of the said commission. The fourth is the appointing authority of the Provincial Council subject to the approval of the first respondent and the third is the secretary to the SP Governor. The fifth to ninth respondents are the prospective appointees whose appointments are challenged by the petition.
The petitioners, in their submissions, had stated that they were Grade 3 officers of the permanent cadre of the SPGMAS who had applied for the limited competitive examination 2018, for the promotion to the super grade of the same post.
They charged that despite the fact that there were numerous officers who were eligible to be promoted to the supra grade after sitting for the due competitive examination, the first respondent allegedly promoted officers based on results of the examination held two years back, in 2016. However, when the case was taken up in courts, the respondents, who assured to stop the alleged process of promoting officers to the supra grade until a decision over the petition was arrived at, requested for a date to make their submissions with regard to the petition.
The Galle High Court Judge, considering the submissions made by the defence, postponed the hearing of the case till August 9. The petitioners were represented by Attorney-at-Law Rajindra Narangoda.

POLICE STEP UP ANTI GANG OPS IN NORTH
The Police have increased rounding up and intelligence gathering operations in the North to apprehend members of sword gangs terrorising the area and STF motorcycle squads have also been deployed in Jaffna round the clock to ensure the safety of civilians, Northern Province Senior DIG Roshan Fernando said.
Speaking to the Daily News, Fernando said this was nothing new as the police have been arresting the sword gang members over the past few months. But when they are produced in court, they are released on bail after a few weeks. Hence, they come back and revert to the same activities. Most of the sword gang members are those whom we arrested last year, but they have been released by the courts. Some of them caught by the police and produced in court dont want to go back to these gang activities, but due to pressure from other gang members and their situation of being unemployed, they are compelled to join these gangs as they are threatened if they dont, he said.
There are ten specially trained Police STF motorcycle riders in addition to several other motorcycle units from Jaffna included in this unit which would be deployed to patrol the areas 24 hours.
He also noted that the leave of all police personnel had been cancelled to facilitate this special operation.
He further noted that an additional contingent of police intelligence officers in plain clothes have also been deployed in areas where the highest number of sword related incidents have been reported, namely Kopai, Manipai and Chavakachcheri.
He noted that it was a small group of sword wielding criminals who were terrorising the people and committing various robberies and crimes, but assured that these gangs would be apprehended by the police and brought to book very soon.
According to the Senior DIG, all police officers deployed for duty have been issued specific instructions and ordered to arrest anyone engaged in these unlawful activities irrespective of their positions or status.
Meanwhile, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake on a visit to Jaffna pooh-phooed as completely false reports that the Jaffna Fort had been declared out of bounds for the Army.
The Army Commander denied these reports speaking to the media after a tour of the Jaffna Fort. He was responding to a statement made by Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeywardena quoting a media report recently.
I wish to state that the Army had been in deployment in this area for a considerable period and this is not the first time the Army has shown its presence within the Jaffna Fort, the Commander said. The Army will continue to be stationed in the Fort area as usual and it has no reason whatsoever to leave the Fort, he said. The Army will also receive any citizen or institution visiting the Fort with open arms and it will always be ready to co-operate with them.
The Army Commander aid while travelling from Katunayake to Palaly I took the opportunity to have a discussion with Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. During the discussions, we first focused on security matters as well as the release of land to the ordinary citizens and how quickly it could be done, the Commander added.

## Title: Preventing Feline Leukemia Virus

Cat Care:
Preventing Feline Leukemia Virus
Feline leukemia virus which first discovered in the 1960s, is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely inhibit a cats immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesnt always manifest symptoms right away, any new cat entering a household and any sick cat should be tested for FeLV. FeLV weakens an animals immune system and predisposes cats to a variety of infections and diseases, including anemia, kidney disease and lymphosarcoma, a highly malignant and fatal cancer of the lymph system.
Who gets the disease:-
Young kittens and cats less than one year of age are most susceptible to the virus. Cats living with an infected cat, allowed outdoors where they may be bitten by an infected cat, and kittens born to a mother who is FeLV positive are most at risk for infection.
How the virus spreads:-
The FeLV virus is shed in many bodily fluids, including saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces and blood. FeLV is most commonly transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and through sharing litter boxes, food and water bowls. It can also be passed in utero or through mothers milk. Infected outdoor cats fighting with other cats can transmit the disease through bites and scratches.
Signs of FeLV:-
Cats can be infected and show no signs. Others may exhibit: loss of appetite and weight loss, pale or inflamed gums, poor coat condition, abcesses, fever, upper respiratory infections, diarrhea and vomiting, seizures, changes in behavior, vision or other eye problems, enlarged lymph nodes, reproductive problems (in females), jaundice, chronic skin disease, respiratory distress, lethargy
Preventing FeLV
There is a vaccine available for cats who are at risk of contracting FeLV. Healthy cats over three months of age and vaccinated for FeLV are highly unlikely to contract the virus from another cat. Like all vaccines, there are risks involved in vaccination, and the vaccine is not a 100% guarantee against infection. Your veterinarian can best evaluate whether this vaccine is right for your cat. As with any infectious disease, the best prevention is eliminating sources of exposure. Routine FeLV testing and keeping your cat indoors and away from cats whose FeLV status is not known remain the best way to prevent your cat from becoming infected.
How to Diagnose FeLV
There are several types of tests available to diagnose FeLV. Modern animal clinics in Sri Lanka also have the facility test FeLV. Therefore it is always better to test your cat at least one a year for FeLV from a reputable animal clinic.
Caring for a Cat with FeLV
If your cat is found positive for FeLV infection good management practices enhance the better life of the cat until rest in peace. Feed your cat a nutritionally balanced diet. Do not feed raw meat, eggs and unpasteurized dairy products, which can harbor bacteria and parasites and lead to infection.
Provide a quiet place for your cat to rest indoors and away from other cats who could promote disease. Bring your cat to the vet every six months for a wellness checkup and blood tests. During the early stages of infection, a cat may not show any clinical signs, but he can still pass the virus to other cats.
Its not advisable to introduce a new uninfected cat into the household, even one who has been properly vaccinated against FeLV. Those living in close quarters with infected cats are most at risk for infection, and should be tested for the virus and, if negative, be housed separately.
Do humans get the disease
FeLV is contagious to other cats, but not to humans or other species. Other cats in the house can acquire the virus from an infected cat. Though the virus doesnt live long outside of the body, and is easily inactivated with common disinfectants.
Complete cure for FeLV
Sadly there is no cure for FeLV, and it is estimated that less than 20% of clinically infected cats survive more than three years of active infection. In the case of those cats who develop cancer, chemotherapy can help prolong life, but treatment often focuses on providing the best quality of life.

RADA case : Warnasinghe alleges Rs.200 mn given to Emil Kanthan
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe, a witness in the controversial RADA case yesterday told the Colombo High Court that Tiran Alles, the first accused in the case, at a media briefing in 2010 had mentioned how he witnessed bags containing millions of rupees been given to a LTTE leader Emil Khanthan.
Warnasinghe, the first witness in the case revealed these facts while he was cross-examined by defence counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty PC when the case filed against former MP Tiran Alles and three others in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006 was taken up for trial yesterday.
Warnasinghe said Tiran Alles had convened a press briefing at his Nawala residence on January 22, 2010 when his residence came under a grenade attack. He further said he is in a position to present the concerned video if necessary. This financial transaction with the LTTE had been revealed in Parliament by late MP Sripathi Suriyaarachchi, the witness said.
Meanwhile, Nishantha Warnasinghe said he and a group including Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera were asked to move out of the Mavil Aru area by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in July 2006 questioning as to how we fight with the LTTE if government entangled in a war.
The witness said at that time JHU leader Champika Ranawaka had been summoned to Temple Trees by former President Rajapaksa and asked to call back the group led by Rathana Thera. The former President had informed Champika Ranawaka that the situation can led to a war unless they were moved out of the Mavil Aru area.
The witness reiterated that they were asked to move out of the Mavil Aru area by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa since they were negotiating with a former LTTE finance head Emil Kanthan and a LTTEer called Elilan.
In reply to a question posted by Defence Counsel, the witness affirmed his previous statement that he and a group including Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Akmeemana Dayaratne Thera who reached the Mavil Aru area to open the Mavil Aru anicut sluice gate from the clutches of LTTE were told to move out of the area by the then President and Defence Secretary.
Meanwhile,the Defence Counsel tendered in court an affidavit given by Ven. Akmeemana Dayaratne Thera that he and others were not asked to move out of the Mavil Aru area by former the President or the former Defence Secretary. However, the witness rejected the facts mentioned in the affidavit and confirmed the validity of his earlier evidence.
The Defence counsel further tendered in court affidavits given by Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thera, Counsel Maithri Gunaratne citing that they did not peruse any document pertaining to RADA fraud after being the members of the Anti-Corruption Front.
Warnasinghe said Rs.200 million had been given to the LTTE through Emil Kanthan and LTTEer called Elilan on the pretext of constructing houses in the Northern and Eastern provinces.
Witness Nishantha Warnasinghe was testifying before Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi and evidence was led by Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris. He was cross-examined by Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty. The first witness will be further cross-examined on August 2.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused-former RADA Chairman Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with controversial RADA fraud.

## Title: Raw oysters are alive when you eat them

Raw oysters are alive when you eat them
If youve ever eaten raw oysters lying open on a bed of ice with a fresh wedge of lemon, or Tabasco or vinegar to drizzle over them, those oysters will have been alive.
Those salty little (supposed) aphrodisiacs were living and breathing organisms when you snapped them for Instagram and tipped their shells towards your lips and thats a good thing.
Dead oysters cannot be eaten raw, because they contain bacteria that can be very dangerous for humans. If you eat a dead oyster raw, youre probably going to get poorly (fever/chills, vomiting, diarrhoea  among other symptoms).
But if you want to enjoy your oysters raw (and alive), are you causing them pain
Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to improve efficiency and raise standards across the seafood industry, say that whether or not oysters feel pain is still up for debate.
Unfortunately theres no definitive proof either way. There are groups that argue oysters might feel pain, and others who say because they dont have a central nervous system then they dont feel pain in the way other seafood species might. We currently dont have research in this area. As for when they actually die, this is likely to happen when they are shucked, rather than when they are chewed or swallowed.
Shucking is when the two shells of an oyster are levered apart and fully opened. So oysters probably arent alive when you bite into them or when they hit your stomach if you choose to swallow them whole.
If youve bought oysters to open and eat raw at home, you can tell whether an oyster is safe to eat raw quite easily. Is the shell completely closed If so, the oyster inside should be alive. If the shell is slightly open, flick it with your finger. The shell should close.
If it doesnt, that means the oyster inside is dead and should only be eaten cooked.
Bruce Rennie of chef and owner of The Shore, Penzance told Metro.co.uk:
You really want to eat the oysters when the lid is tightly closed and shuck them yourself to guarantee freshness. Also its best to store them in the fridge with the deep part of the shell downwards to retain the moisture before preparing them, they should easily live 5-7 days in a properly chilled fridge like this. The reason for eating them alive is simply for freshness and flavour as they still have most of their iron/sea flavoured juices within the meat. Personally, I love the iron flavour. They are far more versatile than most people give credit for. Currently I have Porthilly oysters on poached with mackerel, cucumber, sesame and wasabibut they are also great breaded and fried or tempura as an easy introduction to them. They were classically paired with meat dishes due to the strong iron flavour and used to be cheaper than most meat.
Remember that if you buy shell-less oysters in a bag or jar, theyre absolutely not intended to be eaten raw. You must cook them.

Real-life Aladdin takes to the streets
Arabian nights have nothing on this chap, who has taken to Middle Eastern streets decked out as Aladdin - complete with his own magic carpet.
The fun-loving fez wearer was the talk of Israel when he took to city streets complete with his own mythical rug. And he quickly became a viral hero, with fans sharing pictures and video of him wooshing around on his tasselled transport in regal purple.
Thanks to his harem trousers and nifty violet waistcoat, he drew comparisons to the star of the 1992 animated Disney film.
The original Aladdin was a popular Middle East story retold as Arabian Nights.
The broke young man hooks up with the genie of the lamp and has his wishes granted - but his route to success is not as straightforward as all that. The modern day Aladdin filmed for Facebook has been praised for his commitment and investment in getting the outfit together.
One poster wrote: "lol awesome," while another added, "[He] forgot to bring you a magic lamp."

Request to revise  ministers, MPs salaries
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is yet to make a final decision on increasing salaries of MPs and Ministers, Parliament sources said.
He said a request to increase salaries of ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and parliamentarians on par with those of judges had come up during a Party Leaders Meeting held last month.
These adjustments were proposed in accordance with a Parliamentary Resolution that had been presented by former Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle on November 23, 2006. This was the last time where the salaries of MPs and Ministers were revised, he said.
According to the reports, the proposal was to increase the salary of a minister and a state minister from Rs 65,000 to Rs 140,000, the salary of a deputy minister from Rs.63,500 to Rs. 135,000 and the salary of a Member of Parliament from Rs. 54,285 to Rs. 120,000.
Parliament on March 23 unanimously adopted a resolution to increase the salaries of superior courts including the Chief Justice with retrospective effect from January 1, 2018.
All the MPs are also paid a special allowance of Rs. 100,000 (Office Allowance) from January 2017.
The allowance of Rs. 500 for attending Parliament sittings was also increased up to Rs. 2,500 through a Parliament Resolution adopted in December, 2016.
In addition, MPs are entitled to an entertainment allowance, drivers allowance, fuel allowance, telephone allowance, transport allowance for personal staff and free postage facilities.

Accreditation  delivering a safer world:
Rest assured
Innovation and exchange are not only the integral element of the fast-paced society, but they are the major elements of modern economic strategy as well. In todays world of sciences, destruction has become the catchphrase in an optimistic sense.
When he pointed out the word destruction, Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama apparently did not refer to either physical or mental plain. He pointed at the virtual destruction of the old form to deliver a new model. This form of destruction, Dr. Amunugama added, leads to innovation and exchange in the knowledge society.
But the innovation itself wont suffice. It requires a certain certification. Such a guarantee is a vital ingredient in the world of consumption. Before we consume something, someone must assure that it is good or fit for consumption. If it is not good, then you can complain. You can raise the red flag to say something has gone wrong, Dr. Amunugama explained.
Such a process, in a clear and a transparent manner, is exactly what the public demands. Before making the purchase, they are entitled to have an idea of the worth of the product. To achieve that end, proper research must be done on time in a transparent manner. What is called into question is whether the certification is executable in time to cater to the public demand.
The competitors have an edge when the certification process takes time. If certification does happen on time, more countries will open doors to our experts and exports. It makes the certification really vital. For instance, the United States needs certification for our exports. This is simply because they need some assurance. It is a vital organ of administration. Whatever comes in and go needs certification in a transparent manner catering to the public demand as we live in a highly competitive world, Dr. Amunugama elaborated.
From that well-known sphere, Dr. Amunugama shifted into a lesser-known territory: accreditation. He expressed these sentiments at a seminar on Accreditation  Delivering a Safer World held in Colombo organised by Sri Lanka Accreditation Board in collaboration with UNIDO, International Trade Centre and European Centre recently. Accreditation is a third-party attestation related to a conformity assessment body conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out the tasks of conformity assessment.
Quality and reliability
The process is duly accredited to the Sri Lanka Accreditation Board for Conformity Assessment (SLAB), the national accreditation authority established under the Science, Technology and Research Ministry. Strengthening the quality infrastructure and conformity assessment procedures in Sri Lanka and enhancing the recognition and acceptance of products and services in international and domestic markets are the main objectives of SLAB activities. SLAB offers accreditation for different types of conformity assessment bodies (laboratories, certification and inspection bodies, GHG validation and verification, good laboratory practices) in accordance with international principles.
Quality and reliability of test reports are the prime concern of the customers. SLAB Accreditation scheme is an excellent tool to instil these essential characteristics into the service. This scheme is instrumental in upgrading the competence of testing towards international level. The SLAB Accreditation for testing and calibration laboratories is based on ISO/IEC 17025 standard, which is used to assess the testing and calibration laboratories throughout the world.
According to Tung-Lai Margue, Ambassador and Head of European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka, the world of 9 billion people is facing a critical challenge with limited access to resources. How can they have sufficient access to the limited resources Thats not a simple solution.
We have issues such as climate change on one side. That is why we need legislation policies to change platform. The accreditation or certification process caters to that need. It is the Sri Lankan way of thinking globally, Margue said.
Work-related diseases or occupational accidents take a toll on 2.78 million people on an annual basis. Worse, about 125 million workers are prone to asbestos-related conditions such as lung cancer. One in eight of total global deaths, around 7 million people annually die as a result of air pollution exposure. Plus, 1.25 million has been recorded as road traffic deaths, on a global scale, in 2013. About 374 million non-fatal work-related injuries and illnesses each year add insult to injury resulting in extended absences from work. This finally affects not only the humans but the economic impact as well stemming from poor occupational safety and health practices (which is estimated to be 3.94 per cent of the global gross domestic product or about US$ 2.8 trillion, in direct and indirect costs of injuries and diseases each year).
Recent problems with tainted food, drugs, electronic devices and other consumer products have made clear that more needs to be done to protect consumers. Injury statistics indicate that design problems, defects and inadequate safety information for consumer products are associated with many injuries.
In a wider social scope, the products, especially the electrical goods and the childrens toys, are expected to be hazard-free. On the contrary, the same commodities pollute the environment smashing the hopes of water without contaminants and air free from harmful pollutants. The large-scale infrastructure projects such as road, bridges, and public transportation systems are no longer safe to use. The daily sources of energy such as gas or electricity should also be accessible without risk of injury or harm. The business titans have a responsibility to ensure that their employees, visitors and customers are able to enjoy freedom from injury or disease. They should also ensure that they provide for a sense of mental, physical and social well-being.
Wong Wong Wah, Assistant Commissioner, Innovation and Technology Commission, Hong Kong and Immediate Past Chairperson of Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC), stressed on the conforming assessment. The process has an international definition. The certification is an in-house verification.
How can I tell you that I am what you expected There should be a reliable proof of compliance required. We make decisions on a regular basis. We make decisions every day on what to eat when to eat where to go and how to do a certain thing.
The completed projects, raw materials, products, services, management systems and personnel can be evaluated against a standard, code of practice or regulatory requirement by testing and calibration laboratories, inspection bodies and certification laboratories, inspection bodies and certification bodies (collectively known as conformity assessment bodies). Conformity assessment bodies are used to check that products and services are safe for use.
Accreditation is the independent solution to this predicament.
The evaluation of the conformity assessment bodies against recognised standards to carry out specific activities to ensure their integrity, impartiality and competence. Through the application of national and international standards, government departments, businesses and wider society can, therefore, have confidence in the calibration and test results, inspection reports and certification provided. Accreditation bodies are established to ensure that conformity assessment bodies are subject o oversight by a competent body. Internationally recognised accreditation bodies, which have been evaluated by peers as competent, sign international arrangement that enhances the acceptance of products and services across borders, thereby creating a global infrastructure to support health and safety related processes.
Dr. Sapumal Dhanapala, Director Environment, Occupational Health and Food Safety of Health Ministry focused on food safety.
When we have food, we have the natural question of how safe they are. For that, we need to strengthen the analytical capacity. Our food is good on par with the international platform. But we are not in a position to show that. The international audience might think that our food is not safe, Dr. Dhanapala explained.
The Health Ministry has implemented some regulations to ensure that the hotels can carry on business only if they meet certain regulations. The National Food Policy is being drafted in order to certify food safety. Dr. Dhanapala also hinted how the food imports from the developing countries are subject to a thorough inspection procedure in developed countries.
We need to apply security measures on bottled water as they are in high demand. More products in this category enter the market. We need to check whether they are up to the standard and whether it is safe, Dr. Dhanapala added.
The biggest stumbling block used to be waterborne diseases. The figures decline but indicate the growth of food poisoning on a parallel track. Dr. Dhanapala urges proper farming and animal husbandry habits to make sure that the food does not get contaminated. Most importantly, the food produce must not be mixed with animal faeces. The human sewage, on the other hand, must never be used as manure.
Even in slaughterhouses hygiene needs to be maintained. Then, of course, storing and transport of the meat or vegetables must be done in a proper manner using the correct temperature. Kalmunei is where the food poisoning happens a lot. Comparatively, it is much lesser in Colombo. The Colombo residents are better equipped with food-analytical knowledge, Dr. Dhanapala elaborated.
Professor Ajit de Alwis, Project Director, Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI), emphasised on the safer environment.
Safer environment and a clean environment are an essential requirement in todays milieu. We have come up in the global climate risk index because we are not prepared for disasters, he said.
Professor de Alwis also made reference to climate departure which marks the point at which the earths climate begins to cease resembling what has come before and moves into a new state. It is the core point where heat records are routinely shattered and what once was considered extreme will become the norm. That means to essentially enter a carbon-neutral era for the first time.
Designing a chain reaction is essential, but ensuring the standard is equally important. Maintaining quality is the first step followed by cost assessment. It gives a clear idea of the productivity. Cost assessment and productivity together leads to a stable stay in the market.
For SLAB Chairman Namal Rajapaksha, 2018 is a memorable year. The Board has completed 12 years of accreditation in Sri Lanka.
Up to now, SLAB has received nine international recognition for accreditation schemes for testing, calibration, medical testing, inspection, product certification, food safety management systems, quality management systems and environmental management systems certification and greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies. Sri Lanka Accreditation Board has accredited above 100 conformity assessment bodies which include all categories including personnel certification bodies. In the near future SLAB intends to expand its services into other areas like Good laboratory Practices, Proficiency testing service providers and reference material producers, personnel certification while enhancing the effectiveness of current accreditation schemes, Rajapaksha elaborated.
Once every four years, the SLAB faces a comprehensive peer evaluation conducted by regional accreditation corporations to maintain this international recognition.
We are grateful to all our assessors, committee members, professionals and academics who are currently engaged with SLAB activities and present and previous SLAB staff, for their collective efforts which contributed to the present success of the organisation, Rajapaksha added.
As Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Ministry Secretary Sandhya Wijayabandara said, in most of the current regulations in Sri Lanka, mechanisms for implementation are not adequately addressed.
No proper regulatory impact analysis was done so far. It is a requirement of good regulatory practice to carry out regulatory impact analysis to make sure that regulations are effectively implemented while giving intended results. In many cases, the implementation is not effective due to lack of resources and policies and rules which are not suitable and not comply with current trade practices, Wijayabandara said.
She went on to add that the developed countries and emerging economies in the region such as Vietnam, Bangladesh are transforming their systems in line with current world requirements to strengthen their economies.
WTO principles
According to WTO principles, Accreditation and Conformity Assessment could be used as an effective supporting tool to implement technical regulations. Therefore, it is very much important to complete review of technical regulations and carry out a proper regulatory impact assessment to align our current regulations to meet national and international requirements. Under this background, I strongly believe that all institutions of the National Quality Services Department, all regulatory agencies and Sri Lanka Accreditation Board should work very closely in identifying and implementing strategies to improve the quality of products marketed in the domestic market and produced for the export market, she added.
With the increasing variety of products and services on offer, there is an increasing demand for intervention by the state to assure public safety and protection of consumers.
In 2016, in order to implement proposals of Cabinet of Ministers, State regulatory authorities were requested to make accreditation mandatory in implementing technical regulations covering products and services related to health, safety, consumer protection, fraud prevention and market fairness.
As Wijayabandara placed it on record, the requirement to assess was based on associated risks and prevalence of unfair, unethical practices. This could ensure the effective use of limited resources to the maximum benefit of the society.
State intervention should be planned in areas where it is identified as necessary. Strategies adopted and implementing mechanisms should be effective in achieving the identified objectives. All state regulatory authorities need to give serious consideration to these aspects in formulating regulations and implementation mechanisms for public safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, Wijayabandara said.

The Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the Chief Guest for the and the Minister of Women and Child Affairs Chandrani Bandara will be the Guest of honor.
Sri Lanka has come a long way in a short space of time. With an economy that is growing and a robust economic plan for sustainable growth, peoples lives and their roles in the society are being changed significantly. This has brought new opportunities for women to draw on their unique talents increasing their participation in the countrys development, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a statement in a message issued on the Woman Entrepreneur of the Year Awards.
The Prime Minister further stated that, the biennial flagship event of the Womens Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC), recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs who change the world.
The event is significant in its recognition of the steps taken by women in the world of business, and their growing contribution to our growth and development. Similarly, it is empowering women to improve their business and set up best practices for other women to follow.
The Woman Entrepreneur of the Year Award is the flagship event of WCIC that recognizes outstanding female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. It acts as an impetus for the female business community to improve their companies and establish best practices.
Minister of Women and Child Affairs, ChandraniBandara, noted in her message that around 10% of the Small Medium Enterprises are owned by women.
The Government is developing this sector by providing financial, marketing and other related facilities to nurture, foster and develop such enterprises. The Human Resources and Employment Policy of the Government includes promoting womens entrepreneurship development for enhancing womens employment.
Many women working in the formal sector leave their jobs due to household responsibilities and they tend to stay back at home. By engaging in entrepreneurship activities they can easily combine their familial as well as income earning roles.
The WCIC established in 1985, is the first women only Trade Chamber in Sri Lanka.
Chairperson of the WCIC commented Chathuri Ranasinghe, that this year 21 female entrepreneurs from across the country will be recognized. Over the years, we have seen a steady growth in the number of females building their own businesses and becoming successful entrepreneurs. Its a very encouraging sign and we want to see more Sri Lankan females being motivated to follow, she said.
This event gives us the opportunity to recognize women achievers that are innovating and re-inventing the countrys business environment and also inspire the next generation of female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.

SLAITO educates travel industry on GDPR
Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) in collaboration with SecurMatic.com organised a GDPR awareness summit to all its members and the hotel community (THASL) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo recently.
This summit is part of the ongoing exercise undertaken by SLAITO to educate the local industry on the new European General Data Protection Regulation (EGDPR) that came into effect on May 25, 2018.
With over 35% of inbound travelers originating from the EU, Sri Lankan Tour Operators and Hotel Operators should follow this data protection regulation, said Haritha Perera  Chairman of SLAITO.
He emphasized that since this is something new to the industry, it will be a long and tedious journey for Operators to be compliant due to the existing business practices.
But said, it is essential we follow the guidelines for the future of the industry and that we immediately start the process to be compliant. The guest speakers included Ranjika Manamperi  CEO of SecurMatic.com, a Cyber Security company specializing in cyber risk management and GDPR compliance solutions to the travel industry. If your organisation directly or indirectly markets travel services to EU based travellers and or if your organisation is part of EU based company and or if you carry out DMC services on behalf of a travel company that targets EU based travellers, your company will come under GDPR scope, she said.
Ranjika also stressed that implementing GDPR includes changes and improvements to operational processes, supplier relationships, technology and staff awareness. GDPR is an ongoing process in your organisation. It requires a cultural shift in handling personal data and data security, she said.
Ranjika also emphasised to local companies to pay attention to the data protection and liability clauses incorporated in vendor and B2B agreements. Samantha Simms, an information law attorney from UK, who is the founder of The Information Collective, spoke about the need to protect customers personal information and the impact to Organisations when a data breach does occur.
Due to the myriad number of partners involved in providing travel solutions it can be challenging to control what happens to customers information when its transferred onwards.
She stressed that under GDPR your accountability to protect that information doesnt end after the information is transferred but you have an accountability to ensure that your partners handle the same information securely and notify you in the event of a data breach. Following the presentations, there was a panel discussion moderated by Dayan Gunasekera comprising industry experts namely Sanjeewa Anthony (THASL), Upali Rathnayake (Sri Lanka Tourist Board) Harith Perera (SLAITO), Hasitha Gamage (Sudath Perera law firm), Ranjika Manamperi (SecurMatic) and Samantha Simms (Information Collective).
SLAITO and THASL members posed many questions and clarifications pertaining to GDPR on a macro and micro level.
SecurMatic is a cyber security company based in Colombo. SecurMatics solutions assists companies defend against existing, new and emerging cyber threats and meet their increasing Information Security challenges, including compliance requirements.

SLIIT spearheads BRain Busters  among young generation
Brain Busters with SLIIT was launched recently as an innovative general knowledge quiz competition.
Primarily as a TV Quiz program, the competition is conducted islandwide for school children from government, private and international schools. Students between the ages 15 to 20 are eligible to compete.
With an apparent deficiency of general knowledge among school students a growing concern, SLIIT aims to equip students with a genuine store of knowledge unlike the current norm emphasis on theoretical and academic knowledge.
The Quiz Program conducted in Sinhala and English tests the students general knowledge in different fields such as Current Affairs, Science and Technology, Art and Literature, History and Culture and Geography.
The main objective of SLIIT spearheading the SLIIT Brain Busters 2018 program is to help our younger generation improve their potential and aspire towards a greater future. Great enthusiasm has been shown by both students and teachers for this innovative program and we trust we can continue to promote the value of general knowledge, stated Uditha Gamage, Director Development and Engineering Services, SLIIT.
Over 1000 school students were nominated by their schools and participated in the preliminary rounds which were held in regional test centres Islandwide, such as, Colombo, Kandy, Kurunegala, Galle, Matara, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla.
SLIIT also conducted important educational workshops for schools along with the above tests to develop their knowledge on new technologies such as internet of things, study skills and exams success secrets, stress management and cyber security. All students who participated including the teachers expressed appreciation for the workshops.
We firmly believe that inculcating a wide base of general knowledge is vital to unlock the doors of learning. Especially when students have a good background knowledge they are able to make connections as they read and make correct inferences about things they dont know. The more you know, the easier it is for you to understand and to learn new things and better able to think critically, said Asangi Jayasinghe, Project Chair, SLIIT Brain Busters and Senior Manager Business Development, SLIIT.
Each school will be represented by the student who scored the highest marks and the best 27 schools will be selected for the semi-finals. The three winning schools with the highest marks from the semi finals will enter the grand finale.

The newly built Emergency and Trauma Unit at the Teaching Hospital Batticaloa was declared open recently by the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) is the Super Platinum Sponsor of this project, having invested an amount of USD 300,000 for the project.
The Project Batticaloa Emergency and Accident Project (BEAP) was initiated with the vision of building a fully equipped emergency and trauma unit at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital that is capable of handling the large number of patients that seek treatment at the hospital each day.
The Teaching Hospital treats approximately 700 patients per day. The existing facilities of the hospital were grossly inadequate to provide care to the 2 million plus population that live and seek medical attention not only in Batticaloa itself but also around the region including Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa as well as Ampara. Chairman of SLT Group, P.G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena gave his comments about the opening of the newly built unit, saying, We are honoured to have been a part of this noteworthy cause, the BEAP Project. As the Super Platinum Sponsor of the project, we have invested a large sum in this, but I believe its money well spent. We are truly glad to see the fruits of our investment - the envisioned Emergency and Trauma Unit being successfully completed and opened to the public, and the people in the region now being able to receive high quality medical care and treatment at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital.
We thank and appreciate the Foundation Supporting a National Trauma Service in Sri Lanka for their commitment and hard work to see this project through to its completion and we also thank them for giving us this opportunity to be a part of this noble cause, Sirisena added.

SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
Tempestuous oceanscapes will stake claim to centre stage at self-taught painter Neleisha Weerasinghes first solo exhibition at Art Space Sri Lanka early next month.
Infusing her palette knife paintings with a palpable sense of movement and energy, the results are highly textured images composed of bold strokes of saturated acrylic paint on canvas.
Something Beautiful -inspired by the lyrics by NeedToBreathe promises to take viewers through the same journey as that of the artists; conjuring an emotional state of gratefulness found at the heart of a storm.
This exhibition is very important to me as someone who hasnt really followed a structured education in the Arts. This will be an introduction to the style of work I do, and the conversations I hope to inspire. The series is an expression of my own journey through a turbulent time, and how in retrospect things dont seem as bad as they once appeared  conceptualised through the waves in my paintings erasing the shore, appearing to give way to a fresh start, Weerasinghe said.
She invites viewers to reconstruct and deconstruct what they see at their will. Something Beautiful is a testament to my humble reflections on natural beauty. I am often moved by the profound sense of energy that the ocean seems to exude; that which paradoxically always has a calming effect on my own soul. As a result, I see in perspective the smallness of our beings, and how insignificant our troubles really are, in comparison to the grander scheme of things. I hope my paintings are able to provide that same hopeful outlook to those seeking to be lifted up.
There will be thirteen pieces on show; mostly smaller artworks, and about three medium-sized paintings.
My palette-knife depictions of the beautiful beaches and oceans from our island will feature most prominently, she said.
Something Beautiful, by Neleisha Weerasinghe will be free and open to the public from today to August 5 at Art Space Sri Lanka.

Southeast Asias Grab to announce fresh US$1 bn funding
Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab is set to announce that it has secured new investment of US$1 billion that will help it grow its payments business, a source familiar with the matter said.
The funding will come from parties including US investors and strategic backers, said the person, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.
The funding comes after Toyota Motor Corp agreed in June to buy a US$1 billion stake in Grab as the lead investor in a financing round launched after Grab acquired Uber Technologies Incs operations in Southeast Asia.
Six-year-old Grab, which counts Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Group Corp as backers, was valued at just over US$10 billion after the automakers investment, according to a person familiar with the matter at the time.
Grab, which started as a taxi-booking firm six years ago, has been transforming itself into a consumer technology group, offering services such as digital payments and food delivery.
Earlier this year, Uber sold its Southeast Asian business to Grab in exchange for a stake in the Singapore-based firm, in a deal that has prompted regulatory scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal reported Grabs new funding earlier on Wednesday. Channel NewsAsia

Sri Lanka cricket  scraps plans to emulate  IPL tournament
Colombo, Thursday: Sri Lankas cricket authorities Thursday shelved long-delayed plans for a Twenty20 competition akin to the massively lucrative Indian Premier League, instead announcing a local tournament with no foreign players.
With an eye on the billions of dollars and millions of viewers drawn to the IPL, the island nation launched its own premier league in 2012 but the competition was a flop, lasting just one edition.
Sri Lanka Cricket had hoped to revive the tournament, modelled on the short-format competition that has lured international stars like Englands Ben Stokes and the West Indies Chris Gayle to India.
But a board official said the plans had been scrapped and replaced by the Sri Lanka Cricket T20 League, which would feature exclusively local players.
There will be no foreign players, but our own international cricketers will play in the four teams that will take part, a board official told AFP.
The new league will nurture emerging local talent by giving young players the opportunity to play alongside the islands best, the official said.
The four teams will face each other twice in the tournament, which is slated to begin August 21. AFP

Tasty or tacky
Its likely that if you dont have a tattoo yourself you know someone who does. No longer confined to sailors and prisoners, tattoos firmly have a place in mainstream culture.
Some people opt for double sleeves, while others may have a discreet inking hidden somewhere on their body. And even if someone looks bare, it could be another story underneath their clothes.
One body part which is normally hidden away is the tongue, but that doesnt mean its exempt from the tattoo treatment. Heres a round-up of the best  and worst  tongue tats.

Tax to curb tsunami of small vehicles - Mangala
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the tax imposed on vehicles less than 1000cc was a move by the Treasury to cushion off the effect on the rupee and curb small vehicles imports.
Between January and May this year, 4500 small vehicles had been imported into the country and nearly 1,000 vans were among them, on a monthly basis, he said. The tax is in response to a request made by the Central Bank to not only cushion off the effect on currency flows but also to curb the import of small vehicles.
He said the roads were fast becoming congested and that imports were spiralling out of control.
Describing it as a tsunami of small vehicles, the Minister added that it was high time imports were regulated.
The Minister signed a gazette notification to amend the excise duty of vehicles below 1000cc including hybrid vehicles effect from August. A unit tax of Rs 1.5 million will be taxed for a motor car below 1000cc while a unit tax of Rs 1.25 million will be taxed for a hybrid electric car below 1000cc.
The Ministry, however, said these new taxes will not be applied to vehicles that opened Letter of Credit before August 1, 2018 and cleared before January 31, 2019.

Urani pink lagoon: Teeming with life
Arugam Bay is the amalgamation of the Tamil word for six - Aru and the Sinhala word for village - gam and over an adventurous few days Juliet Coombe discovered the area has a lot more to offer than surf, sand and sea, when staying at Jetwing Surf.
Now one of the worlds top surfing destinations, a place that has around 330 days of sunshine annually, and is ideal for beginners and masters, Arugam Bay could once only be reached by truly adventurous travellers of the 1970s, called wave chasers, who lived out of their cars or in thatched village beach-huts.
From April through October, the swell can get as big as eight feet and competition fierce so watch the masters at work with a fiery red sunset lighting up this surfing paradise. Now with more than thirty five excellent places to eat and world class premium brand Jetwing Surf for top end luxury one can now also enjoy fine dining experience at its finest under the stars, and top spot with architecturally award-winning cabanas to experience not only the waves, but also the amazing historic sites in the area, superb wildlife reserve and superb ancient lagoon complexes.
Urani pink lagoon is at its best at sunrise with its own little wildlife museum Eco Lagoon Safari Information Centre and fishing community, a highlight of my trip to Arugam Bay. Here the Urani fishing communities are passionate about their stunning mangroves, range of birds and so along with the recreational officer of Jetwing Surf, Hiran who always carries the superb bird watching guide by Gehan De Silva to spot the twenty plus species of lagoon birds. We set off pre-dawn when the lagoon was like a pink flamingo and the water was wonderful hues of pink. Every safari on this ancient tributary is different and for those who get up at 5am you will be rewarded by anything from the local farmers chasing the water buffaloes across the lagoon in a small blue canoe boat with the oars swinging through the air to get them rounded up and over to the paddy fields on the other side. The oar swinging in circles is to scare the sleepier animals into action, and it is as if they are cattle ranching at the O.K. Corral with cries of Ye Hi.
One of the best sightings on a Urani Lagoon safari is seeing the wild elephants bathing early morning, head bumping each other and throwing water in the air while they drink and play wash each other and then paddle doggy style to the other side. On my first day we saw them miles away in the distance after landing close to a paddy field where we could see due to the huge holes in the mangroves several elephants had crossed earlier in the morning. Getting out we sank into a muddy elephant footprint and after a lot of stumbling about, loosing flip-flops and nearly the camera, as we laughed at our muddy disposition. I took pictures of the two male elephants vanishing into the undergrowth. With Opticon binoculars always at hand I could see one very well on the horizon and trudged ever closer in my bare feet to take pictures, while still staying at a safe distance.
The next day we returned to the same point thirty minutes earlier and were stunned to see them eye balling us on our tiny boat, through the elephant made holes in the mangroves. We took pictures as they ambled over curious no doubt by a person with long lenses looking just like a trunk zooming in and out to get the best angle. As eagles circled overhead, I learn from the boatman they have no less than five types in the area and combine this with enjoying the largest land animal romping around it was already an unforgettable adventure.
The recreational manager of Jetwing Surf Hiran quietly pointed out 20 different species of birds and explained they have an astounding 22 different types of mangroves in Urani Lagoon. Just as the biggest of the five elephants was about to put his foot in the water, two boat guys passed by shouting to each other, hearing all the noise the elephants got frightened and went into the bushes fearing attack on the youngest member of the small herd. How something so big can vanish like magic into a tiny area is beyond me, and yet they did and so we went around to the other side, where water lilies are in abundance to see if we could track their giant footprints. Sure enough there they were in-printed deep into the lagoon mud like big foot striding across the landscape and yet despite being wide-open planes they had given us the slip.
With so much to see I was not disappointed as we quietly rowed on along the lagoon to an area where a flock of Bramaney Kites circled and found look out points in the branches of the tall trees. From here we saw several mugger crocodiles with snout noses, which grow to up to 4.5 meters and cunningly disguise themselves in the roots of the mangroves. Going out early is essential to see the lagoon action whether it is fisherman throwing nets or the crocodiles catching their first prey of the day. The birds dart in and out of the waters catching jumping fish until the tropical sun starts to kick in giving great air displays with their incredible wing spans. I have a go at paddling as we vanish into a warren of mangrove plants and see some of the smaller more colourful birds like the king fisher splash colours of blue across the small lagoon flowers.
Our boat trip ended around 8am in the morning with the now scorching sunlight light catching on the roots of the mango trees by Urani Bridge, where we landed the pontoon rowing boat and enjoyed a cool drink at the very informative wildlife museum. It was nice to know the names of all the different mangroves we had seen are called, and talk about the weeks sightings with the fisherman before heading back to Jetwing Surf. On arrival I received a cool towel and then enjoyed an epic breakfast watching the waves pumping into action and a swim afterwards in the award winning hotel grounds overlooking the Indian Ocean.

We dont give excuses for our defeats we find solutions - Dickwella
DAMBULLA, Thursday: Wicket-keeper/batsman Niroshan Dickwella said that his team didnt want to give excuses for their defeats but find solutions after Sri Lanka had lost the second ODI by four wickets to South Africa at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium on Wednesday to trail the five-match series 2-0.
First of all our batting didnt do well. Weve got six batsmen, and when three batsmen dont score runs its really difficult to put a big score on the board, said Dickwella at the post-match press conference.
We had an opportunity to win this match, but it slipped from our hands. I think we should make a strong comeback in the Kandy game. When we were batting in the morning it was quite a slow wicket. And at night it was better.
We dont give excuses, we find solutions. I think we should do our basics right first. We should put a good total on the board first and then try to defend, he said.
Sri Lanka winning the toss for the second time and batting first scored 244-8, but a few missed chances allowed South Africa to pass that total for the loss of six wickets in the 43rd over.
Missed catches are part of the game. It happens all the time in the cricket field. It was a bad first 10 overs for us. As a team we have to stand strong, go through our mistakes, and do it better next time, said Dickwella.
The defeat was Sri Lankas tenth consecutive loss to South Africa in successive ODI matches and their seventh straight defeat at Dambulla.
There is no main reason. We made mistakes throughout the game. If we want to win a match, we cant make a lot of mistakes. Maybe you can make two or three mistakes and fix those things within the game itself and win the match. But if you make mistakes through the match, its hard to win a game. But if you fix those mistakes we can win the next one, said Dickwella who scored his first ODI half century since August 2016.
It was a courageous innings of some sort because he was hit a painful blow on his right ribcage off a rising delivery from Willem Mulder but continued to bat to complete his half-century.
After getting hit I continued playing. After I got out I thought I was ok. Then I went into the field and while I was keeping wickets it was difficult. I couldnt give my 100% to the team, so I said to the captain that I cant give 100% and I think I should leave the field, explained Dickwella. I went and got an x-ray and its fine. No fracture - nothing. There are three more days before the next game - I think I should be able to play.
The half century was a typical Dickwella knock with plenty of sweep shots.
I was working with the batting coach Thilan Samaraweera and head coach (Chandika) Hathurusingha. I did some changes in my batting and I was worried about those things. We had one-to-one meetings, and I said Im going to play like how I used to play, and not think about my technique. Im going to work my techniques in the nets, but Im going to play my normal game like I used to play when I started my career. Thats what I did when I went to the middle today. It worked out for me, said Dickwella.
If I go to a negative mindset when we lost two wickets and if I think about that, definitely Im going to get out. I spoke to my partner Kusal Perera and we wanted to build a partnership. Then Angie (Angelo Mathews) came and it really helped me because he is the senior player. He always talks to me. He always advises me how to play and how to take the calculated risk. That helped me.
Soon after reaching his fifty Dickwella gestured towards the stands and he later explained why:
My sisters birthday was yesterday (Wednesday). She called me and she was like: Why arent you scoring runs. Better score a half-century for my birthday. Thats why she was there today.

Zimbabwe on edge awaiting poll results
ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwe was Thursday on edge awaiting the results of its historic Presidential election after troops opened fire on protests against alleged electoral fraud, denting hopes of a new era for the country following the ousting of Robert Mugabe.
The government late Wednesday vowed to enforce a security crackdown to prevent further unrest after the army opened fire to disperse opposition protests in Harare, leaving at least three people dead.
Mondays polls -- the first since autocratic president Mugabe was forced out by a brief military takeover in November -- had been meant to turn the page on years of violence-marred elections and brutal repression of dissent.
But the mood quickly descended into anger and chaos as supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) opposition declared they were being cheated in the election count.
You said you were better than Mugabe -- you are the picture of Mugabe, shouted one young male protester wearing a white T-shirt. We need security for the people. Soldiers fired on demonstrators during MDC protests in downtown Harare, AFP witnesses saw, with one man killed after being shot in the stomach.
Official results Wednesday showed that the ruling ZANU-PF party had easily won most seats in the parliamentary ballot -- strengthening President Emmerson Mnangagwas prospects of holding onto power in the key presidential race.
MDC supporters, who say their leader Nelson Chamisa won the vote, burnt tyres and pulled down street signs as protests spread from the party headquarters in Harare.
Police confirmed the death toll of three, and Mnangagwa issued a statement blaming the opposition for the unrest and fatalities.
We hold the opposition MDC Alliance and its whole leadership responsible for this disturbance of national peace, he said, adding the government went out of its way to try to ensure the elections were peaceful. Mnangagwa, 75, had promised a free and fair vote after the military ushered him to power in November when Mugabe was forced to resign. In a late-night press conference, Home Affairs Minister Obert Mpofu warned that the government will not tolerate any of the actions that were witnessed today.
The opposition... have perhaps interpreted our understanding to be weak, and I think they are testing our resolve and I think they are making a big mistake. A credible and peaceful vote was meant to end Zimbabwes international isolation and draw in foreign investment to revive the shattered economy.
The MDC, which accuses the election authorities of falsifying results, said the army had opened fire for no apparent reason leading to the deaths of unarmed civilians. European Union observers had earlier declared they found an un-level playing field and lack of trust in the election process. It called for transparency in the release of results. On many occasions -- preparation, financing, media and hopefully not in the counting -- it was advantageous for the ruling party, EU chief observer Elmar Brok told AFP.
Former colonial power Britain called for calm and restraint, urging political leaders to take responsibility... at this critical moment. Under Mugabes 37-year reign, elections were often marred by fraud and deadly violence.- AFP

Govt To provide vocational training,  employment prospects for youth
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of a special vocational training programme organized by Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, over the week-end, at Talalla, Matara, attended by a large number of youth, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that his intention is to provide a sound vocational education, holding out good employment prospects, to youth who miss entering the university just by a few marks. In encouragement of his youthful audience the Minister said in lighter vein. We will give the traditional higher education system a good run for its money
The Minister said that although the people of this country, from the time before independence, had sacrificed a good part of the national income to provide free education, a free health care service and a good social protection system and that as result we now have a generation of fully literate, healthy young men and women, unfortunately a large number of them have failed to find satisfactory employment due to the limitations of our traditional higher education system.
The Minister said that in these circumstances his ministry has taken over the responsibility of creating a new generation of youth, empowered with the knowledge and skills demanded by the present day world of work.
The Minister pledged that through these new vocational education courses which will be up to international standards, the doors will be open to the youth of this country, including those who have just missed entering a university, the opportunity of reaching the same levels as could be reached through the traditional higher education system.
He said this will be the mission of all the vocational training institutions under his ministry.
The Minister also revealed that in order to facilitate the vocationally trained youth to find employment, a Job Bank containing all their data in digital format will be initiated at his ministry, the coming week itself.
Recalling that Matara has traditionally been a breeding ground for successful entrepreneurs, the Minister pointed out that some of the new vocationally trained youth could even start their own small or medium scale enterprises, individually or in groups, making use of the easy enterprise loan schemes recently introduced by the government.

AGs appeal to have retrial over  Raviraj murder case fixed for support
An appeal filed by the Attorney General seeking a retrial into the murder of TNA former MP Nadaraja Raviraj was yesterday fixed for support by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli fixed the matter for support on December 4.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
In its appeal, the Attorney General observed that it was inappropriate and imprudent of expecting the jury to consider the facts and laws in the trial that were heard December 23, 2016 until after midnight. The Attorney General maintained the trial process was not appropriate and reasonable to make a just and fare verdict.
The Attorney General observed that there were several deficiencies in the summing up of the trial judge. The Attorney General contended that several important legal concepts relevant to the case were not considered by the trial judge.
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused, Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint, who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused, Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman, under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code.
Three accused who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made State witness in the Raviraj murder trial.
Raviraj was shot dead near his residence at Manning Town in Narahenpita between November 9 and November 10, 2006 when he was driving his vehicle along Martha Road. The CID recovered the three wheeler and the weapon alleged to have been used in the killing of the former Parliamentarian.

AIA Insurance conducts Poson Safety Program
AIA Insurance recently conducted the Poson Safety Program for the 25th consecutive year, making it one of the longest standing CSR initiatives in the country.
Held for three days during the Poson season, in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Dambulla and Mihintale, the program facilitates 600 lifeguards across 28 reservoirs and lakes to ensure that pilgrims are safe when they bathe in the reservoirs.
Sri Lanka is a country in abundance of lakes and reservoirs out of which many are found in the North Central Province. During the Poson season, these reservoirs overflow with not just water but with religious devotees from all over the country. Millions of devotees throng to the sacred area in a religious pilgrimage, where they bathe in these reservoirs to beat the heat and to cleanse themselves before making the pilgrimage to the Udamaluwa.
Since many of these devotees are from other parts of the country, they are not aware of the areas that are safe for bathing and as a result are vulnerable to drowning. Following an unfortunate death in 1992 and being concerned about the safety of pilgrims, the company pursued a solution to prevent the loss of lives due to drowning during Poson. So, in 1993, the insurer together with the Life Savers Association of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Police launched the Poson Safety Program with the intention of putting a stop to the senseless loss of lives by drowning. In addition to the facilitating of lifeguards, efforts include educating the public through on-ground activations and media campaigns, as well as the placement of warning signs in all locations deemed dangerous for bathing.
AIA Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani noted, This year we celebrate the 25th anniversary of this very special initiative, I am proud to say that we have saved over 200 lives over the years. We at AIA feel a sense of pride when we look back at this social responsibility effort of educating the public and saving lives over the years. As an insurer, AIA understands the value of human lives and know the importance of preserving lives of loved ones.
CEO Pankaj Banerjee added, the project is not only about saving lives but also facilitating a mindset shift which prioritises safety and awareness.

ALTERNATIVE TO HANGING
To Sri Lankas underworld whose income and power are mainly derived from the narcotics trade, nothing seems to be impossible. In this land like no other, not many moons ago was not an underworld character or a politician able to get a letter sent out from the then Prime Ministers office ordering the customs to release a container that happened to contain narcotics What happened to the character who was powerful enough to get this letter out to the Customs What is the office that the crooked official who was in the Prime Ministers office now holds What explanation if any did the Prime Minister of the time offer The country remains in the dark; and none appears to be one bit bothered.
If one crook could have taken the office of a Prime Minister for a ride, it is unimaginable what several kings of the underworld enjoying the safety and security of prison cannot do.
Way back in 1959 when I was attached to the CID undergoing training as an ASP I headed a surveillance team that detected Eddie Perera the notorious opium smuggler who was in prison custody leaving his General Hospital bed to which he had been chained and guarded by a prisons officer. He and the jail guard were picked up at 10 p.m. by an attractive woman who drove into the hospital premises unchecked. Having occupied a house in Colpetty until 5 a.m. they returned to the hospital. On a report made by the CID to the Commissioner of Prisons the guard was sacked and the latters immediate Superior a jailor was reprimanded for his laxity of supervision.
Corrupt prison staff
Today, it is public knowledge that with millions being lavished on the custodians, narcotics king-pins in death raw enjoy the best of luxuries within as well as outside the prison walls. But the dangerous and most disturbing factor is their ability, equipped with sophisticated communications equipment to direct underworld activities with the assistance of corrupt prison staff.
What is the governments rationale behind the decision to hang the underworld narcotics kings These powerful few have become the de facto administrators of the prisons in which they are incarcerated. All responsible for this chaotic state of affairs inside the prisons from the top officials down to the junior most guard must be held responsible. They have failed miserably to enforce the punishment of imprisonment resulting in hardcore inmates having their own way.
A government that cannot say boo to a goose and cringes in the face of heartless strikes by the arrogant medical fraternity, protesting students and even village women demanding repairs to their roads, that has failed to keep smart phones getting into the heads of prisoners has decided to make an absurd decision nay a hilarious one; hang all those who have outsmarted the Prisons administration!
True to form the government has begun to realize the imprudence of hanging after making the decision. The EU has only to say We dont want your fish, and the hangmen probably proud products of our universities will have to hang themselves!
However, the discussion on Hang or not to hang that appears to be going on endlessly consuming acres of newspaper space is indeed a soothing saline drip to a government clutching on to a few straws anchored in the mud. Momentarily through, it has smothered the peoples concern for the rising cost of essentials; food, fuel, transport, education or even the occasional tot!
Rigorous imprisonment for life
The most sensible alternative to capital punishment is obviously the vigorous enforcement of the punishment of rigorous imprisonment for life. A high security prison equipped with sophisticated security technology, located in an isolated area, managed by specially selected officers where inmates can be held incommunicado without the possibility of access to prohibited items especially communications equipment, drugs and alcohol, is the answer. A case in point is how the Prisons Authority of the Unites States, during the prohibition days of the early Thirties held the notorious Al Capone and other Mafia gangsters in the tiny island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay.
Even if smartphones had existed at that time the supremely isolated nature of Alcatraz would have made Jamming feasible without affecting any other facility in the vicinity. Essential official communications could have been maintained (which can be done even today) by the installation of a restricted radio intercom system.

BPPL inaugurates SLs First Polyester  Yarn Production Facility
Synonymous with pioneering advancements in manufacturing, BPPL Holdings PLC (BPPL), among the top brush makers in Asia, recently inaugurated the countrys first ever state-of-the-art polyester yarn plant.
The facility is another milestone for BPPL, spearheaded by wholly owned subsidiary Eco-Spindles (Pvt) Ltd, towards bringing forth the advantages of innovative sustainability where yarn is produced exclusively from recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate, commonly known as PET flakes.
As a future oriented company, Eco Spindles is recognised as a pioneer manufacturer, synonymous throughout the industry for producing synthetic monofilaments for cleaning tools, synthetic monofilaments for paint brushes and polyester yarn for fabric.
As a driving and innovative force continually setting new standards in the industry,Eco Spindles technologically advanced new yarn facility, located in the Horana BOI Zone, has an impressive 13,000 sq. meter area and a capacity to produce approximately 960 tonnes of synthetic yarn per annum for local and globally renowned fabric manufacturers.
Impressively, this is only one of two plants globally which creates yarn directly from flakes circumventing the polymerization process where flakes are first converted to chips and then to yarn. The raw material for the plants yarn is sourced through post-consumer (waste) PET bottle collections. Eco Spindles well-established network of over 125 collection points set-up across the country ensures nearly 200-250 tonnes of PET waste is amassed each month.
The PET bottles are then sorted, hot and cold washed prior to being transformed into flakes and finally, into recycled draw textured polyester yarn. This polyester yarn is available in both raw white and dope dyed yarn forms.
Another value addition is the plants dope dying capabilities offering colour pigmentation insertion as part of the extrusion process.
We are extremely proud of our accomplishment in inaugurating Sri Lankas first ever yarn production facility. Propelling the country towards greater recognition, the factorys state-of-the-art spinning and texturing machinery from Europe will make it a game-changer for the industry, said Dr. Anush Amarasinghe, BPPL Managing Director.
Additionally, with the global apparel industry moving towards creating more sustainable products and processes, BPPL sees tremendous potential for its recycled polyester yarn offering, added Dr. Amarasinghe.

Capital Punishment for a crime free society!
Since the declaration of Capital Punishment in Sri Lanka by President Maithripala Sirisena, there have been many articles published in this column most of them opposing his controversial decision.
We all should understand that crime rate in Sri Lanka has unprecedentedly risen since 1977 after the introduction of the liberalized economy. Foreign goods and liquor have been fluxing into the country at the inception of the open economy. Customs barriers in the airport have gradually disappeared. International trade has increased and the functions of the airport too have increased. Customs officers too fell into the bribery net. Then, drug trafficking commenced.
The local kingpins started their gambol in drug trading, the most heinous and lucrative money making strategy.
Later politicians and popular bigwigs too joined in this obnoxious social crime which has become a mafia in the country. Lifting of the moratorium on the death sentence in 1976 has become an impetus for these nasty criminals. Most of the people in the country were addicted to drugs which has become popular among youngsters. Subsequently, the killings increased. Killing has become rampant in our society. Father kills the son or the son kills the father. The wife kills the husband, vice versa.
Although Sri Lanka is predominantly a Buddhist state and most of the people are following the Buddhas teachings, it is very sad that human mayhem has reached to the unprecedented level. It has become uncontrollable, even with the existing law in the country. Presidents thinking is quite right to bring back the death sentence.
In other countries, such as Japan, China and India there is capital punishment in force. In Arabian countries it is strictly enforced. In Saudi Arabia execution is openly done. In those countries the crime rate has become drastically low.
Thus, I most and appreciably welcome the presidents strong commitment to enact the capital punishment in Sri Lanka to witness a crime free society!

CARGILLS Sarasaviya Awards: Starry Night of Sri Lankan Cinema
Sarasaviya is a name synonymous with the arts in Sri Lanka. Appropriately named after the Goddess of the Arts, Sarasaviya is now the countrys only dedicated Sinhala film weekly, with additional focus on television, stage, music and other forms of art. Sarasaviya is close to the hearts of all art lovers in the country and all artistes have a close bond with the newspaper.
Sarasaviya is equally known for the film awards named after it and for many actors and artistes, winning a Sarasaviya award is the highlight of their career. Some have won Sarasaviya awards multiple times, others only once, but a Sarasaviya award is an accolade you cherish for a lifetime and beyond, when your children and grandchildren will hold it with awe. It is the award by which all other local cinema awards are judged. There is nothing quite like it in local cinema.
Sarasaviya was launched during the Golden era of Sinhala cinema in the 1960s. To add lustre to the Silver Screen, Sarasaviya founder-editor Wimalasiri Perera held the first Sarasaviya Film Festival on May 10, 1964 under the patronage of Ranjith Wijewardene, Ranapala Bodinagoda and the then greats of the local film industry. Throughout the years, the Sarasaviya Film Festival retained its unique identity without a change since it represents a combination of both classical (art house) and popular cinema.
Sarasaviyas first choice for best film was Gamperaliya (The Revolution in the Village), which went on to win the Golden Peacock Award in India the same year. This shows that Sarasaviya has felt the true heartbeat of cinema fans and critics here and abroad. The Sarasaviya Film Festival and the Awards Ceremony which carry the imprint of Sri Lankan identity and cultural traits is always admired by the movie fans islandwide.
The next Sarasaviya film awards ceremony will be held today, this time with the sponsorship of Cargills Limited. The Cargills-Ceylon Theatres Group has a close affinity with the local movie industry through film production and film exhibition facilities. In fact, the Regal Cinema and the Lake House Building, which face each other, are two of the oldest buildings in Colombo. Expect a mesmerizing, star-studded evening when the Sarasaviya awards are presented amidst a distinguished gathering.
This year, the Sarasaviya Awards ceremony will be a tribute to the Colossus of the Sinhala Cinema Dr. Lester James Peries who passed away recently at the age of 99. Sarasaviya Awards and Lester were almost synonymous as almost every one of his creations from Gamperaliya onwards had won awards over the years. No other individual has perhaps achieved this monumental feat.
Sarasaviya came along at a time when one young man named Lester was bold enough to challenge the song and dance formula of Sinhala films derived from Hindi and Tamil movies. He wanted to create a truly Sri Lankan cinema that reflected a distinct identity, local ethos and real life stories. Not many believed in his capability and mission then, but more than 60 years later, the entire world has recognized him as one of the greatest movie directors ever.
Journalist turned film maker Lester was a giant of world cinema thanks to his sheer desire to steer the Sinhala cinema in a totally new direction. Journalisms loss was cinemas gain as he introduced fresh insights to a moribund industry that had no real depth or purpose back in the 1950s. Thus his first film Rekhava (Line of Destiny) literally broke new ground in the Sinhala cinema, with a totally indigenous storyline, local outdoor settings (location shooting was a novelty even in Hollywood at this time), believable dialogues and all-new Sinhala songs  not copies of Hindi or Tamil songs.
Lester never looked back from then onwards, taking Sinhala movies to the global stage. His love for Cinema never wavered right till the end  the recent movie Waishnavee directed by his wife Sumithra was based on a story he penned. More than ever, there is a crying need to restore all his movies digitally and release them on blu-ray with English subtitles through a label such as Criterion for the world to get to know him even more closely.
This years Sarasaviya Awards is a convergence of fortunate coincidences  a tribute to a journalist who crossed over to an entirely new medium and changed it forever - from a newspaper that stood by that medium through its ups and downs and an organisation that has nurtured local cinema almost from the moment of independence. The winners tonight will no doubt be inspired by the vision of Lester who aspired to take local cinema to global theatres. Yes, a Sarasaviya Award is a treasure to behold, but even more so, a measure of success that calls for more creativity, better artistry and finer storytelling. May the best win tonight.

Censoring hampers vibrant media culture - Minister Samaraweera
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the government cannot fear free media and added that censoring media with restrictions and circulars hampers fundamental rights of society and violates the basic human rights.
Participating as the chief guest at the Asia Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) annual general conference at the Galle Face Hotel yesterday he said that the traditional and formal media has a greater challenge to provide fruitful, accurate and reliable news faster while preserving media values and ethics.
"With the emergence of social media, a new generation of youth who are also called as millennials, are now very actively participating in shaping our society.They are IT literals and well connected to each other, independent and very powerful communicators. There is a huge increase in information being disseminated through social media", he said.
The Minister said that instead of compromising values for the fear of competition, all must work hard to preserve professionalism and journalism and added that he believes that journalists are duty bound to report news without fabrications despite temptations to compete with those who propagate fake news.
Stating that Sri Lanka enacted the Right to Information Act in 2016 which shows the transparency in the government while ensuring access to information, he said that he was proud to have a vibrant media culture.
Minister further added that the AIBD is mandated to achieve a vibrant and cohesive media environment in the Asia Pacific region thorough policy and resource development in order to create a well informed society while promoting regional cooperation.

than 10 years both on Broadway and in the West End, and in 2011, it became the first Western musical ever to be staged in Mandarin in the Peoples Republic of China.
The hugely successful International Tour, since premiering in Dublin in September 2004, has visited 85 cities across 38 countries and sold over 5 million tickets.
With music and lyrics by Benny Andersson and Bjrn Ulvaeus, MAMMA MIA! is written by Catherine Johnson, directed by Phyllida Lloyd and choreographed by Anthony Van Laast. The production is designed by Mark Thompson, with lighting design by Howard Harrison, sound design by Andrew Bruce & Bobby Aitken, and musical supervision, additional material and arrangements by Martin Koch.
The worldwide smash hit musical MAMMA MIA is presented by Cinnamon Life, an integrated development by Sri Lankas premier listed conglomerate, the John Keells Group.
Roshanie Jayasundera-Moraes, Executive Vice President/Chief Marketing Officer of the Property Group at JKH stated, This well-loved musical has touched the hearts of millions across the world over the years through film and theatre, and we are very proud to bring the stage musical to audiences in Sri Lanka to experience and enjoy. Cinnamon Life will be the culinary and entertainment hub of Colombo, and MAMMA MIA along with a series of other events will give you a glimpse of what you can expect at Cinnamon Life. We encourage everyone to stay tuned for more exciting events in the lead up to the launch of Colombos life capital.

Cleaning up Mount Lavinia Station
The Mount Lavinia station and the platforms offer a multitude of local commuters access to locomotive transportation daily. Tourists enjoy the old character of the old steam engines making their way to and from the Colombo city.
Littering has been a menace to the stations environment. The staff of the Mount Lavinia Hotel joined as one force to give the Mount Lavinia station a thorough clean up. Top management, executives and non executives alike joined in the conquest of clean up. Plastic bags, bottles and overgrown foliage were removed off the premises.
Furthermore, new time tables and directional boards were added as a guide to inform both the tourists and locals.
