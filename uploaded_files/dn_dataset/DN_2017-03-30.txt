Balancing act
Breaking away from the traditions of professional circus, Dileepa Dinush left his audience awestruck. His acrobatic performances were out of this world and left all those around him gasping in wonder. Little did one guess that the youth has learnt the art through rigorous training.
The 28-year-olds amazing talent was brought before the world through Youth With Talent, a reality program which showcased the extraordinary skills of Sri Lankan youth. It was organized by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the National Youth Services Council and the Independent Television Network. Dileepa beat around 53, 657 competitors to emerge as the winner of the competition.
My skills are mostly self taught. I stopped attending school at the age of 15 years. I worked at a garage in Bulathsinhala to earn a few bucks, assisting the workers to repair three wheelers. The Pacifia Circus visited the area during that time. Everyone was excited by the prospect of seeing some amazing acts. The excitement around me aroused my curiosity. I bought a ticket and took my seat. I found the whole experience enchanting! I watched the show over and over again for about five days more. That was the beginning of a journey which kindled passion for the art and brought me on a long, tiring and hard won journey to fame, Dileepa said.
Dileepa was so smitten by the circus that he wished to become a part of it. He spoke to the relevant parties and was finally given the green light to join in. The next hurdle was getting his parents permission. This too proved to be difficult especially because he was the only child in the family.
They finally gave in and I was elated. I knew that I could venture far in this field. They gave me a lot of labour work but I was able to train my balancing act during my free time. I was able to teach myself to ride the unicycle in around six months, he explained.
His next challenge was to master the hand balance which he says in no walk in the park. A person needs a lot of determination and will power to achieve this goal. His training starts at 6 am and ends around 8.30 am. After breakfast the circus acts go on full swing. He had to satisfy his hunger with a glass of water till it was time for curtain call for many days.
Dileepa had earned around Rs 20 to Rs 30 for his work. This was not enough to cover his expenses. He had his parents welfare to think of as well. He bid farewell to the circus and engaged in various other professions like sand mining, carpentry and selling lottery tickets for short spans. His talent for acrobatics was well known among all those who were close to him and before long he got another opportunity engage in his passion.
Ranjan uncle brought the news about a circus from Katana. They offered to pay Rs 250 per month. I worked there for a short period. Then the owner decided to quit. I joined a circus from Mathugama next and worked there for about six months. I had to quit because of the insufficient pay. I did several other jobs next. I worked as a bus conductor for a few months. Then I became a mason for a while. I have even contributed towards laying concrete on roads as a labourer.
But destiny came calling again  this time in the form of Pacifia Circus - the oldest running circus in Sri Lanka. Dileepa joined them and it was during this time that that he got the news of ITNs Youth With Talent competition and decided to try his luck at the event.
I am so grateful that I gave it a shot because everyone knows about my talents now. My goal was to get recognition for my skills rather than become the winner. Winning the competition was an added bonus. There were many talented youth at the show. I chose to showcase different acts which highlighted the diverse things I could do in each round. Maybe that is what helped me clinch this win, he opined.
Dilpeepa is something of a mini celebrity today. He says people recognize him on the streets and come up to talk to him.
They say that they have sent SMSes so that I could win, putting their faith on me and believing that I am the best. They also say that they admire my skills. It is very encouraging to get such feedback. I had a hard time getting ready for the competition because I had no sponsorship. However as I reached the finals many helping hands were extended to me. I am grateful to all of them for helping me reach success, he added.
Speaking about the scope for local circuses to thrive in the entertainment field in Sri Lanka Dileepa laments that it has been put aside, ignored, by the authorities.
There is no recognition for circus as an art form in Sri Lanka. They bring down circus troupes from China to perform in some of the hotspots in Colombo and speak highly about their talents. Our local talent goes unnoticed. The Chinese acrobats perform with safety gear and nets but our acrobats do not use such items because they have no money to purchase them. They gamble with their life daily to enchant the viewers, Dileepa mused adding that while tickets are priced high for international circus shows, local circuses charge only about Rs 150 per show. He says that local circuses do not perform in the city because they are charged a large sum as tax for using a particular land. The amount that they are charged for using the land in rural areas is less. Therefore local circuses stick by the villages rather than venture to the towns.
We generally stay for about six or seven days in one location but if we get a very good response then we stay for about 10 days. Animals like dogs, porcupines, goats and monkeys perform at our shows, he noted.
Recalling one of his most memorable experiences during a performance Dileepa said that during a show in Adiambalama he had taken a fall but had been unhurt because he has fallen right into his mothers lap!
That was a miracle. My parents and family came that day to see me performing and were among the audience. We were all amazed that I landed right on her lap when I slipped. Nobody got hurt, he reflected with a smile.
Dileepa has been working with the Sakura Circus for nearly a year now. His father Kapuwage Malla is bedridden. His mother Moradudalige Suweenitha Lalani works at the neighbourhood bakery once in a while.
My ambition is to build our house and cultivate in our land. I have been through a lot to reach this level. However I was very punctual. I made it on time for all the auditions and shooting schedules. Circus has become a dying art today. I request the authorities to take the necessary steps to save this art for the future generations, he concluded.

The case study of Cinnamon TBCasia took centrestage as the first travel bloggers conference of its kind to be conducted in Asia, effectively bringing travel bloggers together to create engaging written and visual content about Sri Lanka, which exponentially enhanced the country's online presence.

Matt Gibson presented an overview of TBCasia, and explained how emerging destinations benefit from working with travel bloggers. He emphasized how new or unknown places are suffering from the lack of digital online assets, optimization on search engines, endorsements and referrals. He reiterated that travel blogging is an effective tool and mechanism that can be used as an alternative to traditional destination promotion tactics. Travel blogging is also ideal for destinations that want to showcase their attractions, key travel experiences and highlights online but don't necessarily havethe funds and know-how for big advertising campaigns. He further described how Cinnamon TBCasia effectively tapped into the potential of blogging to create unprecedented hype about Sri Lanka as a travel destination, on multiple digital platforms that reached millions of people across the globe.
Commenting on the Cinnamon TBCasia case study, Dileep Mudadeniya stated: Cinnamon TBCasia was part of an innovative destination marketing initiative that attracted international travel bloggers to the Asian continent on a large scale. Through the immense influence and reach that these bloggers had on their online forums and platforms, we were able to rapidly increase awareness about Sri Lanka as a top travel destination. The initiative generated over 56,500,000 Twitter and Instagram impressions, over 230,000 Instagram engagements as well as a multitude of posts, vlogs, blogs and videos about the island.
Observing a highlight of the case study, Mudadeniya further added, The most important aspect of Cinnamon TBCasia is how the platform helped to place unknown or lesser known destinations in Sri Lanka on the map. Places in the North and East of the country in particular received immense online exposure through the social media promotions and blogging activities that were conducted throughout the campaign. This project truly set a benchmark in the region and was spearheaded by Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation and the Market Development Facility.
Matt Gibson said Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts recognizes the crucial role that bloggers play in influencing travellers. Working with bloggers is a creative and effective way to showcase both established and up-and-coming destinations in a cost-effective manner.
Blogging not only ensures that a burst of fresh and engaging information is dispatched onto the most important digital platforms where it can reach potential travellers, it also significantly helps to boost search engine optimization and creates a stronger online presence for destinations and travel brands. Thousands of online contributions were made during Cinnamon TBCasia, and it is recognized as one of the most effective blogging campaigns to be conducted in Asia.

Rental free Supranormal SIM!
I thought of sharing how I have been taken for a ride by a leading mobile operator. I got a rental free SIM some time ago which I didnt use for a couple of months but I was billed monthly (although the SIM was not used) which I promptly settled for the reasons adduced by the representatives of this Company.
About 4-5 months ago, when I brought to the attention of the Customer Service Executive at one of the branches located down Duplication Road, Colombo 3 as to why I was charged when the SIM was not made use of, he told me after browsing through his computer that it had been used at such and such time on so many days for so many minutes as per their records.
And the following month I got another bill and when I queried as to their charge, I was told that when the SIM is kept in a smart phone it automatically gets connected to internet even without logging for internet. So, it showed once again in their computer that the SIM had been made use of.
Once again I got another bill when the SIM was kept in a normal phone which itself was out of order. Here again, the Customer Service Executive told me that the SIM had been used for downloads as per their records. Once more I paid the bill as the charges were nominal.
Finally I decided to remove it from the phone and kept it unused inside the drawer. Believe me; I was billed again for downloading charges which I have not paid and has send them a letter asking for a refund of all the payments made to date and also to carry out a detailed investigation as regards their bogus charges.
Is this a miraculous SIM, I wonder This particular SIM seems to me to be an extra-ordinary one for it works being kept in the drawer under lock and key without being inserted into the phone!
This is to caution other mobile subscribers to monitor their monthly bills very closely for they may be getting charged for calls / internet when it has not been made use of in case the SIM becomes supranormal as it had happened to me.
Over to TRCL and CASL to carry out spot raids and check their billing systems!

Coconuts more precious than son
A father, residing at Paradise village, went to the Ratnapura town recently with his little son to get the lad a haircut and purchase some home needs.
When he came to the bus stand to take the bus home, he had seen a batta lorry unloading coconuts at shops in the area at wholesale price and thought of making a bargain by buying some coconuts for his household. He thereafter boarded a bus to get back home with his son, taking a gunny bag full of coconuts, as well as other provisions. After getting down at his destination with his bag full of provisions, he realised that the bus had taken off with his son aboard. The father who was in a state of panic abandoned his goods and soon boarded a three wheeler to chase after the bus.
After overtaking the bus, when it stopped at the Kuruwita halt, he boarded it and fetched his son who was seen playing with a toy quite unaware of what had happened. When he returned he saw the bag full of provisions intact at the spot he left it and collected it too on his way.
Bystanders who watched the scene in amusement were heard saying given the high price of coconuts today, it is no wonder that he treasured and clung onto his provisions, even momentarily forgetting his son.

The government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe scored a major diplomatic victory last week, with the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) extending the timeframe granted to Sri Lanka by another two years to meet its obligations under a resolution passed by the Council.
These obligations relate mostly to answering allegations of war crimes during the Eelam war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and to setting up mechanisms for ethnic reconciliation. Previously, under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, Colombo contested the resolutions adopted by the UNHRC- but the resolutions were still adopted, primarily because they were being sponsored by the United States.
The present government has however engaged with both the UNHRC and the US and has opted for consultation and compromise rather than confrontation, choosing to co-sponsor the resolutions along with the US.
As a result, UNHRC last Thursday adopted without a vote the consensus resolution on Sri Lanka which proposes to give two more years beyond 2017 to Sri Lanka to fulfil its commitments for reconciliation and transnational justice. The resolution was submitted by the United States with Montenegro, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland being the main sponsors with Sri Lanka a co-sponsor.
Foreign judges
There was some concern in Colombo as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein had made several comments to the effect that foreign judges would still be desirable in any war crimes probe that was to be conducted in Sri Lanka. Hussein has commented many times that the Sri Lankan judiciary had lost its credibility.
Hussein succeeded Navanethem Pillay as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Pillay was known in political and diplomatic circles for her unwavering anti-Sri Lankan stance. Although Hussein has not been as harsh or outspoken as Pillay, there was concern that he too appeared to be giving the benefit of the doubt to the Eelamist lobby.
In the lead up to the UNHRC resolution, Hussein expressed concern over Sri Lankas slow progress in establishing transitional justice mechanisms to address accountability and emphasized the need for an agreement on a comprehensive strategy, with a time-line and detailed benchmarks.
Nevertheless, a successful dialogue primarily with the United States resulted in agreement being reached about an extension being granted to Colombo for two years. Colombo is now required to present a written update on the progress it is achieving to the UNHRC next year and fulfil obligations by 2019.
Eelamist lobby
The governments stance of agreeing with the US and the UNHRC comes with some domestic political consequences, with the Joint Opposition (JO) screaming that it is a sell out to the Eelamist lobby. The JOs Sarath Weerasekera also made representations in Geneva. Weerasekera, a former Member of Parliament and an ex-Navy officer was heckled as he presented his point of view but soldiered on, nevertheless. He was also provoked by some in the Eelamist lobby, to which he responded defiantly.
While Weerasekera handled a difficult brief reasonably well, it seemed that his appearance in Geneva was more for domestic political consumption, so the JO could gain some political mileage. Its activists were quick to post clips of his presentation on social media, hailing him as a war hero.
It was curious that the JO chose Weerasekera to be its emissary in Geneva, when it could have dispatched former Minister G.L. Peiris to perform the same task. Peiris certainly has the better credentials for the task but perhaps has bitter memories of Geneva, where, as Minister of External Affairs in the Rajapaksa government, he watched resolutions against Sri Lanka being adopted year after year, so much so that he became known as Geneva Losing Peiris.
Of course, on the other side of the divide, the Eelamist lobby was not happy with what transpired in Geneva either, alleging that the grant of a two year extension will encourage more dilly-dallying by Colombo on the vexed issue of probing alleged war crimes.
Overall, however, the government will be satisfied with the outcome in Geneva. That is not merely because of the two year extension of the deadline it was granted to meet its obligations. It is also because the crucial issue of involving foreign judges in any war crimes inquiry has been all but shelved by the UNHRC.
This must come as a huge relief to the government because, had it been compelled to carry out a probe with foreign judges, there would have been a huge political fallout. The JO would have naturally cried foul, but it would have been a cry that would have found resonance with a significant proportion of the electorate, especially within the majority community.
The government realised these implications well before the sessions in Geneva. That is why President Maithripala Sirisena was to publicly declare that he would not allow foreign judges in any war crimes inquiry. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also of the same opinion, pointing out that such a move would not be consistent with the Constitution.
The minister doing the spadework for the Government, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, has often been vilified by the JO as working to appease the UNHRC and Eelamist lobby rather than confronting them. However, after the passage of the resolutions was negotiated successfully in Geneva, Samaraweera was to clarify Colombos position.
Credible judicial process
The inclusion of foreign judicial personnel in a domestic process was not the sole obsession of the government or the international community, Samaraweera explained. The governments main concern was establishing a fair, independent and credible judicial process that will address the needs of all stakeholders, the Minister said.
Though the events of last week will bring much needed respite to the government in Colombo, it does come at a price. That is because the deadline granted to the government expires in 2019. This necessarily means that, given the tight time frames with which Colombo is struggling, matters related to the UNHRC will come to the forefront in 2019.
This is the year before the next national elections which are due in 2020. Whether a presidential election will be called for will depend on when an elected Executive Presidency remains in the Constitution at that stage. A general election will certainly be due in 2020.
It is difficult to predict whether the same political alliances will remain in 2019, but if they do, it doesnt take a genius to predict that the JO will attempt to gain maximum political advantage of any inquiry that is held on alleged war crimes, foreign judges or not. This is a factor which the government needs to be mindful of.
It must also note with concern that it has been in office for more than two years now and while some progress has been made on the issue of ethnic reconciliation, if events are to proceed at the same pace for the next two years, there wouldnt be many achievements to showcase.
Therefore, it will be very much in the governments interest to expedite ethnic reconciliation and any inquiries into alleged war crimes as soon as possible. This would ensure that it is able to front up to the UNHRC in 2019 and assure the Council that it has fulfilled all its obligations.
More importantly though, if it can dispose of the issue of alleged war crimes by 2019, it could stand before the Sri Lankan electorate with confidence, not fearing a backlash from any community.
That, perhaps more than anything else, should motivate those walking the corridors of power to act decisively- and to act now.

Drinking water project in Apura north
A mega water supply scheme to provide drinking water to the people in Medawachchiya, Rambewa and Mihintale in Anuradhapura north is under way. Villagers in these areas have been facing shortage of drinking water and suffering from to kidney diseases.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provides a loan of Rs. 11,940 million and the government provides Rs. 2,956 million for the Anuradhapura north drinking water supply project.
Project Director Engineer D.B. Gunadasa said the National Water Supply and Drainage Board under the Town Planning and Water Supply Ministry implements the project. The Mihintale Mahakanadarawa reservoir with a water capacity of 36,250 acre feet is the water source for the scheme.
Kidney diseases are spreading in Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Rambewa and Mihintale. Around 15,000 kidney patients have been found in the Anuradhapura district since 2006. About 20 - 25 persons die of kidney diseases monthly.
It is believed that key reasons for kidney diseases are Algae, heavy metals and agrochemicals entering the body with brackish water.

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry join together to 'shatter the stigma' of mental illness

Attitudes to mental health in Britain are now at a "tipping point", the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry have said, as they sign up a host of high-profile public figures to help "shatter the stigma".
The senior Royalslaunched the next stage of theirHeads Together campaignon Thursday: a series of ten videos designed to spark "simple conversations" about mental health.
Starring the likes of Freddie Flintoff, Ruby Wax, Stephen Manderson - better known as the musician Professor Green - and Alastair Campbell, the videos are part of the Royals' ongoing battle to break down the "walls of judgement" they perceive to be standing in the way of progress.
In a joint statement, the Duke, Duchess and Prince Harry said: "Since we launched Heads Together last May, we have seen time and time again that shattering stigma on mental health starts with simple conversations.
"When you realise that mental health problems affect your friends, neighbours, children and spouses, the walls of judgement and prejudice around these issues begin to fall.
"And we all know that you cannot resolve a mental health issue by staying silent.
"Attitudes to mental health are at a tipping point. We hope these films show people how simple conversations can change the direction of an entire life. Please share them with your friends and families and join us in a national conversation on mental health in the weeks ahead."
The videos, published online, are the next step in a building campaign which will next month culminate in the London Marathon, where around 700 runners including theTelegraph's Bryony Gordon will embark on 26.2 miles in aid of the charity.
Afurther 39,000 branded headbands will be available to any other runner who wishes to show their support for Heads Together, in recognition of how mental health affects copious other good causes.
The Duke, Duchess and Prince Harry are understood to have actively explored taking part in the marathon themselves, but will not be running on April 23.
The Duchess has previously said: "I think there might be a few security issues..."
The trio have each spent months emphasising the importance of speaking about mental health, with the Duchess last week talking frankly about the lack of confidence she suffered after becoming a new mother.
Prince Harry, who underwent a training course to help people suffering mental health crises when he worked in the Army's personal recovery unit, has campaigned for those in the armed forces to stop feeling ashamed about admitting they have a problem.
And the Duke of Cambridge has taken courses on mental health issues as part of his work as an air ambulance pilot. The video series, which will be launched on Facebook, Twitter and Google and followed by new films each week, has been made by directors including Stephen Frears, the man behind The Queen, Philomena and Dangerous Liaisons. Ruby Wax will talk to her husband, director Ed Bye, about the moment she revealed she was "mentally ill" moments before they tied the knot in a registry office, while Alastair Campbell discusses his nervous breakdown and depression with wife Fiona.
Flintoff and Manderson are filmed together discussing their own battles with their minds, while newsreader Mark Austin discusses anorexia with his daughter Maddy.
Other films show new mothers, ambulance drivers and Royal Marines talking about their experiences, in a bid to encourage others to do the same.
Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, one of the Heads Together charity partners, said: It is truly groundbreaking to see so many people, from all walks of life, sharing their mental health experiences on film in the hope of inspiring others to strike up their own conversation.
"These films have the power to spark life-changing and, in some cases, life-saving conversations. We hope that there will be a snowball effect with more and more people seeing the benefits of speaking out and supporting each other. Stephan Shakespeare, CEO of YouGov which has published a study into mental health, said: The nation is at a tipping point in our willingness to talk openly about mental health, and it is young people who are taking the lead."

Entrust Securities has been borrowing money from CB: Commission
The Entrust Securities, a primary dealer which has allegedly been involved in large scale frauds and mismanagement, has been borrowing money from the Central Bank with no government securities,it was revealed at the Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
The money invested in were from the pension funds of the Central Bank and the Ceylon Electricity Board. It was also revealed that the borrowings have been taking place from 2010 until 2015, when former Governor Arjun Mahendra took steps to look into the matter.
The Public Debt Department, which is responsible in supervising the Primary Dealers, has not reported on the mismatch in securities, Deputy Governor P.Samarasiri pointed out.
He said even though the PDD has done routine inspections on Entrust Securities, this mismatch of securities has not been observed.
Asked if he would be surprised if he is suggested that there was a close rapport between the Primary Dealers and the PDD officers, DG Samarasiri said in fact he will not be surprised.
Samarasiri was replying to a submission made by Arjun Mahendrans Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva.

EU blocks Deutsche Boerses $14 bn London Stock Exchange takeover
European Union regulators dealt a final blow to Deutsche Boerse AGs planned takeover of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, a symbolic block on EU-U.K. integration on the same day Britain formally serves notice of its decision to quit the EU.
The $14 billion deal to create Europes biggest exchange would have harmed competition in the soon-to-be 27-nation EU by creating a de facto monopoly for clearing bonds and repurchase agreements, the European Commission said in an emailed statement.
The decision, flagged last month by LSE, thwarts Deutsche Boerses expansion just five years after the EU also banned a proposed tie-up with NYSE Euronext.
The commission cannot allow the creation of monopolies and that is what would have happened in this case, Margrethe Vestager, the EUs antitrust commissioner, told reporters in Brussels. LSE was not prepared to sell a small unit that would have removed concerns that the combined firm could have weakened rival Euronext NV.
EU regulators have become increasingly tough on big deals, demanding weighty concessions to eliminate overlapping businesses amid concerns that a combined firm could dominate an industry and increase prices. While this is the second time that Vestager has formally blocked a merger, several transactions have been ditched over antitrust opposition.
Deutsche Boerse confirmed the deals collapse shortly after the decision. When the exchange receives the formal notice, the merger agreement will automatically terminate, the German company said in a statement.
The prohibition is a setback for Europe, the Capital Markets Union and the bridge between continental Europe and Great Britain, Deutsche Boerse Chairman Joachim Faber said in an emailed statement. A rare opportunity to create a global market infrastructure provider based in Europe and to strengthen the global competitiveness of Europes financial markets has been missed.
Opposition to the Frankfurt-based exchanges merger plans went up a gear after the U.K. voted to leave the EU last year. German concerns over moving the combined firms headquarters to London added to political riptides over clearing euro trades outside the euro area.

Europe and the Extreme Right Candidates
Cold gales of extremism are blowing over Europe from North America.
Religious sectarianism is now fuelling violence in the capitals of the so called civilised sections of the world kindling arguments that would once have been forbidden by the laws of these countries. The world seems to be deciding whether multiculturalism and globalisation does work or not.
With the policies of President Donald to clean the United States of Terrorism extreme right leaders in the old continent are confidently making headway with blowing anti Islam trumpets around Europe West to East and North to South. The first extreme right casualty has been the infamous Dutchman Geert Wilders. Yet the extreme anti Muslim feelings have grown from Italy to Sweden, from Spain to the borders of Turkey where anti-European feelings grow stronger by the minute.
So, what has gone wrong
Countries were created by a world order victors of two world wars who to stop the turmoil in Europe invented the United Nations to create Israel the Biblical mythological country Israel to pacify Jews who were hounded out of many countries including the British Isles, France, Spain, Portugal and of course Germany. This became the tinder of the wars of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. In each case the Western powers were using their firepower and the servile United Nations to instigate regime change of anyone who opposed Israel or the Western countries.
Socialists and Communist Trade Unions
The Muslim colonies of these countries had by then been exporting cheap labour to the factories of the industrialised west. The older generation of Arab and sub Saharan Muslims mostly illiterate very hard working and raised young families to respect law and order. They soon became naturalise British, Frenchmen or Germans on paper. But how real was their naturalisation.
In the 1970s I was as working class as they were and pushing buttons on machines in a cable factory in a Communist orientated suburb of Clichy. The Socialists and Communist Trade Unions were a powerful force because they defended the working class against even the moderate Right Wing of Georges Pompidou, Giscard DEstaing and Jacques Chirac. In 1980 with the help of the Communists Franois Mitterrand was voted in and it seemed that although he took a pro-working stance he gave the extreme right Leader Jean Marie Le Pen the chance of openly attacking the foreigners who he said had invaded France and were preaching hatred from mosques that liberal parties had allowed to sprout with the Republican parties.
The British Isles was no different in the 1960s to the 1990s. Discrimination was rife. Coloured migrants found housing difficult to obtain if not impossible. They had to settle for derelict houses in slums just as Irish immigrants were forced into some years before.
In France, most of my workmates came from the slum housing of the North Parisian suburbs. They spoke halting French and found socialising with the French impossible. They felt no bitterness because they had been prepared to face that battle. Was this a part of Christian France I often wondered but as I moved on and the younger generation of Muslims grew to working age I realised that they were confined to the lower echelons of employment even with proper education. The stigma of the Holy Wars probably was in most middle and upper class peoples minds.
Soon the front running candidate in the French Election Marine Le Pen will dissect French antipathy and show how racist France can be. But then it is not just Islam against Christianity. The right-wing English and French are even against the East European accused of unfairly taking the jobs of the working class. The Polish, the Czechs, the Greeks, Romanians even the Portuguese, Spanish and Italians are taking our jobs they claim. Would they mind if it were the Swiss Norwegians, the Swedes and the Danes coming in No, they dont but the lesser Vikings; the Latvians, Estonians Poles and Hungarians are the problem. To these people every Sterling Pound or Euro is better value in their own countries merely because the cost of living in those countries are lower that the rich European ones.
If you can bang a fist on a table and shout out that the balance must be restored. Scream out that the factories of the industrial countries to be redeployed to the homelands you can reap in the votes. Have they any reason to believe that having done that the cost of every bolt and screw, every nail and tail will cost more when they are manufactured in England and France Look at Germany they will say not realising that the Nazis of yester year have millions of Turkish and Pakistanis on the lines of factories and continue to call for migrants to join the work force.
Is Trump for real
History studied carefully will tell us that the antagonists of peace are the ones have instigated regime changes and created breaches around the Middle East and North Africa. They toppled Sadaam Hussein on the pretext that he had Weapons of Mass Destruction, they were afraid of Ghaddafis influence in Africa so these men were toppled. They found it the duty of NATO to arm the moderate Afghanis first against the Russians and then against these very same moderate Afghanis who now, are the Taliban and Al Kaida and even ISIL!
Will they ever have an extreme right Government is now a question posed in every country in Europe. Yes, the US voted in a businessman who promises to make America great again while ignoring Media Freedom and the basic Human Rights of the First Nations  the native Americans. But then again, the other nation that presents itself as the paragon of Human Rights; Canada is no better. Refugees and Migrants before the Natives. Is Trump for real He is and he will make enemies but Geminis I know dont mind making enemies.
Europe will never ever have an elected President from the Extreme Right if the refugees of yester-year, the migrants of yesterday and the real French people.
They do want to see their own country chasing after an illusion of being a world power, just as the most unpopular French President thought he could be. All the republican parties will in the second round of the election unite to defeat Marine Le Pen again and again. It happened in Austria, now in Holland and if world war two was before my time Hitler did promise to make Germany great and he did for a while only.

Expelling irresponsible party organisers: SP Chief Minister lauds President's action
President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to expel party organisers who did not comply with party obligations and responsibilities and live up to the expectations of party leadership was timely and fitting, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
The Chief Minister was speaking at a convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Womens Organisation of the Ambalangoda electorate recently.
He said President Sirisena led the party democratically. He provided opportunities for all to work independently rendering the party's vision and mission. However, some organisers acted against party policies and decisions. He was not in a hurry to initiate action against nonconformists. The President gave them enough time to be self-corrected. But they acted on their wrong political assumptions. The President had to take action against such wayward party men for the benefit of the party, the Chief Minister said.
He said some persons preferred to engage in politics depending on individuals. But a political party does not exist on a single persons political charisma. Such illogical political exercises are not enduring, he said.
Chief Minister de Silva said the duty and obligation of an organiser is to act according to the party's decisions, upholding the party vision and mission. He should carry the party message to the public. If an organiser advocates any political doctrine that is against the party ideology, it is not a genuine political exercise. Such political moves are unethical and indecorous. If certain persons want to act according to their personal political whims, they should resign from responsibilities without betraying the party and party leadership. The party leadership has the right take a decision on such persons, the Chief Minister said.

In form Trinity can win league
The inter-school first round league rugby tournament for 2017 is coming to an end. Trinity College Kandy has finished their first round with resounding success having won all the matches played. If Trinity continues to play in this fashion they should have no problem in winning the schools league title. Schools rugger today, particularly in Kandy is the number one glamour sport. Its popularity is shown by the large crowds at matches.
It is also significant that rugby crowds have been swelling with great interest, but the rugby organization for the schools controlling body has left much to be desired. Today out of the Kandy schools only one or two schools are backed with much needed facilities, most of the schools are lacking the basic facilities and are severely handicapped and lack what they need. Some schools lack good trained MICs who know the game. Some of them dont even know the names of their players. To play a game, a school needs over Rs. 50,000 as ground charges together with other expenses it comes to over Rs. 85,000.
TRINTIY COLLEGE: Led by Nathan Yee and coached by Lote Raikabula, who is assisted by Buddika Abeyasinghe playing in Division I Segment 2A opened the season beating Wesley and continued their winning streak by beating Science, Zahira, S. Thomas and Prince of Wales. Now they are waiting for the second round peak in performance. Their key game the Bradby Shield against Royal will be the 73rd, and the first leg is scheduled for 20 May in Kandy. The second leg on 3 June is in Colombo. Trinity has a wealth of talent in their forwards and their back division too comprises some exciting players. Whatever the secret of their success, rugger has always been the most popular game at Trinity College since it was first introduced in 1906.
VIDYARTHA COLLEGE: Led by Sachintha Kaluarachchi and coached by one of the most qualified coaches Anil Jayasinghe are with three wins in three outings against Ananda, Maliyadeva and St. Sylvesters. Their last game is with Kingswood College. It has been postponed a few times and still the new date has not been fixed. They have a good side, but their weakness is in their back division. They are playing in the Division I segment 2B. Vidyartha is a school which earned a name in the field of rugby. The game was introduced to the school chiefly due to the initiative of Old Trinitians. It was Kandy Sports Club who helped them to find their feet at rugby by permitting them to use of their grounds at Nittawela free of charge, and also channeling their knowledgeable players to coach the Vidyartha boys.
St. ANTHONYS COLLEGE: Led by Dinuk Amarasinghe and coached by Nihal Viper Gunaratne and assisted by Nalaka Weerakkody have won only one game against D.S. Senanayake and lost to St. Josephs, Isipathana and St Peters. Their next game is on 1 April with Dharmaraja and on 8 April with Royal. St. Anthonys is a school which has reached great heights in the field of rugby, after coming into the game in the late 1950s. They have come a long way in the game. They have the potential to perform better, but there is some hoodoo which seems to be prevailing over them. It is time they settled down to some solid rugby to repeat their past glory. They play in Division 1 Segment 1A.
ST. SYLVESTERS COLLEGE: Led by Kelum Rajapakse and coached by Aruna Rankothge from whom a lot was expected in the first round have failed to oblige. They have managed to win only one game against St. Johns and lost to Vidyartha, Kingswood and Maliyadeva. Their next game is on 1 April with Ananda. A school which started rugby in the mid 1950s and had to give up and restart in the 1980s sad to say their performances have been very disappointing. The school together with the OBA need to study the actual reason for the teams poor performance and find avenues to provide the important needs in order to do better in 2018. The players have no proper facilities to train. They are in Division I Segment 2B.
KINGSWOOD COLLEGE: They began the season well, out of the three matches in Division I Segment 2B with wins over Maliyadeva, Ananda and St. Sylvesters. Their last game is with Vidyartha for which a date has yet to be fixed. Kingswood are led by S.S.Jamson and are coached by D.D.S. Gamage who guided the under 18 side to win the All Island championship last season. They were the first to play the game when they were known as Kandy Boys High School. The match was against Trinity, which ended in a 6-all draw. They gave up rugby and re started in the 1970s.
DHARMARAJA COLLEGE: Playing in Division 1 Segment 1A they are led by Shamika Perera and coached by Isipathanian Kapila de Silva, who has done a good job in coaching the team against all odds. Performance wise the team has given a dismal display. They have won only one match but almost every game saw a very close call towards their victory, means the team has not reached peak form and lack experience, the last outing against D.S. Senanayake and lost to Royal in the last few seconds of the game. Isipthana and St.Josephs were close games. They are left with two more games with St. Anthonys and St. Peters. It is hoped that at least in the second round, the players will play some attacking rugby.
SRI SUMANGALA COLLEGE: They are with two wins against Carey and Moratuwa Vidyalaya but lost to St. Benedicts and Nalanda. Their next game is with Panadura Royal. They are led by Supun Madushanka and coached by former Army, Defence Services and Sri Lanka player G. Dharmapala. Rugby has caught up well and there is great potential in the teams performance. They lack the basic facility of grounds to train. They play in Division I Segment 2C.
SRI RAHULA: Playing in Division 2 Segment 1B they have played two games won against Dharmapala Pannipitiya and lost to Padukka Priyarathne. They have to play against Nugawela, St. Aloysius and Devapathiraja. The side is led W.M. Yohan and coached by Nalin.

Govt. to purchase 1,000 buses for SLTB
The government will purchase 1,000 buses for the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) within the next few months in order to strengthen the SLTB bus fleet and the route network. The government also intends to start a super luxury metro bus service within Colombo and its suburbs.
Leyland Engines
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said, Although the SLTB has 7,700 buses in its fleet, only 6,000 buses are in operational condition at present.
The Minister said this while addressing the gathering in the ceremony of distributing new engine kits for the SLTB buses at the Udahamulla bus depot yesterday. He said that the SLTB needs at least 10,000 buses to provide quality service to the public. Accordingly, 500 new engine kits were provided to the Udahamulla bus depot to be fitted into 500 unused buses need in engine repairs.
He further said Politics prevailing in the country is responsible for the collapse of the SLTB.
SLTB was destroyed due to the political influences under all the regimes that came into the power previously.
All former governments filled the SLTB with their supporters unnecessarily. All SLTB workers have rights to engage in politics, but the SLTB administration itself must be devoid of politics. We all must get-together and work to uplift the SLTB despite the party politics.

Hidden factors behind: female terrorism
Sri Lanka suffered countless terrorist attacks over the course of the thirty-year civil conflict, and many of those who carried out such atrocities were female. Everyone remembers the repugnant work of Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, the LTTE operative who assassinated Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. But perhaps few recall the many other violent acts perpetrated by women, the most deadly of which was the bombing of a presidential rally in 1994 that killed Gamini Dissanayake and over 50 others.
Due to the countrys history of women-executed attacks and the growing participation of female combatants in global extremism, the Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) hosted a public lecture on the subject of women in terrorism.
INSSSL British research Fellow Michelle Brooks, who specializes in counter-terrorism and complex emergency response, delivered the talk, which was titled Women and Terrorism: Tactical Gains Amidst Strategic Losses.
The lecture aimed to elucidate why women are increasingly joining Muslim extremist organizations and carrying out suicide bombings. This issue is of particular interest to Sri Lanka, according to Brooks, since the chances of womens radicalization are increasing as more young Muslim girls are forced into marriage when they are as young as 12.
She explained that women are drawn into these groups due to political, religious, psychological, and even biological factors that are quite different from those that drive men towards extremism.
Though the talk was broad in scope, it was somewhat scattered and riddled with contradictions, which further demonstrated the inherent difficulty in identifying the causes that push people to commit these horrific acts.
Brooks offered convincing information on the social and psychological factors that lead to radicalization, but her analysis of Islams role left much to be desired.
The main argument was that, from a young age, Muslim women are taught to fear being banished to eternal hellfire after death, and that carrying out suicide missions is a way to atone for sins and gain entry to paradise.
INSSSL British research Fellow Michelle Brooks
Furthermore, she claimed that some nebulous biological factors drive women to carry out these missions. Men, she said, are not subject to these biological influences. She did not qualify this claim at all, but insisted that, for women, everything is biological.
That being said, her thinking on the psychological and social elements pushing women towards terrorism was convincing, though many of her arguments would apply to men as well as women.
Societal Push Factors
Brooks began her talk by explaining how the narrative around terrorism and suicide bombings has focused almost exclusively on mens actions. Security forces all over the world are trained to watch out for male jihadis, which has opened up opportunities for female combatants to attack.
Moreover, security forces are reluctant to search women or apprehend them due to concerns about appearing Islamophobic. There are also asymmetries in how police view potential threats from men and women.
For instance, after French police arrested Amedy Coulibaly, who would later kill a French police officer and take hostages at a Paris supermarket, for espousing extremist views, they consulted his wife, Hayat Boumeddienne. After searching her flat and discovering large amounts of assault rifle ammunition, police asked her about Coulibalys views. Though Boumedienne told police that she agreed with everything her husband had said, they let her go and placed him in jail.
Brooks blamed the patriarchal nature of society for peoples ignorance of womens power to commit terrorist attacks. She also argued that the fact that women becoming terrorists is evidence of their systematic subjugation.
After discussing the shortcomings of Western security personnel in identifying and neutralizing the rising threat of female terrorists, Brooks launched into an extended exposition of the push factors that help radicalize women.
Understandably, trauma plays a large role in goading women towards terrorism, according to Brooks. A womans radicalization is often directly linked to the death of a loved one. Almost every woman Ive interviewed has stated they lost somebody very close to them before joining terrorist organizations or launching attacks, she said.
She likewise noted that some women are driven to terrorism by the loss of trust in the state.
When you are born in a country, you think that country will protect you. And if it does not in fact protect you, you feel betrayed. People then search for a purpose because they no longer feel like they belong in the country they were born in, and this can lead to extremism, she said. It is rather puzzling that Brooks neglected to mention the decades-long history of western-led interventions in Muslim countries as a factor in radicalizing people. Instead, she appeared to place the blame on the governments of the countries that have been invaded.
Brooks added that the fame and recognition that come with successfully carrying out an attack are also driving forces for women who feel ignored, silenced, and subjugated by society.
There can also be financial motivations, as terrorist organizations look after children whose parents have carried out attacks. They also give maintenance grants to families who have offered their children to be martyred.
Yet another radicalizing factor is familial pressure, whether it comes from parents, relatives, or spouses.
Some women are encouraged to go down the path of violence from day one by those around them. But others are goaded on by their husbands, she said, while adding that women in traditional marriages can be very obedient and seek relationships where they must be submissive. In contradiction, Brooks stated that women are not forced into committing terrorist acts, but are instead banging on the doors of terrorist organizations and demanding to take part in bombings.
Its what they want, she said.While this inconsistency in her argument is somewhat confusing, it illustrates the inherent difficulties in classifying those who are likely to be radicalized. Part of the lecture focused on the backgrounds of women who went on to become terrorists, and suffice it to say that many of them came from very different circumstances.
Boumeddienne, mentioned above, was one of seven born to Algerian parents in the suburbs of Paris. Her mother died when she was six, and her father put her and some of her siblings in foster care. She was radicalized after she met Coulibaly. In comparison, Samantha Lewthwaite, the wife of Gemaine Lindsay, one of the bombers who executed the 7/7 attack in London, was born in Northern Ireland, and after her parents separated, converted to Islam. She was a high-achieving college student who dropped out after meeting Lindsay and becoming radicalized. Indeed, these women share almost no commonalities, but they were involved with extremist men, a trend that Brooks highlighted. Finally, Brooks mentioned the pervasive sense of hopelessness that many female terrorists share as a problematic factor.
To combat female extremism, we need to think about why women become disappointed in society, feel hopeless, and get angry, she said.Most of the above push factors do seem like legitimate areas of concern and interest, but it should be mentioned that almost all of them apply to men as well as women.
Influence of Terrorist Groups
Perhaps the most interesting portion of the lecture dealt with how terrorist organizations recruit women by treating them as powerful people whom society is ignoring.
Brooks mentioned that the Western world conceives of Muslim women as oppressed and submissive, and that extremist groups play on these notions to entice women to commit attacks.
Groups like Somalias Al-Shabab appeal to women along the lines of feminism, saying that women can show their power and strength through bombings. The woman who blows herself up explodes the myths of womens weakness, submissiveness, and enslavement, Brooks said.
These groups tell women that they will empower them, give them high-ranking positions, and provide them with weapons and explosives training. These are things that normal women in normal society would never get, she added.
Whats more, she shared that radical groups eroticize terror when recruiting young girls. These girls, who are sexually inexperienced and immature, associate romantic love with terrorism, and think that they can find love through committing attacks.
Many of the young women who have traveled from Europe to join ISIS in Syria have, according to Brooks, been moved to leave by this form of recruitment.
Brooks likewise contended that terrorist organizations could offer a sense of inclusion to those who have felt locked out of society. In their publications and pamphlets, many groups use words like sister to foster a sense of companionship and mutual care.
The groups understand how to reach women, and we in the West are far behind them. We have to do better to understand how these women feel and why they might look to terrorism as an escape, she said.
Finally, Brooks discussed what must be done to combat the growing threat of female terrorists going forwardusing the Internet to reach those who are vulnerable to radicalization is of chief importance. Though we might not see them voicing their views in public, women have private lives online, and they can be reached by terrorist recruiters every single day. We need to use social media and websites like YouTube to reach isolated groups. Terrorist organizations can reach them, but so can we, and we have to do better, she said.

If Govt. ignores Oversight Committees, JO will withdraw from them: Dullas
If the Government is ignoring the Sectoral Oversight Committees in Parliament, the Joint Opposition MPs will consider withdrawing from them, UPFA MP Dullas Allahapperuma said.
He was speaking at a press conference at the Dr.N.M.Perera Memorial Hall in Borella yesterday.
He pointed out a copy on the draft agreement on the Hambantota Port Joint Venture has not been referred to the Oversight Committee.
He charged the Government is going to get the port agreement signed by concealing its vital information.
If the Government is going ahead on this move without taking it up at the Oversight Committee, then our MPs will decide to withdraw from these committees he said.
He observed the UNP and SLFP members in the Government ranks were making contradictory statements on the Hambantota Port Agreement while the Subject Minister is saying another story.
Commenting on the UNHRC proceedings, MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena said a full day debate on this subject has been facilitated in Parliament on April 6 following a request from the Joint Opposition. He said the Government consented in Geneva to a resolution that goes against the country.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the MP admitted meeting the President and Prime Minister over the issue relating to MP Wimal Weerawansa. However, the MP declined to reveal to the media anything that was discussed during this meet up.

Ivanka Trump is making her White House job official

Ivanka Trump is changing course andwill become a government employee in the coming days, a White House official told CNN Wednesday.
President Donald Trump's eldest daughter will be an unpaid employee working in the West Wing.
"I have heard the concerns some have with my advising the President in my personal capacity while voluntarily complying with all ethics rules, and I will instead serve as an unpaid employee in the White House Office, subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees," Ivanka Trump said in a statement. "Throughout this process I have been working closely and in good faith with the White House counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role."
A source with knowledge of the decision told CNN's Gloria Borger the decision was made after the "unease" expressed by people about the nature of her voluntary role, and ethics advocates Norm Eisen and Fred Wertheimer had sent White House counsel Don McGhan a letter last Friday.
Power couple
Now, Ivanka Trump will be an "adviser" to the President, and will file her own Form 278, which means she is legally bound by the ethics rules.
An unsigned statement from the White House said: "We are pleased that Ivanka Trump has chosen to take this step in her unprecedented role as first daughter and in support of the President."
Trump's attorney, Jamie S. Gorelick, said: "Ivanka's decision reflects both her commitment to compliance with federal ethics standards and her openness to opposing points of view. She will file the financial disclosure forms required of federal employees and be bound by the same ethics rules that she had planned to comply with voluntarily."
Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband and a top Trump aide, is also serving the White House as an unpaid government employee.
News of Trump's new title was firstreported by The New York Times.
A White House official confirmed last week that, after a few months settling into Washington, Trump was officially moving into a West Wing office and would obtain top-secret security clearance. She will also receive government-provided communications devices, per the official.
Nepotism
Ivanka Trump's elevation has prompted critics to note the potential violation of the nepotism law, passed in 1967, that says no public official -- from the President down to a low-level manager at a federal agency -- may hire or promote a relative.
But the law states that any appointee found to have violated the law is "not entitled to pay" by the federal government, which appears to offer the opportunity for Trump and Kushner to forgo paychecks while still serving the administration.
When Kushner officially joined Trump's team in January, the Justice Department concluded that his post as senior adviser was not in violation of federal anti-nepotism laws.
"In choosing his personal staff, the President enjoys an unusual degree of freedom, which Congress found suitable to the demands of his office," wrote Daniel Koffsky, deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel, which serves as interpreter of federal law for the White House.
Koffsky reasoned in January that the anti-nepotism law covers only appointments in an "executive" agency and that the White House Office is not an executive agency within the law. He cited a separate law that gives the President broad powers to hire his staff.
That law authorizes the President to appoint "employees in the White House office without regard to any other provision of law regulating the employment or compensation of persons in the government service."
Ivanka Trump took a formal leave of absence from her eponymous apparel and accessories brand, as well as the Trump Organization, in January. She has long been a key trusted adviser to her father, through her young adulthood to her time as executive vice president of real estate development and acquisition at the Trump Organization, and, ultimately, to his 2016 presidential campaign.
Trump will continue in that capacity, serving as the President's "eyes and ears," per Gorelick.
"She will not be his only source of input and insight, obviously, but she may be able to provide insights into the concerns of people whom he might not meet as President," Gorelick told CNN via email last week.
Already at work

Maldives sovereign bond offer tests economic prospects
Island group's first international debt instrument highlights economic and political concerns:
In an apartment block facing Colombo's coast, members of the large Maldivian diaspora in the Sri Lankan capital are discussing economic developments at home. The latest topic: a decision by the government of President Abdulla Yameen to float the country's first sovereign bond, seeking to raise $200 million.
Commercial bankers in Sri Lanka, the Maldives closest neighbour, are also tuning in for more details. We still don't know the yield and the date of the issue, a senior commercial banker in Colombo said, asking not to be identified. All that is known is that the bond will have a maturity of five years and will be issued within March.
Moody's, a global credit ratings agency, has assigned a B2 rating with a stable outlook to the Maldivian bond. But the rating falls into the agency's highly speculative category, and is labeled subject to high credit risk.
The Maldivian economy has been driven by a huge expansion in tourism, Moody's noted, helping to boost per capita incomes to $15,000 a year in purchasing power parity terms -- the highest in South Asia -- and boosting government confidence in the bond's prospects. We're really confident we would be able to get our targeted funds, Finance Minister Ahamed Munawwar told local media in February. This would be a historic achievement for this sector.
Not everybody is cheering. The bond issue has prompted uncomfortable questions about the Maldivian economy from longtime observers, who point to the isolated tourist resorts among the 1,192 Maldivian islands in the Indian Ocean to drive home the point.
Banking sector
Each resort, built at costs ranging from $20 million to $100 million, attracts piles of dollars from foreign holidaymakers, but most of this cash never enters the Maldivian banking sector. All the materials needed to build and run the resorts have to be imported, so most building and running costs are spent outside the Maldives. Tourists often pay offshore in dollars, or book online, transferring money to foreign bank accounts.
A financial analyst in Colombo shakes his head as he talks about the parallel economies in the Indian Ocean archipelago. Technically, the Maldives can go bankrupt, if you look at the way economic data is calculated, he said, on condition of anonymity, as he weighed official numbers against the latest economic indicators on the ground in South Asia's smallest country, where 400,000 people inhabit 200 islands.
Other bankers and economists in the Colombo share similar views. If you look at the numbers, the Maldivian economy looks like it can go off a cliff at times, one economist said, also on condition of anonymity. But that doesn't factor the dollars circulating outside the formal banking system.
Events in the last few months have fueled worries about the $3.27 billion economy, where the dollar is used for daily commerce as much as the rufiyaa, the local currency. The Maldives Monetary Authority, the central bank, triggered concerns by buying a $140 million bond from the state-owned airport company.
The company needed dollars to pay compensation to GMR, an Indian infrastructure company, whose contract to develop and manage the country's main airport was abruptly terminated in 2014. The saga, which will ultimately cost the Maldivian state $271 million in damages, has severely damaged the islands reputation for investor protection.
The impression of an increasingly troubled economy heightened in mid-November, when locals began queuing outside commercial banks in Male, the capital, as the country was hit by a dollar shortage. The central bank was forced to step in on Nov. 20, taking over dollar sales from the commercial banks.
The scene added to alarm about the country's foreign reserves, which had amounted to $187 million at the end of October, before the GMR settlement. Critics have assailed the government for reducing the reserves to an all-time low of $47 million.
Powerful ammunition
Reports that the government was under financial strain continued through January, when it had to delay paying the salaries of some civil servants -- providing powerful ammunition to former President Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader, who is living in exile. President Yameen is isolated, and he is running out of money, Nasheed told journalists in Colombo during a brief stopover. He cannot pay the civil servants.
The increasingly autocratic Yameen, who is filling Maldivian prisons with one-time allies (including his former vice president) and political adversaries, appears to be spoiling for a fight. Those who shiver over the high debt we have to shoulder can keep shivering, the 57-year-old leader said after inaugurating a clean water project on Meemu atoll. We are going forward with this debt because we do not shiver.
In that vein, Yameen has decided to ignore the World Bank, which warned about the dangers posed by the Maldives chronic debt in a 2016 report. The ratio of public debt to gross domestic product is forecast to hit 96% in 2017, from 83% in 2016, 73% in 2015 and 66.3% in 2014, according to the bank. The country also endured a slowdown in economic growth in 2015, when GDP growth fell to 1.9%, from 6.5% the year before, according to the World Bank. The Yameen administration paints a rosier picture of the economy, claiming it grew by 4.8% in 2015. A government minister said that the World Bank was jealous of Yameen's development achievements.
However, the International Monetary Fund has also expressed concern about the Maldives high public debt levels. [Debt is already high] following persistent fiscal problems, and while investment programmes could boost growth in the long run, it will substantially add to fiscal and external risks in the near future, the IMF said in a review of the Maldivian economy last year.
Yameen is trying to boost his political fortunes with three large Chinese-funded infrastructure projects that have made construction and public infrastructure spending the main drivers of the economy, which grew by 3.6% in 2016. The projects include the airport expansion scheme, now being handled by a Chinese company; a $120 million bridge being built to connect Male to a separate island where the airport is located; and a port enlargement on Laamu atoll. China accounts for 70% of the Maldives foreign debt, estimated at $741.6 million.
Observers say that Yameen has got his way because of a political culture that rewards bad governance. There is a business-political-bureaucratic nexus in the Maldives that finds bad governance -- or misgovernance -- profitable, said Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director of the Regional Center for Strategic Studies, an independent think tank in Colombo. The absence of a strong civil society has added to this climate, but that makes the political structures very unstable.
Speaking out against the culture of corruption has a price. Niyaz Ibrahim, a former Maldivian Auditor General, fled the country in late 2016 following a series of death threats. His troubles began after he stated in his 2014 auditor general's report that prominent members of Yameen's regime and their cronies had profited from $300 million in kickbacks.
Now you cannot trust the official statistics of the government, because the numbers are made public to give a positive image of the president, Ibrahim told the Nikkei Asian Review in Colombo. This is what is worrying about the sovereign bond.
Against this background, convincing foreign investors to snap up this first-time bond will be a test of the acceptability of Maldivian economic data. The Yameen regime's representatives may find that roadshows planned to attract investors turn out to be opportunities for critics to ask awkward questions.

More whistleblowers are talking to WADA, says Reedie
LONDON: Several whistleblowers have approached the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) through a new programme set up after revelations of rampant state-sponsored
doping in Russia, WADA President Craig Reedie said on Wednesday.
WADA this month launched its Speak Up secure digital platform for athletes and others to report anti-doping violations.
We already have a number of whistleblowers speaking to us, so I am told, said Reedie, speaking at the SportsPro Live conference. He had no details about which sports or countries might be involved.
The investigations people do not tell the president of the organisation what they are doing.
And thats exactly the way it should be. That has to be confidential.
Asked whether the world might be facing another big
scandal, after Russian track and field athletes were banned from last years Rio Olympics, Reedie said he did not know but hoped not.
WADA recommended that the entire Russian team be excluded from Rio after an independent report by Richard McLaren, published just before those Games, accused the country of widespread state-sponsored doping.
The IOC rejected a proposed blanket ban and instead let international sports federations decide which athletes should be eligible to compete.
Russia has said it hopes to have the suspension of its anti-doping body RUSADA lifted in November, but Reedie said that could not be relied upon.
He said a decision on Russian athletes participation at next years Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea needed to be made as early as possible and they could expect an aggressive programme of targeted testing in the run-up.
I certainly want (Russia) to be compliant as quickly as possible. Not having the biggest country in the world compliant poses problems for sport that sport is finding very, very difficult to handle, he said.
What I think is important going into Pyeongchang is that whatever else happens, there is a very rigorous pre-Games testing exercise, he added.
I think the pre-Games testing programme, which is easier to do for a winter Games than a summer Games because youve got fewer sports, will almost certainly be extensive and authoritative.
The chances of Russian athletes competing at this years world athletics championships in London in August remain slim.
I think it would be difficult for the IAAF to remove the suspension of Russian athletics while the Russian anti-doping agency is non-compliant, Reedie said.
My guess is that it would be a struggle to have them compliant in time to allow the IAAF to change their view.  Agencies

MTIs success with USAs Limoneira to be published in London
The strategy-critical project carried out by MTI Consulting for Limoneira, the Nasdaq listed and USA's largest lemon producer, is to be published as a case study in an upcoming publication by Routledge of London in a book titled Management Consultancy Insights and Real Consultancy Projects'.
Commenting on the success of this project, the President of California based Limoneira Harold Edwards said From our inception in 1893, we have been part of the Sunkist's global distribution system that gave us access to global markets, however we were essentially the supply chain, while Sunkist focused on the demand chain. Naturally, we had to share the rewards from the value-chain proceeds. In 2008, we wanted to explore the prospects of direct go-to-market model internationally and that we realized is a high-risk, high reward decision. Having previously worked with MTI (and Hilmy Cader, their CEO) in the Philippines in my role at Ralston Purina, we reached out to them
This strategy consulting project with Limoneira, which was based on MTI's 8S (r), involved a comprehensive scan of the global lemon market, based on which the strategizing process took place. An international team of MTI's Strategy Consultants and Analysts were on the ground in Ventura County, California, working closely with the senior management of Limoneira, through consulting clinics and strategizing workshops.
The key focus areas of the plan centered around Demand Generation, Brand Equity Development, Customer Conversion, Channel Transition Management, New Market Development (especially from newly emerging regions) and then ensuring that Limoneira's Structure, Staff and Systems are all aligned to the Strategy. The project culminated with a comprehensive presentation to the Limoneira Board, that was subject to intense scrutiny and challenging - given extremely high-risk, risk-reward consequences of such a strategic decision.
At the end of the MTI project we decided to go-to-market directly with our lemon business utilizing our vertically integrated supply chain and the Limoneira brand. Looking back we are extremely pleased with that decision which has paid off significantly as reflected in our business performance and financial results. MTI played a pivotal role in this exercise and did so while getting the buy-in and inclusiveness of our team. said Harold S. Edwards, the President & CEO of Limoneira.
MTI CEO Hilmy Cader who personally led the MTI team on this project said This was one of most intense international projects we've handled. The exposure our team got, including hands-on front-end market interface in many countries, has helped the team's learning and sharpened our ability to handle such international projects.
Limoneira is leading global producer of lemons, oranges and avocados. The company's portfolio also includes residential and commercial real-estate, water rights across 11,000 acres and now a dedicated sustainability company that is into solar farming.

Natures architect
Architects have to be able to handle pressure. Because a lot depends on the architects ability to handle logistics. An Architect needs to get the logistics exactly right otherwise you cannot execute a plant to satisfaction. In the 21st century with technology evolving, new solutions and problems have come up. ArchWorld speaks to Archt. Mahesha Liyanage on the burning issue which is getting your logistic right.
We all are prisoners of the consumerist culture, and many of our deeper human needs have become the commodities of the consumerist culture. We have to strike a balance between the demands of the consumerist culture and deeper human needs, said Liyanage
Generally architectural buildings are user oriented creations.
We, architects try to read the emotions of clients and feature them to our designs. We try to incorporate the character of the user in a reflective manner in to our designs. Human feelings, emotions and habits are important to create user friendly designs. I believe spiritual wellbeing is a must for any individual in the society today. Its an important social requirement. Spirituality can be considered as an element in architecture which can support the client to develop spiritually by creating spiritual spaces in to designs, stated Liyanage
As it is a tropical climate, sunshine is generally plentiful. It is important control the sunshine effectively to create comfortable environment within available spaces.
Generally we dont keep doors and widows facing the direct sun path. If unavoidable, we should use protective elements to avoid over exposure. Sunshine provides opportunities to use our creativity - creating different shades and patterns within the same space with the help of changing sun rays. In a tropical climate, wind should be embedded in to our creations to ensure cross ventilation throughout the year. Doors and windows should be positioned in such a manner to facilitate the natural air flow. Skillful use of air flow can completely eliminate or considerably reduce the high energy cost for fans and air conditionings, explained Liyanage
Architectural Logistic does not only entail the sun and wind. It also entails materials.
Construction material can dictate a number of conditions into architectural designs. Especially walls can influence the interior temperature of a building up to a greater extent. Therefore, walls of tropical buildings should withstand against the exterior heat. Brick walls are an ideal option for tropical buildings over many other materials. Lines and colors are used to define the character of the building and to build the linkage with the environment, pointed out Liyanage
Use of sound is a challenging task.
Sound can bring the sweetness of the natural environment into our living rooms. Yet extensive sound might become an annoying hassle for anyone. Sound is a commodity which should be controlled in order to ensure optimum use of it. Over exposure to some means of artificial sound can cause health and behavioral issues human beings, warned Liyanage.
In tropical architectural designs, natural commodities such as sun, wind, rain, flora and fauna are extensively used.
The comfort of the environment should be preserved with created spaces while eliminating the negative effects of those. Yes, I love to preserve trees and foliages, and to make the best use of them for my designs, added Liyanage.
Timelessness
Timelessness is an eternal concept, which is impossible to redefine.
Pyramids in Egypt and the Sigiriya Fortress are timeless designs of our civilization. These great creations have become conceptually timeless from their purpose itself. Today purposes are different, commercial ventures or creations with economic purposes can never be timeless. Therefore, most of modern creations are profit driven ventures, where timelessness is no longer a requirement as it doesnt make quick profits. I strongly believe no machine can be as creative as humans. Involvement of robots and artificial intelligence into the designing process is unavoidable. But if the creativity is in demand, humans have the leading role to play, reasoned Liyanage.
Decaying is something we cant avoid or stop at any cost. But we can manage it to a greater extent and achieve a degree of timelessness in our creations.
There are many examples in the history of civilization where time has been managed and a degree of timelessness has been achieved. You dont have to go to great Pyramids in Egypt or Taj Mahal in India; there are many examples in Sri Lanka such as Awukana Statue, Samadhi Statue and Sigiriya Fortress.
I think they are timeless creations. Achieving timelessness is purely depending on requirements of the client. I believe, timelessness can be more or less driven by the circumstances. It is always a degree of timelessness and it will never become absolute or zero, informed Liyanage
Architects more or less have their own language! Liyanage has developed her own language in architecture over the years.
This architectural language is a mix of many aspects such as local traditions, cultural and social values, local climatic condition, modernity and technology. It is not easy to explain the architectural language developed over the years. It should be identified through careful observation of my architectural creations for various clients, shared Liyanage
There are many instances where we have seen the right mix of Sri Lanka-ness with modernity in modern architectural designs.
We have to understand that all are not successful stories.
There can be creations with no characteristics of modernity or tradition too. But, many modern architects have got the ability to negotiate traditions with modernity and to achieve the right balance, said Liyanage
Built environments always act negatively on natural environment. As an architect, I try my best to preserve the natural environment and to come up with solutions with minimal environmental effects. Climatic issues, urban issues and financial issues remain as challenges to natural environment. Hence, I always consider environment as the most important factor, summed up Liyanage.

Nearly 3,000 suicides each year in SL
Each year nearly 3,000 persons commit suicide in Sri Lanka and 40 percent of them are men and 24 percent of them are women. They are above the age of 15. Two percent among them are those who suffer from serious mental diseases, Director of the Mental Health Directorate Dr.Chinthamali De Silva said.
Addressing a press conference at the Media Ministry Auditorium in Colombo yesterday she said that there are 800,000 persons in Sri Lanka who suffer from depression. Alcohol abuse is one of the main reasons for developing mental diseases.
WHO Mental Health Officer Suveen Thirapathy said that one out of every eight Sri Lankans suffer from some sort of mental illness but only 40 percent of them receive medical treatment. More women are victims of mental diseases than men and the most affected age group is 50 to 69.
Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Neil Fernando said that talking itself is a relief for a person who suffer from depression. Depression is based on sadness and pregnant mothers, mothers who just delivered babies, persons suffering from various chronic disease, the elderly, students etc. are at risk of developing depression.

Nepal, an untapped holiday destination for Lankans
Both Sri Lanka and Nepal are yet to exploit the tourism potential and this is an area that needs urgent attention.
The Nepal Embassy hosted a highly interesting event titled Tourism in Nepal at the Kingsbury Hotel recently and it was said that this is despite the two countries having direct air links between the two countries and also having a simplified visa procedure.
A select group of those connected with tourism and key government officials, representatives of the private sector and Chambers of Commerce was present on the occasion. The event was timely and appropriate since Nepal is making an endeavor to arouse interest in tourism, a key source of her revenue generation which coincides with that country's efforts to stabilize itself with after relative inactivity politically, and economically.
Sri Lanka on the other hand is on the crest of a wave in tourism and the recent developments are reflective of the big strides made in this field.
The staff of the Nepal Embassy headed by Charge de Affairs M. Joshi needs to be complimented for undertaking this task. There were two main components of this valued exercise.
Sri Lankans could obtain visas free from the Nepal Embassy in Kynsey Road, Colombo and its free visa for Nepalese from Colombo. One was the visual presentation accompanied by a narrative which explained the geography of Nepal, her culture, and hot spots for tourists. This presentation was orchestrated by the Charge de Affairs herself.
The second component was the screening of a film on Nepal which too was of absorbing interest.
Before the presentation was the address delivered by the chief guest, Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs, Janaka Sugathadasa outlined the macro perspectives of tourism.
Sugathadasa opined that tourism is a driving force for development and a medium for promoting people to people contact. These were necessary for creating goodwill and are an effective measure to develop cosmopolitanism.
According to Sugathadasa while Nepal had been affected by natural disasters, Sri Lanka too had been affected by disasters which were man made.
Commenting on the recently inaugurated direct flights between Kathmandu and Colombo by Himalayan Airlines, Sugathadasa said that it was a boost to tourism. Concluding his address he said that Sri Lanka should add value to the tourism product, re-define and adopt a more holistic approach to the development of tourism.
The film presentation also showed Nepal's vast hilly regions, valleys and rivers and people of different ethnic origins that live in Nepal.
The film also depicted Nepal's unique architecture, her handicrafts besides the most favored tourist locations.
Also shown were water sports and other features of interest to tourists in this land of arresting beauty.

No decision to release Indian boats in Lankan custody :Amaraweera
No decision has been taken to release Indian fishing boats in Sri Lanka custody, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He dismissed as false and baseless news reports that Sri Lanka authorities are taking steps to release Indian boats.
He said none of the Indian boats seized for poaching in Indian waters since 2015 were released. There are about 130 Indian boats in Sri Lanka custody.
They had been forfeited after producing in courts.
The operation to seize Indian boats trespassing into Sri Lankan waters for illegal fishing continues, he said.
The minister said before 2015 too Indian boats poaching in Sri Lankan waters were seized, but they were later released.

Over 45 companies to showcase Lanka at Arabian Travel Mart
Over 45 Sri Lankan companies are billed to participate in the annual Arabian Travel Mart (ATM) from April 24 to 26 in World Trade Centre Dubai.
In its 22nd edition, Arabian Travel Market 2015 witnessed a year-on-year visitor attendance increase of 15% to over 26,000, with exhibiting companies increasing by 5% to 2,873. Business deals worth more than US$2.5 billion were signed over the four days.
The 2016 ATM posted a 7% year-on-year rise in visitor numbers with more than 28,000 trade visitors attending the show, which took place from 25-28 April at Dubai World Trade Centre. The 2016 edition boasted an additional hall, with 423 main stand holders representing 86 countries, 64 country pavilions and over 100 new exhibitors making their debut.
Leading with a topical mid-market theme, the initial results for the 23rd travel and tourism industry showcase, released by organiser Reed Travel Exhibitions, also recorded a 9% increase in the number of Buyers Club members, with a similar percentage hike in the number of other quality visitors such as VIPs, sponsors and speakers, compared to 2015.
The initial estimated figures for this year's show highlights ATM's significance as a leading exhibition for the region's travel and tourism sector, as an increasing number of destinations ramp-up efforts to drive travel and tourism as part of economic diversification and sustainability, Arabian Travel Market Exhibition Manager,Nadege Noblet-Segers said .
The overall increase in visitor numbers and specifically the 9% rise in key buyers (those with budget responsibility for regional and international contracting) underscores ATM's importance to trade buyers and also means ATM 2016 is poised to top last year's record US$2.5 billion in business deals facilitated.
This year's popular mid-market theme also resonated with the region's travel professionals - with many exhibitors leveraging opportunities to launch mid-tier brands as well as discussing strategies, developments and future trends during the ATM seminars, added Noblet-Segers.

## Title: Pattiniya, Sira Sirisena  Sri Lankas PELE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Pattiniya, Sira Sirisena  Sri Lankas PELE
To reminisce about P. D. SIRISENA, the wonder boy of Sri Lanka soccer in the 1960s and early 1970s is to say quite honestly that he was to Sri Lanka , in our own microcosm, what the great PELE was to Brazil. On the 7th of October 1940 was born to PATTINIYA DURAGE ODIRIS PERERA and EMULIN PERERA a baby boy who they named PATTINIYA DUARGA SIRISENA. it is said that even at birth Sirisena had the knack of kicking his feet about and there was something amazing the way he did it. He probably was signaling that here was a football champion in the making for the country. He was destined to be the king of the football field here and abroad. The magic he wove when he had the ball at his feet was what the greet Pele was known for. In over a dozen years of football for his school Maradana Central College, Saunders Sports Club and Sri Lanka, he dazzled, dribbled, body swerved, sent the opposing defenders including the custodians the wrong way to hit the nets. It was done PELE style.
A fabulous future
There is no other beauty in football than to see a player with dribbling ability. Spectators go into raptures when a player dribbles past opponents and scores goals. Sirisena during his reign was eye catching with speed, body swerves, magical work with both feet. No surprise that many a defender and team was unable to stop his artistry. They watched helplessly.
In the Lankan game there were many other wonderful dribblers such as Nithi Nicholas, Edward Wickremasuriya, Denzil Walles, Judy Preena, A. Zaninulabdeen, Karunapala and Andrew Fernando, K.D. Somapala, Azeez and Subani Hashim Deen who spectators flocked to watch, but Sirisena was monarch and unparalled.
From the time he knew what a football was, he took to the game like a duck to water. He was fortunate to be being born near Price Park, which was the cradle of Saunders Sports Club-- the birth place of many outstanding footballers. He began to impress all watching with his passion, discipline and his dexterity with the ball at his feet and they all predicted a fabulous future for this youngster. And he did not let them down as he began to grow in stature.
After having shown his class at Price Park he joined Maradana Central College and it did not take long for him to show his team mates how to play to win. In those days fans flocked to venues where inter-school, Playgrounds, club matches and when international teams played to watch and soak in the excitement that was tremendous. Famous venues other than for the school and Playgrounds were the Army ground at Echelon Square, Government Services Ground at Parsons Road and of course the Prince of Wales Ground, which now stands the Sugathadasa International Stadium. Sadly the Army Ground and Government Services Ground are no more. Where they stood now stand the Galadari and Cinnamon Lake Hotels.
Unlike today, supporters and fans knew the dates and the venues. When it was known that Sirisena was in action in an inter-school game, crowds would flock to watch Sirisenas artistry and he would not let them down. He won games for his school scoring match winning goals and making them champions. In that time St. Benedicts College famous for football too had a master dribbler in Denzil Walles. But sadly at that time these two schools did not play each other, otherwise it would have been a blockbuster watching the two magicians spinning their magic with the ball at their feet.
National honours
At Price Park as a youngster Sirisena watched and learnt from some the greats such as Azeez, Richard, Ismail, Wilson, Nandasiri, Podiappuhamy, Eric Perera, T.O.M. Deen and Petha Premadasa. Azeez was a penalty specialist. It is said that he carried an explosive in his right foot when taking a penalty and no goal keeper would dare attempt to stop it. One custodian Benedictine Vijaya Silva dared saving a penalty from Azeez, feared to put his hands but kneed the ball and for a few weeks he was seen sporting a bandage at school and limping for days.
After a successful school career in the game, Sirisena was an automatic choice for the famous Saunders Sports Club, which club had a number of national caps. The Club dominated soccer in the country. Football Association Cup which was the cup of cups to win saw Saunders who were tagged the glamour boys carry it way every time they entered the finals. Sira as he was fondly called played for them as a schoolboy with their greats and many a time outshone their more senior and brilliant players. He with his scintillating ball play struck many a winning goal for them. Goalkeepers it is said used to shudder when Sirisena had the ball at his feet. In the 1960 FA cup he scored two dozen goals in 6 games.
National honours came his way as a schoolboy and he played for the country 35 times and captained the team for 7 years which was record. He toured countries like India, Pakistan, Israel, Burma, Holland and Thailand and broke the ice by being the first Lankan to be invited to play for a club in Holland  Arc Hercules Ist division league champs in the country. While still a schoolboy he was picked to play against Zenith FC Russia . Although losing 2-5, he showed his skills by making the passes that helped Captain Peter Ranasinghe score both goals. Ranasinghe, an Old Josephian, was a gentleman footballer and led the team with aplomb. He also made the team Zenith FC from Dusseldorf West Germany watch in amazement by scoring two goals that was stunning which helped to hold the visitors to a 2-all draw which was great.
Pomp and pageantry
Coming, as I did from St. Benedict's, a school that was renowned for football and inter-school champions I would rarely miss a match. Those were the days when Albert Fernando a former Bens captain was the first Sri Lankan to train with Brazilian players of the calibre of Pele, Socrates, Carlos Alberto, Zico and Garincha coached St. Benedict's College. He obtained a trainers license from the home of football Brazil. One match I watched Sirisena putting on show his magic was in the Gold Cup final where he slammed all five goals against Colpetty Uniteds 4 after trailing at one stage. In addition to cricket which was my pet sport and wrote a lot, I also covered, football, hockey and basketball for the Times of Ceylon as a reporter and later Sports Editor.
Football, then, was known as a poor mans game in the country,. Successive administration did try as did the dynamic Manilal Fernando, to bring focus and distinction to the game as they launched a scheme to financially reward players and employ them. But Sirisena and his ilk carried the game on their shoulders without the pomp and pageantry that our sportsmen of today in Cricket especially are accorded. To me it seemed that to the soccerites of yore, it was the sport that mattered , and not making money.
When the great Sirisena hung up his boots after a glorious career, Manilal Fernando appointed him a Technical Director and he served in that responsible post with dedication until age caught up with him. Incidentally, former President of the country Ranasinghe Premadasa was also a Price Park player which is near Hultsdorf. He too had talent and would have made it to the big league, but preferred to take to politics and serve his countrymen. His son Sajith is now carrying on the tradition. Sirisena was a close confidant of Premadasa and in recognition of Sirisenas great contribution to the game Premadasa named a ground at Maligawatte which is known as the P.D.Sirisena Playground. Premadasa also built the first floodlit R.Premadasa Stadium for cricket and the Indoor Stadium. His old school St.Josephs College has a pavilion in his memory.
It wont be wrong to imagine that P in Sirisenas first name stands for the legendary Pele of Brazil. Because Pattiniya was to Sri Lanka football what Pele was to Brazil.

Political solution leading to ethnic harmony will fast track development: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed that a political solution which paves the way to ethnic harmony and reconciliation among various religious groups was needed to fast track growth and development in the country.
Addressing a gathering at the unveiling of the Buddha statue at Suduwella, Maradana, the Prime Minister observed that people of all ethnicities and religious groups had come for the unveiling, demonstrating the power of reconciliation and unity in the country.
We must create a Sri Lankan identity under which all ethnicities are united within a unitary Sri Lanka. For this we need reconciliation between religions and act without causing religious or ethnic conflict. To bring about such an environment, there needs to be a suitable a political solution,the Prime Minister said.
Such a solution, he added was discussed at the Parliament Constitutional Council and the Steering Committee.
There is no obstacle in the path to national reconciliation. All have accepted that we have to act within a unitary state,the Prime Minister further said.
When speaking of creating national reconciliation, he asked for thinking of ways in which we can devolve power without separating the country.
No one has asked for the country to be divided. To strengthen the unitary structure of the state, we need to devolve power so that the citizens of each area can easily carry out their work and have the freedom to practice their religion of choice, the Premier said.
He further explained that the Chief Ministers of the Northern and Southern Provincial Councils have asked for greater power sharing at the provincial level.
If we can solve our political problems and act on creating religious reconciliation, we will be a country with no ethnic strife and this will enable us to develop at a fast pace. Different political parties have various stances, such diversity is needed. Such ideas however have to be put forward in support of their country and faith.
But those holding certain political opinions state that this will eliminate the Sinhalese, take away the rights of the Tamils and not allow the Muslims to live in the country. Such racist ideologies are not rational and such racism is aroused by those who have failed politically. We do not need such ideologies today, we need to instead think of ways in which we can work and live together, the Prime Minister said.
At the last Presidential election, we left aside our political issues, to come together to support the common candidate, Maithripala Sirisena who was chosen to take all people in this country, together along a single journey and if we can go together on this journey, we can grow faster, the Premier said.
We have given clear statements on our journey to the people. We do not want another war. Our aim is to develop our country. We dont need people who scream that if power is devolved, the country with be divided, Buddhism will disappear or that the Tamil peoples rights wont be taken into account, the Prime Minister added.

President to contest next election as SLFP candidate: Dewapriya
President Maithripala Sirisena will contest the next Presidential election as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Presidential candidate, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said.
He added that the decision to nominate President Sirisena as the Presidential Candidate at the 2020 Presidential election
will be taken at the Central Committee and the Executive Committee meetings of the SLFP in due course.
He said so while addressing the media at the Western Provincial Council complex in Colombo yesterday. When Chief Minister Devapriya was noticed by media that President Sirisena has said that he would not contest the next Presidential election, he said that the President made that statement when contesting the last Presidential election as the common candidate.But,he will contest the next Presidential Election as the SLFP candidate.
He further said that Executive Presidency should not be abolished when a people-friendly leader like Maithripala Sirisena holds the post.
Eventhough there are various comments on the Hambantota part, no decision has yet been taken relating to the Hambantota port, he said.
The President said when the Chief Ministers met him recently, that no decision on the port has been taken. The discussion on the Hambantota port is being carried out but a final decision has not yet been taken yet. The best option, which benefits both the country and the port will be taken, he said.
The Chief Minister said that the Presidents attention is also been drawn on a Cabinet reshuffle. The Cabinet reshuffle will probably be carried out prior to May Day, he said.
At the meeting we had with the President, he (the President) said that his recent visit to Russia was successful and fruitful. Four MOUs were signed between the two countries, he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has gifted a Sri Lankan sword as a sign of friendship during President Sirisenas state visit. The United Kingdom should also take measures to hand over thousands of valuable items taken to their country from Sri Lanka during the Colonial rule.
Dewapriya added that at the discussion the President highlighted that he has no intension of postponing any election. The President has instructed the relevant parties to hold the Local Government election as soon as possible. The Provincial Council Election will also be held at the due time, upon the completion of the term.
Speaking to media Devapriya said that SLFP has taken measures to hold the Youth Convention which has been scheduled to be held on April 2 and the May Day Rally, which held at Gatambe, Kandy in a grand scale with a participation of thousands of people.
The Chief Minister speaking on big match fever said that Police should take sternaction against students who behave in an unruly manner during big matches.
The behavior of these students cannot be tolerated, he said.
Speaking about Pannipitiya Dharmapala school issue, he said that a decision on school education is taken by education administrators and not by parents or students. The parents together with students of the college did not allow the qualified and selected Principal to assume duties.
This situation has a bad impact on the countrys education. There is a hidden conspiracy against Buddhist schools, Devapriya noted.

President says will stand by War Heroes

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday declared indemnity for War Heroes when he said that no War Hero would be subjected to any inquiry relating to abuse of human rights.
The President said he is not prepared to make any War Hero a suspect on the charges levelled against the Armed Forces and the government on the alleged violations of human rights during the war against terrorism.
He made this statement at the opening of the newly constructed three-storeyed building at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala. The President presented Virisara beneficial cards to war heroes at the function held yesterday
The President, pointing out that it is the responsibility and duty of the government to protect the War Heroes who fought for the Motherland and assured that he would always fulfill his responsibility as the President and Defence Minister.
While there is an unprecedented goodwill for Sri Lanka among the international community today and many people question as to what benefit could be derived to the country from this, President Sirisena said. We are utilising that goodwill and friendship for the protection of the honour and respect of our War Heroes, he said.
The President added that the most powerful world leaders have assured him that they would stand by Sri Lankas independence and democracy as well as on issues pertaining to the members of Armed Forces.
The President emphasised that he would always take the fullest responsibility on behalf of any problem faced by the officers, staff members and war heroes who fought against the LTTE.
He said that however, he was unable to protect those found guilty of acts that are not connected to national security and those who are guilty of killing media persons or sportsmen.
When President Sirisena arrived at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala, he was warmly received by the students. The President unveiled the plaque to vest the new building with the students of the school and awarded prizes to outstanding students and those who excelled in Year 5 Scholarship Examination. Later he inspected the building and its facilities.
The Defence Services School also offers courses to teach English for the students selected to universities and vocational training. Ministers Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, S. B. Navinna, Dayasiri Jayasekera, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Wayamba Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dasanayake, Governor Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake, service chiefs, Inspector General of Police, Principal D. A.

Private sector to run loss making govt ventures
Htota Harbour, Hyatt hotel, Colombo Hilton, SriLankan Airlines, Grand Oriental hotel among them:
The government has identified that globally acclaimed Private Public Partnership is the way forward for Sri Lanka as well and now the country will look for local and foreign investors to run and turnaround some of the loss making government entities (SOEs).
This was stated by Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim at the Malaysian Business Council, breakfast meeting at the Hilton Residencies.
He said that PPP was successfully implemented in the USA and Malaysia initially. The US government sold over US$ 185 billion state assets in the early 1990s.
Later even in countries like, South Korea and developing countries copied this. In New Zealand seven government bodies including Telecom were privatised while in the UK 12 companies including transport, power generation and rail were vested with the private sector.
In 2016, a record 216 government owned Chinese companies came into PPP deals with both local and foreign investors.
He said similarly in Sri Lanka too the government had identified some institutions like the Hambantota Harbour, Hyatt hotel, Colombo Hilton SriLankan Airlines, Grand Oriental hotel for PPPs. We like the private sector to get involved in turning them profitable.
However in some countries PPP ran in to issues and in Sri Lanka too we are engaging the unions and public to explain the concept.
Hashim said the government pumped in a staggering Rs.123 billion towards up keep of 245 SOEs in 2014 and this is increasing each year. The loss from these entities was Rs. 60 billion from which 300 hospitals with 200 beds could have been built.
The SriLankan Airlines privatisation to Emirates was a huge success and it brought in revenue to the country and as soon as it was unwisely taken over by the then government the airline made huge losses. We messed up here.
Minister however said that there are profit making SOE like Sri Lanka Insurance, state banks and eight other entities. The total revenue generation form these 10 SOEs was double the market capitalization of the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The Minister said the government has now decided to firstly form a Public Enterprise Board to monitor the SOEs and then coordinate with investors to convert them to PPP. Though it would be hard we want to discontinue the political appointment and appoint professionals to run some of the SOEs
TPG may not get SriLankan Airlines bid - Minister
Shirajiv Sirimane
The Transpacific Group (TPG) which was short listed to operate debt ridden SriLankan Airlines may not be given that opportunity.
Public Enterprise
Development Minister Kabir Hashim speaking at the Malaysian Business Council, breakfast meeting at Hilton Residencies last morning he said that one main reason to overlook TPG was that they dont have airline experience to run a national carrier.
In addition TPG is also a Fund management company and SriLankan was given to them to operate it may also damage the airlines image.
Asked by Daily News Business if the Request for Proposals (RFP) was on again to find a new player he answered in the positive.We have got several new offers from global airlines and are perusing them.The door for RFP is not shut yet.
He said that 14 companies responded to the RFP and three companies were short listed including TPG.

Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series: How Difficult is Cliff Diving
The degree of difficulty is varies between 3.6 for a required dive and 6.3 for the most difficult dives in the sport currently. The degree of difficulty (DD) is the rating for each dive performed in a competition and is multiplied by the sum of the judges scores to give the total number of points per dive.
Each trick in a high dive adds to the degree of difficulty and the athletes of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series keep pushing the limits of their sport by creating and realising new dives which werent even considered possible a few years ago.
The degree of difficulty (DD) is the rating for each dive performed in a competition and is multiplied by the sum of the judges scores to give the total number of points per dive.
I came to my dives just by a natural progression. I started off doing a back triple with two twists and eventually added two more twists to get to the back triple quad. My other dive at the start was a front triple with 1 1/2 twists and I started adding a twist and then decided to take away a twist but add a somersault, says the man who introduced the first dive conceived exclusively for cliff diving, Gary Hunt.
The reigning champion of the World Series premiered his triple quad  three somersaults with four twists - with an unbelievable DD of 6.3 in 2009 and has perfected this striking weapon over the past seasons.
Only since the start of this season have two more athletes added dives with a DD of more than 6.0 to their portfolio: Russias Artem Silchenko  back armstand 2 1/2 somersaults with 2 1/2 twists has a DD of 6.1  and Blake Aldridge, from England, who learned his back armstand 2 1/2 somersaults with 4 twists at the US leg in Boston a few weeks ago is now the second athlete performing a dive with a DD of 6.3.
The degree of difficulty value depends on the kind of manoeuvres, somersaults and twists a diver shows in one dive. The number of somersaults and twists as well as the position in which you leave the platform and enter the water add to the degree of difficulty. You have the tuck position which is like a ball shape and that puts you into a really small position and allows you to spin really fast and that gives you a lower degree of difficulty. But, for example, when you have the pike position, which is more like an L-shape that means you are bigger and longer and its harder to spin as fast and that increases the degree of difficulty. And if you start with a handstand, instantly you have a higher degree of difficulty, explains former cliff diving world champion Joey Zuber.
Improvement and evolution are crucial aspects of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series and in the past four years the athletes have been pushing for more difficult and complex dives. In the 2012 season, the average DD for the optional dives performed in a competition is 5.4. However, not everything in cliff diving centres on the degree of difficulty as the quality of the dives plays a major part, and this is where the judges come in. The five international jurors dont judge based upon how difficult a dive is. They judge it by how well the athletes execute the dive and they have to look at the overall aesthetics of the dive: is it a strong take-off Is the flight in the air good Are their legs straight, are the toes pointed Is the entry nice and vertical It doesnt matter whether the dive is easy or hard, they still have to score it based upon how good it looks.
The judges have to look at the dive as a performance piece, not just as a technical piece. You want a high degree of difficulty but you want high-quality dives. Just doing difficult dives for low scores is just not going to count. Myself, I try to see what my strengths are, so for example I have good twisting technique; so I try to add more somersaults and more twists to the dives that I know I can do well and still get good scores. It still doesnt work when you do big, big dives and youre just splashing or missing the dive completely, because at the end the scores from the judges are not going to be good and when you put those two together its just not going to be a good result, states Orlando Duque (COL), who is well known for his perfectly executed dives.
The recent competitions have proven that the worlds high diving elite feels more and more comfortable with doing big dives from almost three times the Olympic height. Having followed its past development, one next comes to the inevitable question: How difficult can the dives get I think the platform is the limit. Not too long ago, we shifted it up to 27.5m from like 24 or 25m, which was the traditional cliff diving limit and soon enough we are going to be using that full 27, 28m to do all the dives you can.
I dont know if there really is a limit. As the sport progresses and the years go on and it gets bigger and more popular, every year I think there are going to be bigger and harder dives that come out. Its awesome to be a part of it and to push the envelope myself is just an extraordinary feeling, says David Colturi whose innovative energy everybody may soon have to try and keep up with.

Samaraweeras contribution to Bangladesh cricket
The contest for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year is turning out to be a keen tussle for supremacy. With the month of March, better known as the big match month among schoolboys, coming to an end, last few weeks of voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year titles, will attract greater attention.
Winning a major title at Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest would undoubtedly change the life of any schoolboy cricketer, opening new horizons. Experiencing such glory would bring them closer to winning the Sri Lanka cap that would open the big league for them.
For some outstanding schoolboy cricketers, winning a major award at the Mega Show is even more than playing for Sri Lanka. Many past winners have even gone to the extent of becoming Chief ICC Match Referee, ICC Elite Panel Umpires and international coaches.
The latest in that elite Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year family to prove his credentials as a coach of international repute is former Sri Lanka Test batsman and ex-Ananda cap Thilan Samaraweera.
Under the guidance of head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe, Samaraweera has done a tremendous job in sharpening the skills of Bangladesh batsmen who gave a torrid time to Sri Lanka bowlers in the second Test played at Saravanamuttu Stadium.
As the batting consultant of the Bangladesh team, Samaraweera has proved his class. Having lost the first Test at Galle to the hosts by 259 runs, Bangladesh would never have dreamt of winning the second Test.
Perhaps, their only intention would have been an honorable draw at Sara Stadium and stop Sri Lanka from going for a 2-0 clean sweep. But Samaraweera injected that gutty feeling to the Bangladesh batsmen  to believe in them and capitalize on the mistakes of Lankan bowlers. The visitors did just that to register their first ever Test victory over Sri Lanka. Most importantly, that came at a memorable time for Bangladesh  in their 100th Test!
Bangladesh made only 312 all out and 197 all out in the respective innings to lose the first Test. Yet, the visitors bounced back to win the second Test by four wickets and square the two-Test series.
First, the restricted Sri Lankas first innings to 338 all out and came out with their best batting performance on tour to make 467 runs. That handsome lead eventually became the deciding factor of the Test series.
Inspired by their performance in the second Test, Bangladesh did well to win the first ODI in Dambulla by a massive margin of 90 runs. Once again, it was the Bangladesh batsmen who gave Lanka a torrid time, scoring a commanding 324 for 5 in 50 overs.
Full credit should go to former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year winner Samaraweera who was mainly responsible in transforming the Bangladesh batting to a formidable position, along with the support of Hathurusinghe.
Samaraweera has a proven track record as a classy batsman right from his school career at Ananda College, Colombo. His outstanding performances in successive years earned him the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year titles in 1994 and 1995.
Since the inception of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest way back in 1979, only six players had won the main title two times each and exactly half of them are Anandians!
Heading that elite brand of cricketers is Sri Lankas world cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga (1980 and 1982). Beside Samaraweera and Ranatunga, Roshan Mahanama (Nalanda -1983 and
1984), Lahiru Peiris (Ananda - 2004 and 2005), Bhanuka Rajapaksa (Royal - 2010 and 2011) and Charith Asalanka (Richmond - 2015 and 2016) have won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title two times each.
In less than three years after winning the title for the second time, Samaweera made his Sri Lanka debut in the Champions trophy ODI against India in Sharjah on November 6, 1998. Although he did not get an opportunity to bat, he had Indian wicket keeper bat Nayan Mongia (51) as his first ODI scalp.
Samaraweeras Test debut too had also been against Indian, but on a memorable note. He made a debut Test century in Sri Lankas third Test against India at SSC grounds in August/ September 2001. Coming in as No.8 batsman, Samaraweera made 103 not out on his debut, facing 175 balls in 201-minute stay, hitting ten fours.
In fact, Samaraweera was the fourth Sri Lanka batsman to score a century in the home teams first inning of 610 for 6 declared with Marvan Atapattu (108), Mahela Jayawardene (139) and Hashan Tillakaratne (136 not out) making merry against the Indian bowling.
Despite making his debut, Samaraweera showed class of a seasoned batsman and was associated in an unfinished 194-run partnership for the seventh wicket with Tillakaratne as Sri Lanka emerged victorious by an innings and 77 runs. Samaraweeras rock-solid batting and tantalizing off spin bowling enabled him to cement his place in the Test team.
Representing Sri Lanka in 81 Tests, Samaraweera had aggregated 5,462 runs with 14 centuries and 30 fifties. In fact, he is among the top Lankan batsmen who had maintained an impressive Test average of 48.76. Although Samaraweera was better known as a Test batsman, he had also represented Sri Lanka in 53 ODIs with a top score of 105 not out.
The 40-year-old had been working with some Australia Test players ahead of their 2016 tour to Sri Lanka, in his brief consulting stint at Australias National Cricket Centre in Brisbane. In 2013, he had a successful season with Worcestershire in the English country championship and made a top score of 144 not out against Leicestershire at Leicester on August 28, 2013

SLMC demands arrest of those who damaged Asst.Registrars vehicle
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) urged the authorities to find the culprits behind the attack that damaged the vehicle of its Assistant Registrar Dr. Chandana Atapattu at his house in Mulleriyawa on March 19.
A member of the SLMC Dr. Upul Gunasekara said that so far nobody had been arrested in this connection.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Medical Council auditorium.
He said that Dr Atapattu had no personal enemies. It is better if the authorities find out the culprits to verify on whose need the attack was made or if it was an attempt to put the responsibility on some one else.
He also said that since 2002 there had been six threats to the SLMC and to its members on six occasions and none of the culprits had been arrested or action taken against.
Queried by the media if the SLMC suspected that the SAITM had any involvement in this attack Dr Gunasekara said that the they were not aware of it. But most of the attacks had been during the periods when private medical colleges faced issues, Dr Gunasekara said. The SLMC only needed to find as to who had a grudge against the SLMC.
He also said that the SLMC is a statutory body established under the Medical Council Ordinance for the purpose of protecting health care seekers by ensuring the maintenance of academic and professional standards, discipline and ethical practice by health professionals who are registered with it. He also added that none of the members were paid but is conducting an honorary service. If actions were taken against the culprits it would be a strength to the members to render their service to the nation with a sense of confidence, said Dr Gunasekara.
Members also said that the attack on the vehicle was made at dawn and High Quality CCTV cameras in the houses in the vicinity have recorded the culprit coming riding a motorcycle and hurling stones targeting the Dr Athapattus vehicle. They added that one CCTV footage has been handed over to the Police and if it were not sufficient the Police could get the CCTV clips of the other houses to expedite the investigation.
Registrar of the SLMC Dr Terance Gunaratne de Silva, Prof Rizvi Sheriff, Dr Sivaprian, Assistant registrar of the SLMC Dr Chandana Atapattu also were present.

Tender Board proceedings went openly and voluntarily on February 27, 2015 : Deputy CB Governor
The Deputy Central Bank Governor P.Samarasiri answered in the affirmative when asked if the proceedings of the Tender Board went openly and voluntarily on February 27, 2015 where the decision to accept Rs. 10.5 billion was taken.
Samarasiri said the Tender Board decision came out unanimously, after they got the reasons for this acceptance was rationalised by the then Governor Arjun Mahendra.
Arjun Mahendrans Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva questioned Samarasiri whether any member of the Tender Board said the rationalisation given by former Governor Mahendran were invalid, to which Samarasiri replied nobody mentioned such a disagreement.
De Silva then asked Samarasiri whether any member of the Tender Board was forced to sign in agreement with the decision taken at the said Tender Board meeting.
Samarasiri said nobody was forced to sign and everybody signed in agreement with the decision voluntarily. He also pointed out, when writing down the minutes at the said meeting, it was he who suggested including the fact that these decisions were taken as instructed by Governor Mahendran.
Meanwhile, Harsha Fernando, Legal Counsel of DG Samarasiri, voiced his dissatisfaction at the way in which the panel appointed by the Attorney General was leading evidence at the Commission.He pointed out to the Commission that, in a process of a fact finding mission which does not cross examine the witnesses, too much pressure is put on DG Samarasiri by repetitively directing same questions. He voiced his concerns as Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera questioned certain statements made by DG Samarasiri at the Commission.
Livera suggested that DG Samarasiri has neglected to inform to Governor Mahendran on that day, the Tender Board members wanted a meeting with him to get clarifications on the questioned decision.
Samarasiri said a Governors decision is usually agreed upon and not questioned by the lesser ranking officers.
SSG De Livera also questioned the expertise knowledge of Samarasiri on the subject of direct placement and auction system.
De Livera also suggested that Samarasiri is making certain false statements before the Commission.
DG Samarasiri denied that he is making false statements and said persons can have their own personal opinions.
On direct placements, Samarasiri said he is able to provide the Presidential Commission with certified documents highlighting discrepancies of the yield rates on similar tenures with comparable amounts along with the dates these direct placements were made.
I can provide reports made on direct placements. The Auditor General has studied all private placements done from 2008 to 2015,Samarasiri said as well.

The government will purchase 1000 buses for the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) within the next few months in order to strengthen the SLTB bus fleet and the route network.
The government also intends to begin a super luxury metro bus service within Colombo and in its suburbs.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said although the SLTB has 7700 buses in its fleet, only 6000 buses are in an operational condition at present.
The Minister was addressing the gathering in the ceremony of distributing new engine kits for the SLTB buses at Udahamulla bus depot yesterday.
He said the SLTB needs at least 10000 buses to provide quality service to the public.
Accordingly, 500 new engine kits were provided to the Udahamulla bus depot to be fitted into 500 unused buses need in engine repairs.
He further said that politics prevailed in the country should responsible for the collapse of the SLTB. Politicians should be held responsibility for that.
The SLTB was destroyed due to the political influences under the all regimes came into the power previously.
All former governments filled the SLTB with their supporters unnecessarily.
All SLTB workers have rights to engage in politics but the SLTB administration itself must be devoid of politics.
We all must get-together and work for the upliftment of the SLTB despite the party politics, he added.

Toyota Lanka launches Toyota Coaster in Sri Lanka
Toyota Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, formally launched the latest Toyota Coaster designed for premier passenger transportation at the Toyota Plaza in Wattala. The event was attended by key clientele comprising of members from the leisure and travel sector, and the senior management of Toyota Lanka.
Speaking at the launch Managing Director of Toyota Lanka Shungo Yoshioka said, The Coaster is the only coach in the Toyota line-up and has been playing a vital part in catering to clientele who have specific transportation requirements, especially in the travel and leisure sectors. The Coaster is a name that reflects reliable, durable and trusted transportation with over decades of global acclaim. The same, I believe applies in a Sri Lankan context where Toyota Coasters from many generations can be seen on the roads daily, fulfilling transportation requirements of a well-matured vehicle market.
With this unveiling Toyota Lanka will for the very first time offer 2 specifications of the Coaster, the mid-grade and the high-grade . The all-new Coaster comes with a sleek, innovative new design while staying true to the Coaster's identity.The interior has also been significantly revamped and is now more spacious due to wider and taller cabin dimensions.Noise insulation has also been improved contributing to a quieter ride with a plush interior giving an enhanced sense of ride comfort. Both versions have semi reclining seats as a standard option. Additionally, for anyone who wants to pay extra for a bit of luxury, the high-grade Coaster has a factory fitted cool box to keep you refreshed during long journeys.
One of the Coaster's main selling points is its durability. The circular frame structure is adopted to ensure high body rigidity and strength.
Laser welding has also been used for rigid body panel bonding. All of this contributes to enhance quality, durability and reliability. The availability of safety features, which is of paramount importance in the present day context, has also been enhanced. Driver airbags and ABS are standard features on the high-grade spec while 3 point seat belts are standard on all models.
Also speaking at the launch Director-COO Manohara Atukorale noted, With the introduction of the new Coaster, we are looking at adding more value to your business requirements with enhanced reliability and more emphasis on passenger safety. With unparalleled after-sales care, only Toyota Lanka can offer such an extensive value proposition.
Sold with the 3 year/100,000km exclusive Toyota Lanka warranty, the Coaster available for the local market has been built to specification considering local conditions.

The Transport Ministry together with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) received Cabinet approval this week to go ahead with a project to turn unused railway carriages into backpacking tourist accommodations.
The Cabinet Paper put forward by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva proposed to use unused rail carriages by renovating them into accommodation units.
These renovated carriages are then to be placed in unused lands adjacent to the stations of; Colombo Railway Compound, Mahaiyyawa sub railway station, Nanuoya, Ambewela, Ella and Dondanduwa. These lands belonging to the Railway Department remain underutilised and thus the project also proposes that these accommodations pay a tax to the Railway Department for the use of the land, enabling the Department to earn extra revenue through the project.

Vasus gambit
Firebrand Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara has called on the government to instruct the courts to release his colleague Wimal Weerawansa, now on a hunger strike. Nanayakkara says the MP has not been found guilty but only taken into custody merely on suspicion. His detention therefore was unlawful, the JO stalwart asserts.
Nanayakkara is well aware that Weerawansa was placed in remand following his indictment by court and that his revision application for bail too was rejected by the High Court which held with the Magistrate that that the offence was unbailable. This clearly shatters Nanayakkaras argument that the MP was being held merely on suspicion. Weerawansa was taken into custody following due process. The complaint against him that he misappropriated state vehicles incurring a loss of Rs. 90 million to the government was gone into by the law enforcement and he was subsequently arrested based on hard evidence that transpired in the investigation. Courts dont throw people into jail merely based on suspicion but after hearing arguments of both, the prosecution and the defence, and considering corroborative evidence. To suggest, then, that the MP was being held based only on suspicion is indeed a dubious claim made by Nanayakkara who is a senior attorney- at- law.
As a lawyer, the MP is clearly aware that the government cannot instruct the court to release those held in custody. Nanayakkara may well be entertaining the thought that this indeed could be done by the President, going by the precedent set by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa releasing the wife of one his ministers, who was in death row for the murder of hubbys mistress, or on the basis of a presidential pardon granted by another President to a convicted rapist. But it is difficult to imagine that such precedents will be followed by a government which claims to be wedded to Yahapalanaya. The President had demonstrated his bona fides in this regard when he went public to claim how a deposed Chief Justice had pledged to deliver verdicts in favour of the government, if that was what it wants, in turn for his retention in office. Hence it could be reasonably assumed that the government will not interfere in the functions of the judiciary.
By urging the government to request the court to release Weerawansa, and faulting the courts for holding the MP on mere suspicion, Nanayakkara also has scored an own goal of sorts. The MPs contention, no doubt, would be received with glee by those clamouring for a hybrid court with foreign judges. The MP has sent a clear message that the Lankan courts is flawed and justice could not be expected from our judicial system. The MP also makes the case that Weerawansa was not conducting the hunger strike to get himself released from remand custody but to protest against the burning issues in the country, such as the sale of state assets to foreigners, rising cost of living and indirect taxes.
If that indeed is the case it certainly is an extreme action. We thought that there are enough protests being carried out, highlighting these very issues, and more, by mobs supportive of the Rajapaksas. Does Weerawansa believe that, by offering his life, the cost of living would come down, or, there will be a moratorium on the sale of state assets to foreigners, or, the indirect taxes imposed on the public would cease It is this selfsame Weerawansa who staged a death fast opposite the UN compound in Colombo for something as fantastic as getting then UN Secretary General Ban-ki-Moon to drop charges against Sri Lanka. Not just the MP, but all government institutions were ordered by Mahinda Rajapaksa to protest against Moon and May Day in 2012 was converted to one mass anti-Moon protest, for all the effect it had on the UN. The NFF leaders concerns, on behalf of the suffering public, should indeed be appreciated. But it would have been much more endearing if he thought about the public when he caused a loss of Rs. 90 million of tax payers money, if indeed the allegations against him are true. Nanayakkara has also made another pitch to justify the release of Wimal Weerawansa from remand prison. He claims that the MPs daughter had fallen sick following her fathers prolonged stay in remand and gives this as a reason for securing his release.
Nanayakkara, as a lawyer, may have defended countless suspects from the other side of the dock and, while, he may have been successful on some occasions he would not have been able to secure an acquittal at other instances. We have never heard, though, of Nanayakkara the lawyer pleading for the release of his convicted clients, based on the trauma undergone by their children. It is hoped that the reasons adduced by the MP to secure the release of his colleague will not open the floodgates, as also with the MP, now on hunger strike.

Wallspan envisions transforming Colombo into garden city
The beautiful green landscape which soothed our eyes and refreshed our souls as we walked through the city streets back in the good old days is disappearing at a rapid speed due to accelerated urbanising in our city.

The only noticeable park we have for the entire city is Viharamahadevi Park at Townhall.
The development of many giant commercial buildings and high-rise apartments are indeed highly beneficial for the country yet the diminishing small remaining patches of greenery is taking its toll on the city dwellers with increased city temperature and stress-related illnesses at an unprecedented level.
Ensuring the wellbeing of the population, creating sustainable living space and the attractiveness of the city; Wallspan, a company specialising in architectural building facade, rain screen cladding, decorative cladding and curtain wall facade, has come up with a novel solution to transform Colombo into a Garden City without disturbing the fast paced development.
Explaining the concept of living facade,Wallspan Operations Director Ramzeen Rauff said, Plante living facade is a vertical garden which helps people living in densely populated urban environments re-connect with nature. It transforms dull and grey walls into most needed greenery by growing beautiful plants on a vertical space. It can be used to beautify the walls of high-rise buildings, offices, flats, apartments, individual homes or any other structure for that matter.
Wallspan very recently completed the country's tallest vertical garden at the five-star Movenpick city hotel with more than 33,000 plants on vertical plane, thus proving its engineering excellence. Though it's a new concept to Sri Lanka, living facades have helped to change the city landscape of many developed countries including Singapore which has gained international reputation as a garden city.
According to Rauff, living facades goes beyond than offering an aesthetic value to the city landscape to also give many other health and environmental benefits. Some major studies done by world renowned green facade consultants on vertical garden has revealed benefits such as reduced air pollution, better acoustics and reduced urban heat among many benefits.
Living facades help to reduce air pollution by filtering the fine particles in the air and help reduce heat in urban areas by preventing heat radiation into surrounding areas as opposed to solid walls. Modern studies have proven that plants can reduce radiation of heat by up to 50 percent. Additionally living facade also helps reduce noise pollution in the city. The initial cost of living facade is outweighed by the health and other benefits offered by it, he added.
As plants are grown on a vertical space in contrast to ordinary gardens on land, access to regular water supply, fertilizer and nutrients become a challenge. Wallspan uses a fully automated irrigation and liquid fertilizer system to overcome such challenges. The system especially designed for high-rise buildings, which is incorporated with special safety features.
The plants can be chosen according to individual tastes of the client considering climatic conditions and other factors affecting plants to grow in the particular location. One of the special features of living facade is that users can move plants around, not having to look at the same display every day, thanks to the advanced engineering capability of Wallspan.
Due to lack of space in the congested city, at the residential level, many home gardens have been turned in to car parks disallowing them to enjoy luxury of having their gardens. Concerning the need, Wallspan also provide an economical and value engineered solution for individual home owners to have their Vertical Garden within the limited space available.
Living facades offer a wide range of benefits to the users as well as to the country. With tourism being one of the main growth engines of our economy living facades will be able to give a much needed boost to it by attracting and promoting the Sri Lankan capital as a beautiful garden city, further stated Rauff who brings with him an experience of over ten years in the industry in the UK where he worked with internationally renowned architects, developers and contractors.
The company takes pride in introducing a range of innovative, high quality, and sustainable cladding solutions to the Sri Lankan building facade market within the last few years.
Products being chosen from world renowned manufacturers in Europe, USA and Singapore in order to ensure our clients to benefit from latest technologies and sustainable products with the promise of long term cost benefit.
Wallspan has become a trusted brand among the design community and some of its clients include Softlogic Life, Dialog, Odel, Prime Residencies, Mobitel, Movenpick City Hotel, and various universities, banks and many other retail, corporate and government institutions.
The Company already has been able to build an excellent track record in providing pioneering technologies to building facade market through introduction of EXTEC Cladding, Light Clad, PERF Clad, Archizinc cladding and BIPV Solar glass.
Wallspan team dedicated to provide its expertise and assistance to architects, interior and landscape designers, corporate and individual home owners who wish to have a beautiful vertical garden in their premises irrespective of the scale of the project.

Indian actor Rajinikanth today thanked Sri Lankan Tamils for their love and affection, days after he cancelled his visit to the island nation following opposition from pro-Tamil outfits.
I came to know your love for me through the media. I have no words to thank you. Let us think good and only good things will happen, he said in a statement.
Originally on April 9, Rajinikanth was scheduled to hand over 150 new houses built in Jaffna for Tamils by Gnanam Foundation of Lyca Group, a Tamil film production house.
The actor, however, cancelled his visit after various pro-Tamil outfits including the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) objected to it.
Following the cancellation of the actors visit, the Tamils in Jaffna had taken out a rally in his support.
Expressing optimism, Rajinikanth said he will meet them (Sri Lankan Tamils) when the time is right. We will meet at an appropriate time. I pray to god for your well-being, he said.
The VCK yesterday said they were not averse to the actors visit to meet Tamils after the situation for the minorities improves there.
The outfits chief Thol Thirumavalavan said an all-is-well carnival atmosphere, being sought to be projected by the pro-government organisers, was inappropriate now when Tamils were struggling for their rights.
He said that Rajinikanth can meet the Tamils any day in Sri Lanka but only after the situation of its various regions affected by the 2009 war improves.

World's most expensive cities are mostly in Asia
Singapore remains the world's most expensive city to live in, a study showed on Tuesday, with two Japanese cities,Tokyo and Osaka returning to the top 10 thanks to the strengthening of the yen.
Almaty in Kazakhstan was the least expensive, followed by Lagos in recession-hit Nigeria.
Only one U.S. city, New York, made the top 10 in the Economist Intelligence Unit's twice-yearly Worldwide Cost of Living survey. It came in ninth, dropping two places on a slightly weaker dollar but still far higher than its No. 46 slot just five years ago.Los Angeles, in 11th place, just missed the top tier.
Europe was represented in the top 10 by four cities , Zurich at three, Geneva and Paris tied at seventh, and Copenhagen tied with New York at nine.
The study bases its calculation on the price of at least 160 products and services including food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items among others, converted to U.S. dollars.
So a one-kilo loaf of bread costs $3.55 U.S. in Singapore and a bottle of table wine $23.68. In Paris, they were $6.81 and $10.35, respectively.In Almaty, it was 90 cents for the bread and $5.15 for the wine.
Cheap but not always cheerful, the survey said of some of least expensive cities, which also included Bangalore in India, Karachi in Pakistan, and Algeria's Algiers.
The survey said the trend in the latest report was for a resurgence of Asian cities.With Singapore on top, Hong Kong (second), Tokyo (fourth), Osaka (fifth) and Seoul (sixth) in South Korea also making it, the top 10 was 50 percent Asian. But the steady devaluation of the renminbi, or yuan, resulted in China's urban centers moving down the ranking by between five and 16 places each, it said.

CIMAs ethical framework appealing
CIMAs ethical framework is appealing commented Priyadharshana Ekanayake (ACMA, CGMA), National Finance Director, Unilever Sri Lanka.
Priyadharshana has worked for Unilever in Sri Lanka, Singapore and India. During his 25 years at Unilever, his professional experience spans all finance functions - in regional, global and local roles.
Priyadharshanas CIMA journey began with his decision to enter the accountancy profession. With its unique blend of management accounting, financial accounting, people, business and leadership skills, CIMA became his first choice. He believes that CIMA gives a holistic understanding of a business and its operational environment: In real life, you do not work in a bubble but as part of an organisation.I believe that CIMA prepares you for the Boardroom as you gain views from different disciplines.
For Priyadharshana, the most appealing aspect of the CIMA Professional Qualification is its ethical framework: It will guide you to undertake the right and sustainable actions. His advice to young professionals undertaking leadership roles in the corporate world is to build a solid foundation which will help them propel their careers further.
In a rapidly changing world of uncertain economic and geo-political shifts, and disruption created by technology, Priyadharshana believes an educational or professional qualification must stay abreast with these developments in order to retain its lasting value.
He believes that CIMA through its regular updates to the syllabus fulfils this purpose.

Talking Bus Halt by SOS
With the aim of raising awareness about the referral service offered by SOS CVSL, Talking Bus Halt, a first-of-its-kind audio visual bus halt had been unveiled opposite D.S. Senanayake College, Colombo 7 by the Never Give up on a Child advocacy initiative of the SOS CVSL.
The SOS Coordination Centre, an arm of the public education component of the Never Give up on a Child (NGUP) advocacy initiative of the SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka (SOS CVSL,) acts as a referral mechanism linking vulnerable children who are at the risk of losing parental care with service providers.
The Centre set up in Piliyandala at the National Office of SOS CVSL in consultation with the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs, Department of Probation and Child Care and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) is presently operative in the Districts of Anuradhapura, Colombo, Galle, Jaffna, Matara, Moneragala and Nuwara Eliya where Family Strengthening Programmes and the related ancillary projects of SOS CVSL function.
However the service will be expanded to other districts eventually on the need and the availability of resources, states National Advisor-Advocacy, SOS CVSL, Chathuri Jayasooriya in a recent press release.
The main objective of the SOS Coordination Centre as Jayasooriya explains, is to prevent children being institutionalized. Several recent studies reveal that children are at the risk of being institutionalized due to the threat of being abandoned by parents, poverty and also disharmony at home including domestic violence, alcoholism and land disputes and the Coordination Centre facilitates in making referrals to relevant service providers who can support the child and the family concerned, thereby preventing institutionalization.
The Coordination Centre is manned by two trained coordinators who will respond to calls made by the public with regard to children who are at risk. The hotline 0114013933 is available during working days from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Upon receiving the necessary information, the Coordinators will assess the situation and will make referrals to the relevant service providers who can assist the child and family requiring help and they will also provide further information to educate other interested stakeholders. The information gathered will be entered into a database and will be shared with the relevant state authorities. We urge socially responsible citizens and other state authorities dedicated to child welfare to make optimum use of this facility, by alerting us on any instance of a child/children being at the risk of losing parental care, states the National Adviser-Advocacy.

According to Mathew
The Catholic Church wishes to inform the general public, especially our Catholic faithful, that the above mentioned film which will be shortly screened in Sri Lanka, does not refer in any way to a Catholic Priest.
The Catholic Church by its centuries old tradition, does not visualize a married clergy and this has been the tradition in the Church in Sri Lanka, states Rev. Fr. Edmund Thilekeratne, Director-Social Communications, Archdiocese of Colombo, in a release.

He further stated that the days leading up to April 2 race date would see some light showers, creating the expected conditions. The meteorological department forecasts slightly cloudy but bright weather on April 2, 16, and 29 race dates ensuring excellent racing conditions throughout the season.
Event Coordinator and Stipendiary Steward RTC, Nikhil Punna, stated that Competition this season is expected to be fiercer than the seasons gone by, due to the Selvaratnam Challenge Trophy Class 1 race to be held on April 2, in addition to the usual Royal Turf Club signature race RTC Magic Million that is to be held on April 16, both which offer a Rs 1 Million stake to the winner. An International Jockey Competition which is currently in the organizational stage, is targeted for April 29. Punna Stated that the demand for tickets for all 3 events, have been huge, but a certain number of tickets have been reserved for those who wish to purchase tickets at the gates on race days to ensure no one is disappointed.
The Selvaratnam Trophy is supported by a family of exemplary horsemen, hailing from Nuwara Eliya, Renga Selvaratnam and sons Gopi, Karthik and Druba Selvaratnam. Trained under the tutelage of legendary Sri Lanka Trainer Renga Selvaratnam, Druba has trained Sheikh Ahmed bin Rashid al Maktoums horses for the past 27 years and was the prime mover behind the creation of the Dubai Race course. He easily sailed past his 1,000-win Mark in 2006 and has never looked back since. The RTC is looking forward to his advice and support in the coming years.
Speaking to Punna, senior trainer Jayantha stated that he has a few good runners this season, including Champion Honorius who shook the race course by winning his first ever race in Sri Lanka.
Owned by Fearless Stables belonging to Eresha Weerasinghe, Honorius is targeted to win the Class 5 races with Crimson Quest owned by the Jayaratne couple and trained by veteran trainer Madialagan being the main Challenger. Champion Trainer Raju stated that he has a good string of horses especially for the Class 1 Races and stated that Alcazaba and the RTC Governors Cup 2016 winner Roswell owned by Deepthika Jayakody are in peak condition.
As always animal welfare is uppermost with the RTC, who have started a Pony Welfare Fund for around 115 Ponies registered with RTC. Dr Balaji Consultant Medical Officer for RTC stated that, RTC has set up a free medical scheme for these ponies owned by low income groups and the unemployed Youth of Nuwara Eliya. The scheme would ensure that the Ponies would be vaccinated periodically and their general health condition monitored from time to time. RTC has introduced a Raffle for this season to finance the scheme where on course spectators would be able to purchase Raffles Tickets for their favorite horses and a draw will be held among the tickets sold for each winning horse plus the horses that are placed second and third. Prizes are Rs 10,000 for the winning horse, Rs 5,000 for the second horse and Rs 2,500 for the third horse.
President RTC Panduka Keerthinanda stated that the RTC has further enforced its commitment to animal welfare by importing a state of the art Equine Ambulance from the United Kingdom at considerable cost. Dr Balaji stated that this is not only the only Equine Ambulance in Sri Lanka but that it has the most modern, up to date features such as two adjustable partitions with breast and breeching bars, front and side ramps for the horses to enter and exit comfortably, two privacy screens complete with vinyl bags for mounting externally, as well as an electric winch mounted internally with winching attachments.
RTC Treasurer Rupasinghe stated that the sponsors of RTC have made available a record number of gifts and vouchers for on course spectators exceeding Rs 1 Million, including cash gifts, gift vouchers, luxury hotel stays etc. The Pony Welfare Raffle, Lady with the Best Hat, Best Dressed Gent, and Best Dressed Couple are just some of the competitions that have been set for the Audience.
